<text>Evansville is a city in Rock County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,703 at the 2020 census. Evansville is a part of the Janesville-Beloit Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Madison-Janesville-Beloit CSA.

==History==
Evansville was first settled in the 1830s by New Englanders who were attracted to the area by its pristine wooded landscape and the placid Allen Creek. By 1855, the city recorded its first plat and was complete with homes, shops, and churches. Evansville is named for Dr. John M. Evans, a doctor and postmaster during the city&#x27;s early years.

In 1863, the Chicago and North Western Railway came to Evansville, accelerating growth. At this point, Evansville&#x27;s economy was based on industry and manufacturing of carriages, wagons, pumps, windmills and iron castings. The economy was also based on agriculture: dairying; farming (production of wheat and tobacco); and stock raising.

By the turn of the twentieth century Evansville had over 1900 residents, and by the 1920s, most of the buildings in Evansville&#x27;s future Historic District were completed.

The first newspaper, &quot;Badger&quot;, was established in 1894 by native sisters, Eleanor and Marilla Andrews and was run by all female employees. The first paper,
Vol. 1, no. 1 was published on Oct. 13, 1894 and the last, Vol. 12, no. 14 on Apr. 7, 1906.

In February 2024, Evansville made history as the first town in Wisconsin to experience a tornado in that month. The tornado was rated as an EF-2 and caused $7.4 million in damage to farms and other buildings in the eastern part of the city.

===1918 mob attacks===
On November 11, 1918, Armistice Day activities celebrating the end of World War I took an ugly turn as some Evansville citizens began rounding up townspeople who they had deemed insufficiently supportive of the war, mainly due to their refusal or inability to buy war bonds. A German minister and his wife were apprehended on their way out of town before being brought downtown and forced to kiss the American flag. Other &quot;slackers&quot; were made to wear sleighbells as they rode atop a car&#x27;s radiator, while others were forced to dance in a snake formation around a bonfire. A 73-year-old woman who passed on participating in the &quot;Your Share is Fair&quot; war bond campaign was dragged from her home by the mob, placed in a large animal cage and paraded about the streets before being parked before the fire. The woman, Mary J. Shaw, had previously bought bonds and supported the Red Cross and other war relief efforts. After refusing to salute or kiss the flag she was rescued by other citizens. Her attempts to see her assailants punished were brushed aside by the local sheriff, and testimony before the state legislature was similarly disregarded.

===Historic District===

The Evansville Historic District, which surrounds Main Street and stretches to the side streets of Garfield Avenue and Liberty Street, includes dozens of historic homes and other structures. The Wisconsin Historical Society called Evansville home to &quot;the finest collection of 1840s to 1915 architecture of any small town in Wisconsin.&quot;

The Eager Free Public Library building was built with the bequest of a leading citizen, Almeron Eager, in 1908. Designed by the architectural firm of Claude and Starck of Madison, Wisconsin in the Prairie style, it features stained glass windows and plaster friezes just below the overhanging roof line. A 1994 addition at the rear of the original building was designed to match the original architecture, while adding much needed space and handicapped accessibility. The intersection on which the library stands also contains a Greek Revival home (now a funeral parlor), a High Victorian Gothic brick home (now housing the local Masonic Temple) and a classic Victorian &quot;Painted Lady&quot; home, still a private residence.

The Evansville Seminary was located near College Drive in the district. Its building was designed by James R. West, but now functions as apartment homes.

In 1978, the historic district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Railways===
In the 1860s the C&amp;NW Railroad came to Evansville from Beloit. Later a line was built from Evansville to Janesville, making a more direct route between Madison, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. The segment between Evansville and Beloit was abandoned in the late 1970s.

C&amp;NW was acquired by Union Pacific in 1995, which abandoned much of the segment between Madison and Evansville.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Evansville is located south of Madison, Wisconsin, northwest of Janesville, Wisconsin, and northwest of Beloit, Wisconsin.

===Lake Leota===

This lake was formed by damming Allen Creek in the 1840s as a mill pond. Because of erosion into Allen Creek from upstream farm fields and the resulting silt deposits that accumulated, Lake Leota had become shallower over the years, reaching an average depth of only one and a half feet by 2000. One major issue that faced the city in the last 30 years was how to restore the lake to its original depth. The dam was opened in September 2005 to allow the lake to drain and its bottom to dry out. There was some controversy in Evansville over the cost of dredging, so a referendum was put to the city&#x27;s voters in November 2008. It passed by almost two to one, and dredging to a maximum of ten-foot depth was completed in February 2009. The dam was closed shortly thereafter, and Lake Leota was refilled slowly. A ceremony to mark the renaissance of the lake was held on July 4, 2009. Citizens can now enjoy the natural beauty of the lake, boating in non-powered craft, and fishing. Since refilling, the lake has been stocked with panfish and bass, and &quot;fish-cribs&quot; sunk below the lake surface to provide breeding areas and cover for small fry.

==Community==

Evansville has four gas stations, several banks, a full-sized grocery store, and several specialty shops and restaurants. Over the last two decades, many of the downtown buildings have been renovated in the style in which they were originally built. In addition, in 2008, three blocks of Main Street that had been covered with asphalt in the 1960s were re-paved with 1900-era paving bricks, adding to the &quot;old time&quot; feel of Main Street. The re-paving took place when major utility improvements were made to the city&#x27;s downtown infrastructure.

Evansville shares a fire department with several surrounding rural towns. A new fire station was built in 2008 on Water Street. The police department then moved into the remodeled former fire department building on Church Street. The Evansville EMS is housed separate from the fire department and is located on Church Street as well.

The community has a large central park, Leonard-Leota Park, named in part after early settler Levi Leonard. The park contains Lake Leota, which has fishing, boating, and swimming. A local landmark the Park has is a cold-war era M60 Patton on the eastern side of the park visible from Madison St. Park amenities include a baseball diamond with night lighting, a softball diamond, two tennis courts, a basketball court, a splash pad, picnic shelters, and playgrounds. A skateboard facility was installed in 2006. In addition, there are several smaller community parks, among them Countryside, Franklin, and Brzezinski. In 2008, a new large park was opened on Evansville&#x27;s west side to accommodate the new subdivisions being built there, the park was originally called West Side Park, and only had a children’s playground, two buildings one a picnic shelter the other a public bathroom. In 2020, a project had launched to renovate the park, In summer of 2024 it was renamed to Larson Acres Park this park contains the Evansville Aquatic Center and its new swimming pool, two baseball diamonds, two soccer fields that have been completed and are open to the public. Still under construction is a tennis court and basketball courts on the North side of the park, with a series of concrete paths connecting them all. The original buildings from when the park was first opened in 2008 still remain untouched, with the addition of some new paving.

==Education==

The city has four schools: Levi Leonard Elementary, Theodore Robinson Intermediate School, J.C. McKenna Middle School, and Evansville High School. In 2005, Evansville High School earned a Blue Ribbon award from the United States Department of Education.

Evansville has one home-town bank that has been in business in Evansville for over 100 years, with several other banks around the city.

Some tracks of the former Chicago &amp; North Western railway remain. The terminal had included multiple spur, classification, and industrial tracks, but after 1996, when the line was sold to Union Pacific railway, nearly all rail facilities in town were removed. The line, which at a point in time carried 70 mph-plus speeds, was left in a state of disrepair .

<text>Lawrence is a town in Rusk County in north-central Wisconsin, United States. The population was 240 at the 2000 census. The town is rural - all farmland or forest.

==Geography==
The town is 8 miles by 6 miles. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 47.7 square miles (123.6 km2), all land.

Branches of Main Creek, Little Jump River, and Alder Creek flow through the township, all generally heading to the west-southwest. The terrain is dominated by low parallel ridges running in that direction. These ridges could be drumlins left by a glacial advance, or they could mask the shape of the bedrock beneath the glacial till.

==History==
Like most of northern Wisconsin, the area that would become Lawrence was Ojibwe territory in the years before white contact.

Some of the earliest European Americans to walk the six mile squares that would become Lawrence were the U.S. government&#x27;s surveyors. In 1847 they surveyed the outsides of the six mile squares on foot with chain and compass. Then others came back in 1855 to survey all the section lines. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description for the western six miles of what would become Lawrence:
&quot;This Township contains several swamps; and all are unfit for cultivation. The Alder and Meadow Bottoms are all subject to be overflowed to a depth of 1 too 2 feet. the Meadow Bottoms are good for Hay. The surface is level. a small portion is upland where the soil is 2d rate. This Township is heavily Timbered and is chiefly composed of Hemlock Y Birch W Pine and maple on 3d rate soil. on 2d rate soil it is Sugar, Linden white Pine, Balsam and Elm. The undergrowth is Generally thick and is composed of Hemlock Balsam and Hazel Elm and Balsam line the Margin of the Alder and Meadow bottoms and also most of the Streams. There is no improvements in this Township.&quot;

An 1880 map of the area showed no development in Lawrence. The closest was a logging tote road from Chippewa Falls passing four miles to the west, following Main Creek. It crossed over to a couple logging camps(?) on the Flambeau and then followed that river northeast to Phillips.

The 1888 plat map of what would become Lawrence still showed no improvements and no settlers. Much of the land was still in large blocks, with the largest landholders H.W. Sage &amp; Co., Cornell University, Bond Bros, and Empire Lumber Co.

The 1901 plat map showed a wagon road following the course of modern County B down from Glen Flora into the northwest corner of Lawrence, with a handful of settlers along it. Another road of some sort was drawn in following the course of modern Highway 73 from north to south. Another north-south road, which disappeared on later maps, was drawn in two miles west of 73. A.E. Walrath owned large blocks in the west. Cornell University owned large blocks in the east and middle. Sage Land and Improvement Co. and Mississippi River Lumber Co. also owned significant shares.

Walrath, now a ghost town, was a little mill town in Lawrence, initially called Vallee. As mentioned above, Alvin E. Walrath owned much of what would become Lawrence township by 1901. At some point he started a mill that cut chair rounds from his surrounding forests. Walrath also built a boarding house and store for his workers. A box factory and lath mill were added later. By 1911, the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips had run its line up from Jump River to Walrath and built a depot. At first there was no turnaround, so the train backed in from Jump River, then unloaded supplies and loaded wood products, then steamed back out. In 1916 Walrath got a post office - in 1919 a school. Around 1920 Walrath began pushing to sell his cutover land to settlers through the National Land Colonization Company. Eventually the mills closed and the railroad pulled out. The Walrath school consolidated with Glen Flora around 1953. Now not much remains of the little mill town.

The 1914 plat maps showed more settlers in the northwest corner, near Glen Flora, and one in the northeast. It also showed a forerunner of Hunter Lane entering the town in the southeast from Jump River way, with a few settlers east of it. The other new thing was the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railroad angling up into the town from Jump River. Major land-owners were A.E. Walrath in the west, John S. Owen Lumber Company in the east and southwest, and the Northwestern Lumber Co. (parent of the SM&amp;P) along their rail line.

Plat maps from between 1915 and 1920 showed Lawrence&#x27;s modern road grid more or less complete, though they were no doubt rough wagon tracks. Highway 73 is marked with that name. The northern two miles is largely broken into 40 and 80 acre farms. South of that, much of the town is in large blocks owned by A.E. Walrath and John S. Owen Lumber Co. A &quot;Ladysmith News&quot; article from 1923 stated that some of the last timber in the county was &quot;...still standing in the southeastern townships. It is safe to predict that practically all of Rusk county will be clear of its merchantable timber within ten years...&quot;

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 240 people, 90 households, and 56 families residing in the town. The population density was 5.0 people per square mile (1.9/km2). There were 111 housing units at an average density of 2.3 per square mile (0.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.58% White and 0.42% Native American. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.67% of the population.

There were 90 households, out of which 35.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.4% were married couples living together, 6.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.7% were non-families. 30.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.44.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 30.0% under the age of 18, 11.7% from 18 to 24, 29.6% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $35,313, and the median family income was $35,972. Males had a median income of $23,750 versus $21,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,031. About 18.0% of families and 24.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.8% of those under the age of eighteen and none of those 65 or over.

<text>Marshall is a town in Rusk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 683 at the 2000 census. The village of Sheldon lies within the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.8 square miles (92.6 km2) - all land. Marshall&#x27;s soil is a patchwork of Almena, Auburndale and Spencer silt loams left by the last glacier, with peat soil accumulated in the low places. The Jump River cuts across the south end of the township.

==History==
In October 1852 a survey crew working for the U.S. government marked all the section corners in the six mile square which would become Marshall, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyors filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains some Tamarac Swamp, all of which is unfit for cultivation. Some Hay meadow from which Hay may be cut. The Surface is generally level. That(?) that may be considered upland, and Compare favourably with 2nd(?) rate land in(?) any(?) Country. Covered with white and yellow Birch, Sugar, Maple, Elm, Ash And some Pine, some places Hemlock mostly.&quot;

An 1880 map of the area shows logging well under way. In 1878 the Mississippi River Logging Company had built a large dam twelve miles downstream on the Chippewa at what is now Holcombe. A tote road from Cornell (then called Brunett) passed up through the west end what would become Marshall, following the east side of Main Creek. Another tote road from Cornell stopped at the south edge of what would become Marshall at the Jump River near the future County G bridge.
A later map, from 1901, shows the area when Rusk County was called Gates and Marshall was still part of a large town of Dewey. The map shows one wagon road in the town, entering from Chippewa County on the south edge, crossing the river, and passing Fern Post Office. Then the road followed the future Cemetery Road and County V to the north end of Marshall. About a dozen settlers&#x27; homesteads were sprinkled along this road. Away from the road and the Little Jump, most of the land was still in large blocks, with the largest landholders Cornell University, Fitch Gilbert and Keith Brothers on the west, Northwestern Lumber Company on the east, and James L. Gates, who speculated in pinelands and sold the cutover lands to farmers.

A later plat map (date uncertain, but no later than 1905) shows more wagon roads and more settlers. One road ran west from Fern, roughly paralleling the river to the west edge of modern Marshall. Another predecessor of Marshall Road reached two miles east of Cemetery Road. Another short road reached east a quarter mile from the modern County V to a sawmill on the Little Jump River. More settlers were scattered along these roads, plus a few out near the corner of Market and Poplar, where no road was yet marked on the map. By this time Cornell University and Fitch Gilbert had sold their large blocks, mostly to John S. Owen and J.L. Gates Land Co.

The previous maps show no development where Sheldon would be. Around 1905 the J.S. Owen Company built a new rail line for the Wisconsin Central Railroad, heading northwest from Wisconsin Rapids for Ladysmith and ultimately Superior - now the Canadian National Railway. This rail line cut across Marshall diagonally, crossing the Jump River a mile east of Fern. The Wisconsin Central built a depot and section house on the north bank of the river and called the station &quot;Sheldon.&quot; Within a few years the post office, saloon and general store had moved from Fern to Sheldon, near the station.

A 1914 plat map of Marshall shows the Soo Line Railroad crossing the town, with Sheldon on the north side of the river. Wagon roads had extended further, with more settlers. One rural school was out by Fern across from Meadowbrook Cemetery. Another was three miles north of Sheldon on what is now County V. Another was five miles northwest on Elm Road and another where County G now crosses the river. By this time west of the railroad was largely settled. Much of the east was in large blocks owned by the Owen Lumber Company. Other large landholders were the Faast Land Company and Northern Wisconsin Seed.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 683 people, 210 households, and 170 families residing in the town. The population density was 19.1 people per square mile (7.4/km2). There were 228 housing units at an average density of 6.4 per square mile (2.5/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 95.90% White, 0.15% African American, 2.34% Native American, 0.59% from other races, and 1.02% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.02% of the population.

There were 210 households, out of which 43.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.1% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.6% were non-families. 15.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.25 and the average family size was 3.63.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 38.9% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 15.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $33,281, and the median income for a family was $36,319. Males had a median income of $25,729 versus $21,094 for females. The per capita income for the town was $11,411. About 13.8% of families and 16.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.3% of those under age 18 and 14.4% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Sheldon is a village in Rusk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 237 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Around 1885 a few pioneer families named Marshal, Sergeant and Carman settled in the brush a mile west of Sheldon&#x27;s current location, in a hamlet they called &quot;Fern.&quot; Anton Corbine carried mail in to them from Flambeau by foot or by horse. Other settlers followed. Woodlawn Cemetery was started in 1903 with the burial of Mrs. Alice Elmendorf (aged 65 years). A little log school stood just south of it, and a Rev. Willam would sometimes follow the trails up from Huron to lead worship in the school. In 1905 Max Dietze from Hawkins built a general store east of the cemetery, supplied by driving a wagon with horses across the Jump and along logging roads to Holcombe or Chippewa. In 1906 D. L. Pickering built a sawmill on the bank of Little Jump River.

Sheldon itself began to take form in 1906 when the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line a mile east of Fern, over the Jump and through the woods on its way to Superior. (That rail line still exists as the modern Canadian National line.) Just north of the river, the Wisconsin Central built a depot, a section house, and a water tank for its trains, and named the station &quot;Sheldon,&quot; after one of its officials. That same year Ed Lacy built a general store across from the depot, later known as Brown&#x27;s store, then Mau&#x27;s. In 1907 Bill Huggins moved his saloon from Fern into Sheldon. Max Dietz also moved his general store from near the cemetery in to town. Eventually all businesses and schools moved, until now all that remains out by Fern is farms, homes, and the cemetery.

In 1908 Sheldon was platted, and that year a land office opened. By 1910 a new 8-grade school was built in town. The town had a barber shop and two saloons - one with a dance hall upstairs. It had two hotels: the Hotel Walter and the Sheldon House. They mainly housed lumber workers. Logging was the big business then, with the John S. Owen Company logging north of town. In town, several mills sawed boards, including the Jump River Lumber Company&#x27;s mill, which employed more than forty men until it burned in 1912. These mills produced boards mostly for local use, but Pickering&#x27;s lath mill shipped out its product on the railroad. A train stopped once a day, heading north one day and south the next, and carrying passengers of course, since the roads were terrible. Herb Duel, Sr. installed the first telephones in 1910, with a switchboard in the Hotel Walter. Lacy brought the first car, a 1909 Ford, to town in 1910. In 1917 the village of Sheldon was incorporated, with population 123.

By 1923 Sheldon&#x27;s industry included the lath mill, a creamery supplied by local farmers, and a factory that made hoops for butter tubs from local ash wood. The town had a bank, a predecessor of the Dairyland State Bank. And sidewalks were built along Main Street. Electricity came to town in 1930. In 1938 the WPA helped build sidewalks alongside streets.

The town had its setbacks. Logging gradually waned, but dairy grew. Prohibition in 1915 shut down the saloons for a while. In 1920 a pool hall and other buildings burned. In 1923 the school burned, but classes shifted to Tupper&#x27;s Hotel, the bank, the Lutheran church, and a lumber company warehouse, and a new school was ready in 1925. The Sheldon Woman&#x27;s Club established a library in 1933, which burned in the early 1940s, but was reestablished. In the Labor Day flood of 1941 the Jump River wrecked the road bridge on the south side of town, damaged the railroad bridge, and destroyed buildings. The bridges were rebuilt, but not all buildings. Pickering&#x27;s lath mill burned in 1947, but was reconstructed for sawing and planing.

By 1959 the Soo Line was stopping twice a day, providing passenger, freight and mail service, and Sheldon&#x27;s population was 300. The town had two or three grocery stores, a few garages, the creamery, two feed mills, some implement dealers, and a lumber yard, but no sawmill. Sheldon had made the transition from lumber-processing to providing services for the surrounding dairy farms.

<doc id="139688" wikidata="Q208417" url="?curid=139688" title="Immortal (band)">
<text>Immortal is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen. The group was founded in 1991 by frontman and guitarist Abbath Doom Occulta (Olve Eikemo) and guitarist Demonaz Doom Occulta (Harald Nævdal). The pair worked with various drummers (including Grim, Armagedda and Hellhammer), and were later joined by former drummer Horgh (Reidar Horghagen) in 1996.

In March 2015, long-serving member Abbath announced his departure from the group following a dispute with the other members of the band, and he went on to form a new band under his name called Abbath. It was initially reported that following Abbath&#x27;s departure, the band would split up. However, In August 2015, Demonaz and Horgh said that the band would continue without Abbath. Demonaz would return to playing guitar with the band for the first time since 1997, and would do vocals as well. &quot;Northern Chaos Gods&quot; was officially released on 6 July 2018 under Nuclear Blast Records. Although the band has been a trio for most of its history, several albums have been recorded as a duo, with varying combinations of Abbath, Demonaz, and Horgh.

==History==
===First three albums (1991–1996)===
Immortal arose from two short-lived bands, Old Funeral and Amputation, in the late 1980s. Old Funeral was founded by Abbath and Tore (Tore Bratseth), then went through a string of guitarists (including Demonaz, Varg Vikernes and Jørn Inge Tunsberg) until disbanding in 1992. Demonaz and Jørn formed Amputation, which released two demos with Demonaz on guitar and vocals, Jørn on guitars, and Padden on drums, before disbanding in 1990.

Members of Old Funeral and Amputation formed Immortal in 1991, with Abbath on bass and lead vocals, Demonaz on guitar, Jørn on guitar and Armagedda on drums. The music on their early demo recordings was death metal, with lyrics influenced by Morbid Angel and Possessed. The band then became influenced by Mayhem guitarist Euronymous and bands like Bathory and Celtic Frost. They released their self-titled EP in 1991, which saw a stylistic change to black metal. This was followed by their debut album &quot;Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism&quot; in 1992, which maintained the raw black metal sound developed the previous year.

Their second full-length album &quot;Pure Holocaust&quot; was released in 1993 and featured a relatively more polished production than their debut, with ambitious songs played at breakneck speeds, and grandiose lyrics based on evil and darkness. It continues to be held in high regard within the black metal genre. &quot;Battles in the North&quot;, released in 1995, picks up where its predecessor left off, featuring more extreme tempos and lyrics about coldness and winter landscapes.

In 1995, the band released two video clips directed by British artist David Palser, entitled &quot;Masters of Nebulah Frost&quot;, through Osmose Productions. They featured many bizarrely-shot images of frozen landscapes and vast forests with the band performing two songs from the album &quot;Battles in the North&quot;, &quot;Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Blashyrkh (Mighty Ravendark)&quot;, on a Norwegian mountainside. The video for &quot;Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms&quot; features Mayhem drummer, Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg). These clips have become the template for many other bands producing such works, similarly to how &quot;The Call of the Wintermoon&quot; is also highly influential.

===&quot;Blizzard Beasts&quot; and &quot;At the Heart of Winter&quot; (1996–1999)===

&quot;Blizzard Beasts&quot; released in 1997 introduced technical thrash elements with shorter more focused songs, though it contained the epic &quot;Mountains of Might&quot; and continued the lyrical themes of cold and winter.

Apart from the two core members, Abbath and Demonaz, Immortal did not find a stable lineup until 1996 when drummer Horgh joined the band and is credited on the album &quot;Blizzard Beasts&quot;. A major turning point for the band was in 1997 when Demonaz suffered acute tendinitis in his arm and was unable to continue playing, and Abbath took over for guitar. Despite this, Demonaz continued writing lyrics and has been a manager for the band, accompanying them on tour, releasing updates and giving interviews about how things are progressing with the band.

Abbath and Horgh wrote and recorded the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;At the Heart of Winter&quot;. Immortal&#x27;s early full-length releases were in traditional black metal style, but their most acclaimed album, &quot;At the Heart of Winter&quot;, marks the period when the band began to experiment with a complex fusion of black metal and German thrash metal, resulting in the sound of Immortal&#x27;s later works. During the tours for this album, the band recruited Iscariah to stand in for bass duties, and made him a full-time member.

Erik &quot;Grim&quot; Brødreskift committed suicide in 1999. Grim appeared on the on cover of &quot;Pure Holocaust&quot; and is credited as the drummer (though he did not play on the album), and toured with Immortal as their drummer. The band frequently headlined the Hole in the Sky festival held in his memory.

===&quot;Damned in Black&quot; and &quot;Sons of Northern Darkness&quot; (2000–2003)===
The next album, &quot;Damned in Black&quot; was more similar to their old style. It was well received, but is frequently overlooked as it came between two of their classic albums, &quot;At the Heart of Winter&quot; and &quot;Sons of Northern Darkness&quot;. In 2000, the EP &quot;Immortal&quot; was repackaged as part of the &quot;True Kings of Norway&quot; compilation by Spinefarm Records. Also in 2000, Immortal signed a record contract with German label Nuclear Blast; this change to a more prominent record company didn&#x27;t affect their style, a fact proven by their record &quot;Sons of Northern Darkness&quot;. Two months after this, Iscariah announced his intention to leave the band and was replaced by Saroth for the next few months.

=== Split (2003–2007) ===
Immortal decided to split during the summer of 2003 for various personal reasons of the band members. Following the split, Abbath began working on new material during that same year. He enlisted Enslaved guitarist Ice Dale (Arve Isdal), Gorgoroth bassist King ov Hell and original Immortal drummer Armagedda for a new band named I, while Demonaz featured as the band&#x27;s lyricist. The band released their debut album, &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot;, released in November 2006.

In early June 2006, German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; reported that Abbath, Demonaz and Horgh had decided to resurrect Immortal and start touring again in 2007. Abbath is quoted as saying:

=== Reunion and &quot;All Shall Fall&quot; (2007–2014) ===
In 2007, Immortal reunited for a string of summer shows. They headlined the Inferno Festival in April, the Tuska Open Air festival in June/July, Metal Camp festival in July, and the Wacken Open Air festival in August. They also performed twice in the United States in July 2007. Filling in as bassist for these dates was Aura Noir bassist Apollyon. Immortal first toured Australia and New Zealand in March 2008.

After the reunion, Abbath and Horgh decided to reform the band on a permanent basis. This was confirmed by Demonaz in an interview with Eternal Terror. Apollyon was the permanent replacement for Iscariah, and the three began working with Demonaz on material for their next album &quot;All Shall Fall&quot;. &quot;All Shall Fall&quot; was recorded in April–May 2009, and was released on 25 September 2009.

According to &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s interview, work had begun on Immortal&#x27;s ninth album stating in the article &quot;four new songs already in the works for a follow-up to &quot;All Shall Fall&quot;&quot;.

Abbath and Demonaz were interviewed in the 2009 American documentary by Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, &quot;Until the Light Takes Us&quot;.

=== Legal battle, Abbath&#x27;s exit, and &quot;Northern Chaos Gods&quot; (2014–2020) ===
The members of Immortal were involved in a legal battle with each other over the rights to the Immortal trademark. They were also due to submit a new album to the Nuclear Blast label, though little information regarding the album and its release had been disclosed. It is confirmed, however, by Abbath that the album had been completed with the aid of various musicians.

In March 2015, Abbath left Immortal as a result of this conflict and an inability to move forward. Abbath has continued to record and perform as a solo act under his name.

On 8 January 2018, the band posted via Facebook an update on Immortal&#x27;s upcoming ninth full-length, stating &quot;We have put a massive amount of energy into this, and wanted to deliver our absolutely best.
It has been a pleasure to finish the studio process and most of all being stoked about the final result. Peter Tägtgren has done an outstanding job in producing and mixing it. We now look forward to have it released, and are excited to share our 9th full length with you all.&quot; The album was released under Nuclear Blast Records as &quot;Northern Chaos Gods&quot; on 6 July 2018. The album features original member Demonaz on vocals and guitar. Tägtgren played bass on the album, with the exact timing of Apollyon&#x27;s departure being unclear.

=== Legal battle, Horgh&#x27;s exit, and &quot;War Against All&quot; (2020–present) ===
In August 2020, it was announced that Demonaz and Horgh were involved with a legal dispute over the rights to the band&#x27;s name. Demonaz had registered the name with the Norwegian Patent Office as his exclusive trademark in July 2019, which was approved; however, Horgh chose to appeal the registration, and the matter was ruled in his favor, meaning that Demonaz no longer has the exclusive right to the Immortal name. Horgh was unaware of the initial sole registration made by Demonaz.

On 24 October 2022, the band announced that their tenth studio album, &quot;War Against All&quot;, would be released in 2023. It was also revealed that Demonaz was listed as the only member of the band, indicating that he won the dispute of the rights to the band&#x27;s name against Horgh. In March 2023, the band released the title track to the album, which was revealed to be coming out on 26 May.

==Lyrical style==
Immortal&#x27;s lyrics are based on an overall theme, a realm called &quot;Blashyrkh&quot; which is said to be &quot;demon-and-battle-filled&quot; and a &quot;fusion of gothic, Nordic, and heroic themes.&quot; The idea for Blashyrkh came about from Demonaz and Abbath&#x27;s feelings of isolation living in Bergen. They created Blashyrkh to mirror those feelings, basing it on Norway, including &quot;winter landscapes&quot;, &quot;the woods, the mountains, the darkness, the fog&quot;, and &quot;glacial valleys&quot;. When writing lyrics, the band&#x27;s lyricist Demonaz often takes long walks in the Norwegian countryside near his hometown of Bergen for inspiration. Unlike many early black metal bands, Immortal does not have satanic-themed lyrics, opting instead for basing the genre&#x27;s inherent concepts of darkness and evil in the fantasy setting of Blashyrkh. However, on the band&#x27;s first album, there were a few satanic references but without any lyrics attacking religion.

<text>Franklin is a town in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 696 at the 2000 census.

The town of Franklin was established in November 1854 from part of the town of Honey Creek. In September 1858, the town of Bear Creek was formed from the western part of the town of Franklin. Towns to the north are Westfield and Washington, on the south is Spring Green, on the east are Honey Creek and Troy, and on the west is Bear Creek. In 1899, a town hall building was built by Rob and Albert Nachreiner and was located at 915 Wachter Avenue in Plain, Wisconsin. The building replaced a wagon maker shop owned by Moses Tunstall. The upper floor of the new town hall building was used for town activities while the basement housed a small jail room and fire station for the Village of Plain use. On the top of the town hall was an alarm bell which was later moved to the front of the new fire station about 1980. After the original town hall building was no longer being used, the Old Franklin Township Historical Society (OFTHS) was organized in 2004, and shortly thereafter, used the building to store Plain and Franklin area memorabilia, genealogy, and artifacts in their museum.

<text>Lime Ridge is a village in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 162 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Lime Ridge is located at (43.468074, -90.153701).

==History==
The earliest settlers of Lime Ridge, as they arrived in the late 1850s, cleared the land of timber to plant crops, though others used the hardwood to make and sell railroad ties and stave bolts. The first post office was established in 1858. In 1867, Wesley Marsh opened a store, which was sold a few years later to John T. Pollock, and again in 1876 to Robert L. Bohn, an Ohio family that also built a dam and sawmill. Bohn bought hardwood timber from area farmers and converted it to barrel staves shipped to urban markets. Bohn also opened a hotel and in 1909 founded the State Bank of Lime Ridge. In 1874, the United Brethren opened a house of worship, used too by Baptists and Methodists in the community. In 1890, an Adventist church served members of that faith. After the population of German immigrants rose, in 1906 Trinity Lutheran church was built to serve that community. In 1912, St. Boniface Church was formed to serve the Catholic community.

Lime Ridge was incorporated in 1913. Rural electrification reached the village in 1922; the population at that time had risen to about 200. The Great Depression together with World War II proved crippling to the local economy; the bank and hotel closed, and several other businesses followed. Many residents today work in other places.

<text>Plain is a village in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 773 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Plain is located at (43.277580, -90.044563).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.
==History==

The village of Plain is located on Wisconsin Highway 23 and County Road B in the Township of Franklin. The area of Plain was originally known as Cramer&#x27;s Corners after four Cramer brothers (John, Jeremiah, Adam and Solomon, Sr.) moved to the Plain area in the early 1850s. They came from Troy Township in Richland County, Ohio and Morrow County, Ohio. Joseph Cramer was originally from Letterkenny Township, Pennsylvania.

The Cramers are listed as land owners in the 1859 Town of Franklin map. This Cramer family should not be confused with the Kraemer [Krämer] family from Irlach, Bavaria, Germany, who settled in Plain, Wisconsin, in 1867. Several rough buildings were erected and the area acquired the nickname of Logtown (also spelled Log Town).

A post office was proposed to be established at Plain on March 31, 1858, with B. V. Bunnel as postmaster. The proposed mail route was Prairie du Sac, Sauk City, Harrisburg, Plain, Maqua to Sextonville in Richland County. Plain formally became a village in 1912.

The origin of the village&#x27;s name is widely rumored to have been selected as an homage to the Shrine of the Virgin Mary at Maria Plain on the hill known as Plainberg in the village of Bergheim, Austria outside Salzburg, Austria. There are, however, no known documents, newspaper articles or books of the time to support this claim, and writings of the time indicate a less colorful origin. Plain was &quot;called Plain because the inhabitants were plain people&quot;.

In September 1915, a subscriber of the local newspaper wrote of his desire to have Plain re-christened as the town had expanded and improved so much over the past three years that it had outgrown the &quot;plain&quot;-ness of its name. The unnamed author wrote: &quot;Within a few weeks very strong efforts will be made at proper headquarters to have the name of Plain changed, as that name does not agree with the rushing strides our burg is making. First of all there is no meaning to the word Plain, as it is an adjective; we must have at least a noun and why not put a &#x27;ville&#x27; or &#x27;city&#x27; to it.&quot;

Old Franklin Township Historical Society (OFTHS) in Plain, Wisconsin, was organized in 2004 in the former Town Hall of Franklin, Sauk County, Wisconsin located on Highway 23 at 915 Wachter Avenue. Museum exhibits are open to the public during open house events and by special request.

<text>Sauk City is a village in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States, located along the Wisconsin River. The population was 3,518 as of the 2020 census. The first incorporated village in the state, the community was founded by Agoston Haraszthy and his business partner, Robert Bryant in the 1840s. 

==History==

Impressed by the beautiful scenery, Agoston Haraszthy, a charismatic Hungarian sometimes called &quot;Count&quot; Haraszthy, purchased a small plot of land along the Wisconsin River in 1840. Later, with his English-born business partner, Robert Bryant, Haraszthy bought additional land and founded the town of Haraszthy (originally called Széptáj, Hungarian for &quot;beautiful place&quot;).

In 1849, the name of the town was changed to Westfield. Three years later, in 1852, it was changed again, this time to the current name of Sauk City. The community was incorporated as a village in 1854, making Sauk City the oldest incorporated village in the state.

In 1852, German immigrants founded the Sauk City Free Congregation (&quot;Freie Gemeinde&quot;). This group, a liberal religious society, celebrated German music, literature, and culture. It met in a private home until 1884, when Park Hall was built as a meeting house. The building is now home to the Sauk County Free Congregation, a Unitarian Universalist fellowship.

In the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine of November 21, 1914, Sauk City was named &quot;America&#x27;s Foremost City&quot;. The article cited a pageant, attended by 4000 people, which enacted scenes from the village&#x27;s history, and concluded with the naming of the school principal as the Civic Secretary, charged with making the school the center of the life of the town. To that end, the ballot box was transferred from the town hall to the school house.

In 2017, the Great Sauk State Trail opened on the former railroad line running through the city.

Sauk City is adjacent to Prairie du Sac, located directly to the north. Both communities are located on the west bank of the Wisconsin River. They share a municipal boundary, as well as a school system, police department, and hospital, but have separate fire departments and libraries. The Sauk City Fire Department is the oldest organized volunteer department in the state of Wisconsin, having been founded in 1854. Efforts have been made to join the two villages into a single entity, Sauk Prairie, but these have failed because of tax differences between the communities.

==Education==
Sauk Prairie High School, located in Prairie du Sac, serves the villages of Sauk City and Prairie du Sac. The school&#x27;s mascot is the eagle, so named because of the population of eagles found on the Wisconsin River adjacent to Sauk Prairie.

== History ==
Ojibwa, like all of the Sawyer County settlements, had its heyday during the era 1902 to 1920. The community is located on the banks of the Chippewa River at a site that is now the junction of Highways 27 and 70. The town was named ‘Ojibwa’ by Mr. Ben F. Faast, an early real estate promoter, because of the nearness of the Chippewa River and the Lac Courte Oreilles reservation (Chippewa is a corruption of the name “Ojibwa”).

This little hamlet was strategically located between the timber tracts of four large lumber companies — the Couderay Lumber Company to the north, the Hines Lumber Company to the east, the Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company to the south, and the Arpin Lumber Company to the west.

The Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company transported its logs to the Chippewa River by the way of the Brunet and Chippewa rivers. The Arpin Lumber Company maintained a large logging camp at the present location of McDonald Park and floated its logs down the Chippewa River. The Hines Lumber Company loaded its logs on railroad cars and shipped them to Park Falls. A spur line extended north to the holdings of the Couderay Lumber Company camps. Remains of the old Crooked Rapids Spur can still be seen from Highway 70 just west of the Albert Skogen farm. The northern end of the old right-of-way is used today by the Wisconsin Conservation Department as a fire lane. The Couderay Lumber Company shipped its logs by rail to sawmills at Couderay and Rice Lake. The logging industry was short-lived in the Ojibwa area, the major operation being shifted to Radisson and Winter.

Mr. Ben Faast of Eau Claire organized the Wisconsin Colonization Company and purchased large tracts of cut-over land south of Ojibwa. The office was located in Radisson and was moved to Ojibwa in 1918. (?) Mr. Faast had visions of a prosperous city that would be supported by farmers who would be anxious to develop modern farms where the loggers had left slashings in their hasty operations to make quick profits. The land was advertised as unusually fertile and very cheap. The method of sale is described in the chapter about Radisson.

So firmly did Mr. Faast believe in his scheme that he personally planned the organization and layout of the community. Frans Aust, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, drew the plans for the village. The plan was complete and ideal and provided for a zoo, a park, a boulevard, street and sidewalk planning, a residential zone, and a manufacturing zone. The result was only moderate success since the buyers of the farmlands found that profits in farming were small and that too much time, capital, and hard work were necessary to attain the success to which they had aspired.

A variety of nationalities settled in the vicinity of Ojibwa; such as the Scandinavians, Polish, English, French, German and Irish. The largest ethnic group which settled in the area was the Polish. They were industrious, ambitious, thrifty, and honest people, who tilled the soil in the summer and worked in the logging camps in the winter. The wives and children remained on the farms in the wintertime and tended the cattle, while the husband and father was away at work to supplement the farm income. Slowly and reluctantly, one by one, the families deserted the farms and returned to the cities to resume work in factories.

Of the original group of Polish families who came to the town of Ojibwa, there are only four remaining; the Jarosz family, the Granica family, the Pydo family and the Karpowicz family.

The first church in Ojibwa was the Lutheran Church. An old schoolhouse, the Crawford School, was moved from a site near the airport to the village in the winter of 1922. This building was moved down the river on the ice, the last time the Chippewa River has been completely frozen over so that it could be used as a thoroughfare for teams and vehicles.

The congregation dissolved about 1925 and the building was moved to the settlement known as “Thornapple”, where it was used as a community hall.

The area around Ojibwa was organized as a civil township in 1918 and was made up of lands detached from the Radisson Township. The first annual election held in the newly created township of Ojibwa was held on July 2, 1919, at the Al Raynor farm. There were a total of nine ballots cast. As there were only eight offices to fill, there was only one elector who was not honored by election to an office. Mr. Henry LeBeau, who was the town clerk of Radisson, was present and gave the oath of office to the newly elected officials.

The total assessed valuation of the new township was $286,048. In 1957, the total assessed valuation is $263,746.

Since the settlement of Ojibwa four school districts were established. The first school was the Menwaring School at Chappel Creek; the second was the Sam Sigwin School; the third was the Bishop School at Bishop Bridge, and the fourth was the state Graded School in the village. The district reorganized in 1952 and is now integrated with the Winter, Draper and Ojibwa School District. The school is no longer operating and the pupils are transported by bus to Winter.

A park, known as the Ojibwa Roadside State Park, is located in the township on the south side of the Chippewa River on Highway 70. It consists of three hundred fifty acres of heavily wooded land which is a beauty spot and attracts many tourists. There are many outdoor accommodations, such as, picnic tables, fireplaces, baseball diamond, shelter house, well, campsites, and hiking trails. In the wintertime, it is used as a feeding station for deer. The entire area is a wildlife refuge and many species of birds and animals inhabit the park. During the summer between five thousand and six thousand people visit the park to enjoy nature. From May to September an average of three thousand tourists camp on the grounds.

Although there is no incentive to encourage an influx of permanent resident to Ojibwa, it will continue to live as a memento of the prosperous logging days and serve many city people who own summer cabins on the banks of the picturesque Chippewa River.

<text>Bonduel is a village in Shawano County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,417 at the 2020 census, and 1,478 at the 2010 census.

==History==
As founded, the community did not have an officially agreed upon name. Some early news reports called it Hartland Corners, presumably in reference to the surrounding town, named Hartland. The name Bonduel was not established for the community until an application for a post office was made in 1864, at which point &quot;Hartland&quot; was rejected as already being in use as a village name in Wisconsin. Therefore, the village was named Bonduel when the post office was created. The village is named after a Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Florimond Bonduel, who served Wisconsin parishes and who worked with the Menominee Indians, helping them settle on their newly created reservation in 1853.

Bonduel incorporated as a village in 1916. Prior to this time, administrative affairs for the community were managed by the surrounding town of Hartland.

In 1964 attempts by the National Farmers Organization to get farmers to withhold their produce, milk and livestock from the market in order to boost prices resulted in the deaths of two NFO members who were run over by a cattle truck in Bonduel.

The Cedar Grove-Belgium School District made national headlines in April 2024 when the desired characteristics listed by the Board of Education in its official search for a new Superintendent of Schools cited &quot;Christian Values&quot; and &quot;conservative politics&quot; as those sought in a successful candidate. Questions were raised in many quarters about the legality of a &quot;religious test&quot; for the position in light of the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as the propriety of insisting on specific political views. Subsequent to publication of the District&#x27;s Search Document, a public meeting concerning the Search was abruptly cancelled. 

==Arts and culture==
Every year the town remembers its Dutch heritage with a two-day celebration, the Holland Fest, held in Memorial Park the last Friday and Saturday in July. The festival features ethnic foods, music, and 2-mile and 10K runs. Before the Saturday afternoon parade the main street is scrubbed by children and adults dressed in traditional Dutch costumes to prepare the road for the Klompen Dancers and parade to follow. Another nod to the village&#x27;s Dutch roots is a full-sized replica windmill in Windmill Park downtown. In addition to Klompen Dancing, the festival also holds an annual wooden shoe race where children race one another while wearing traditional Dutch wooden shoes. The festival also is known for its Oliebollen, which is a type of Dutch doughnut. Holland Fest is one of the largest &quot;dry festivals&quot; in Wisconsin.

===Racing===
Racing at Elkhart Lake dates back to the 1950s. The very first races were held on July 23, 1950, on a 3.35 mile road circuit north of the lake. These first races were very successful for the time, drawing a crowd of over 5,000. Races were originally held on a street circuit that ran around the Lake with the start/finish line in the village. In 1951 and 1952, races were held on a new 6.5 mile circuit that circumvented the Lake. The 1951 races drew an estimated crowd of 50,000 spectators and the 1952 races saw an estimated crowd of over 100,000 people. The 1952 races would be the last races held on the open road circuit. Three years later, a new, specially designed track was built south of the village. Road America was built in 1955 with the first racing being held on September 10 &amp; 11, 1955. Each year, Road America holds over 425 events, one of the most popular being the Kohler International Challenge in July. The economic impact from the track, its events, and visitors is estimated at $70 million annually.

===Annual cultural events===

Every July, during the Kohler International Challenge, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; holds a race car Concours d&#x27;Elegance in the village. This draws a large crowd as people line the streets from Road America to the shore of Elkhart Lake watching the cars drive past on their way to downtown Elkhart Lake. The cars park in the streets of Elkhart Lake, mainly on Lake Street, where curious visitors, car enthusiasts, and other racers alike walk up and down the streets looking at the cars. As the concourse comes to a close, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; announces the winner of various awards including the best-looking car award. The cars return to the track around 7:30 pm, just before the sun sets because many of the cars do not have headlights.

Jazz on the Vine is an annual festival held in May. Jazz musicians from all over the United States come to the festival to perform.

On June 20, 1890, the line was acquired by the Milwaukee Road (Chicago, Milwaukee, St Paul and Pacific Railroad) operating as the Green Bay Sub. The section between Milwaukee and Plymouth, Wi is currently operated by the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad and is used as a secondary freight only line serving local industry, as the Plymouth Sub.

The village was plated in 1873 by N.C. Harmon on 80 acres of land that he and his son-in-law Eugene McIntyre had purchased from Abraham Lawson. When it was discovered that there already was an existing Lyndon Station in Juneau County, it was decided to rename the village after Otis Harvey Waldo, a prominent Milwaukee attorney and then president of the railroad.

In 1877 the Post Office (Est. 1849) for the Onion River settlement (Est. 1844), one mile (1.6 km) east was closed. In 1923 Waldo became an incorporated village and Onion River ceased to exist. The open area between has since been built up.

<text>In English poetry, accent refers to the stressed syllable of a polysyllabic word, or a monosyllabic word that receives stress because it belongs to an &quot;open class&quot; of words (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) or because of &quot;contrastive&quot; or &quot;rhetorical&quot; stress. In basic analysis of a poem by scansion, accents can be represented by a short vertical line (&#x27;) preceding the syllable, while the divisions between feet are shown by a slash (/). 

There is generally one accent in each foot, for example:
:Be-&#x27;hold / her, &#x27;sin-/gle &#x27;in / the &#x27;field
:Yon &#x27;sol-/i-&#x27;tar-/y &#x27;high-/land &#x27;lass!
:&#x27;Reap-ing / and &#x27;sing-/ing &#x27;by / her-&#x27;self;

<text>New Richmond is a city in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, United States. Its population was 10,079 as of the 2020 census. New Richmond is within the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. 

==History==
New Richmond was founded in 1857. The first permanent settlement was established by Hiram Foster, who had led a group of settlers from Vermont into the area in search of virgin Wisconsin timber for harvesting. Foster built and operated a sawmill on the banks of the Willow River, which gradually drew more settlers from New England into the area. For the first few years the settlement was called Foster&#x27;s Crossing, and was later renamed after Richmond Day, the land surveyor who plotted the town. Because another town in Wisconsin had already taken the name Richmond, it was decided to call the town New Richmond. In 1871, New Richmond was made a station on the southwestern branch of Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railroad&#x27;s &#x27;Omaha X&#x27; network, initially working northwards from Hudson to New Richmond and providing a direct connection to St. Paul. Construction on the line continued northeast of New Richmond, reaching Spooner, Wisconsin in 1879. In addition to a steady stream of newcomers from New England, New Richmond saw an influx of Irish immigrants throughout the 1870s and early 1880s, later followed by large numbers of Germans, Norwegians and a few Swedes throughout the 1880s and 1890s. In 1885, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built a line into the north side of town westward from Chippewa Falls, from where it later continued towards Stillwater and on to St. Paul.

On the early evening of June 12, 1899, a deadly tornado tore through St. Croix, Polk and Barron counties along a 46-mile path. While most of the F5-strength storm&#x27;s path was confined to rural areas, New Richmond suffered a direct hit, with half the town&#x27;s residences leveled as well as the entire business district. In all, the tornado killed 117 people, 111 at New Richmond alone, injured more than 125, left over 1,500 people homeless and caused an estimated $18 million in damage. Due to state and federal aid and a large amount of donations, most of the homes and all but two of the businesses destroyed in the storm were able to rebuild by the following winter. Today, the tornado ranks as the deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin and the ninth deadliest tornado in American history. Most of Main Street (Knowles Avenue) was rebuilt within five months.

==Geography==

New Richmond is located at (45.119856, −92.539142).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. A major source of hydrological water is from the Willow River, which is dammed near the center of town.

<text>Aurora is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 386 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.2 square miles (88.6 km2), all of it land.

==History==
In the mid-summer of 1847, a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed a six-mile (10 km) square which approximates the current boundaries of Aurora. In December 1854, another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring them with a chain and a compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains a few swamps some of considerable extent they are all unfit for cultivation. The River Enters the Town Near the NE Corner of section 24 and flows in a WSWesterly course with a Gentle current except a few Riffles where the current becomes Rapid. The soil is principally 2d rate. This Township is covered with timber The greater portion of which is Hemlock Y Birch Elm and Sugar. A number of small streams rise in this Township and flow in a SWesterly course toward its west boundary. The swamp except Alder are covered with moss(?). There is no improvements on this Township.&quot;

An 1880 map of the area shows a &quot;winter road&quot; entering what would become Aurora from Chippewa County and loosely paralleling the Yellow River on the north side. This tote road extended through the wilderness all the way to what would become Westboro. It was used to ferry supplies to equip logging camps for the winter logging season. During this phase the loggers focused on cutting white pine - the most valuable tree - floating the logs down the Yellow in spring log drives.

An 1888 map shows the first settlers. Paralleling the winter road, a wagon road followed the course of Polley Lane a mile and a half into the township, and about ten settlers were sprinkled around it, with a rural school at the end. The largest land-holders at that time were Chippewa Lumber and Boom Co., Bruce &amp; Bayless, E. Pozwanski, and Westville Lumber Co.

A map from around 1900 shows still about ten homesteads in that southwest corner of the township near the river - half with Scandinavian names. The road had been extended to a few miles, turning down what would become River Road. The map still shows no settlers in the rest of the township, and no one at Gilman yet. Most of the land is held by lumber companies, with Chippewa Lumber and Boom and Northwestern Lumber Co holding the largest portions.

In 1902 and 1903 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway built its road up the east side of what would become Aurora, creating a station at Gilman. Around 1905 the J.S. Owen Company built a line for the Wisconsin Central heading northwest across the town for Ladysmith and Superior - now the Canadian National.

The 1911 plat map of the six mile square that would become Aurora shows the railroads in place. By this time the road that would become Polley Lane extends the full width of the six-mile square, and the road that would become River Road reaches across the river to the south edge of the town. Some sort of road follows the course of modern highway 64 west out of Gilman, with a branch heading north up the course of modern Gilman Road toward Hannibal. The road following 64 west goes only three miles, then tees north and south at modern Elder Road. The cluster of settlers in the SW corner has expanded somewhat, and a schoolhouse is marked where Polley Lane and River Road meet. The map also shows a few settlers on the east end, outside Gilman. Most of the land in the township is still owned by lumber companies, with the North Western Lumber Co. holding the majority. A few small chunks are held by Nye Lusk &amp; Hudson, the local mill in Polley. Some smaller parcels are held by land companies: Faas Land Co. and American Immigration Co. Settlers and farming were beginning to encroach on logging.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 386 people, 134 households, and 108 families residing in the town. The population density was 11.3 people per square mile (4.4/km2). There were 154 housing units at an average density of 4.5 per square mile (1.7/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.19% White, 0.26% Native American, 0.52% Asian, and 1.04% from two or more races.

There were 134 households, out of which 37.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.6% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.4% were non-families. 17.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average family size was 3.25.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 30.1% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 21.5% from 25 to 44, 24.6% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 107.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101.5 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $30,417, and the median income for a family was $34,583. Males had a median income of $29,500 versus $20,625 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,374. About 17.5% of families and 22.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 35.1% of those under age 18 and 10.4% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Browning is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 850 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Gad is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.5 square miles (94.6 km2), of which, 36.5 square miles (94.5 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water. The east and west branches of the Little Black River flow through the town.

Other than streambanks, the surface of the town is fairly level, laid down by some unknown glacier and eroded long before the last glacier which bulldozed the sharp Perkinstown terminal moraine to the north. Fragments of a low ice-marginal ridge cross the northeast corner of the town. The soil of most of Browning is called Merrill till.

==History==
The south and east edges of the six by six mile square that would become Browning were first surveyed in 1851 by crews working for the U.S. government. In the fall of 1861 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is generally level or gently rolling. Soil is principally 2nd Rate Timber Hemlock Birch Sugar White Pine Spruce and Fir and it is well watered by numerous Small Streams of pure water.&quot;

Around 1873, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line up through the forest just west of what would become Deer Creek, through Medford heading for Ashland. This opened up the nearby lands to settlers. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections.

An 1880 map of this area shows early roads spanning the six-miles square that would become Browning. One follows the course of modern Highway 64 from west to east.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the six-mile square that would become Browning was part of a larger Town of Medford, which spanned the county east to west. In 1895 the town of Browning was split out on its own.

A map from around 1900 shows settlers&#x27; homesteads dotted along the road that would become highway 64, along another road following the course of the future County O that spanned the south edge of the town, and along some roads that connected the two. The north half of the town had no roads except for 2.5 miles around what is now Frey Lane. On that Frey Lane corner, a sawmill, a rural school, and &quot;Lynch P.O.&quot; were marked. On the road that would become 64 were a church, another rural school, and a sawmill where the road crossed the east fork of the Black. Another rural school was on what would become Hall Drive. Large chunks of the town were still unsettled, with the Wisconsin Central still holding large parts of some odd-numbered sections. Other large land-holders are Davis &amp; Starr (the mill at Little Black), P.A. Merino, F.J. Witten, and E.F. Browning. One logging dam impounded the west branch of the Black and another the east.

The 1911 plat map shows the roads extended, with more settlers along them. By then a road followed the course of modern Grahl Road through the center of Browning, with a sawmill and a rural school added at the center of the township. A town hall was added where modern Hall Drive crosses highway 64. Some large parcels still remained in the north and east, with Stouton L.I. Co., Medford Manufacturing Co, H &amp; L Keifer, and Rib River Land Co. some of the largest landholders.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 850 people, 298 households, and 246 families residing in the town. The population density was 23.3 people per square mile (9.0/km2). There were 313 housing units at an average density of 8.6 per square mile (3.3/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.47% White, 0.12% Asian, 1.18% from other races, and 0.24% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.59% of the population.

There were 298 households, out of which 40.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.8% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.4% were non-families. 12.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.85 and the average family size was 3.10.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 28.9% under the age of 18, 8.7% from 18 to 24, 32.8% from 25 to 44, 20.9% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 108.3 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $45,917, and the median income for a family was $46,833. Males had a median income of $28,950 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,687. About 4.6% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.8% of those under age 18 and 7.5% of those age 65 or over.

<doc id="139813" wikidata="Q1884462" url="?curid=139813" title="Chelsea, Wisconsin">
<text>Chelsea is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 113 at the 2010 census. The census-designated places of Chelsea and Whittlesey are located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

Most of Chelsea is hilly, with small glacial lakes. It lies within the Perkinstown terminal moraine, which is described under Taylor County.

==History==
The six by seven mile square that would become Chelsea was first surveyed in 1861 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in April 1862 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is generally rolling and considerably Swampy. Timber principally Hemlock mixed with Birch Sugar Spruce (?) Tamarac Cedar and White Pine. It is watered by numerous Small Streams which unite and form two of considerable size one running in a Southerly direction and the other running NW and becoming a tributary of Chipewa river. The Township on the whole would not be very well adapted to agricultural purposes.&quot;

In the early 1870s the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company built its line up through the forest on the east side of the six-mile square that would become Chelsea. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for 18 miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd sections. The railroad built two stations in this town: Whittlesey and Chelsea. Sawmills were built near each station and logging commenced.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, Chelsea was six miles north to south, but it spanned the full width of the county, including all modern towns from Pershing to Greenwood. An 1880 map shows some sort of road roughly following the course of modern highway 13 up to Chelsea station, then heading west along the course of modern Quarter Lane.

The 1911 plat map of the six mile square that would become Chelsea shows much of the same as 1880, but the road/track along Quarter Lane had disappeared. By then the whole east and south edges of the town had a fairly complete grid of roads and dirt tracks. In addition, that same area was starting to fill in with settlers holding parcels 40 acres and up. Outside that band on the east and south, roads are sparse and much of the land is in larger chunks, with Medford Mfg. Co, Wisconsin Central Railway, and M.H. Mould the largest holders. The map shows a sawmill at Chelsea and a brickyard south of Whittlesey.

That Langenberg brickyard dug clay onsite from a layer ten to twelve feet thick, and formed and fired bricks in &quot;permanent up draft kilns.&quot; The brickyard produced 200,000 bricks in 1898, the year it opened. A writer from the Wisconsin Geological Survey observed, &quot;This is one of the best common clays that has come under my observation.&quot;

In 1933 much of the northwest quarter of Chelsea was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest

As logging operations declined, the railroad continued hauling freight and passengers, but that business too eventually dwindled and in 1988 the trains stopped running on this stretch of railroad. The following year, local residents and the railroad agreed to allow use of the railroad bed as a multi-use recreational trail - the Pine Line - which now runs along the east side of Chelsea.

<text>See Cleveland (disambiguation)

Cleveland is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 262 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Hannibal is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.7 square miles (92.4 km2), of which 33.9 square miles (87.7 km2) is land and 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2) (5.07%) is water.

Most of the water area is Chequamegon Waters, also known as Miller Dam, a man-made lake in the southeast corner of the town.

==History==

The six mile square that would become Cleveland was first surveyed in 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and slogging through the swamps on foot, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Township contains several swamps. All(?) are unfit for cultivation. The Meadow and Alder bottoms are all subject to be overflowed to a depth of 1 too 2 feet and are good for hay. The surface is Generally low and level apart is upland where the soil is 2d rate. This Township is heavily Timbered and is chiefly composed of Hemlock Y. Birch W. Pine and Balsam. The undergrowth is generally thick and is composed of Hemlock Hazel and Balsam. Balsam and elm(?) line the margins of the meadow and Alder bottoms. The River enters the Township near the center of its East Boundary and flows in a Southerly and South-Westerly course with a switft current and is from 1 too 3 feet deep in a low Stage of water and is adapted to the forming of a good motive power for mills. There is no improvements in this Township.&quot;

The east end of Cleveland was logged at least by the early 1860s, when George Judson built a dam on the Yellow River near Hughey and started a pine logging camp nearby, on the east side of the township.

In 1903 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway built its line up the west side of the town, generally running a little west of the present Highway 73. That same year the Eau Claire, Chippewa Falls, and Northeastern Railway (a.k.a. Omaha) built its line across the township, from Hannibal east to Hughey on the Yellow River. Logs were floated down the Yellow and loaded on railcars at Hughey to be shipped out. Hannibal grew at the junction of the two rail lines.

The 1911 plat map of the six mile square that would become Cleveland shows the two railroads in place, with Hannibal just north of their junction. Some sort of road follows the course of modern County M into Hannibal from the west. Another road follows the course of modern highway 73 toward Jump River to the north, but continues only a mile south - then turns to follow modern County M east toward Perkinstown. The map shows five settlers in the country within a mile of Hannibal. The rest of the township is mostly owned by lumber companies, with the Northwestern Lumber Company owning the most land. Chequamegon Waters does not yet exist, with just the Yellow River flowing through that area.

In 1933 much of the cut-over east half of Cleveland was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest Bear Creek Hemlocks is a State Natural Area in the north east corner of Cleveland on the border with the town of Jump River, which includes two stands of old-growth hemlock. Part of the Pershing Wildlife Area occupies a thousand acres in the northwest part of the town. The remainder of the town is privately owned—mostly farms, homes and wild land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 262 people, 98 households, and 72 families residing in the town. The population density was 7.7 people per square mile (3.0/km2). There were 120 housing units at an average density of 3.5 per square mile (1.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White.

There were 98 households, out of which 32.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.3% were married couples living together, 2.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.5% were non-families. 23.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.17.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 30.2% under the age of 18, 3.4% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 23.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 120.5 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $35,625, and the median income for a family was $39,375. Males had a median income of $29,167 versus $25,179 for females. The per capita income for the town was $16,452. About 8.2% of families and 10.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.6% of those under the age of eighteen and 8.0% of those 65 or over.

<text>Deer Creek is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The village of Stetsonville lies partly in the town, straddling its west border with Little Black. The population was 733 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.2 square miles (88.7 km2), of which, 34.2 square miles (88.6 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water.

Other than the banks of streams, the surface of the town is fairly level, laid down by some unknown glacier and eroded long before the last glacier which bulldozed the sharp Perkinstown terminal moraine to the north. The soil of the northwest and northeast corners of Deer Creek are considered to be primarily Merrill till, and the rest (majority) is Edgar till.

==History==
The six by six mile square that would become Deer Creek was first surveyed in 1851 by crews working for the U.S. government. In the fall of 1854 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains a large number of Swamps, all of which are unfit for cultivation. The lands is nearly all unfit for farming purposes, the soil being very poor and in most places the stone and gravel comes to the surface. The Timber is of poor quality, being mostly Hemlock &amp; Birch. Where the land is rolling, the timber is Sugar Lind? and Elm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no Pine worth any thing in the Township. It is well watered by small streams, but none of them are of sufficient size for milling purposes.&quot;

Around 1873 the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company built its line up through the forest just west of what would become Deer Creek, heading for Medford and eventually Ashland. This opened up the nearby lands to settlers. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections.

An 1880 map of this area shows a wagon road following the course of modern highway 13 for the north five miles of what would become Deer Creek, a predecessor of Apple Avenue spanning the full six miles across the north, and a predecessor of County A reaching four miles east of Stetsonville. A farm with the name A.J. Cliveland is marked in section 26.

A map from around 1900 shows the town filling in with settlers. Some sort of road follows most of the course of modern Highway 13 up the west edge of the town, and a mile to the east one follows the course of Oriole Drive. Other east-west wagon roads cover most of the section lines except for Pine Ave. Many north-south connector roads were also in. Settler homesteads were sprinkled along all these roads, with 40 and 80 acres the most common farm sizes. The town hall was a mile east of Stetsonville. Two rural schools were marked on what would become Elm Avenue, one in section 36, and one on what would become CTH A four miles east of Stetsonville. A sawmill was marked in section 26 and in the northwest corner of the town along the Little Black was the &quot;Poor Farm.&quot; The Wisconsin Central still owned large chunks of the odd sections, especially on the east side of the town.

The 1911 plat map shows more settlers. More roads had been connected. Another school had appeared two miles east of Stetsonville, and another up on what would become Apple Avenue. There were still large blocks without settlers, particularly in the east and south.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 733 people, 241 households, and 201 families residing in the town. The population density was 21.4 people per square mile (8.3/km2). There were 253 housing units at an average density of 7.4 per square mile (2.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.50% White, and 1.50% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.59% of the population.

There were 241 households, out of which 44.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.9% were married couples living together, 4.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.2% were non-families. 12.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.04 and the average family size was 3.34.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 31.7% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 22.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.5 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $49,688, and the median income for a family was $51,607. Males had a median income of $30,938 versus $21,500 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,503. About 6.0% of families and 7.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.2% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

<text>Ford is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 276 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Polley is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.1 square miles (90.8 km2), of which, 32.8 square miles (84.8 km2) of it is land and 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2) of it (6.59%) is water. Chequamegon Waters, also known as Miller Dam, is a man-made lake that covers the northeast corner of Ford.
Most of Ford&#x27;s soil is silt loam with a heavy subsoil. The southeast corner of the town lies in the hilly terminal moraine that runs from Westboro through Perkinstown and Lublin - dumped by the last glacier. The rest of Ford is the flatter till plain left by the same glacier. The Yellow River and Hay Creek have cut channels through that flatter area. Beneath the glacial till, most of Ford&#x27;s bedrock is volcanogenic metasedimentary rock, with smaller areas of amphibolite and sandstone.

==History==
In mid-summer of 1847 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed a six-mile square which approximates the current boundaries of Ford. Then in October 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains numerous swamps some of which are of considerable extent they are all unfit for cultivation. The surface is Generally level the low Hemlock lands the soil is 3d rate the uplands 2d. The whole of the Township is covered with Timber and is chiefly composed of Hemlock and Y Birch. The River Enters the Township Near the NW corner of section 1 and flows in a south westerly course with a swift current and has a good motive power for mills. There is no improvements on this Township. The Hemlock and Swamps Except Alder area covered with moss(?).&quot;

An 1880 map of the area shows a &quot;winter road&quot; from Chippewa County loosely paralleling the Yellow River on the north side. This tote road extended through the wilderness all the way to what would become Westboro. It was used to ferry supplies to equip logging camps for the winter logging season. During this phase the loggers focused on cutting white pine - the most valuable tree - floating the logs down the Yellow in spring log drives. This map also shows &quot;Dam built 1871&quot; at the location of Miller Dam.

In 1902 and 1903 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railroad was built up the west edge of Ford, heading north from Stanley toward Jump River and beyond. Around 1905 the J.S. Owen Company built a line for the Wisconsin Central heading northwest across the town for Ladysmith and Superior, crossing the SM&amp;P line two miles south of the Yellow River. At this auspicious junction, the hamlet of Polley sprang up, growing to include a 40-man sawmill, a hotel-saloon, a general store, a school, a barber, a cheese factory, a millinery shop, and a newspaper. The community was originally called Morehouse after the road superintendent, while the SM&amp;P called their railway station Lusk after the sawmill owner. In 1909 the USPS established a post office there named Polley for logger and postmaster James Polley. As years rolled on, some businesses moved two miles north to Gilman, the SM&amp;P shut down in the 1930s, and Polley dwindled until today only a bar and some homes remain.

The 1911 plat map of the six mile square that would become most of Ford shows the railroads, with Gilman where the SM&amp;P crosses the Yellow River. The rural lands to the east are mostly owned by lumber companies, with the Northwestern Lumber Co. holding the lion&#x27;s share. Some smaller parcels are owned by Nye, Lusk and Hudson, the local mill at Polley. Some chunks in the south are owned by the American Immigration Co. The map shows not a single settler in this 6-mile square, though the same series of maps from 1911 shows a smattering of settlers around Jump River, around Hannibal, west of Gilman, and a good number around Lublin. Ford was rather late to be settled.

In 1933 the cut-over eastern half of Ford was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest

The SM&amp;P Railway ceased operations in the 1930s, but the Wisconsin Central line ended up acquired by the Canadian National Railway, and runs to this day.

<text>Gilman is a village in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 410 at the 2010 census. The village is located between the towns of Aurora and Ford.

==Geography==
The community is in southwest Taylor County adjacent to the intersection of highways 64 and 73. The Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest lies three miles to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
Gilman was not settled until 1902 or 1903, though people had settled along the Yellow River in the west end of what is now the town of Aurora by 1900. The article on Aurora contains a description of the area from 1854, before logging or settlers. By 1880 a &quot;Winter Road&quot; followed the Yellow River through the vicinity of what would become Gilman, heading for logging operations further up the Yellow.

In 1902 and 1903 the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway crossed the Yellow River into the woods that would become Gilman, heading for Jump River and beyond. It built a section house where the line crossed the river and named the stop for Sally Gilman, the wife of the president of the Northwestern Lumber Company. That was the start of Gilman. The SM&amp;P ran generally north through town, passing just east of the current school. Around 1905, the Wisconsin Central Railway built its line northwest through town, heading from Owen to Ladysmith and eventually Superior. This line later became the Soo Line Railroad and eventually the Canadian National Railway line which still runs through town.

The village grew fast. A school was started in 1904 and the village was platted in 1905. Hotels, saloons, a general store, a barber and a post office soon followed. In 1907 Roy Heagle and others started a stave and heading mill called Gilman Manufacturing Company on the south side of town near the river. It made barrels from local basswood and by 1912 it employed as many as sixty men. During World War I the mill ran around the clock making barrels for ammunition. This mill operated until 1935. Heagle also ran a planing mill and a lath mill in Gilman.

Gilman was incorporated as a village in 1914. In 1915 three gas lights lit the streets at night - the only street lights between Owen and Ladysmith at the time. That same year the Catholic Church was organized. Other denominations followed shortly. A high school started in 1917. A fire destroyed much of Gilman&#x27;s business district in 1922, but it rebuilt.

During the same period, the village of Polley had grown two miles to the south, also on the SM&amp;P line. It had a school, a hotel-saloon, a general store, a forty-man sawmill, a barber, a cheese factory, a millinery shop, and a newspaper. But the SM&amp;P shut down in the 1930s and Polley declined until today only a bar and some homes and farms remain, while Gilman survives.

In the 1950s a central high school was started at Gilman for all of western Taylor County. Since then the primary schools have been centralized there too.

Today Gilman is smaller than it once was, but it has a hardware store, a few cafes, a bank, and other services. Major employers in town are the school, the nursing home, and Gilman Cheese. The major events each year are the Fall Fest and Snieg (Polish for &quot;snow&quot;) Fest in February, which features snow sculpting and a frying pan toss.

<text>Goodrich is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 510 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.3 square miles (94. km2), all of it land. The Big Rib River crosses the northeast corner of the town.

Other than streambanks, most of the surface of the town is fairly level, laid down by some unknown glacier and eroded long before the last glacier which bulldozed the sharp Perkinstown terminal moraine to the north. The soil of most of Goodrich is called Merrill till, except for meltwater stream sediment along the Big Rib River.

==History==
The dells of the Big Rib River in Goodrich are probably the rapids where Father René Menard disappeared in 1661, while attempting to reach a band of Huron Indians near the headwaters of the Black River. He left his partner at the rapids to carry some supplies and was never seen again.

The south and east edges of the six by six mile square that would become Goodrich were first surveyed in 1851 by crews working for the U.S. government. In December 1861 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The surface of this Township is mostly gently rolling and the Soil is principally 2nd Rate being well adapted to agricultural purposes. The Timber is a mixture of Hemlock Birch Sugar (?) Fir and Maple. There is but little Swamp land in the Township but it is well watered by numerous small streams of pure water which are tributaries of the Rib River which (?) through the Township in a South Easterly direction. It is a Stream that does not overflow having but few tributaries(?) to affect its rise and fall. There are no settlers in this Township.&quot;

Around 1873 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line up through the forest that would become Medford, heading for Ashland. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections.

An 1880 map of the area shows some sort of road entering what would become Goodrich from the Medford side, following the course of modern Highway 64 for two miles, then angling south into Marathon County.

A map from around 1900 showed one road following the course of 64 for a few miles, and two other roads along the southwest corner of the town. The map showed five settlers&#x27; homesteads along these roads. Otherwise, Goodrich had no roads or settlers. In contrast, lands nearer the railroad at Medford, Stetsonville and Chelsea were fully settled by this time. Much of the unsettled part of this town was held in large blocks, with the largest owners P.A. Merino in the north, H.B. Claflin in the east, and G. Stout in the south. By this time, the Wisconsin Central railroad had sold off most of its odd-numbered sections, but still held some smaller blocks.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the six-mile square that would become Goodrich was part of a larger Town of Medford, which spanned the county east to west. In 1895 Browning and Goodrich were split off into a 12-mile-wide town called Browning. In 1903 the town of Goodrich was split out on its own.
The 1911 plat map shows the roads extended, with more settlers along them. The predecessor of highway 64 had been extended another mile to a community of Goodrich, with a sawmill and a school on the map, and a railroad entering from the south. That railroad was Upham Manufacturing&#x27;s logging line coming up from Athens, by 1911 owned by the Copper River Land Co. Another wagon road followed the course of Martin Road north from 64 to the town line, with shorter roads branching off to the west. Settlers were filling in along all these. Another rural school had appeared along the south boundary of the town. Large chunks still remained unsettled, mostly owned by the Rib River Land Co.

<text>Greenwood is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 642 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Interwald is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 54.3 square miles (140.7 km2), of which, 54.3 square miles (140.6 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.09%) is water. The Big Rib River crosses the east end of the town.

Other than stream valleys, the east and middle of the town roll gently, laid down by some unknown glacier and eroded long before the last glacier. The soil of these areas is called Merrill till, except for meltwater stream sediment along the Big Rib River. The west end is the terminal moraine of that last glacier, with choppy glacial sediment interrupted by the sandy bottoms left by ice-walled lakes.

==History==
Most of the edges of the six by six squares that would become Greenwood were surveyed in October 1861 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In early 1862, the same crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description for the western six by six square:
&quot;The surface of this Township is level and the soil good - well adapted for agricultural purposes. The Timber is large, among which is scattering White Pine of a Superior quality.&quot;

Around 1873, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line just west of what would become Greenwood, up through the forest that would become Medford heading for Ashland. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections.

An 1880 map of the area shows no roads in what would become Greenwood. It shows two wagon roads touching the southwest corner, and a road following the course of modern Highway 13 a half mile west of Greenwood.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the land that would become Greenwood was part of a larger Town of Chelsea, which spanned the county east to west. In 1895 Greenwood was split off as its own town.
A map from around 1900 shows some roads and settlers in place. By that time some sort of road followed the course of modern County M for 12 miles across the township. Another road followed modern Wellington Lake Road north and south. Others followed modern Brehm Avenue, Trout Avenue, and County C. Settlers&#x27; homesteads were sprinkled along all these roads. The map also shows two sawmills and four rural schools on the future County M, Urquhart Post Office at the west end, and Interwald Post Office toward the east. Another school was where the predecessor of County C crossed the Rib River, and another school and church on Brehm Avenue, where St. Ann&#x27;s church still stands. The remainder of the land was still mostly in large blocks, with the Wisconsin Central Railroad still holding many of the odd-numbered sections. The next largest land-owner is J.J. Kennedy, owner of the sawmill at Rib Lake.

The 1911 plat map showed the roads extended, with more settlers along them. The school at C and the Rib River had become the town hall. A Brehm Post Office had appeared on the future Trout Avenue. By this time, the Wisconsin Central had sold most of its land. The surviving large blocks are distributed between various owners, including U.S. Leather, Medford Manufacturing Co., and Wausau Lumber Co. on the east end. Two years later, on a 1913 plat map, Brehm Post Office is shown in a different location, across from St Ann&#x27;s church.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 642 people, 234 households, and 186 families residing in the town. The population density was 11.8 people per square mile (4.6/km2). There were 295 housing units at an average density of 5.4 per square mile (2.1/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.60% White, 0.16% Native American, 0.16% Asian, 0.31% from other races, and 0.78% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.62% of the population.

There were 234 households, out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.4% were married couples living together, 2.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.1% were non-families. 17.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.74 and the average family size was 3.12.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $34,000, and the median income for a family was $42,500. Males had a median income of $27,321 versus $21,528 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,120. About 10.2% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.2% of those under age 18 and 16.3% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Grover is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 256. The unincorporated community of Perkinstown is located in the town.

==Geography==
Grover is a large town - six miles by twelve. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 71.4 square miles (184.8 km2), of which, 70.7 square miles (183.0 km2) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) of it (0.99%) is water.

Much of Grover is hilly with little glacial lakes. It is part of the Perkinstown terminal moraine, which is discussed in the article on Taylor County. Because the land would be difficult to farm, much of Grover&#x27;s land was incorporated into the Chequamegon–Nicolet National Forest, and the town includes five of Taylor County&#x27;s twelve State Natural Areas: Brush Creek Hemlocks, Perkinstown Hemlocks, Pirus Road Swamp, Richter Lake Hemlocks, and Yellow River Ice-walled Lake Plain.
==History==
The two six mile squares that would become Grover were first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in the winter of 1857 and 1858 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and over frozen swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description of the six mile square north of Perkinstown:
&quot;This Township contains numerous small Tamarac and Cedar Swamps. These are generally unfit for cultivation. There are some few marshes that are very good for hay. The surface is generally rolling; Soil mostly second rate except on some of the Birch and Maple ridges it is first rate. Timber chiefly Hemlock, Birch, Maple, Pine, Tamarac and Cedar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yellow River runs through the North West corner of this Township in a South Westerly course. It is a deep narrow Stream flows in a gentle Current no(?) good for forming motive Power for Mills. There are several small creek running in different Directions bank generally high and dry.&quot;

Logging was underway in the area by 1860, with the logging dam at Hughey patented in that year. Other dams on the Yellow River were patented in 1869 and 1873, and on the north fork in 1896. An 1880 map of the area shows a &quot;winter road&quot; crossing the northwest corner of what would become Grover, roughly following the Yellow River up from Chippewa County. This tote road extended through the wilderness all the way to what would become Westboro. It was used to ferry supplies to equip logging camps for the winter logging season. During this phase the loggers focused on cutting white pine - the most valuable tree - floating the logs down the Yellow in spring log drives.

The first settlers in Grover arrived in the early 1880s. Jacob Maurer, Henry Richter, Fred Westrich and Joseph Lechner earned their plots by living on them five years and meeting other requirements of the Homestead Act of 1862. They all settled around what would become Perkinstown. In 1891 the Shaws platted the village of Perkinstown; soon after they started a tannery on the north side of Lake Kathryn, choosing this location because hemlock bark was used for tanning. A small sawmill started about the same time. The tannery closed around 1900, when tanning techniques were developed that didn&#x27;t use hemlock.

A plat map from around 1900 shows the Wisconsin Central Railroad owning more of what would become Grover than anyone else. In the 1870s the Wisconsin Central had built the first rail line up through the forest that would become Medford. To finance that project, the U.S. government granted the Wisconsin Central half the land for eighteen miles on both sides of their track - generally the odd-numbered sections - and Grover lay within eighteen miles. By 1900 the Wisconsin Central had sold some of that land to lumber companies, but still held some large chunks. Other large landholders are Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company in the north and in the south Sawyer and Austin, J.M. Holway, and various Shaw entities. Some sort of road follows the course of modern Perkintown Avenue in from the east. Another follows the course of modern County M for two miles north of Perkinstown. Another road from the east follows the course of modern highway 64 for a few miles. Scattered settlers&#x27; homesteads are marked along all these roads, and also a few west of Perkinstown where there are no roads.

The 1911 plat maps of Grover showed more roads and more settlers. By this time a forerunner of Sawyer Avenue entered the town from the east. Another road followed the course of modern County M. A school is marked at the corner of Perkinstown Avenue and what would become Winter Sports Road. In the southwest corner J.S. Owen&#x27;s logging railroad presses into the town for a couple miles. Another school is marked two miles north of Perkinstown. Beyond that, the town was still roadless and mostly owned by the Wisconsin Central Railroad, Yellow River Lumber Company, and Northwestern Lumber Company.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 233 people, 93 households, and 70 families residing in the town. The population density was 3.3 people per square mile (1.3/km2). There were 135 housing units at an average density of 1.9 per square mile (0.7/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.42% White and 2.58% Native American. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.43% of the population.

The average household size was 2.51 and the average family size was 2.89.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.7% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.2 males.

<text>Hammel is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 735 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Murat is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.7 square miles (92.5 km2), of which, 35.5 square miles (91.9 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2) of it (0.70%) is water.

Geologists believe the last glacier to advance into this area stopped its advance at a line running through northern Hammel, just south of Lake Isadore, then retreated. See the map and discussion in the article on Taylor County.

==History==
The six mile (10 km) square that would become Hammel was first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in late 1857 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and over frozen swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains several Tamarac and Cedar Swamp some of considerable extent and mostly unfit for cultivation. The Surface is generally rolling and 2nd rate soil except on the Black River bottoms it is 1st rate soil. Timber is very heavy all over the Township Chiefly Hemlock Birch Pine Maple Tamarac and Cedar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black River enters the Township near the South East corner, it is generally Deep and flows in a gentle Current in a Westerly direction to the South West corner of the Township, not well adapted for good motive power or mills.&quot;

An 1880 map of central Wisconsin shows two roads from Medford reaching the east edge of what would become Hammel.

The Town of Hammel was organized in 1897.

A map from 1900 shows lots of settlement activity, particularly in the east. Some sort of roads followed the course of parts of modern County E along the east edge of the town. A predecessor of modern Perkinstown Avenue spanned the whole township, with short side-roads branching off to north and south. Along it were scattered settlers, three rural schools, and two sawmills. Another road followed the eastern two miles of modern Center Avenue. It too had scattered settlers and a rural school. Another road followed the course of modern Highway 64 and Sawyer Avenue across most of the town, with many settlers and two rural schools. Another followed the course of modern County O, with scattered settlers. Parts of the town, particularly in the west, were still largely unsettled, still mostly in large blocks owned by logging companies like Sawyer &amp; Austin and the Holways. Sawyer&#x27;s log-driving dam on the Black River was marked at the west edge of the town. The Wisconsin Central Railroad still owned portions of the odd-numbered sections. The railroad had been given most of the odd-numbered sections for 18 miles on both sides of its line through Medford to finance building that railroad line up through the wilderness. By 1900 it had sold most of its land in Hammel, but still held some chunks.

A village of Murat was platted around Lake Esadore. The map shows a hotel and &quot;hall&quot; about where the High View Inn now is, and a school out west of Mud Lake. One of the two sawmills stood where the outlet of Esadore crosses Perkinstown Avenue. It was in operation by 1900 and closed after burning in 1903.

The 1911 plat map shows little change from 1900. The roads had reached farther and more settlers had filled in along them in the east. The far west was still mostly in large blocks, with some changes of ownership and few settlers.

In 1933 parts of the northwest quarter of Hammel were designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 735 people, 265 households, and 219 families residing in the town. The population density was 20.7 people per square mile (8.0/km2). There were 346 housing units at an average density of 9.8 per square mile (3.8/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.78% White, 0.14% African American, 0.27% Native American, 0.68% Asian, and 0.14% from two or more races.

There were 265 households, out of which 38.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 75.8% were married couples living together, 3.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.0% were non-families. 14.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.5% under the age of 18, 8.2% from 18 to 24, 30.3% from 25 to 44, 26.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $51,250, and the median income for a family was $53,281. Males had a median income of $30,089 versus $26,319 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,425. About 3.7% of families and 7.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.4% of those under age 18 and 10.9% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Holway is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 854 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.4 square miles (94.2 km2), of which, 36.3 square miles (94.1 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water. The surface is fairly level, not reached by the last glacier which bulldozed the Perkinstown terminal moraine to the north. The soil of most of Holway is considered to be Merrill till.

==History==
The six mile (10 km) square that would become Holway was first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is generally level the dry land is but very little elevated above the Swamps the Soil is poor 3rd rate bearing but little vegetation but is generally covered with a thick heavy moss. The Timber is principally Hemlock &amp; Birch with a few Scattering trees of White Pine of poor quality. The Township is well watered by numerous Small Streams of good pure water. There are no Settlers in the Township.&quot;

At the formation of Taylor County in 1875, the six-mile square that would become Holway was part of the original town of Little Black, which spanned the width of the county from east to west. An 1880 map of central Wisconsin shows no roads in the six-mile square, but two roads of some sort reach the east edge - one from Stetsonville and one from the community of Little Black. The map also shows a farm in section 29, labelled A.E. Sawyer. Sawyer ran a logging firm in Black River Falls.

The town of Holway was split off in 1895. It was first named Pine-lake, then changed to Holway, 
for Nymphus B. Holway, a wealthy lumberman from Maine.

A map from 1900 shows lots of settlement activity. The grid of roads was fairly complete for the easternmost two miles. A wagon road followed the course of modern Elm Avenue all the way across the town. Another road, a forerunner of Apple Avenue, reached across to within a mile and a half of the west end. Settlers&#x27; homesteads were started in along these roads. Two rural schools and a church were shown on Apple Ave. Two more rural schools were probably (that part of the map is blurry) shown along Elm. It appears there were also two sawmills in the south of the town. Holway&#x27;s Dam was marked on Trappers Creek in section 15. The west end was still held in larger chunks, with few settlers. There J.M. Holway owned the most land by far. Sawyer and Austin still held a chunk and the Wisconsin Central Railroad held a few parcels in the odd-numbered sections, remnants of its payment for building the railroad line up through the wilderness and creating Medford and Stetsonville in the early 1870s.

The 1911 plat map shows thicker settlers, and some extension of the roads beyond the 1900 map. A sawmill is at Holway&#x27;s dam. The west end still has few settlers, with N.B. Holway and Benson &amp; Anderton the largest land-owners. Upham Manufacturing of Marshfield owns a smaller chunk.

Amish families began to arrive in Holway in 1921 - initially from Kansas, but then other places. In those first years they bought cut-over land for $30 per acre from J.S. Owen and cleared it. These are Old Order Amish who refer to themselves as Curtiss Colony, which is centered in Holway. As of 1974, this colony was divided into several church districts.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 854 people, 263 households, and 213 families residing in the town. The population density was 23.5 people per square mile (9.1/km2). There were 284 housing units at an average density of 7.8 per square mile (3.0/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.77% White, 0.12% Native American, and 0.12% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.12% of the population.

There were 263 households, out of which 42.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.7% were married couples living together, 6.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.0% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.25 and the average family size was 3.71.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 32.4% under the age of 18, 10.9% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 17.3% from 45 to 64, and 8.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 106.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,500, and the median income for a family was $44,464. Males had a median income of $27,333 versus $23,472 for females. The per capita income for the town was $13,718. About 14.9% of families and 20.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.3% of those under age 18 and 25.0% of those age 65 or over.

<doc id="139823" wikidata="Q3248676" url="?curid=139823" title="Jump River (town), Wisconsin">
<text>Jump River is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 311 at the 2000 census. The town takes its name from the Jump River which flows through its northwest corner. There is also a census-designated place called Jump River located partially in the town.

==History==
In 1847, surveyors working for the U.S. government walked the six mile (10 km) square that would become the town of Jump River. They marked off the outline of the township on foot using compass and chain. A crew came back in 1855 to survey all the section lines. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains several swamps and some of considerable extent. They are all unfit for cultivation. The Meadow and Alder bottom are all liable to be overflowed to a depth of or more. and are good for Hay. The surface is generally level apart is upland where the soil is 2d rate. This Township is heavily timbered and is composed of Hemlock and Y. Birch on low level land, but on upland it is Sugar Linden W. Pine Balsam and Elm. The undergrowth is Generally thick and is composed of Hemlock, Hazel, and Balsam. Elm and Balsam line the Margin of the Meadow and Alder Bottoms and also most of the Streams.&quot;

In 1863 the federal government granted the first land patents in what would become the town of Jump River, granting ownership of three parcels:
* 120 acres along Levitt Creek in sections 8 and 17 to Barton W. Chase. Chase had apparently bought the land from Daniel Stevens of the Massachusetts Militia, who had been granted rights to the land as payment for serving in the War of 1812.
* Another 120 acres along Levitt Creek in section 8 to Charles B. Coleman. Coleman had apparently bought rights to the land from George W. Jones of the Wisconsin Militia, who had the rights for serving in the Black Hawk War.
* 160 acres near the Jump River in sections 4 and 5 (the Jahnke, Johnson and Smith neighborhoods) to Joseph W. Wiggins. Wiggins had bought rights to the land from the heirs of John R. Patten, who had served in the Illinois Militia in the Black Hawk War.
The largest grantee was Ezra Cornell, who received many quarter-sections in 1868 and 1869 to help finance the new Cornell University under the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act.

The plat map ca. 1880 of the 6-mile square that would become Jump River showed no roads or settlers yet, while the same set of maps already showed significant settlement along the Wisconsin Central Railroad - especially around Medford: homesteads, rural schools, sawmills and wagon roads. Also out west of future Gilman, a few had settled along the Yellow River. In the unsettled future Jump River, the largest land-holders in 1880 were Cornell University, W. Ramsay, M.W. Simmonds, and the Wisconsin Central Railroad. To finance building the railway up through Medford, the government gave the Wisconsin Central the odd-numbered sections for eighteen miles on either side of the rails, and Jump River was just at the edge of that land grant.

Barney and Gertrude Broeder were the first settlers in the town, arriving in 1892. Others soon followed. The Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway reached the town in 1904. Prior to that, logging operations generally stuck to white pine reasonably close to the river, since the only way to get logs out was floating them downstream. The last logs were driven down Jump River around 1903. With the arrival of the railroad, logging operations could shift to stands away from the river and eventually to hardwoods. The Northwestern company laid rail spurs and temporary logging spurs over much of the township.

The 1911 plat map of the area that would become Jump River Township shows most of the land still owned by logging companies, but a few settlers&#x27; homes. A road of some sort follows the current route of modern Highway 73 and then continues straight north across the river. Next to that road south of the river is the Allamang School. A dozen homes are sprinkled east of Jump River around Barney Broeder&#x27;s. A few other homes are on the west end where modern County H crosses the river, but the rest is lumber company land, with the Northwestern Lumber Co. holding the lion&#x27;s share.

In 1923, the Town of Jump River was established with its current boundaries. The stone Jump River Town Hall was built in the early 1930s during the Great Depression with funds from the New Deal WPA.

In 1933 the cut-over east edge of the town of Jump River was designated part of the Chequamegon National Forest In 2007 an area in the southeast corner was designated the &quot;Bear Creek Hemlocks State Natural Area&quot;. Among a variety of flora, it contains two stands of old-growth hemlock.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.0 square miles (93.2 km2), all of it land.

<text>Little Black is a town (six-mile square municipality) located in Taylor County, Wisconsin. The village of Stetsonville lies partly in the town, and the hamlet of Little Black. As of the 2000 census, the town had a total population of 1,148.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.0 square miles (90.7 km2), of which, 35.0 square miles (90.7 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water. Other than the banks of streams and the Little Black River, the surface of the town is fairly level, laid down by some unknown glacier and eroded long before the last one which bulldozed the sharp Perkinstown terminal moraine to the north. The soil of the northwest half of Little Black is considered to be mostly Merrill till, and the southeast half is Edgar till.

==History==
The western edge of the six by six mile square that would become Little Black was first surveyed in 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. That west edge of the town is on the Fourth Principal Meridian, the first north-south line surveyed up through the forests of Wisconsin, from which towns, sections and forties were later measured. In October 1854 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains some Swamps, all of which are unfit for cultivation. The North West portion is mostly worthless, being almost all Swamp. The Land is generally of poor quality, and not good farming land, the soil being poor and the rocks coming to the surface in many places. Most of the Timber is Hemlock but where there is Hardwood the land is fair(?) farming land. There is no Pine of any consequence. The Township is well watered with small streams and in the North part of the Township there is a large Stream of sufficient size for milling purposes, with high banks, rocky bottom and rapid current. There are no improvements in the Township.&quot;

Around 1873 the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company built its line up through the forest on the east side of the six-mile square that would become Little Black, heading for Medford and eventually Ashland. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd sections. The railroad built a station at what would become Stetsonville. In 1873 a sawmill was built in the hamlet of Little Black - the first in Taylor County. One was built in Stetsonville in 1875. They were first fed by lumber cut from the surrounding country.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, Little Black was six miles north to south same as today, but it spanned the full width of the county, including all modern towns from Taft to Deer Creek. It was named for the Little Black River. Deer Creek was split off in 1880 and other towns in subsequent years.
A village of Little Black was platted, with most lots aligned to the compass instead of the railroad. The map shows a post office and church. As mentioned above, the first sawmill there started in 1873. A shingle mill was added in 1880. Another mill was added in 1883 where the Wisconsin Central crossed the Little Black River. This mill went through a succession of owners until it was bought by Davis and Starr of Eau Claire, then burned in 1889. Davis and Starr rebuilt it with the latest technology at the time to be one of the largest mills in the state, running night and day, employing over 200 men. Then in 1893 they shut it down.

A map from 1900 shows the town largely filled in by settlers, except for the southwest corner. The same map shows the adjacent 6-mile squares on the east and west still in large blocks owned largely by lumber companies or the Wisconsin Central, but the land near the railroad was filled in with settlers for miles. East-west wagon roads were in place every mile, except for the southwest corner. North and south, predecessors of Swallow Drive and Gibson Drive already spanned much of the town. Settlers&#x27; homesteads lined these roads, with 40 and 80 acres the most common farm sizes. The map shows sawmills at Little Black and Stetsonville, two rural schoolhouses along a predecessor of Elm Avenue, a schoolhouse west of Little Black, and another where Apple Avenue now meets Castle Drive. It shows churches in Stetsonville and Little Black.

The 1911 plat map shows thicker settlers, filling even the last southwest corner. By this time even the east-west roads were nearly complete every mile. To the previous schools, one had been added three miles west of Stetsonville. Another sawmill had been added a mile south of Stetsonville.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,148 people, 403 households, and 321 families residing in the town. The population density was 32.8 people per square mile (12.7/km2).

<doc id="139826" wikidata="Q1885420" url="?curid=139826" title="Maplehurst, Wisconsin">
<text>Maplehurst is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 359 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.9 square miles (93.1 km2), of which, 35.9 square miles (93.0 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.06%) is water.

The northwest corner of Maplehurst lies in the hilly terminal moraine that runs from Westboro through Perkinstown and Lublin. That land is choppy because it has had only about 15,000 years to level out since it was dumped by the last glacier. Within that northwest moraine are some ice-walled lake plains, which are fairly level and farmable. Outside Maplehurst&#x27;s northwest corner, most of the town is fairly flat, covered with till deposited by some earlier glacier at an unknown date, with much more time to erode and level out. The Black River and smaller streams have cut channels through that flat area.
==History==
The six mile square that would become Maplehurst was first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in May 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, moving on foot, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
An 1880 map of the area shows no development in what would become the town of Maplehurst except &quot;A.E. Sawyer&quot; in section 2 near the Black River - a logging camp for Sawyer&#x27;s firm in Black River Falls.
A map from around 1900 shows the Wisconsin Central Railroad owning more of what would become Maplehurst than anyone else. In the 1870s the Wisconsin Central had built the first rail line up through the forest that would become Medford. To finance that project, the U.S. government granted the Wisconsin Central half the land for eighteen miles on both sides of their track - generally the odd-numbered sections - and Maplehurst lay within eighteen miles. By 1900 the Wisconsin Central had sold some of that land to lumber companies, but still held some large chunks. The next largest land-holders were Sawyer and Austin, J.M. Holway, and the N. Wisconsin Land Co. Also appearing on this map is a sawmill on the Black River near modern Shady Nook Lane. The map also shows some sort of road following some of the north edge of the township on the course of modern highway 64. Another road roughly follows the course of modern County A into the east half of the town. Settlers are also starting to appear along the Black, with the largest group five homesteads with Scandinavian names near modern Putnam Drive and Rabbit Ave.

The 1911 plat map of Maplehurst shows more roads, more settlers, and a community of Maplehurst platted at the intersection of modern County T and Shiner Ave. A map of the community from 1913 shows neatly planned streets, a hotel, a store and a school. Some claim a railroad spur ran to Maplehurst from the Soo Line to the south. For a mile or two around this community, the map shows a fairly complete road grid. A road has also reached up the course of modern Putnam Drive and a school is marked near that group of settlers. Another school and a sawmill are also marked on the road that would become modern A. The south half of the town is fairly well filled with settlers. Most of the north half is not - still mostly owned by the Wisconsin Central, land companies, and lumber companies. The Wisconsin Central/Soo Line cuts across the very southwest corner, heading toward Lublin and eventually Superior. The Owen Lumber Company&#x27;s logging spur cuts across the northwest corner near Diamond Lake. But the transition from logging to farming was well under way.
