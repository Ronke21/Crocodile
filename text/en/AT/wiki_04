<text>Hardwick is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,920 at the 2020 census. It contains the unincorporated villages of Hardwick, East Hardwick, and Mackville. The town is a commercial center for the region&#x27;s farming population.

The main settlement of Hardwick in the center of the town, formerly an incorporated village, is since 1988 a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 1,269 at the 2020 census.

==History==
During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington ordered construction of the Bayley-Hazen Military Road to provide access into the interior of Vermont. It would prompt the development and settlement of Hardwick and East Hardwick.

The town was granted by the Vermont General Assembly on November 7, 1780, then chartered on August 19, 1781, to Danforth Keyes and 66 others, some of whom were from Hardwick, Massachusetts. Permanent settlement began in 1793 when several families named Norris arrived from New Hampshire. By 1859, when the population reached 1,402, the town had several sawmills and gristmills on the Lamoille River. There were also two tanneries. Over the years, other industries would include a woolen mill, tinware shop, and carriage factory.

The predominant business following the Civil War was granite quarrying, especially after the Portland &amp; Ogdensburg Railway opened service through the town and facilitated shipment of stone. While most of the granite was quarried in nearby Woodbury, the stone was dressed and finished in Hardwick, largely near &quot;Granite Junction&quot;, where the rail lines met. The Hardwick and Woodbury Railroad was built to bring granite from the quarries to the finishing shops, and Hardwick became known as the &quot;Building Granite Center of the World&quot;. By 1906, 1,200 people were employed in the industry, which was led by the Woodbury Granite Company. Buildings around the country made with Hardwick granite include the Pennsylvania State Capitol, Chicago City Hall, and the 1914 Post Office in Washington, D.C., as well as numerous city halls and custom houses. The decline of the &quot;architectural granite&quot; industry in the 1920s and 1930s left Hardwick in economic depression.

Hardwick Village disincorporated in 1988 and merged with the town.

In 2011, the office manager of the municipal electric department was accused of embezzling $1.6 million over a period of 12 years. The FBI investigated, and she was charged in federal court and found guilty.

==History==
The town was chartered to Roswell Hopkins in 1790; Hopkins served as Clerk of the House of Representatives and Secretary of State of Vermont, and he accepted the land grant in lieu of cash as payment for his government service. The grant Hopkins received was originally called Hopkinsville; it was later combined with a parcel from the town of Burke, and renamed Kirby. Several ideas have been proposed for how the name Kirby was chosen; the most common is that it is a variant of the English Kirkby, which means a village or settlement around a church. By the time the town was organized in 1807, Hopkins had sold his interest and moved to Hopkinton, New York.

==Geography==
Kirby is located on the eastern border of Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont.

<text>Lyndon is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,491. Lyndon is the home of Lyndon State College. The town contains five unincorporated villages, Lyndonville just east of the geographic center of town, Lyndon Corner in the south, Lyndon Center in the center of town on the west side of Lyndonville, Little Egypt in the north, and East Lyndon in the southeast.

Lyndon is the second-most populous town in the Northeast Kingdom; only neighboring St. Johnsbury is larger. It is also the fastest growing town in Vermont with a population over 5,000, growing 9.8% in the decade preceding the 2010 census.

==History==
When Rhode Island proprietors secured the original Lyndon township grant, the area was covered in forests and woodlands. The Passumpsic River, flowing through the center of the town, provided power for grist and saw mills. The charter of the town of Lyndon was signed by Governor Thomas Chittenden in 1780.

It seems likely that the name Lyndon was chosen to honor Josias Lyndon (1704–1778), a former governor of Rhode Island and friend of many of the proprietors. Many of these men served with the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment, 1st Division, including Israel Angell. The original proprietors secured the grant as a business venture and had no intention of settling it. Some of the men held high positions of rank, including Jonathan Arnold, William Greene, and James Manning, the President of Rhode Island College, later Brown University. They needed men in search of free land, who would clear each proprietor&#x27;s grant in return for a portion of it. The town was surveyed in 1781 by Jonathan Arnold, Daniel Cahoon and Daniel Owen. Settlement began in 1789. By the 1790 census, twelve families with 59 residents made their homes in Lyndon. These families installed roads, mills, homes, barns, fields, crops, churches, and schools.

The village of Lyndon Corner was incorporated in 1792; Lyndon Center in 1794. Lyndonville was incorporated in 1866. The village of Lyndon Corner was about south of Lyndonville. The Hotel Lyndon was built there in 1807. It became a tavern and burned in 1897. About 1867, the Connecticut &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad bypassed Lyndon Corner and Lyndon Center. This resulted in business moving to Lyndonville. The bypassed villages became residential and are no longer distinguished by a separate name. They both gave up their incorporated village status in 1962.

Meetings held in Lyndon in the late 1880s by local resident Theodore Newton Vail led to the creation of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. In addition to other contributions to Lyndon, Vail constructed Vermont&#x27;s first paved road from the railroad depot to his estate.

During a centennial celebration in 1891 an iron box was buried as a time capsule but could not be found during a 1991 ceremony.

The Lyndon Outing Club held an annual winter festival in the late 1930 to early 1940s. The festival consisted of dog sled races, cross-country and ski jumping competitions, and sulky races on cleared streets.

==Geography==
Lyndon is located in the valley of the Passumpsic River in northeastern Vermont. It is bordered by the town of St. Johnsbury to the south, Danville to the southwest, Wheelock to the west, Sutton to the north, Burke to the northeast, and Kirby to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.89%, is water.

The highest point in Lyndon is Diamond Hill in the southwest, with an elevation of slightly greater than .

===Geology===
Lyndonville, the main village in town, is partially located on a high kame terrace. This may have once extended across the valley to form the end of a basin. Its lower strata are clayey, and are folded and curved. West of this terrace the level is lower. There is the course of a former river bed which ran towards the east. At the upper village of Lyndon the first terrace is about wide. There is a lot of sand and fine gravel adjoining.

Every stream from either side of the valley has its large terraces to correspond with those of the Passumpsic River. It is a characteristic of these terraces that they are large while their quantity is small. The count never exceeds five which is unusual.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 5,448 people, 2,031 households, and 1,326 families residing in the town. The population density was 137.0 people per square mile (52.9/km2).

This town contains the dormitories of Vermont State University&#x27;s Lyndon campus, thus affecting the age profile of the town.

The median income for a household in the town was $32,946, and the median income for a family was $42,633. Males had a median income of $30,525 versus $23,237 for females.

<text>Peacham is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 715 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1763, Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire gave a charter for the region to a group of proprietors, and the town was given the name Peacham (the etymology of the name is unclear). The original proprietors were speculators who surveyed the town, laid a few rudimentary roads, and divided it into lots, though the territory remained unsettled for some time.

In 1775, settlers, primarily from Connecticut and Massachusetts, bought the lots and built homes, developing the land for agriculture. The original settlers survived almost entirely through subsistence farming despite the long winters, hilly terrain, and rocky soil. Nine years later, records show a population of approximately 200 people. The first recorded town meeting took place in 1784, and selectmen were duly elected to govern the affairs of the town. Peacham was early on presented with a choice of having either the county courthouse or the county school, and the residents voted for the school. In 1795 the Caledonia County Grammar School received its charter, and the first school was established in a log structure on the Bayley Hazen Road, halfway between Peacham Corner and South Peacham.

In 1799, a library was established, which traveled from store to store. A congregational church was founded in 1794—the first pastor, Leonard Worcester, was well known for his fiery sermons. His son Samuel went on to be an important missionary to the Cherokee people, creating the first typeface for the Cherokee alphabet and gaining lasting fame as the plaintiff in the supreme court case &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;.

Early residents, who came to be known as Peachamites, traded butter, eggs, and wheat for goods which they could not make at home, and also relied on the production and sale of items such as whiskey and potash to help augment the relatively poor harvests. Almost from the beginning, various trades and industries—as many as 30–35 at a given time—flourished. Lumbering, coopering, milling, butter making, tin ware, tanneries and leather goods provided goods for local consumption. From 1800 to 1830, sheep farming flourished as a more profitable endeavor than growing crops. In 1840, the town reached its greatest population of 1,443. From that date on, census numbers steadily declined. Farming methods changed, and dairy farming came to replace sheep. The larger, more industrially advanced farms of the late 19th century could not support large families, and youth began to leave home.

In the 20th century, the population continued to decline to a low in the mid-600s. Farming also became less common due to competition with larger dairy farms in the West, and many farms either consolidated or went under. Tourism became important during the 20th century as people opened their homes to visitors from the cities of the Atlantic seaboard, often derisively referred to as &quot;&quot;. With the advent of the railroad in Barnet and then motor vehicles, Peacham became a popular location for summer residents, some of whom were educators from Boston and New York City. In the second half of the 20th century, Peacham became a popular vacation spot and retirement home for prominent intellectuals and liberal thinkers—individuals such as David Dellinger, William Lederer, Roman Jakobson, and the historian Shepard Clough all owned houses in town. Their interests and stimulation enhanced the cultural interests of the town.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.18%, is water. Neighboring towns are Danville to the north, Barnet to the east, Ryegate to the southeast, Groton to the south, Marshfield to the west, and Cabot to the northwest. No numbered state highways pass through the town.

The highest point in Peacham is the summit of Cow Hill near the northern corner of town.

==Culture==
The Peacham Historical Association (PHA) has been preserving records since 1916. The PHA has published a number of works on the town and has archives which chronicle the town&#x27;s history from 1776.

The Peacham Library is a private library founded in 1810 as a resource for the debating team of the Caledonia County Grammar School. For the first century of its existence, the library possessed no fixed location and rotated from store to store around the town. The original library building was purchased in 1909. It burned in 1959, destroying almost the entire collection. The current library was constructed on the same location in 1960 and enlarged in 2001. The library has over 9,200 volumes and over 500 registered patrons.

Peacham has hosted the yearly Peacham Acoustic Music Festival since 2011, typically in mid-August. Other yearly events include the Fall Foliage celebration and the yearly July 4 festivities, including the traditional tractor parade.

In September 2005, Peacham was designated &quot;Best New England Village&quot; by &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine, which wrote, &quot;Of all the villages in New England, Peacham (population 665) is unsurpassed.&quot;

<text>Ryegate is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,165 at the 2020 census. The town contains the villages of South Ryegate, East Ryegate, and Ryegate Corner.

==History==
One of the New Hampshire Grants, it was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on September 8, 1763. Granted to Richard Jenness and 93 others, it was named Ryegate, a variant spelling of Reigate in Surrey, England. The first settlers were Aaron Hosmer and his family. Sold to John Witherspoon and others, the southern half of town was purchased in 1773 by two agents for the Scotch American Company of Farmers from Renfrew and Lanark, Scotland, whose members began settlement in 1774.

The town had excellent soil for the cultivation of grains, vegetables and orchards. Streams teemed with salmon and trout. Hills and valleys provided pasturage for grazing sheep and cattle. Connected in 1847 to the Connecticut &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, the town by 1859 was noted for producing butter and leather. The Wells River supplied water power for one gristmill and five sawmills. In 1873, the Montpelier &amp; Wells River Railroad was completed. In 1890, a big brickyard opened; then in 1906, the Ryegate Paper Company began operation. But the town&#x27;s dominant industry was six granite quarries at Blue Mountain.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.80%, is water. Bounded on the east by the Connecticut River (the boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire), Ryegate is drained by the Wells River. Blue Mountain, the highest point in the town, has an elevation of above sea level.

The town is crossed by Interstate 91, U.S. Route 5, and U.S. Route 302. It is bordered by the town of Newbury to the south, Groton to the west, and Barnet to the north. To the east, across the Connecticut River lies Bath, New Hampshire.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,150 people, 435 households, and 324 families residing in the town. The population density was 31.4 people per square mile (12.1/km2). There were 564 housing units at an average density of 15.4 per square mile (6.0/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.35% White, 0.09% African American, 0.43% Native American, 0.35% Asian, and 0.78% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.17% of the population.

There were 435 households, out of which 31.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.8% were married couples living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.3% were non-families. 19.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 25.2% under the age of 18, 7.0% from 18 to 24, 24.6% from 25 to 44, 28.4% from 45 to 64, and 14.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 107.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $36,761, and the median income for a family was $41,607. Males had a median income of $26,875 versus $21,705 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,880. About 3.3% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.2% of those under age 18 and 5.2% of those age 65 or over.

== Education ==

The Blue Mountain Union School (BMU) serves students from the town of Ryegate and consists of Pre-K through grade 12 housed in one building. Total enrollment for the 2017–2018 school year was 419 students. BMU is located on Route 302 (Exit 17 off Interstate-91), just east from P &amp; H Truckstop.

The Blue Mountain Union School District was formed in November 1964 merging the Wells River Graded School District, the Groton Town School District, and the Ryegate Town School District. This merger resulted in the closing of five local schools: Groton School, Wells River School, South Ryegate School, Ryegate Corner School, and East Ryegate School. The merger also removed the option for high school choice in the town of Ryegate, in favor of attending the new union high school. Although the merger was approved in 1964, there was a lengthy legal battle regarding the formation of the district, and the new district did not operate a school building until 1970.

On July 1, 2018, the State Board of Education temporarily reassigned the Blue Mountain Union School District to Orange East Supervisory under the Act 46 school district consolidation law. Merger plans and implementation continue following lawsuits and local district votes. Blue Mountain is, now, a part of the Orange East Supervisory Union.

<text>Sutton is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 913 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Sutton was chartered on February 26, 1782, by the Vermont Legislature. Chartered as Billymead to Dr. Jonathan Arnold of Rhode Island and associates, and named for Arnold&#x27;s younger son, William. By 1810, townsfolk had had enough of Billy and his name due to his bullying and drunken behavior, and at a town meeting they voted overwhelmingly to change the name to Sutton.

Villages and hamlets in Sutton include Sutton, Sutton Depot, and Summit Siding. The population at the 2010 US Census was 1,029.

==Geography==
Sutton is located in northern Caledonia County. It is bordered by the town of Lyndon to the south, Wheelock to the southwest, Sheffield to the west, Barton to the northwest, Westmore to the north, Newark to the northeast, and Burke to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.51%, is water.

The highest point in Sutton is the summit of Mount Hor in the northern corner of town, with an elevation of above sea level. The modest elevation of this town gives it a slightly cooler and wetter climate than nearby towns such as St. Johnsbury. Annual snowfall averages well over 100 inches per year at the weather station in the center of town.

==Climate==

Sutton has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb), typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold winters. Exceptionally for such a small town, two NWS-certified weather stations have operated in the town for much of recent history. From January 1948 until spring 2017, the original station, located in a frost hollow at an altitude of about 1000 feet, reported data for the town. In January 2000, a new station was built in a hilly area a few miles away and at about 500 feet higher altitude. This station is still reporting today.

The two stations show distinct microclimates. At the valley station, a freeze has been recorded for every month of the year as well a temperature of at least . The newer station has a much shorter period of record, but NOAA also lists &quot;mean monthly maximum&quot; and &quot;mean monthly minimum&quot; temperatures, which are the highest and lowest temperatures one can expect in a typical month each year. From this one can see that the hill station has much less variability of temperature, with much less chance of frost during the warm months.
Four miles away on a hill, a recently built weather station has data for the period from 2000 to 2020 only. The daily temperature amplitude is smaller, with warmer lows and cooler highs. Yet, despite the higher elevation of the new station, its temperatures are slightly warmer than at the valley station. There is more rain and snow here, as well. 


==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,001 people, 366 households, and 270 families residing in the town. The population density was 26.2 people per square mile (10.1/km2). There were 439 housing units at an average density of 11.5 per square mile (4.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.60% White, 0.20% Native American, 0.20% Asian, 1.20% from other races, and 0.80% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.40% of the population.

There were 366 households, out of which 38.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.5% were married couples living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.2% were non-families. 18.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.10.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 29.8% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 27.9% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $36,750, and the median income for a family was $40,368. Males had a median income of $27,303 versus $25,000 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,564.

<text>Wheelock is a town in Caledonia County, Vermont, United States. The population was 759 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town was named after Eleazar Wheelock, the founder of Dartmouth College. Through a provision of the college dating to , any full-time resident of Wheelock who is accepted as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College may attend the school entirely free of tuition. Between the 1890s and 2025, ten Wheelock Scholars attended Dartmouth College.

Standing in the center of the village for many years was the old brick hotel, known as the Caledonia Spring House. In 1893, Myron D. Park, who served four years as a Wheelock selectman, sold the Caledonia Spring House to Marshall Way. The hotel was the site of a notorious murder on May 20, 1896, when owner Marshall Way killed his 44-year-old wife, Ellen Sheldon Way, in the dooryard. According to the St. Johnsbury &quot;Caledonian&quot; of May 22, 1896, &quot;The little town of Wheelock was thrown into a state of wild excitement last Wednesday evening when the cry went around that Marshall Way had killed his wife. It was a terrible shock to the people of the quiet town, and it may be many days before they recover sufficiently to converse to any length upon another subject.&quot;

After the murder, the Caledonia Spring House was sold to Alden J. Rennie, owner of several mills in Sutton, Sheffield, and Wheelock. The building was dismantled during the 1990s after falling into disrepair. It was moved to Peacham where it is being restored on private property.

Eleazar Wheelock&#x27;s grandson founded Wheelock, Texas in the early 1800s and named it after the original town in Vermont.

<text>Bolton is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,301 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is home to Bolton Valley, a popular ski resort.

The main road passing through the town is U.S. Route 2, which follows the north bank of the Winooski River. Interstate 89 also passes through the town, parallel to Route 2, but does not have an interchange there.

==Geography==

Bolton is located in eastern Chittenden County, bordered to the east by Washington County. The main crest of the Green Mountains runs north to south through the eastern part of the town, and the Winooski River, running east to west, cuts through the mountains south of the center of the town. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.65%, is water.

The town is predominantly rural. There are four principal settlements:
* Bolton proper is in the Winooski River valley, on the north side of the river.
* West Bolton is in the northwestern corner of the town, and is accessed primarily from the adjacent town of Jericho.
* A thin strip of land, known as &quot;the back side of the river&quot;, is located south of the Winooski River. The only road access is through the neighboring towns of Richmond and Duxbury.
* A small number of year-round residents live near the Bolton Valley ski area in the northeastern part of the town.

The Long Trail passes through Bolton on its way from Camel&#x27;s Hump to Mount Mansfield.

==Schools==

Bolton has its own elementary school (Pre-K to 4th grade). The Ellen P. Smilie Memorial School&#x27;s benefactor was Ellen Pinneo, born in 1849 in Pinneo Flats in Bolton. She attended the Pinneo Flats School, which was later destroyed by the flood of 1927. Ellen married Melville Smilie and moved to Montpelier where she lived for many years until her death on December 17, 1933. After the flood of 1927 washed away her old schoolhouse, she donated $1000 toward the rebuilding of another school on Pinneo Flats. In her will, she bequeathed a sum of money to the Memorial School. When I-89 was constructed through Bolton and cut off access to the Memorial School, it was demolished and in 1960 part of the present school was erected. In September 1999, a large addition was completed adding five new classrooms and a large gym to the existing building. A final gift was made that made it possible to enlarge the library facility and increase the number of books. The school is exceptional with a strong partnership with Smilie families and Townspeople.

On November 4, 2014, the communities of Bolton, Jericho, Richmond, Underhill ID and Underhill Town voted to form the Mount Mansfield Modified Union School District, also known as the MMMUSD. This new school district serves and governs the current town school districts of Bolton (Smilie Memorial School), Jericho (Jericho Elementary), Richmond (Richmond Elementary), Underhill ID School District (Underhill ID Elementary), Underhill Town (Underhill Central School), Mt Mansfield Union School District (Browns River Middle, Camels Hump Middle and Mt. Mansfield Union High Schools) in grades Pre-K through 12 and Huntington students grades 5–12.

<doc id="137283" wikidata="Q1955538" url="?curid=137283" title="Buels Gore, Vermont">
<text>Buels Gore is a gore in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. The population was 29 at the 2020 census, down from 30 in 2010. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

==Geography==
Buels Gore is located at the southern tip of Chittenden County, bordered by the town of Huntington to the north, Fayston in Washington County to the east, and Starksboro in Addison County to the west. The crest of the Green Mountains, followed by the Long Trail, runs through the eastern side of the gore, and Vermont Route 17 crosses the gore from east to west, cresting the mountains at Appalachian Gap.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Buels Gore has a total area of , of which , or 0.08%, is water.

==The name in history==

The gore was chartered by the Vermont General Assembly on November 4, 1780. It is named for Major Elias Buel (in some references &quot;Buell&quot;) who moved to Vermont from Coventry, Connecticut. With a group of would-be proprietors including Ira Allen and several Buel family members, the group petitioned the legislature for a grant. They received a grant for a town, intended to be called &quot;Coventry&quot; near Shoreham. Due to a surveying error there was almost no land left in the grant. The group returned to the legislature and received a &quot;flying grant&quot;, a sort of license which allowed a grant to be made on uncharted land that could be identified. As much of the state had by now been organized, they finally settled upon three unconnected pieces of land. The largest became the present town of Coventry in Orleans County. A second piece near Coventry was named &quot;Coventry Leg&quot; for its appendage shape. Coventry Leg was annexed to Newport in 1816. The final small piece, adjacent to Huntington, was called &quot;Huntington Gore&quot;, and renamed &quot;Buels Gore&quot;, despite Major Buel&#x27;s desire to call it &quot;Montzoar&quot;. All three charters were issued in October 1788, though dated back to 1780, the year of the original petition. Buel was charged retroactive taxes on the grant, a debt that only resolved by sale of all of his lands. He left Vermont to settle in New York.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 12 people, 6 households, and 4 families residing in the gore. The population density was 2.4 people per square mile (0.9/km2). There were 8 housing units at an average density of 1.6/sq mi (0.6/km2). The racial makeup of the gore was 100.00% White.

There were 6 households, out of which 16.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were couples living together and joined in either marriage or civil union, and 33.3% were non-families. 33.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.00 and the average family size was 2.50.

In the gore the population was spread out, with 8.3% under the age of 18, 8.3% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 33.3% from 45 to 64, and 25.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49 years. For every 100 females, there were 200.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 175.0 males.

The median income for a household in the gore was $39,583, and the median income for a family was $61,250. Males had a median income of $38,750 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the gore was $32,533. None of the population or families were below the poverty line.

==Bicycle racing==
Buels Gore and the summit of Appalachian Gap are the site for the finish of the Mad River Road Race which is stage 3 of the Green Mountain Stage Race road bicycle event. This final climb is considered one of the most scenic and challenging finishes for a bicycle race with grades near the summit of 18%. The Mad River Road race started in 1994 and became a stage in the Green Mountain Stage Race in 2000. Annually the event brings between 700-900 racers to the gore to compete.

<text>Essex is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. Vermont Route 289 crosses the town from east to west. The city of Essex Junction, with a population as of 2020 of 10,590, was located within the town as an incorporated village until 2022.

==History==

The town was incorporated on June 7, 1763, named after the Earl of Essex.

The Village of Essex Junction was formed within the town of Essex on November 15, 1892. The village was formed to provide additional services (such as sidewalks, water, and sewers) to its residents. The rural areas of the town did not want the services or the needed taxes.

As the town outside the village developed, it gradually added its own similar services, and by 1958, merger proposals appeared via voter petition. Over the years, various votes (often contentious) regarding a merger occurred in the village and the town, but never passing in both communities. - a requirement by the state legislature for a merger.

On November 7, 2006, a merger passed in both the town (as a whole) and village. The town as a whole (including the village) voted once on the merger, while the village, separately, voted in a second ballot to accept the merger if it passed the townwide vote. Complicating the matter, the regional paper misreported the merger failed based solely on results outside the village. The next day the correct results were reported in both the town&#x27;s paper, and as a correction in the regional paper.

On December 6, 2006, a petition to reconsider the merger was submitted to the town. The petition contained signatures totaling more than 5 percent of registered voters, the threshold required for a re-vote. The re-vote was held on January 23, 2007. Those results overturned the merger by 191 votes, rejecting the current merger proposal.

An approval result would have triggered a multi-year merger process creating a new &quot;Town of Essex Junction&quot; and replacing the current governments of the town of Essex and the village of Essex Junction.

On November 2, 2021, voters in the village of Essex Junction voted to separate from the town of Essex, citing an unfair tax burden. The vote was 3,070 to 411 in favor of separation. Essex Junction separated on July 1, 2022.

<text>Huntington is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,938 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was originally called &quot;New Huntington&quot;, but the name was changed to &quot;Huntington&quot; in October 1795. It was named for landholders Josiah, Charles and Marmaduke Hunt. 

The Huntington Lower Village Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Its predecessor church building, constructed in 1839 and later used as the town hall and fire department, was established by Black Baptist preacher Charles Bowles in 1839.

==Geography==
Huntington is in southeastern Chittenden County, bordered to the southwest by Addison County and to the east by Washington County. The town is located on the west side of the Green Mountains and is centered on the valley of the Huntington River, a north-flowing tributary of the Winooski River. The summit of Camel&#x27;s Hump is in Huntington&#x27;s northeast corner, on the town boundary with Duxbury.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Huntington has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.26%, is water. The village of Huntington is in the northwest part of the town, Huntington Center is centrally located, and Hanksville is in the south. All three villages lie along the Huntington River.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, there were 1,934 people, 789 households, and 526 families residing in the town. The population density was 50.9 people per square mile (19.7/km2). There were 853 housing units at an average density of 22.4 per square mile (8.6/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 92.6% White, 0.57% African American, 0.36% Native American, 0.52% Asian, 0.05% Native Hawaiian, 0.98% from other races, and 4.96% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.96% of the population.

As of the 2022 American Community Survey, there were 824 occupied housing units, out of which 44.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.4% were non-families. 22% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.24 and the average family size was 2.69.

The average age of the town&#x27;s inhabitants has increased in the past few decades, up to 45.9, compared to the rest of county, which is 36.7. Only 21.3% are under the age of 20, 2.8% from 20 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 38% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years.

==Climate==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Huntington has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Education==

Mount Mansfield Modified Union School District operates the community&#x27;s public schools.

When MMUUSD formed, Huntington residents had representation as the community sent its secondary students there, but Huntington continued to have its own elementary school district. Residents of Huntington resisted merging that district for a longer time, with four unsuccessful votes on merging into MMUUSD. At one point the state of Vermont passed Act 46 that obligated school districts to merge. The Huntington School District sued the state government to try to stop the merger. In 2018 the Huntington district filed its third lawsuit against mergers. On June 6, 2019, the vote to merge Huntington into Mount Mansfield succeeded on a 450–191 basis; the Chittenden East Supervisory Union dissolved as a result.

<text>Richmond is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 4,167. The main settlement of Richmond, in the north-central part of town, is a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 853 at the 2020 census; it was formerly an incorporated village.

==History==

In 1775, Amos Brownson and John Chamberlain made the first settlement attempt. They abandoned their efforts in the fall of that year, but returned in the spring of 1784, at the close of the Revolutionary War. Richmond was incorporated by the General Assembly on October 27, 1794, then organized in 1795. The Winooski River and Huntington River both offered locations for water mills. Industries began to manufacture wagons, harnesses, tinware, brass, cabinet work and woodenware. By 1859, the population was 1,453.

Richmond is noted for the Round Church, a rare 16-sided meetinghouse that was erected in 1812–1813. Originally designed to be a town meeting place and a Protestant church, today it is open to the public and a popular tourist destination.

=== Public health controversy ===
In October 2022, the town&#x27;s water superintendent resigned after admitting that he had, without notifying city officials, lowered the water&#x27;s fluoridation levels to less than half that recommended by the state to protect health. The superintendent confessed that he had done so since 2011 without seeking permission; the town&#x27;s water and sewer commission immediately voted to restore fluoridation to the levels recommended by public health authorities.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.59%, is water. Richmond is bisected by the Winooski River, with its tributary, the Huntington River, crossing the southeast corner of the town. Richmond is located in the western foothills of the Green Mountains.

The town is crossed by Interstate 89, with access from Exit 11 in the northwest part of town, by U.S. Route 2, and by the New England Central Railroad. A scenic view of Camel&#x27;s Hump and the foothills of the Green Mountains presents itself to southbound motorists around mile marker 80.2, as the interstate descends a 6% grade into Richmond.

==Education==

Local students attend Mount Mansfield Union High School, Camel&#x27;s Hump Middle School and Richmond Elementary School. Mount Mansfield Union High is in the neighboring town of Jericho. The MMU athletic teams are the Cougars, who play the teams of neighboring schools such as CVU.

On November 4, 2014, the communities of Bolton, Jericho, Richmond, Underhill ID and Underhill Town voted to form the Mount Mansfield Modified Union School District (MMMUSD). This new school district serves and governs the current town school districts of Bolton (Smilie Memorial School), Jericho (Jericho Elementary), Richmond (Richmond Elementary), Underhill ID School District (Underhill ID Elementary), Underhill Town (Underhill Central School), Mt Mansfield Union School District (Browns River Middle, Camels Hump Middle and Mt. Mansfield Union High Schools) students in Pre-K through grade 12, and Huntington students in grades 5–12.

<text>Shelburne is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. Located along the shores of Lake Champlain, Shelburne&#x27;s town center lies approximately south of the city center of Burlington, the most populous city in the U.S. state of Vermont. As of the 2020 census, the population of Shelburne was 7,717.

The main settlement of Shelburne in the center of town is a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 6,178 at the 2020 census. Shelburne municipality has the highest median income in both Chittenden County and the Burlington metropolitan area.

==History==
Shelburne was chartered by New Hampshire, August 18, 1763, to Jesse Hallock and 64 associates by governor Benning Wentworth. The name &quot;Shelburne&quot; or &quot;Shelburn&quot; was chosen to honor William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, a celebrated nobleman of the British parliament and Prime Minister. According to the charter, the town was to have an area of , or a tract a little over , but owing to a blunder on the part of the surveyors, it was shorn of a large portion of its possessions.

From the beginning, Shelburne&#x27;s economy was based on farming. With the clearing of land and burning of logs the town experienced a potash boom. A carding and fulling mill, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a blacksmith shop were erected on the La Platte River at Shelburne Falls. In 1811, a few Merino sheep imported from Spain led to an upsurge in sheep raising. Orchards and fruit growing became a major source of income for the farmers, with some 17,740 trees in 1880. Following the War of 1812, commerce on the lake expanded rapidly.

The Lake Champlain Transportation Company established its shipyard at Shelburne Harbor and launched its first steamboat, the &quot;General Green,&quot; in 1825; this was followed by ten others before the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; in 1906. In 1955, the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; was moved overland to the Shelburne Museum, where it is now on display.

Harvey Brook, Cranes Brook, and Mill Brook draining from other hillsides within the town also converge with the Browns River in Underhill Center.

The town of Underhill contains two villages, Underhill Flats (shown on maps as &quot;Underhill&quot;) and Underhill Center. Both villages have U.S. post office buildings and are enumerated with ZIP codes 05489 (Underhill or Underhill Flats) and 05490 (Underhill Center).

Underhill Flats is located on the western side of the town along the Vermont Route 15 corridor, and is a shared jurisdiction with the adjacent town of Jericho. This area is otherwise known as the Underhill Incorporated District (i.e. Underhill ID) and includes the Riverside settlement in Jericho as well as the Flats settlement in Underhill. The Incorporated District was a unique authorization created by the Vermont legislature. It was listed as a designated historic Village Center; the Riverside Village Center by the former Department of Housing and Community Affairs (now known as the Agency of Commerce and Community Development) in 2010. The United Church of Underhill Presbyterian Church, and the Underhill-Jericho main fire station are located on the Underhill side of the district. The majority of the district&#x27;s geographic area lies within the Town of Jericho.
Underhill Center is an unincorporated village (i.e. not a legally defined entity) located around the intersection of River Road and Pleasant Valley Road, on the eastern side of the town closer to the foot of Mount Mansfield. Located within the village area are the Town Hall and municipal offices, the town hall park, a recreation area (with tennis courts, half-court for basketball, and a small swimming pond), Casey&#x27;s Hill (a municipally owned sledding hill), and the St. Thomas Catholic Church.

==Education==

Underhill Independent Elementary school tested best in the county in reading proficiency in the New England Common Assessment Program test in 2008. Underhill Central stood first in math proficiency.

On November 4, 2014, the communities of Bolton, Jericho, Richmond, Underhill ID and Underhill Town voted to form the Mount Mansfield Modified Union School District also known as the MMMUSD. 
This new school district serves and governs the current town school districts of Bolton (Smilie Memorial School), Jericho (Jericho Elementary), Richmond (Richmond Elementary), Underhill ID School District (Underhill ID Elementary), Underhill Town (Underhill Central School) and Mt Mansfield Union School District (Browns River Middle, Camels Hump Middle and Mt. Mansfield Union High Schools) in grades Pre-K through 12 and Huntington students grades 5–12.

<text>Westford is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,062 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area that is today described as Westford, Vermont originally fell within the traditional territories of the Sokoki, Missisquoi, and Cowasuck bands of the Western Abenaki tribes. Newly introduced infectious diseases and attacks by English settlers greatly impacted native populations and prompted their emigration to Quebec by the 1670s, opening the land for settlement by European immigrants. The original charter for the Town of Westford was granted at a cost of by New Hampshire&#x27;s provisional governor Benning Wentworth on June 8, 1763, as part of a series of what came to be known as New Hampshire Grants. According to Wentworth&#x27;s grant, six lots were set aside (3 for religious use, 1 for the town&#x27;s school, and 2 for Wentworth himself) and the remainder of the land was subdivided among the founding residents. Although officially granted simultaneously with Underhill and Mansfield, the description of Westford&#x27;s territory is recognized as having been set down earlier due to the fact that their territorial boundaries are defined in relation to Westford&#x27;s. From their founding, both Westford and Underhill shared many of the same grantees, and settlement between the two towns occurred in concert with families such as the Macombers living in Westford but conducting business on Underhill&#x27;s Mount Macomber.

Governor Wentworth&#x27;s land grants in the area that is today Vermont were considered controversial at the time and since the early 1750s New York, which also laid claim to the area, had challenged the validity of town charters granted by Wentworth. Between 1764 and 1770, in a series of legal decisions handed down by England&#x27;s Board of Trade and the New York Supreme Court of Judicature, New York was found to be the proper jurisdictional body for the area and Wentworth&#x27;s charters were invalidated. New York immediately began redistricting the area by land patent, putting Westford within the now-extinct Charlotte County (formed 1772), and requiring residents to repurchase their land from New York in order to retain legal title. The residents of Westford (together with residents of the other New Hampshire Grant towns) protested this ruling and petitioned New York for the confirmation of Wentworth&#x27;s town grants. In response New York declared that it would halt further subdivision of settled areas until clarification of King George III&#x27;s intent was made clear. Before such clarification could be made, the American Revolutionary War (1775) interrupted matters and shortly afterward in 1777, Vermont seceded from New York and England to form the Republic of Vermont. New York&#x27;s redistricting was forgotten and Westford solidified its position as a town within Vermont&#x27;s western County of Bennington (founded in 1779, and later splitting the area containing Westford into Rutland in 1781, Addison in 1785, and ultimately Chittenden County in 1787). Westford would remain part of Chittenden County during the state&#x27;s 1791 entrance to the United States as its 14th state and through to the present.

==Geography==
Westford is in northern Chittenden County, bordered by Franklin and Lamoille counties to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.53%, is water. Prominent waterways include Westford Pond, Pond Brook, Rogers Brook, and the Browns River (on the east), as well as Morgan Brook (in the town&#x27;s center) and Beaver Brook (in the northeast near Cloverdale). The town has a number of named hills including those named after prominent families (e.g. Duffy and Stewart), and others named descriptively (e.g. Oak, Beech, Spruce, Bald, and Prospect). In her bicentennial work, &quot;Vermont Place-Names&quot;, historian Esther Munroe Swift suggests that some of the more abstract names of Westford&#x27;s hills may closely reflect the sentiments of the original English settlers. Swift notes that the process of subdividing down to individual lots was often done in stages with the first few lots representing land suitable for dwellings and tillage, the second group of lots representing pasture land, and the third group representing land suitable only for logging. Swift points to hills like Westford&#x27;s Number Eleven Hill (never renamed from its original lot number) and Jack Lot Hill as examples of hills whose names reflect the dissatisfaction of their owners with the quality of land.

The town of Westford contains two villages: Brookside (centered in the bend of Rogers Brook along Maple Tree Lane and Brookside Road), and Westford (commonly known as Westford Center and centered on the Westford Commons). Smaller communities include the hamlet of Cloverdale (located near Vermont Route 15 in Westford&#x27;s northeast corner), Osgood Hill where early settler Manassah Osgood first settled, Bowman&#x27;s Corners just south of Brookside, and the historic communities along the northern border with Fairfax, which developed in response to the early industry along the Lamoille River from Fairfax Falls to what is now Fairfax village where the Mill Brook forge was located.

===Industry===
The town&#x27;s first industrial center was located in the Village of Brookside, an area bounded on three sides by the Rogers Brook. Historic maps of the area show that at the turn of the 20th century (between 1893 and 1910), Brookside featured a post office, cheese plant, and cheese box factory all run by the Rogers family. Other businesses flourished along the northern town line with Fairfax, where the Mill Brook forge worked iron ore mined in Colchester from 1796 until its closure in 1810, and in the Hamlet of Cloverdale which developed surrounding the Cloverdale Creamery and freight station on the Burlington and Lamoille Railroad running between Burlington and Cambridge.

Today Westford is home to Rovers North, A Land Rover parts dealer that employs over 20 people, Morgan Brook Farm/Wagyu Wagon, and Kickback Brewery. Professional services, agribusinesses, transportation and construction companies make up the greatest number of commercial concerns.

<text>Williston is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. Originally rural and laid out with many farms, in recent decades it has developed into a thriving suburb of Burlington, the largest city in the state of Vermont. As of the 2020 census, the population of Williston was 10,103, an increase of over 1,000 people since the 2010 census. Williston is one of the fastest-growing towns in Vermont, and while becoming more populated, it has also developed as a major retail center for the Burlington area as well as much of central and northern Vermont. The town has a National Register Historic District in its unincorporated central village. 

==History==

The town was chartered in the New Hampshire Grants in 1763 as a grant from Governor Benning Wentworth of the colony of New Hampshire. It was named for Samuel Willis, a New York merchant who was one of the original 65 grantees, though he never visited the town that was named in his honor.

A private, boarding high school, Pine Ridge, was founded in 1968 to serve learning-disabled students. It closed in June 2009.

The town is notable for its fine and well preserved central collection of brick nineteenth century civic and religious buildings including the &quot;old Brick Church&quot; of 1832, considered one of Vermont&#x27;s finest country Gothic churches; the former Universalist Church, now the Town Hall, of 1860; the former Methodist Church of 1848, now the Town Annex; former Town Hall of approximately 1840. Also is the regal Federated Church of 1867, formerly the Methodist Episcopal Church, designed by noted Boston architect John Stevens. On the western side of the town, bordering South Burlington, is Vermont&#x27;s largest mercantile development with numerous &quot;big box&quot; stores and other commercial activities, making it a destination from all over the region.

The town was also the home of several generations of the Chittenden family, for whom the surrounding county, Vermont&#x27;s most populous, is named. A number of beautiful original Chittenden family homes still stand in the town. Thomas Chittenden, the President of the Vermont Republic, and first governor of the state had his home in Williston and is buried in the central cemetery, with a prominent memorial.

===Events===
During the night of July 7, 1984, an Amtrak train with 287 people aboard hit a landslide and derailed, killing five people and injuring about two hundred.

<text>Winooski is a city in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. Located on the Winooski River, as of the 2020 U.S. census the municipal population was 7,997. The city is the most densely populated municipality in northern New England, an area comprising the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. It is the smallest of Vermont&#x27;s 10 cities by area, though the city of Vergennes has the smallest population. As part of the Burlington, Vermont metropolitan area, it is bordered by Burlington, Colchester, and South Burlington.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2), of which 0.1 sq mi (0.2 km2) (5.30%) is covered by water.

===Etymology===

As early as 750 CE, the Abenaki tribe lived along the shores of a cascading waterfall in a fertile river valley they called &quot;Winoskitegw&quot;, meaning “land of the wild onion&quot;. Winooski&#x27;s southern border is formed by the Winooski River, which is alternatively known as the Onion River.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian===
About 5000 years ago, a single family of paleolithic Native Americans came to what is now the city. The prehistoric campground for this transient group is one of Vermont&#x27;s significant archaeological sites. Other native people came to Winooski in the years that followed.

===Colonial===
Situated on a main road, Winooski most likely started as a rest stop for travelers. With a set of waterfalls to assist the growth of industry, however, it soon also became a center for wool processing.

In the early 1770s, Ira Allen constructed a blockhouse on the Winooski (then &quot;Onion&quot;) River, which served both as a fort and as general store and office for the land-speculating Onion River Company. Fort Frederick was never used for defense, but its presence increased the value of Onion River property and promoted settlement.

===Post-colonial===

After the Revolutionary War, Ira Allen built a dam across the river with a sawmill at each end.

In the late 1830s, the Burlington Mill Company used the river&#x27;s power for the manufacture of yarns and cloth.

In 1846, James and Lucinda Stone from Winooski settled in Sheboygan County in the Wisconsin Territory and named their new settlement Winooski, Wisconsin.

===Modern times===

The American Woolen Company purchased the failing Burlington Mills in 1901, restoring a measure of economic growth to the area. This success eventually led Winooski to incorporate as a city in 1922, breaking away from the town of Colchester.

The mills closed in 1954, resulting in two decades of economic problems for the city. In the 1980s, two old mills were converted into commercial, office, and apartment space, helping to revitalize the area.

In 1979, the city researched the construction of a dome over the entire city of Winooski, to reduce heating costs during the winter. The proposed dome would have been at the center, and internal combustion engines would have been banned. Though the dome was never built, in 2009 the city&#x27;s planner defended the concept, insisting, &quot;Economically, it&#x27;s a slam dunk,&quot; and adding, &quot;You could have had year-round fly-fishing.&quot;

In 2008, the city dismissed their city manager of 11 months, while he was still an at-will employee. His contract had been scheduled for three years.

==Government==
The mayor of the city is Kristine Lott, who is the first elected female mayor in Winooski&#x27;s history.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 U.S. census, 7,267 people and 3,252 households were residing in the city. The population density was 5,191 people per square mile (1,964.1/km2).

<text>Averill is an unincorporated town in Essex County, Vermont, United States. The town was named for Samuel Averill, a landholder. The town was never formally incorporated, having never gained a large enough permanent population. The population was 21 at the 2020 census. The town&#x27;s affairs are handled by the Unified Towns &amp; Gores of Essex County. It is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire Vermont Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Averill was originally chartered in 1762 as part of the Province of New Hampshire on the behalf of Royal Governor Benning Wentworth. Averill consisted of twenty three thousand and forty acres of land, which was divided among seventy equal shares, with the stipulation that the grantees must cultivate a tenth of their land within five years, and that all pine trees fit for ship masts must be preserved for that purpose. The first settlers arrived in the 1830s, and in 1840 the town had 11 residents. In the 1870s a sawmill was built in the neighboring town of Norton, which led to a rise in population to 48 residents in 1880. The Averill Lumber Co. formed in the 1880s, and operated a mill on the east side of Great Averill Lake until it burned down in 1898.

==Geography==
Averill is in northern Essex County, bordered by Canaan to the northeast, Lemington to the southeast, Bloomfield at the southernmost point, Lewis on the southwest, Averys Gore to the west, and Norton to the northwest. The northern corner of Averill is less than south of the Canada–US border.

Vermont Route 114 crosses the northern tip of the town, leading east to Canaan village and west to Norton. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.40%, is water. The town includes Great Averill Pond, Little Averill Pond, and Forest Lake. The highest point in the town is an unnamed summit along the border with Lemington in the southeast.

===Climate===
The Averill weather station is near the northern edge of Great Averill Pond, just south of the border with Canada. Averill has a humid continental climate(Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) influences. Its far northern location and relatively high elevation of , means it has some of the coldest weather in Vermont. The daily average temperature stays below freezing for five months, with high levels of snowfall as well. The climate is very similar to the nearby places Island Pond and First Connecticut Lake.

==Government==
Averill, along with the unorganized towns of Lewis and Ferdinand, as well as the unincorporated areas of Avery&#x27;s Gore, Warren&#x27;s Gore, and Warner&#x27;s Grant, had no local governance. In 2000, a representative Board of Governors (three members) was elected to replace the former Essex County Supervisor system.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 8 people, 3 households, and 2 families residing in the town. The population density was 0.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.1/km2). There were 192 housing units at an average density of . The census also indicates that the racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White, and that 11.1% of the population spoke French at home due largely to the town&#x27;s proximity to the Province of Quebec.

There were 3 households, out of which one had children under the age of 18 living with them, two were married couples living together, and one was a non-family. One household was made up of individuals who were 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.50.

In the town, the population was spread out, with two people under the age of 18, one from 18 to 24, two from 25 to 44, one from 45 to 64, and two people who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. There were three males and five females, out of which two were under the age of 18.

The median income for a household in the town was $27,500, and the median income for a family was $28,750. Males had a median income of $21,250 versus $13,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $9,876. None of the population or families were below the poverty line.

Averill contains two lakes—Big Averill Lake (sometimes notated on maps as Great Averill pond) and Little Averill Lake. Big Averill is a relatively large, rectangular lake about 2 miles long and 0.7 miles wide. One side of the lake (Cottage Road) is outfitted with electrical power, and the backside (Jackson Road) is not wired for electricity. Little Averill lies 1,000 yards to the southwest of Big Averill.

Guildhall was chartered by New Hampshire&#x27;s colonial governor, Benning Wentworth, in 1761. Its grantees and original settlers were from Lancaster and Lunenburg, Massachusetts, and they named towns on opposite sides of the Connecticut River in New Hampshire and Vermont for their Massachusetts hometowns. The southern part of the original town of Lunenburg, Vermont was chartered as Lunenburg in 1763, while the northern portion was renamed Guildhall.

After Guildhall was chartered, a small group of settlers built temporary cabins and camps and began to clear the land. As the population began to grow, the first recorded town meeting took place in 1783. Guildhall is heavily wooded, as are several other towns in Essex County, and lumbering was once a major portion of the local economy. The Guildhall Village Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The district includes Guildhall&#x27;s village center and encompasses the central common and several nearby buildings.

==History==

===The railroad===

Island Pond became an important railroad center in 1853 when the Grand Trunk Railway established international connections between Montreal, Quebec, and Portland, Maine. The half-way point in the Portland-Montreal railroad line, this town became a booming railroad center with a roundhouse, shops, and all the facilities associated with train operations. In 1923 the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada was bankrupt and taken over by the Canadian government and operated as the Canadian National Railways. With the Canadian government directing the railroad, political considerations soon outweighed the economics of the railroad; commerce was displaced from the port of Portland to the Canadian ports of Halifax and St. John. The importance of the Portland line then began a decline which was never to be reversed. Island Pond&#x27;s days as a major railroad town were over by the late 1950s due to the elimination of steam locomotives. By 1960 passenger train service to Portland had ended, and three years later the diesel locomotive shop was closed. In 1966 barely a skeleton staff of people worked in Island Pond after the roundhouse closed. Canadian National continued to operate freight service to Portland until 1988; the following year the line was sold to a short line operator, the St. Lawrence &amp; Atlantic Railroad, which provides service to this day.

===The Twelve Tribes===
Island Pond became the home of the Twelve Tribes when the religious movement relocated to Island Pond from Tennessee in 1977. The group, led by Yoneq Gene Spriggs, sought shelter from the opposition it met elsewhere, although it continually faced opposition which culminated in the Island Pond raid in 1984 where state police and state social workers seized 112 children due to allegations of child abuse. The children were returned the same day upon a determination that the raid was unconstitutional, and no trial was held on the evidence of abuse the state found. Nevertheless, the &quot;Island Pond Raid&quot; retains its notoriety.

===Traffic enforcement===
In 2007, Brighton Constable Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Miller&#x27;s strict enforcement of traffic regulations became the subject of nationwide coverage. In 2006 alone, 1,224 tickets and 1,662 warnings were issued.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 849 people, 374 households, and 228 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 203/mi2 (78.4/km2). There were 556 housing units at an average density of 132.9/mi2 (51.4/km2).

<text>Lewis is a town in Essex County, Vermont, United States. The town was named for landholders Nathan, Sevignior, and Timothy Lewis. Although incorporated by the state, the town was never formally organized, since it never gained a sufficiently large permanent population. For most of the 20th century, the town had a total population of zero. It reported a population of 2 at the 2020 census; however it is possible due to the town sharing a census block with nearby towns and gores and the introduction of differential privacy in for the 2020 census, that the actual population remained at 0. Indeed, 100% of the town&#x27;s land that is not federally protected is owned by a single logging company, Weyerhaeuser. The town&#x27;s affairs are handled by the Unified Towns &amp; Gores Of Essex County.

<text>Warner&#x27;s Grant (alternatively Warners Grant or Warner&#x27;s Gore) is a gore located in Essex County, Vermont, United States. At the 2020 Census, the grant had a total population of 0. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited). Warner&#x27;s Grant is named after Seth Warner, a leader of the Green Mountain Boys.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the grant has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
The population was zero at the 2020 census. The gore has been uninhabited since at least 1970.

==Proper name==
Sources are inconsistent on whether the name is, properly, &quot;Warner&#x27;s Grant&quot; or &quot;Warners Grant&quot; (i.e., with the apostrophe or without), and some sources list it as &quot;Warner&#x27;s Gore&quot;. The likely reason is the standard removal of the apostrophe from nearly all US place names by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names on its inception in 1890.

The original charter (as reproduced in &quot;State Papers of Vermont, Volume Two: Charters Granted by the State of Vermont&quot;, VT Secretary of State, 1922, pp 206–7) merely mentions the boundaries of the tract of land. The land was granted to Hester Warner, the widow of Col. Seth Warner (one of the leaders of the Green Mountain Boys), and Seth Warner&#x27;s other heirs. While the name&#x27;s origin, honoring Seth Warner, is clear, the charter does nothing to specify precise usage.

&quot;State Papers of Vermont, Volume One: Index to the Papers of the Surveyors-General&quot; (VT Secretary of State, 1918) lists it as &quot;Warner&#x27;s Grant or Warner&#x27;s Gore&quot; (p. 154).

The Vermont Statutes mention the grant in at least three places, each time using the term &quot;Warner&#x27;s Grant&quot; (Title 17, Chapter 34, Section 1893; T. 24, Ch. 1, Sec. 6; and T. 24, Ch. 117, Sec. 4341(e)).

The &quot;Gazetteer of Caledonia and Essex Counties, VT, 1764-1887&quot; (Hamilton Child, 1887) lists the name as Warner&#x27;s Grant&quot; (p. 490).

However, &quot;The Vermont Road Atlas and Guide&quot; (Northern Cartographic, 1989) uses &quot;Warners Grant&quot; (p. 63), as do &quot;Vermont Place-Names: Footprints of History&quot; by Esther M. Swift (The Stephen Greene Press, 1977, pp 220–2), and the &quot;Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer&quot; (Delorme, 9th ed., 1996, p. 55).

<text>Warren&#x27;s Gore (or Warrens Gore or Warren Gore) is a gore in Essex County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2 at the 2020 census, down from 4 at the 2010 census. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited). Warren&#x27;s Gore is part of the Berlin, NH–VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Warren&#x27;s Gore was originally chartered to be part of the town of Warren on October 20, 1789. The charter provided for two tracts of land, one which became the town and the other which became the gore. They were almost 100 miles from each other, on opposite sides of the state. Why they were chartered together is still uncertain, but it is possible that this was due to the tract of land for the grant that became the town of Warren being smaller than most; the inclusion of the gore would therefore have been a tactic to increase the total land area. The tract that became the gore has been treated as separate from the town since its inception. The charter referred to the two tracts collectively as &quot;a Township by the name of Warren&quot;.

While the place was known as Warren&#x27;s Gore, including in Vermont state statutes, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names eschews the use of apostrophes in geographic names, which may improperly imply personal possession. This has led to the use of both Warrens Gore and Warren Gore as well. The &quot;Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer&quot; (Delorme, 9th ed., 1996) uses &quot;Warren Gore&quot; on the relevant map (p. 55) but also uses &quot;Warrens Gore&quot; (with no apostrophe) for the gore&#x27;s entry in the index (p. 7).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the gore has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.26%, is water. The gore contains the majority of Norton Pond, the source of the Coaticook River, which flows north into Quebec. Less than one mile south of Norton Pond is the source of the Pherrins River, which flows south to Island Pond and is part of the Clyde River (Lake Memphremagog) watershed.

Vermont Route 114 passes through Warrens Gore, leading north to Norton and south to Island Pond.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 10 people, 4 households, and 4 families residing in the gore. The population density was . There were 43 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the gore was 100.00% white.

There were 4 households, out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 100.0% were married couples living together, and 0.0% were non-families. No households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 2.50.

In the gore the population was spread out, with 20.0% under the age of 18, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 30.0% from 45 to 64, and 20.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years.

<text>Bakersfield is a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,273 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Bakersfield is located in southeastern Franklin County, bordered by Lamoille County to the southeast. Vermont Route 108 passes through the center of town, leading north to Enosburg Falls and south to Jeffersonville. The unincorporated village of Bakersfield is in the center of the town. Vermont Route 36 leads west from VT 108 in the village center to St. Albans, the Franklin County seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Bakersfield has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.24%, is water. The town is part of the Missisquoi River watershed, draining to Lake Champlain. The Cold Hollow Mountains occupy the eastern end of the town, with a high point of just north of the Lamoille County line.

==History==
===Early years===
The town history began when Joseph Baker of Westborough, Massachusetts, the namesake for the village, bought 10,000 acres in 1791. Initial settlers were his son-in-law, Stephen Maynard, and his nephew Jonas Brigham, along with their families. Baker built grist and saw mills on Baker&#x27;s Pond in 1794. Two years later Maynard built a tavern. In 1797, a school was established in a log cabin at the Post Road and Vermont 108. Five acres were deeded for the development of a town common and burying ground in 1804 by Joseph Baker. Maynard built a Federal style house north of the village to serve as the first post office in 1811.

There were 12 school geographically accessible districts in Bakersfield in 1839, due to the growth in the area. The town had grown to 1,258 residents in 1840.

===Academies===

The settlement has been called an &quot;old academy town&quot; for the schools for college-bound students. Public speaking was encouraged for boys. The Bakersfield Academic Association was established in 1839, which built a three-story building to house a Methodist church and the South Academy. It was the first building for Bakersfield Academy, which opened in 1840. Jacob Spaulding was hired as headmaster and Mary, his wife, was a drawing instructor and preceptress. In 1851, there were 271 students from New England, other parts of the United States, and Quebec. They had a staff of 14 people. The academy suffered a loss of reputation when Spaulding left the school in 1852 to become a principal for Barre and its well-endowed academy.

In 1844 by Methodists wanted an academy on the north end of town. Unofficially called North Academy, the principal was Rev. H.J. Moore from northern New York. The academies closed after a loss of students due to westward expansion, the creation of central public high schools, and the American Civil War. In 1870, there were 70 students at Bakersfield Academy. Bakersfield Academy is no longer in existence.

Brigham Academy was built in 1879, with funding provided by Peter Bent Brigham, who left a $30,000 endowment for education, and his sister Sarah Brigham Jacobs who provided land and a $100,000 endowment for the academy. It was staffed by Jacob Spaulding, Rev. Dr. Wright from Bakersfield and of Oberlin College, and President Buckham of the University of Vermont. In 1900, an addition provided additional classroom, laboratories, and a gymnasium. Notable people who attended the academy include Warren Austin, the first U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a U.S. senator and members of the Austin family of Highgate. In 1967, it closed as a high school. It continued to offer elementary and middle school education until 1987.

<doc id="137327" wikidata="Q194195" url="?curid=137327" title="Amusement park">
<text>An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, and events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.

Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens, and large picnic areas, which were created for people&#x27;s recreation. World&#x27;s fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry. 

Bakken (&quot;The Hill&quot;) in Klampenborg, Denmark, Wurstelprater in Vienna, Austria, and Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark are the three oldest operating amusement parks in the world. Lake Compounce, which opened in 1846, is considered the oldest, continuously operating amusement park in North America.

==History==

===Origins===

The amusement park evolved from traditions in the European Middle Ages. An amusement park is a contemporary arrangement, designed to combine components of a fair, carnival, and theme park. An early example of an amusement park is the Bartholomew Fair. By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses, where the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring, and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through menageries.

A wave of innovation in the 1860s and 1870s created mechanical rides, such as the steam-powered carousel (built by Thomas Bradshaw, at the Aylsham Fair), and its derivatives, notably from Frederick Savage of King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk whose fairground machinery was exported all over the world; his &quot;galloping horses&quot; innovation is seen in carousels today. This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride, as the working classes were increasingly able to spend their surplus wages on entertainment.

The second influence was the pleasure garden. Bakken (&quot;The Hill&quot;), the world&#x27;s oldest amusement park, opened in mainland Europe in 1583. It is located north of Copenhagen in Klampenborg, Denmark.

Another example is early garden was the Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661, in London. By the late 18th century, the site had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted for romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing amusement. Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great social diversity. Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered music, dancing, and animal acrobatics displays.

Prater, located in Vienna, Austria, began as a royal hunting ground which was opened in 1766 for public enjoyment. There followed coffee-houses and cafés, which led to the beginnings of the Wurstelprater as an amusement park.

The concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world&#x27;s fairs. The first World fair began in 1851 with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London, England. The purpose of the exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was designed to educate and entertain the visitors.
In the United States, cities and businesses also saw the world&#x27;s fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial success. The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois was an early precursor to the modern amusement park. The fair was an enclosed site, that merged entertainment, engineering and education to entertain the masses. It set out to bedazzle the visitors, and successfully did so with a blaze of lights from the &quot;White City.&quot; To make sure that the fair was a financial success, the planners included a dedicated amusement concessions area called the Midway Plaisance. Rides from this fair captured the imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the world, such as the first steel Ferris wheel, which was found in many other amusement areas, such as the Prater by 1896. Also, the experience of the enclosed ideal city with wonder, rides, culture and progress (electricity), was based on the creation of an illusory place.

The &quot;midway&quot; introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks, fairs, carnivals, and circuses. The midway contained not only the rides, but other concessions and entertainments such as shooting galleries, penny arcades, games of chance, and shows.

===Trolley parks and pleasure resorts===

Many modern amusement parks evolved from earlier pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public for day-trips or weekend holidays, for example, seaside areas such as Blackpool, United Kingdom and Coney Island, United States. In the United States, some amusement parks grew from picnic groves established along rivers and lakes that provided bathing and water sports, such as Lake Compounce in Connecticut, first established as a picturesque picnic park in 1846, and Riverside Park in Massachusetts, founded in the 1870s along the Connecticut River.

The trick was getting the public to the seaside or resort location. For Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, on the Atlantic Ocean, a horse-drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829. In 1875, a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad, and in 1876 two million visited Coney Island. Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper classes and the working class at the beach. The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first roller coaster, the &quot;Switchback Railway&quot;, in 1884.
In England, Blackpool was a popular beachside location beginning in the 1700s. It rose to prominence as a seaside resort with the completion in 1846 of a branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main Preston and Wyre Joint Railway line. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, provided the motivation for entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.
In 1879, large parts of the promenade at Blackpool were wired. The lighting and its accompanying pageants reinforced Blackpool&#x27;s status as the North of England&#x27;s most prominent holiday resort, and its specifically working class character. It was the forerunner of the present-day Blackpool Illuminations. By the 1890s, the town had a population of 35,000, and could accommodate 250,000 holidaymakers. The number of annual visitors, many staying for a week, was estimated at three million.

In the final decade of the 19th century, electric trolley lines were developed in many large American cities. Companies that established the trolley lines also developed trolley parks as destinations of these lines. Trolley parks such as Atlanta&#x27;s Ponce de Leon Park, or Reading&#x27;s Carsonia Park were initially popular natural leisure spots before local streetcar companies purchased the sites, expanding them from picnic groves to include regular entertainments, mechanical amusements, dance halls, sports fields, boat rides, restaurants and other resort facilities.
Some of these parks were developed in resort locations, such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey and New York. A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City, a famous vacation resort. Entrepreneurs erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean. The first of several was the Ocean Pier in 1891, followed later by the Steel Pier in 1898, both of which boasted rides and attractions typical of that time, such as Midway-style games and electric trolley rides. The boardwalk also had the first Roundabout installed in 1892 by William Somers, a wooden predecessor to the Ferris Wheel. Somers installed two others in Asbury Park, New Jersey and Coney Island, New York.

Another early park was the Eldorado Amusement Park that opened in 1891 on the banks of the Hudson River, overlooking New York City. It consisted of 25 acres.

===Modern amusement parks===

The first permanent enclosed entertainment area, regulated by a single company, was founded in Coney Island in 1895: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island in Brooklyn. This park was one of the first to charge admission fee to get into the park in addition to sell tickets for rides within the park.

In 1897, Sea Lion Park was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that opened in the Coney Island area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and entertainment. The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park. Coney Island also featured Luna Park (1903) and Dreamland (1904). Coney Island was a huge success and by the year 1910 attendance on days could reach a million people. Fueled by the efforts of Frederick Ingersoll who borrowed the name, other &quot;Luna Parks&quot; were quickly erected worldwide and opened to rave reviews.

The first amusement park in England, Blackpool Pleasure Beach, opened in 1896, developed by W. G. Bean. In 1904, Sir Hiram Maxim&#x27;s Captive Flying Machine was introduced; he had designed an early aircraft powered by steam engines that had been unsuccessful and instead opened up a pleasure ride of flying carriages that revolved around a central pylon. Other rides included the &#x27;Grotto&#x27; (a fantasy ride), &#x27;River Caves&#x27; (a scenic railway), water chutes and a tobogganing tower.

Fire was a constant threat in those days, as much of the construction within the amusement parks of the era was wooden. In 1911, Dreamland was the first Coney Island amusement park to completely burn down; in 1944, Luna Park also burned to the ground. Most of Ingersoll&#x27;s Luna Parks were similarly destroyed, usually by arson, before his death in 1927.

===20th century===

During the Gilded Age, many Americans began working fewer hours and had more disposable income. With new-found money and time to spend on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment. Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic opportunity. These parks served as a source of fantasy and escape from real life. By the early 1900s, hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many cities. Parks like Atlanta&#x27;s Ponce de Leon and Idora Park, near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world&#x27;s fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American Gilded Age was, in fact, amusement parks&#x27; Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s.

The Golden Age of amusement parks also included the advent of the kiddie park. Founded in 1925, the original Kiddie Park is located in San Antonio, Texas, and is still in operation . The kiddie parks became popular all over America after World War II.

This era saw the development of new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders. By the end of World War I, people seemed to want an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters. Although the development of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance. The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.
In England, Dreamland Margate opened in 1880 with Frederick Savage&#x27;s carousel the first amusement ride installed. In 1920 the Scenic Railway rollercoaster opened to the public with great success, carrying half a million passengers in its first year. The park also installed other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip and the River Caves. A ballroom was constructed on the site of the Skating Rink in 1920 and in 1923 a Variety Cinema was built on the site. Between 1920 and 1935 over £500,000 was invested in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland Cinema complex in 1934 which stands to this day.

Until 2011, the Blackpool Pleasure Beach ranked among the top free of charge attractions in Britain. Blackpool Pleasure beach was developed continuously, requiring frequent large-scale investments. The construction of many new rides could be counted on. Rides included the Virginia Reel, Whip, Noah&#x27;s Ark, Big Dipper and Dodgems. In the 1920s the &quot;Casino Building&quot; was built, which remains to this day. In 1923, land was reclaimed from the sea front. It was at this period that the park moved to its current location above what became Watson Road, which was built under the Pleasure Beach in 1932. During this time Joseph Emberton, an architect famous for his work in the amusement trade was brought in to redesign the architectural style of the Pleasure Beach rides, working on the &quot;Grand National&quot; roller coaster, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; and the Casino building to name a few.
The Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II during the 1940s saw the decline of the amusement park industry. War caused the affluent urban population to move to the suburbs, television became a source of entertainment, and families went to amusement parks less often.

By the 1950s, factors such as urban decay, crime, and even desegregation in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time. Many of the older, traditional amusement parks closed or burned to the ground. Many would be taken out by the wrecking ball to make way for suburb and housing and development. In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all amusement parks, closed down for good. The traditional amusement parks which survived, for example, Kennywood, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, did so in spite of the odds.
Inspired by the layout of Tivoli Gardens theme park in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1951, Walt Disney came up with the idea of having an amusement park next to the studios in Burbank. The park would have been called Mickey Mouse Park, built across the street with a western area featuring a steam driven paddleboat, a turn of the century town, and a midway. It was rejected by the Burbank city council in fear of a carnival atmosphere. In 1952, he created WED Enterprises to design the park, which was now to be built in Anaheim, and in 1953, was able to convince the bankers on funding the park with the help of a studio artist, Herb Ryman, by making an aerial drawing of Disneyland. By July 1954, construction had started with a deadline of one year. Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, and two months after the park opened, it welcomed its one millionth guest. Because of the financial success of Disneyland, the amusement industry was reinvigorated. What became Busch Gardens Tampa opened in 1959 as a garden and bird sanctuary. Six Flags Over Texas opened in 1961, themed to the six different countries that ruled over Texas. In 1964, Universal Studios Hollywood opened to the public with a studio tour of their backlot that had multiple adventure scenes and became a proper theme park. That same year, SeaWorld San Diego opened and displayed many varieties of aquatic and marine life.

Initially meant to house Walt Disney&#x27;s dream idea, EPCOT (Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow), Disney executives decided to settle on building the park first in Walt Disney World and the city later. After six years of construction, Walt Disney World opened to the public on October 1, 1971. Meant to be a larger east coast version of Disneyland, it had copies of most of the attractions from Disneyland (except for Liberty Square and the Hall of Presidents), yet it was financially the most ambitious project Walt Disney Productions had ever undertaken, and succeeded once the holiday crowds came in during Thanksgiving. In 1982, Walt Disney Productions opened the second Walt Disney World park, EPCOT Center, based on Walt Disney&#x27;s futurist ideals and World Fairs. Like a World&#x27;s Fair, the park would display the latest technologies in an area called Future World, and the cultural pavilions in World Showcase.
In 1987, Disney announced that it would open its third Disney World park, Disney-MGM Studios in 1989, which would have a working backlot. However, Universal knew that its Californian backlot tour would not work as a standalone attraction next to Disney World (especially now as Disney built one in Disney-MGM). So it divided up the segments of its California tour into individual attractions, such as Jaws, Disaster!, and Kongfrontation. Disney-MGM Studios opened it on May 1, 1989, with two major attractions: The Backlot Tour and The Great Movie Ride. The concept for the park started out as an EPCOT pavilion, but was turned into a park as a &quot;half day&quot; attraction—a complement to the rest of the resort. The rest of the park was themed to 1930s Hollywood and featured lost parts of Hollywood like the Brown Derby. Universal Studios Florida opened on June 7, 1990 (delayed by one year) to great fanfare, but the primary attractions were experiencing severe technical difficulties. All three of the park&#x27;s major attractions (Jaws, Disaster!, and Kongfrontation) were not working and suffered major technical difficulties. Disaster! and Kongfrontation were fixed by the end of June, but Jaws had to be rebuilt and reopened three years later. However, Universal learned from opening day and started conducting exit surveys and special ticket deals.

In 1992, Disney opened its first European park, Euro Disneyland, outside of Paris, France, designed to be like the Magic Kingdom in Florida, yet it caters to the European tastes through changes, including removing Tomorrowland and replacing it with Discoveryland, themed to the great futuristic thinkers of European culture such as H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. A recession in the French economy and the immense public backlash against the park led to financial hardship, putting the park into debt. However, this did not stop Disney from expanding Disney-MGM Studios with The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, in 1994, and building their fourth Walt Disney World park, Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom.

===21st century===
In the early 1990s, after the opening of Universal Studios Florida, Universal sought to build a second theme park, one aimed more towards children and their families. Universal acquired the theme park rights to many properties including Marvel and Dr. Seuss to build the park around. In 1999, Universal Studios opened Universal Studios Islands of Adventure under the new resort name Universal Studios Escape. The park was allegedly designed by former Disney Imagineers who left after the financial disaster of Disneyland Paris. In the late 80s, the Oriental Land Company (the owners and operators of Tokyo Disneyland resort which opened in 1983) wanted a second park. None of the current non-Magic Kingdom parks satisfied the Japanese, but one concept thrown away for Disneyland&#x27;s second gate inspired a new one: DisneySea. Tokyo DisneySea is themed after stories based on the ocean and nautical adventure. It was constructed at a cost of ¥335 billion and opened on September 4, 2001. The park&#x27;s two signature attractions are a modernized version of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Journey To The Center of The Earth.

In the early 1990s, Michael Eisner wanted to make Disneyland in the image of Walt Disney World&#x27;s resort style. Plans were made for multiple hotels, such as one based on the Grand Floridian Hotel, and a new west coast version of EPCOT, called WESTCOT. WESTCOT never came to be due to local opposition from residents, rising costs, and the financial fallout of Disneyland Paris. After a corporate retreat in Colorado, Disney executives decided to make a park themed to California so that guests could experience all of California within the confines of the Disneyland Resort and would be built across from Disneyland on its 100-acre parking lot. Disney&#x27;s California Adventure would be the largest disaster Disney ever created because unlike Disneyland, it would be set in the modern day and spoof modern-day California with its cheap, insincere, and flat backdrops. The park would be adult focused, sell fine food, and serve alcohol. When the park opened on February 8, 2001, it received a chilly reception for its lack of attractions, poor environment (for example, Hollywood Studios Backlot was themed to a modern-day movie backlot of modern-day Hollywood), and overemphasis on retail and dining. When John Hench (an original Imagineer who worked with Walt and was a chief creative executive at Imagineering since Imagineering was founded) was asked for his opinion on the park, he reportedly said, &quot;I preferred the parking lot.&quot;

Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris was the second Disneyland Paris park. Disney had to build a second park or risk losing the land to the French government. The park opened March 16, 2002, with only three rides and California Adventure style theming. However, Hong Kong Disneyland was higher quality than the other black sheep, but still lacked the number of attractions that was needed, just like California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park. It opened on September 12, 2005, with only four lands, and had exorbitant wait times on opening day for everything from rides to food.

In the early 2000s, the Harry Potter book series written by J.K Rowling had become a pop culture phenomenon. Universal and Disney entered a bidding war over the theme park rights to the books, but Disney seemed to have won after Rowling signed a letter of intent with Disney. However, Rowling was disappointed with Disney&#x27;s small-scale plans to install an omnimover attraction themed to the Defense Against the Dark Arts class with one shop and one restaurant in the former submarine lagoon at Magic Kingdom. She was also displeased with the lack of creative control she had and exited the deal. She went to Universal next and was also displeased with the initial plan to redress the Islands of Adventure&#x27;s Lost Continent area. To remedy this, J.K Rowling wrestled creative control from Universal and forced them to make the land a full scale, realistic re-creation of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts without being a refurbishment of an existing area. The project was announced in 2007 and in 2010 the land was opened to the public and made Universal Orlando a must visit destination.

Today, there are over 475 amusement parks in the United States, ranging from mega-parks and those that are operated by Warner Bros., Disney, Six Flags and NBCUniversal.
The amusement park industry&#x27;s offerings range from immersive theme parks such as Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi, the Disneyland Resort and Universal Orlando Resort to thrilling coaster parks such as the Six Flags parks and Cedar Fair parks. Countless smaller ventures exist across the United States and around the world. Simpler theme parks directly aimed at smaller children have also emerged, such as Legoland.

Examples of amusement parks in shopping malls exist in West Edmonton Mall, Pier 39 and Mall of America.

Family fun parks starting as miniature golf courses have begun to grow to include batting cages, go-karts, bumper cars, bumper boats and water slides. Some of these parks have grown to include even roller coasters, and traditional amusement parks now also have these competition areas in addition to their thrill rides.

In 2015, theme parks in the United States had a revenue of and theme parks in China had a revenue of , with China expected to overtake the United States by 2020.

==Other types of amusement park==

===Educational theme parks===

Some parks use rides and attractions for educational purposes. There are also Holy Land USA and the Holy Land Experience, which are theme parks built to inspire Christian piety. Dinosaur World entertains families with dinosaurs in natural settings, while the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens parks also offer educational experiences, with each of the parks housing several thousand animals, fish and other sea life in dozens of attractions and exhibits focusing on animal education.

Created in 1977, the Puy du Fou is a much-celebrated theme park in Vendée, France. It is centered around European, French and local history. It received several international prizes.

===Family-owned theme parks===

Some theme parks did evolve from more traditional amusement park enterprises, such as Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott and his family sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California, ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm officially became a theme park. Because of its long history, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm currently claims to be &quot;America&#x27;s First Theme Park.&quot; Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut, may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana, in 1935 and included Santa&#x27;s Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana, and many people will argue that it was the first true Theme Park despite Knott&#x27;s history. In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Kentucky Kingdom and Wild Adventures.

===Regional parks===

The first regional amusement park, as well as the first Six Flags park, Six Flags Over Texas was officially opened in 1961 in Arlington, Texas. The first Six Flags amusement park was the vision of Angus Wynne Jr. and helped create the modern, competitive amusement park industry. In the late 1950s, Wynne visited Disneyland and was inspired to create an affordable, closer, and larger amusement park that would be filled with fantasy. He followed in the steps of Disney and had subdivisions within the park that reflected different lands. The subdivisions included the Old South and other sections that referenced Wynne&#x27;s background. By 1968, the second Six Flags park, Six Flags Over Georgia, opened, and in 1971, Six Flags Over Mid-America (now Six Flags St. Louis) opened near St. Louis, Missouri. Also in 1971 was the opening of the Walt Disney World resort complex in Florida. In 1991 Warner Bros. in partnership with Village Roadshow, opened their own Warner Bros. Movie World. It is the only Movie-Related theme park in Australia. Warner Bros. continued their theme park ventures and opened Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi in UAE and Parque Warner Madrid in Spain.

== Admission prices and admission policies ==

Amusement parks collect much of their revenue from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other revenue sources include parking fees, food and beverage sales and souvenirs.

Practically all amusement parks operate using one of these two admission principles:

=== Pay-as-you-go ===
In amusement parks ,using the pay-as-you-go scheme, guests enter the park at little or no charge. The guests are then required to purchase rides individually, either at the attraction&#x27;s entrance or by purchasing ride tickets (or a similar exchange method, like a token). The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity or popularity. For example, one guest might pay one ticket to ride a carousel, but also four tickets to ride a roller coaster.

The park may allow guests to purchase a pass providing unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park for a specified duration of time. A wristband or pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.
Disneyland opened in 1955, using the pay-as-you-go format. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Within a short time, the problems of handling such large amounts of coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park lexicon. In this new format, guests purchased ticket books that contained a number of tickets, labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; Rides and attractions using an &quot;A-ticket&quot; were generally simple, with &quot;B-tickets&quot; and &quot;C-tickets&quot; used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the &quot;D-ticket&quot; was added, then finally the &quot;E-ticket&quot;, which was used on the biggest and most elaborate rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides, for example two or three A-tickets would equal a single B-ticket. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, eventually abandoned this practice in 1982.

=== Pay-one-price ===
An amusement park using the pay-one-price scheme charges guests a single admission fee. Guests are subsequently given access to most of the attractions, usually including flagship roller coasters, in the park as often as they wish during their visit. A daily admission pass, also called a day pass, is the most basic fare on offer, with alternatives including season tickets which offer holders admission for the entire operating year (plus special privileges for the newest attractions), and express passes which gives holders priority in bypassing lineup queues for the more popular attractions.

Parks with a pay-one-price admission format often have attractions that are not included in the admission charge; these are called &quot;up-charge attractions&quot; and may include Skycoasters or go-kart tracks, or games of skill where prizes are won. All Warner Bros. Theme Parks, including Warner Bros. Movie World, Warner Bros. World, and Parque Warner Madrid, follow this scheme.

When Angus Wynne, founder of Six Flags Over Texas, first visited Disneyland upon its opening in 1955, he noted that park&#x27;s pay-as-you-go format as a reason to make his park pay-one-price. He thought that a family would be more likely to visit his park if they knew, up front, how much it would cost to attend.

==Rides and attractions==
Mechanized thrill rides are a defining feature of amusement park attractions. Early rides include the carousel, which originally developed from cavalry training methods first used in the Middle Ages. By the 19th century, carousels were common in parks around the world. Another such ride which shaped the future of the amusement park was the roller coaster. The origins of roller coasters can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where gravity-driven attractions, which at first only consisted of individual sleds or carts riding freely down chutes on top of specially constructed snow slopes with piles of sand at the bottom for braking, were used as winter leisure activities. These crude and temporarily built curiosities, known as &quot;Russian Mountains&quot;, were the beginning of the search for even more thrilling amusement park rides. The Columbian Exposition of 1893 was a particularly fertile testing ground for amusement rides and included some that the public had never seen before, such as the world&#x27;s first Ferris wheel, one of the most recognized products of the fair. In the present day, many rides of various types are set around a specific theme.

Parks contains a mixture of attractions which can be divided into several categories.

===Flat rides===
Flat rides are usually considered to be those that move their passengers in a plane generally parallel to the ground.

There is a core set of flat rides which most amusement parks have, including the Enterprise, Tilt-A-Whirl, Gravitron, chairswing, swinging inverter ship, twister, and top spin. However, there is constant innovation, with new variations on ways to spin and throw passengers around appearing in an effort to keep attracting customers. Manufactures such as Huss and Zamperla specialise in creating flat rides among other amusement attractions.

===Roller coasters===
Amusement parks often feature multiple roller coasters of primarily timber or steel construction. Fundamentally, a roller coaster ride is one in which a specialized railroad system with steep drops and sharp curves, passengers sit and are restrained in cars, usually with two or more cars joined to form a train. Some roller coasters feature one or more inversions (such as vertical loops) which turn the riders upside down. Over the years there have been many roller coaster manufacturers with a variety of types of roller coasters.

Manufacturers today include:
* Bolliger &amp; Mabillard
* Gerstlauer
* The Gravity Group
* Great Coasters International
* Intamin
* Mack Rides
* Maurer AG
* Premier Rides
* Rocky Mountain Construction
* S&amp;S - Sansei Technologies
* Vekoma
* Zamperla
* Zierer

===Railways===
Amusement park railways have had a long and varied history in American amusement parks as well as overseas. Some of the earliest park trains were not really trains; they were trolleys, which brought park patrons to the parks on regular rail lines from the cities to the end of the rail lines where the parks were located. As such, some older parks, such as Kennywood in Pennsylvania, were referred to as trolley parks. The earliest park trains that only operated on lines within the park&#x27;s boundaries, such as the one on the ridable miniature Zephyr Railroad in Dorney Park, were mostly custom-built. A few parks trains (such as the Disneyland Railroad, Walt Disney World Railroad, and Dollywood Express) operate using locomotives that had working careers on common carrier railways. Amusement park railways tend to be narrow-gauge, meaning the space between their rails is smaller than that of railroads. Some specific narrow gauges that are common on amusement park railroads are gauge, gauge, gauge, and gauge.

Past and present manufacturers include: 
*Allan Herschell Company
*Brookville Equipment Corporation
*Cagney Brothers
*Chance Rides
*Crown Metal Products
*Custom Fabricators
*Custom Locomotives
*Doppelmayr Garaventa Group
*Hurlbut Amusement Co.
*Miniature Train Co. (MTC)
*National Amusement Devices Co. (NAD)
*Ottaway
*Sandley
*Severn Lamb
*Tampa Metal Products
*Train Rides Unlimited
*Western Train Co.

===Water rides===
Amusement parks with water resources generally feature a few water rides, such as the log flume, bumper boats, rapids and rowing boats. Such rides are usually gentler and shorter than roller coasters and many are suitable for all ages. Water rides are especially popular on hot days.
===Dark rides===

Overlapping with both train rides and water rides, dark rides are enclosed attractions in which patrons travel in guided vehicles along a predetermined path, through an array of illuminated scenes which may include lighting effects, animation, music and recorded dialogue, and other special effects.

=== Haunted houses ===

A haunted house is an attraction that intends to scare its guests for its thrill factor. It usually is overlapped with dark rides. Most open in the Halloween season but some are year-round. Most include actors, lighting, darkness, fog and animatronics.

===Ferris wheels===
Ferris wheels are the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs and county fairs in the US.

===Transport rides===
Transport rides are used to take large numbers of guests from one area to another, as an alternative to walking, especially for parks that are large or separated into distant areas. Transport rides include chairlifts, monorails, aerial trams, and escalators.

Ocean Park Hong Kong is well known for its cable car connecting the Lowland and Headland areas of the park, and for having the world&#x27;s second longest outdoor escalator in the Headland. Both transportation links provide scenic views of the park&#x27;s hilly surroundings and, while originally intended for practicality rather than thrills or enjoyment, have become significant park attractions in their own right.

==Food==
There are food stands at amusement parks which serve a variety of food and beverages. They offer snack items like cotton candy, ice cream, fried dough, funnel cake, candy apples or caramel apples and french fries. Meal items may include pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken. Beverages may include soda, coffee, tea, and lemonade. Junk food items like deep fried candy bars, the deep-fried Twinkie, Dippin&#x27; Dots ice cream, the blooming onion, and &quot;deep-fried butter on-a-stick&quot; are some of the delicacies that can be found at food stands. Local and regional specialties, along with ethnic foods, are often available such as Empanadas and Tacos.

<text>Ludwigslust () is a central castle town of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, 40 km south of Schwerin. Since 2011 it has been part of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district.

Ludwigslust is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. The former royal residential town is known for its rich heritage, especially the famed Ludwigslust Palace, known as &quot;Versailles of the North&quot;.

==History==

In 1724 Prince Ludwig, the son of Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg, decided to build a hunting lodge near a small hamlet called Klenow. Later, after his succession to the Dukedom, this became his favourite residence and he named it accordingly &quot;Ludwigslust&quot; (&quot;Ludwig&#x27;s pleasure/desire&quot;). In 1765 Ludwigslust became the capital of the duchy in place of Schwerin. The town was enlarged by a residential palace (the castle). This situation continued until 1837, when Grand Duke Paul Friedrich returned the capital status to Schwerin.

The Wöbbelin concentration camp—sometimes referred to as &quot;Ludwigslust concentration camp&quot;—was established by the SS near the city of Ludwigslust in 1945. At the end of World War II, as the Line of contact between Soviet and other Allied forces formed, Ludwigslust was captured by British troops initially, then handed over to American troops. After several months the US troops departed and allowed Soviet troops to enter under the Yalta agreement designating the occupation of Mecklenburg to be administered by the Soviets. 
==Sights==
* Schloss Ludwigslust, a Baroque residential palace built in 1772–1776, according to plans by Johann Joachim Busch. It is called the &quot;Little Versailles of Mecklenburg&quot;. The palace is in the middle of the palace garden (Schlosspark), a vast park (120 ha.) in the English style, with canals, fountains and artificial cascades.
* The &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (Municipal- / City-Church), built in 1765–1770 in Neoclassical style with Baroque sway. Its classical design, with a portico resting on six doric columns, gives the church an appearance similar to a Greek temple.

==Transport==

*Ludwigslust railway station is served by ICE, EC, IC and RE services.

==Twin towns — sister cities==
Ludwigslust is twinned with:
* Ahrensburg, Germany
* Muscatine, United States
* Kamskoye Ustye, Russia

== Sport ==
The Ludwigslust Motodrom and Speedwaystadion is a motorsport and motorcycle speedway venue located approximately 3 kilometres west of the town. The stadium has hosted important events, including a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1992 and 1993. The team MC Ludwigslust won the bronze medal in the 1988 East Germany championships.

<text>Montgomery is a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States. The population as of the 2020 census was 1,184. In 1963, part of Avery&#x27;s Gore in Franklin County became part of Montgomery, with the other section becoming part of Belvidere in Lamoille County.

==Geography==
The town is in eastern Franklin County, bordered to the south by Lamoille County and to the east by Orleans County. Vermont Route 118 passes through the town, leading northwest to Berkshire and south to Eden. Vermont Route 58 intersects Route 118 at Montgomery Center, leading southwest over Hazens Notch to Lowell. Vermont Route 242 also terminates at Montgomery Center, leading northeast over the Green Mountains to Jay. The higheast point in Montgomery is the summit of Big Jay, a spur of Jay Peak. Big Jay is in the northeast corner of Montgomery.

The state and federal government continues to study this problem. A critic replied that the entire basis of the study were three unidentified people who died from asbestosis from 1995 to 2005 out of a total population of 16,700.

<text>Isle La Motte () is an island in Lake Champlain in northwestern Vermont, United States. At 7 mi (11 km) by 2 mi (3 km), it lies close to the place that the lake empties into the Richelieu River. It is incorporated as a New England town in Grand Isle County. Its population was 488 at the 2020 census.

The island is named after a French soldier, Pierre La Motte, who built a military outpost on the island in 1666. The island&#x27;s population significantly increases in the summer months. The island is the site of Fort Sainte Anne, Saint Anne&#x27;s Shrine, the Methodist Episcopal Church of Isle La Motte, the Fisk Quarry and Goodsell Ridge Preserves, the Isle La Motte Elementary School, and the Isle La Motte Lighthouse.

==History==

On July 9, 1609, Samuel de Champlain debarked on the island.

In 1665, the French began building a series of forts along the Richelieu River to protect New France from the Iroquois. From north to south these were Fort Richelieu, Fort Chambly, and Fort Sainte Thérèse.

Four companies of the Carignan-Salières Regiment were sent from Quebec City to extend these forts further south, under Captain Pierre La Motte. They built a trail connecting Fort Sainte Thérèse and Fort Saint-Louis (Chambly).

In 1666, Fort Saint-Jean and the farthest south Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte were added. The fort included Saint Anne&#x27;s Shrine. Both the fort and chapel were dedicated to Saint Anne. In 1668, the bishop of Quebec, François de Laval, came to Isle La Motte to baptise a number of Iroquois to Christianity. Even after the abandonment of the fort, the shrine continued to give mass to worshipers. The fort was the first European settlement in what is now Vermont.

Fort Saint Anne was the one most vulnerable to attack. The fort was garrisoned by about 300 French soldiers over the next four years, and the troops were then pulled back to Québec after they had destroyed the fort.

In 1746, a party of Mohawks under Hendrick Theyanoguin, returning from a conference with the Governor of New France in Montreal, attacked a group of Frenchmen at Isle La Motte before returning to Albany. The incident was followed by Mohawk raids along the St. Lawrence River in 1747.

In the mid-1800s, orchards, vineyards, and dairy farms flourished on the island, which was then connected to the mainland by ferry during the warmer months and by foot or wagon over the ice in winter. In November 1802, Isle La Motte was renamed to &quot;Vineyard,&quot; but the original name was restored in November 1830.

In 1878, the town was incorporated for the sole purpose of building a bridge to Alburgh that was completed in 1882.

Fisk Farm was the site at which the Vermont Fish and Game League was addressed in August 1897 by President William McKinley and in September 1901 by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, who had learned of the shooting of McKinley, who later died.

==Geology and quarrying==

The island, along with Valcour Island south of Plattsburgh, was formed 480 million years ago as a reef during the Ordovician Period in a shallow tropical sea, near where Morocco is today. At that time there was no life on dry land except for a few primitive plants such as mosses and algae. Almost all of life was in the oceans. Carbon dioxide levels were 14–16 times higher than today, with high sea levels covering much of the continents, which were mostly located south of the equator. The stromatoporoid patch reef, one of the oldest known metazoan reefs, originally stretched a thousand miles from what is now Quebec to Tennessee, but only a few remnants remain today. The island&#x27;s fossil reefs are part of the Chazy Fossil Reef, a National Natural Landmark dedicated in 2009.

Reef builders during this period in earth history were principally bryozoa, stromatolites, stromatoporoids, sponges, and algae. Other marine life included cephalopods, gastropods, crinoids, and trilobites. Today fossil gastropods (snails) can be seen at the abandoned quarries.

Black limestone from the Chazy Formation was quarried on the island. The oldest quarry behind Fisk Farm started as early as 1832.

The limestone is composed of calcite and fossils of marine creatures. It is so dark in appearance that it was marketed in the 18th and 19th century as &quot;black marble&quot; and was used for the construction of the U.S. Capitol building and the National Gallery of Art. Structures made of the stone still visible on the island are the Isle La Motte Public Library, the Isle La Motte Methodist Church, Isle La Motte Historical Society (formerly the South Stone School House), ruins of the Fisk House at Fisk Farm, and the original Fisk House (once owned by Lieutenant Governor Nelson Fisk).

<text>Stowe is a town in Lamoille County, Vermont, United States. The population was 5,223 at the 2020 census. The town lies on Vermont Routes 108 and 100. It is nicknamed &quot;The Ski Capital of the East&quot; and is home to Stowe Mountain Resort, a ski facility with terrain on Mount Mansfield, the highest peak in Vermont, and Spruce Peak.
==History==

The indigenous people who lived in the area now called Vermont were primarily Abenaki, who spoke Algonquian. They were forced aside by strategies of displacement after primarily British settlers flooded into the area after the French and Indian War. There are no surviving names from the original language, which was most likely Mahican, an Algonquian dialect akin to Abenaki.

Stowe was chartered on June 8, 1763, by Royal Governor Benning Wentworth of the Province of New Hampshire. Vermont became a U.S. state in 1791. Two years later more settlers arrived in Stowe. By the turn of the nineteenth century, the majority of the town’s property had been sold, and its population had risen to 316. 

Stowe&#x27;s early years were dominated by the farm and lumber industries. Over 75 percent of the land in Stowe and most of Vermont used to be open terrain cleared by lumber production and used for agriculture, particularly sheep farming. In those days, up to 8000 sheep grazed the Stowe hills and valleys.

Stowe&#x27;s agricultural fortunes changed alongside those of the rest of New England. Most of Vermont eventually switched from sheep to dairy farms, with more than 100 farms in Stowe alone. Only nine of these farms are still operational today. This move allowed 75 percent of the cleared area to reforest over time.

Unlike much of the rest of Vermont, Stowe&#x27;s past was not centered solely on agriculture. It had become a well-known summer resort by the mid-nineteenth century, thanks to its mountain scenery.

The Summit House atop
Mt. Mansfield was constructed just before the American Civil War broke out. The Toll Road to reach it followed by 1870. At that time the 300-room Mansfield House occupied the majority of the settlement. The latter, often known as the &quot;Big Hotel,&quot; burned down in 1889. Behind it lay a vast stable with over 100 horses, equipment, carriages, and stable hands. In 1953, the barn was demolished over fire concern, and several of the original beams were repurposed in the construction of The Whip Bar &amp; Grill. The Depot Building located next to the Green Mountain Inn was erected in 1897 for the Mt. Mansfield Electric Railway. Running the 11 miles between Waterbury and Stowe, it carried both passengers and freight until 1932.

Through the First World War, summer tourism remained crucial to Stowe&#x27;s economy. Stowe had its inaugural Winter Carnival in 1921, including ski jumping, skating, and a variety of other enjoyable activities. The Civilian Conservation Corps erected camps and began clearing ski tracks on Mt. Mansfield during the Great Depression, leading to Stowe becoming an early mecca for downhill skiing in the United States. The Bruce Trail, which ran from the current site of the Octagon to Ranch Camp, was the first built in 1933. The Mt. Mansfield Ski Touring trail system now includes this trail as well. The Nose Dive, the next ski trail, was created in 1934. Skiers used to trek the 2.5 miles to the summit in the early days. Chairlifts, which began with a single chair in 1940, overtook rope tows as the more convenient way. The chair was in service until 1986, when it was replaced with a high-speed detachable quad.

The Vermont Ski Museum was founded in 1988, and relocated to Stowe in 2000. It contains information and artifacts on the history of skiing and snowboarding in Vermont. 

Stowe remains a premier Eastern resort town, summer and winter.

==History==
In 1780, the American Revolution-era government of Vermont granted the town of Orange to Captain Ebenezer Green, Amos Robinson, and 63 other shareholders. At the time, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York were fighting for control of Vermont, including the right to award town charters—a fight eventually won by Vermont. During the Revolution, New York unsuccessfully attempted to award a charter for the town of Kempton, which would have encompassed the same territory as Orange. The first settlement in Orange took place in 1793, when Joseph Williams and his family built a house in the southern portion of the town. Orange was officially organized in 1796 in a meeting which took place at Williams&#x27;s home, and its first government consisted of: Joseph Thayer as town meeting moderator; John Sloane, town clerk; Thomas Storrs Paine, Fairbanks Bush, and Gould Camp as selectmen (Camp was also town treasurer); Ezra Paine, constable; listers Fairbanks Bush, Ezra Goodale, and Humphrey Hunt; and grand juror Joseph Williams.

<text>Randolph is a town in Orange County, Vermont, United States. The population was 4,774 at the 2020 census, making Randolph the largest town in Orange County. The town is a commercial center for many of the smaller, rural farming communities that surround it.

When the area was originally settled there were three villages—Randolph Center, East Randolph and West Randolph—the current locations of the three fire departments. What is now Randolph, the primary village of the town, had previously been the village of West Randolph.

==History==

Vermont granted the town on November 2, 1780, when the New Hampshire settlers could not locate the original grantees, whose patents were issued by New York. It was chartered on June 29, 1781, to Aaron Storrs and 70 others, and was originally named &quot;Middlesex&quot;.

The town was first settled , when Vermont was an unrecognized state whose government existed in defiance of the government of New York, which claimed Vermont was a part of New York. To encourage recognition of the state by the United States, the town was renamed in honor of Edmund Randolph, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

With productive soil for cultivation, farming became an intensive industry. By 1830, when the population reached 2,743, between twelve and thirteen thousand sheep grazed its pastures. Randolph was noted for its good butter, cheese and mutton.

Two branches of the White River provided water power for watermills. By 1859, the town had three gristmills, one oil mill, and one carding mill. In 1848, the Vermont Central Railroad opened service through the town. Randolph&#x27;s prosperity during the Victorian era endowed it with some fine architecture, including the Second Empire Randolph Railroad Depot and Renaissance Revival Kimball Public Library.

In 1921, Randolph was the setting for, and provided some of the cast of, a silent movie called &quot;The Offenders.&quot; In 1922, the same was true for the film &quot;Insinuation&quot;.

Today, Randolph is a thriving meeting-spot and shopping center for the surrounding area. The town is home to attractions such as the Porter Music Box Museum and the Chandler Music Hall. Also located in Randolph are the Gifford Medical Center, a hospital; Dubois &amp; King, a civil and structural engineering firm; and Randolph Union High School, which also serves students from the neighboring towns of Braintree and Brookfield. Downtown Randolph hosts the Amtrak station, shops, restaurants, Playhouse Movie Theatre, and several gas stations.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 47.9 square miles (124.1 km2), of which 47.9 square miles (124.0 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.08%) is water. Randolph is drained by the second and third branches of the White River.

<text>Thetford is a town in Orange County, Vermont, United States in the Connecticut River Valley. The population was 2,775 at the 2020 census. Villages within the town include East Thetford, North Thetford, Thetford Hill, Thetford Center, Rices Mills, Union Village, and Post Mills. The town office is in Thetford Center.

Thetford is home to Thetford Academy, Vermont&#x27;s oldest secondary school. Girl Scouts of the Green and White Mountains, formerly Swift Water Girl Scout Council, also has a summer residential camp here called Camp Farnsworth. Camp Farnsworth originally started under private ownership by Chelebe and Madama Farnsworth in 1909 when it was called Camp Hanoum.

==History==

The town was created on August 12, 1761, by way of a royal charter which King George III of Great Britain issued to Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire. Wentworth named it for Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, 4th Earl of Arlington and 4th Viscount Thetford, who in 1768 became prime minister. It was first settled in 1764 by John Chamberlin, who lived at East Thetford beside the Connecticut River. He was an agent for one of 62 proprietors (51 from Hebron, Connecticut).

In 1910, the Camp Fire Girls were founded locally. This became a national organization within two years.
Gove Hill Retreat, a nonprofit Christian Retreat center, was founded in 1966 in Thetford Center. The center supplied hospitality to religious, educational and other non-profit organizations. The retreat was sited on property originally owned by John Gove, the first farmer and name sake of Gove Hill. It was closed December 31, 2013, after the American Baptist Churches of Vermont and New Hampshire (ABCVNH) decided the yearly upkeep was not worth it. The retreat center had run a deficit for a number of years. The Pastor&#x27;s larger salary were both believed to be factors in the closing of the doors.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 44.2 square miles (114.4 km2), of which 43.6 square miles (112.8 km2) is land and 0.6 square mile (1.6 km2) (1.36%) is water.

<text>Tunbridge is a town in Orange County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census the town population was 1,337. The town consists of three village centers, all situated on Vermont Route 110 in the valley of the first branch of the White River. The three settlements are named North Tunbridge (also known locally as &quot;Blood Village&quot;), Tunbridge Village (&quot;Market&quot;) and South Tunbridge (&quot;Jigger&quot;).

==Historic sites==

The entire center of Tunbridge Village, including the fairgrounds, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Officially the district listing is &quot;Roughly, along VT 110 and adjacent rds. including Town Rd. 45 and Spring and Strafford Rds.&quot;

Tunbridge has five covered bridges (all listed on the National Register)
*Cilley Bridge – southwest of Tunbridge Village (off Howe Lane from VT 110)
* Flint Bridge – North Tunbridge on Bicknell Hill Road (off VT 110)
* Larkin Bridge – North Tunbridge on Larkin Road (off VT 110)
* Howe Bridge – South of Tunbridge Village (entering on VT 110) at Belknap Road
* Mill (or Hayward &amp; Noble or Spring Rd.) Bridge —in the Village, west side of VT 110 on Spring Road

Tunbridge also has two other structures are individually listed on the National Register:
* Hayward &amp; Kibby (or Hayward &amp; Noble) Mill – on Spring Road in Tunbridge Village
* South Tunbridge Methodist Episcopal Church

==Tunbridge World&#x27;s Fair==

The historical antecedent of the Tunbridge World&#x27;s Fair can be traced to the town&#x27;s charter, which therein authorized the establishment of two annual fairs when the population of the town reached fifty families.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1867 that, after a succession of fairs in Orange County starting in 1847, the Tunbridge Agricultural Society was organized and staged a fair at the Elisha Lougee Farm in North Tunbridge. At the 1867 fair, Vermont&#x27;s former Lieutenant Governor Burnham Martin referred to the fair as a &quot;little World&#x27;s Fair&quot;. Lewis Dickerman adopted the phrase and used it in the 1868 publicity handbills and the Tunbridge fair has since used the name.

In 1875, the Union Agricultural Society assumed the sponsorship of the fair and moved its location to the present fairgrounds in the center of Tunbridge.

In 1894, the fair joined the National Trotting Association, and for many years has maintained the only remaining grass race track in Vermont.

The annual fair continues to this day with demonstrations of farming and agricultural traditions and culture, working antique displays, horse and ox pulling, horse racing, cattle and horse shows, junior exhibits, floral and 4-H exhibits, contra dancing, gymkhana, and many free shows.

==Geography and geology==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 44.8 square miles (115.9 km2), of which 44.7 square miles (115.9 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.04%) is water.
The First Branch of the White River running north to south divides Tunbridge into two nearly equal parts. Two mineral springs exist in the town, one of which is a white sulphur spring located on &quot;Spring road,&quot; one and a half miles from Tunbridge Center; this spring was once valued for its medicinal properties.

The highest points of land are Brocklebank Hill at 2100+ ft near the northern boundary with Chelsea, Old Hurricane Hill at 1900+ ft in the northwestern part near East Randolph, and East Hill at 2112 ft near the Strafford line. The soil is well-drained and was formed in Wisconsin-age glacial till, its average depth is around 20 to 40 inches. Typical composition of the soil: a surface layer of very dark brown, partially decomposed organic material; a subsurface layer of gray fine sandy loam; upper subsoil of dark brown fine sandy loam and subsoil of brown channery fine sandy loam. The rocks underlying Tunbridge are entirely of the calciferous mica schist formation, with a small bed of granite, syenite and protogine in the northeastern part.

No. 9 of the Acts of 1985, effective March 27, 1985, designated the Tunbridge Soil Series as the official State Soil. The Tunbridge series (course-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplothrod) consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils. It was selected from among more than 160 different soil series in the state. As it is a typical &quot;hill farm&quot; and &quot;sugarbush&quot; soil, the Tunbridge series well represents the soil resources of Vermont. A soil formed in loamy glacial till, it has good potential for agriculture and forestry. As Professor Richmond Bartlett of UVM says, &quot;It&#x27;s the soil that makes Vermont hills greener than those either in New Hampshire or New York.&quot; ---&quot;&quot;

Typical species of tree to be found in the landscape are white birch, yellow birch, American beech, red spruce, red maple, sugar maple, white ash, hemlock and white pine.

==History==
The town and a village were renamed &quot;Ely&quot; in 1880 after the Ely Mining Company, which mined copper. This changed in 1883, when 200 miners seized the plant demanding back wages. Five companies of the National Guard were called out to suppress the miners. It is the home of The Mountain School of Milton Academy, a selective independent semester program that provides academically motivated high school juniors from across the country the opportunity to live and work on a farm.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.5 square miles (94.6 km2), of which 36.5 square miles (94.5 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.05%) is water. The headwaters of the Ompompanoosuc River are located in the town.

<text>Washington is a town in Orange County, Vermont, in the United States. The population was 1,032 at the 2020 census. The town is believed to be named after George Washington, although the town may also be named after Washington, Connecticut, as there are records of individuals moving from that town in Connecticut to Vermont around 1766.

==History==

During the 1760s and 1770s, the territory now known as Vermont was in dispute between New York and New Hampshire, the result of conflicting interpretations of each colony&#x27;s charter. People moving into the territory, then known as New Connecticut or the New Hampshire Grants, generally settled after purchasing land grants from New Hampshire governor Benning Wentworth. When the British government resolved the dispute in New York&#x27;s favor, New York attempted to assert control by forcing residents who had purchased grants from Wentworth to pay a fee to confirm their titles, otherwise face eviction. Many Vermonters resisted, leading to creation of the Green Mountain Boys.

As part of New York&#x27;s effort to demonstrate control over the grants, in 1770 it chartered the town of Kingsland far from New York in what was then remote Gloucester County. Kingsland had no record of any residents, but was designated as one of two county seats. A log jail and courthouse were constructed at the head of a stream subsequently named the Jail Branch.

In 1780, the government of Vermont, by then an independent republic, re-chartered Kingsland and named it Washington. The town was uninhabited until 1785, when Daniel Morse obtained title to 100 acres. He was soon followed by his brother, John. Other residents continued to arrive, and by 1792, the town was completely organized, with records for 1794 indicating that there were 32 freemen on its voter checklist.

Centered on the hilltop near the Jail Branch, the town consisted mainly of small sheep farms that produced wool. Between 1820 and 1829, there were two fulling mills and one carding mill in operation, and sheep raising peaked around 1830. Washington&#x27;s population peaked at 1400 in 1840, after which there was a steady decline, as wool production decreased due to increasing tariffs and other factors. Most farms and homes around the center of town on the hilltop were abandoned, and the center of town relocated downhill and further north, along the Jail Branch and what is now Vermont Route 110.

With the arrival of the railroad in the 1850s, the dairy industry expanded as urban markets became accessible. By 1895, Washington had enough dairy farms to make the operation of a creamery possible. As industries including granite manufacturing grew in nearby towns, the expansion and railroads associated with it bypassed Washington, which remained a low-population rural community centered on agriculture.

By the late twentieth century, small dairy farms were increasingly uncompetitive, and by the 1950s, many of Washington&#x27;s farms had ceased operation. By 1960, Washington&#x27;s population had declined to 565. Although Washington remains a rural town, most farms are no longer in operation, and it has become a &quot;bedroom community&quot; with residents commuting to work in Barre, Montpelier, Burlington and other cities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.9 square miles (100.7 km2), of which 38.9 square miles (100.6 km2) is land and 0.03% is water.

Washington is situated south of U.S. Route 302. Adjacent towns are Barre Town to the northwest, Orange to the north, Corinth to the east, Chelsea to the south, and Williamstown to the west.

<text>Wells River is a village in the town of Newbury in Orange County, Vermont, United States. The population was 431 at the 2020 census. The village center is located at the junction of U.S. Routes 5 and 302.

The village center (the portion near the confluence of the Wells River and the Connecticut River) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as Wells River Village Historic District. The district covers 84 contributing properties over an area of . It includes examples of Classical Revival, Federal, and Late Victorian styles. The architectural character of the district represents the building traditions of nineteenth-century Vermont, showcasing a wide array of building styles.

==History==

The area was first called Governor&#x27;s Right because were granted to Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire. It was purchased by Er Chamberlin, who built a gristmill on the Wells River. Located at the head of navigation for the Connecticut River, Wells River developed as a center for trade. Canal boats guided by long poles floated downriver laden with lumber, clapboards and shingles, returning with goods such as iron, salt, rum and molasses. In the 1830s and 1840s, Jacob Kent Jr. was the proprietor of the Coosuck House, a well-known Wells River hotel.

On November 6, 1848, the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad opened to Wells River, rendering obsolete the river&#x27;s barge traffic. In 1853–1854, the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad reached Woodsville, New Hampshire across the Connecticut River. It built division offices and repair facilities, transforming that village into a booming railway town. The line replaced the 1805 bridge over the narrows to Wells River with a two-level wooden span which combined a toll highway deck at the bottom of the truss, with railroad tracks on the roof. In 1903, a steel bridge of similar configuration replaced it. In 1873, the Montpelier and Wells River Railroad was completed, enhancing the region&#x27;s position as a railroad junction.

<text>West Fairlee is a town in Orange County, Vermont, United States. The population was 621 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Originally a part of the town of Fairlee, West Fairlee separated in 1797. The town was first settled by Nathaniel Niles that same year. The town remained predominantly agricultural until copper was discovered in nearby Vershire in 1813. With the opening of the Ely Copper Mine in 1821 the town rapidly began to grow. The mine became the site of Vermont&#x27;s largest labor revolt, dubbed the &#x27;Ely War,&#x27; in 1883. Unable to remain financially solvent the mine was sold to George Westinghouse.

Combined with a fire that destroyed much of the town in 1910 and the mine&#x27;s closure in 1920, West Fairlee&#x27;s economy suffered immensely. Today the town is largely a bedroom community.

Samuel Graves originally established his brass and woodwind instrument company Graves &amp; Co. here in 1824. 

During the Civil War, 98 residents served, or 11% of the town’s population. Among them was Medal of Honor recipient General Stephen Thomas. The town also sent men from Company A of the 15th Vermont Infantry Regiment, which was organized in West Fairlee in 1862.

West Fairlee was the summer residence of Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman, which he named &quot;Capitaf.&quot; It was here that he and his wife, Rose Friedman wrote the 1980 bestselling book, &quot;Free to Choose&quot;.

Portions of the 1983 film &quot;The Survivors&quot;, starring Walter Mathau and Robin Williams was filmed in West Fairlee.

==History==

Native Abenakis told of how a large pond &quot;ran away&quot; similar to Runaway Pond in the 1780s before the area was explored by the descendants of Europeans.

Commodore Abraham Whipple was given a grant to the town, along with 50–60 of his shipmates. He called it &quot;Navy&quot;. Abner Allen, from Barton, Vermont, was the first settler in 1803.

In 1825, the town of Navy changed its name to Charleston, presumably after a naval battle that had occurred off Charleston, South Carolina.

During the Civil War Charleston furnished 121 enlisted men, 35 of whom were killed in action or died from the effects of wounds or disease contracted while in the service.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town had a number of mills. The population hit a high of 1700.

A round barn (not uncommon for the time and place) was erected in Charleston in 1908. It was possibly the largest such structure in New England. The barn burned to the ground in 1918, though the large stone foundation can still be seen along the Ten Mile Square Road.

A series of fires destroyed East Charleston May 18, 1921, and West Charleston on the following day.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.6 square miles (100.0 km2), of which 37.5 square miles (97.1 km2) is land and 1.1 square miles (2.9 km2) (2.93%) is water.

The Clyde River is the largest stream in the town. It flows into Charleston, in a northwesterly direction nearly through its center. Falls are found on the river, especially in the western part of town, where it drops more than in , but its current is generally slow.

Echo Lake, situated in the easterly part of the town, receives the waters of Lake Seymour in Morgan, and through that the waters of Holland Pond. Echo Lake is one mile (1.6 km) from East Charleston. It is one mile (1.6 km) and a half long and one mile (1.6 km) wide. General Whitelaw gave it the name of Echo Pond because when any sound was produced in its vicinity, it reverberated in various directions, producing a series of echoes.

Pensioners Pond is the next in size, and was so named because of the pension of a revolutionary soldier who employed its water power.

Toad Pond is above Pensioners Pond, near the great swamp on the Brownington line. Broadway Pond is near the Morgan line.

The southwest part of town is delimited from its neighbor, the town of Brownington, by Chilafoux Road, which runs northwest-southeast, for about half its length.

<text>Coventry is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,100 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Etymology===
Coventry was named for the birthplace of one of the founders, Major Elias Buel, who was born in Coventry, Connecticut.

===Post bellum===
A record exists from 1860, showing that the &quot;Artillery Company&quot; of the 3rd Regiment mustered for annual drill on June 5. An inventory shows they possessed one six pound brass cannon.

In 1861, the 3rd Vermont Infantry, Company B, was recruited in part from Coventry.

In the September 9, 1977, episode of Hee Haw, Coventry was saluted for its population of 300.

===Coventry festival===
In 2004, what was billed as the final concert of the band Phish was held in Coventry on August 14–15. The concert was the single largest gathering of people in the town&#x27;s history. Some fans had to be turned back due to heavy rains. Even so, with 65,000 attendees Coventry&#x27;s augmented population was the largest in the state at that time, outranking Burlington, Vermont, which had around 39,000 people in the 2000 census.

The Phish concert was a two-day event (August 14–15, 2004), held at the Newport State Airport. People began arriving early Friday morning and shortly after the roads became congested. On Friday morning, it had rained. The soft land in the parking area had turned to mud. Cars were then turned away. Instead of driving home, they parked their cars on the median of Interstate 91, choosing to walk the rest of the way to the concert.

Dozens of pairs of shoes, sandals and boots were lost due to the thick mud. On Sunday, at the end of the concert, tractors were brought over to help pull cars out of the mud.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.7 square miles (71.7 km2), of which 27.5 square miles (71.1 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km2) (0.80%) is water. It contains the smallest area of any town in the county. However, the city of Newport is smaller in area. The village of Coventry is in the southern part of the town.

The Black River flows an east-northeasterly course through the central part of the town until it joins the South Bay of Lake Memphremagog in Newport. For approximately the last , the river is part of the state&#x27;s South Bay Wildlife Management Area.

South Bay Wildlife Management Area is located mostly in Coventry but also in the adjacent town of Newport at the southern part of Lake Memphremagog. This is a large wetland and floodplain forest, red maple and white cedar swamp, along the Black River.

The Barton River flows through Coventry, east of the Black River, and then into Lake Memphremagog.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,014 people, 379 households, and 286 families residing in the town. The population density was 36.9 people per square mile (14.3/km2).

<text>Craftsbury is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,343 at the 2020 census. The town includes the unincorporated villages of Craftsbury, Craftsbury Common, Mill Village, and East Craftsbury.

==History==
The state granted the town to Ebenezer Crafts, Timothy Newell, and sixty-two associates, on November 6, 1780. They named it Minden. It was changed to Craftsbury, in honor of Ebenezer Crafts, on October 27, 1790. Crafts was the first settler in the county.

North Craftsbury, later known as Craftsbury Common, was the first significant settlement in the town, and was for many years the center of culture and commerce, not only for Craftsbury, but for the greater region as well serving many of the neighboring towns. As mills multiplied around the town in the early 1800s additional settlements were made at Mill Village and in Craftsbury Village, while a predominantly Scottish settlement was made in East Craftsbury.

In 1840, the town needed 12 school districts to administer its schools, because of poor road infrastructure. There were 1,200 people, predominately engaged in farming. They owned 333 horses, 1,718 cattle, 3,166 sheep, and 658 pigs. They produced of potatoes, oats, of other crops, of hay, and of maple sugar. The town had two gristmills, a hulling mill, two carding machine operations, ten sawmills, two fulling mills, three carriage makers, and one oil mill.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.7 square miles (102.9 km2), of which 39.3 square miles (101.7 km2) is land and 0.4 square mile (1.1 km2) (1.11%) is water.
Craftsbury is on a plateau on the Catamount Trail.

There are many hills and valleys. The soil varies from alluvial meadows to clay and gravel. There are more numerous grades and varieties of soil than is usual.

There are five ponds or lakes.

Lake Elligo (also known as Eligo Pond) is partially in Greensboro. It is about two miles long and half a mile wide. Unusually, it has two outlets: one flows to the north and the other to the south. The northern outlet is one of the head branches of Black River. The southern flows through Little Elligo Pond and on to the Lamoille River in Hardwick. The eastern shore rises to cliffs. The western shore rises gradually. Near the center of the pond are two small islands. The lake was formerly a hunting-ground of the St. Francis Indians, who named it Elligo Scoloon.

The others are Great Hosmer Pond, lying partly in Albany, Little Hosmer Pond, and two other small ponds. The Black River is the main river in the town. It was called Elligo-sigo by the natives. Its current is slow. The drop from its source to Lake Memphremagog, including the falls at Irasburg and Coventry, is 190 feet. Wild branch, a tributary of the Lamoille, rises in Eden and flows through the western part of the town. The valley of the Black river in Craftsbury is a muck bed averaging a quarter of a mile in width.

===Geology===
Geologically, the town varies in its structure to an unusual degree. There is granite in the east part of town. This alternates with gneiss and mica slate. In the central portions of town, the previous rocks are replaced by dark argillaceous slate. This alternates with siliceous limestone. These rocks are from the Devonian Period and are part of the Waits River Formation.

The rocks on the west side of the Black River also vary. These are older rocks from the Cambrian Period, Moretown Formation. State Route 14 runs along a seam where these east and west rock formation converge. Strata of mica slate, argillaceous, and chlorite slates, and limestones, alternate. An extensive deposit of gray granite is near Craftsbury village. It is broken on the surface. This rock is filled with nodules of black mica and quartz, in concentric layers. These are about one inch in diameter.

In much of the area, the biotite orbicules are so numerous that a hundred may be counted within a circle two feet in diameter. In some parts of the ledge these nodules are flattened, as if subjected to an immense vertical pressure when the mass was in a semi-fluid state. In the nineteenth century these rocks were once believed to be unique from any other found in America or Europe. Today, it is known that they resemble those found in Bethel granite.

As the last glacial period ended, part of the town became submerged under the transient Lake Winooski which drained when its ice dam melted 14,000 years ago.

==Craftsbury in film==
Alfred Hitchcock shot the scenery for his 1955 movie &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; in Craftsbury. Ostensibly, the movie takes place entirely in town. Exteriors of the parsonage beside the East Craftsbury Presbyterian Church are used as well as exterior shots of Craftsbury Common. Assuming that the town would be in full foliage, the company showed up for outdoor shots on September 27, 1954. To the filmmakers&#x27; shock, there was hardly any foliage left; to achieve a full effect, leaves were glued to the trees.

The 1976 IMAX film &quot;To Fly!&quot;, a history of human flight, directed by Jim Freeman and Greg MacGillivray and produced for the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum opens with a hot air balloon passing over the Wee House and the United Church of Craftsbury on the Common.

==History==
On October 29, 1779, the state of Vermont chartered it to Timothy Andrus and fifty-nine associates, with an area of . It was named after Derby, in England.

In the War of 1812, an expeditionary force of Quebec Eastern Townships&#x27; volunteers destroyed a barracks built at Derby with no personnel casualties.

Portus Baxter and David Camp were Underground Railroad agents before the Civil War.

On October 31, 1866, the town erected a granite monument at Derby Center in honor of those who died in the Civil War. It is inscribed: &quot;In Memory of the Volunteers from Derby, who Lost their Lives in the Great Rebellion, 1861-’65.” It lists the names of fifty-three men from Derby. It is the oldest community memorial to that war in the United States.

The failed town of Salem was annexed to Derby by an act of the legislature of 1880, and took effect March 1, 1881. This increased the land size of Derby so it became the largest in Orleans County.

Like many Orleans County towns, Derby grew in population until 1890, after which the depression (then called &quot;panics&quot;) of 1893 affected the local economy and agricultural prices. Population fluctuated until it hit a bottom in 1940. The town has grown steadily since.

In 1917, the city of Newport was formed from portions of the towns of Newport (the former village of Newport) and Derby (the former village of West Derby).

In 1928, the Canadian Gateway Airport opened off Vermont Route 111, within walking distance from Derby Center. It was the third airport constructed in the state. The larger and older airport, Burlington, was given the designation of &quot;entry airport&quot; from Canada resulting in the closure of Gateway in 1933.

A drive-in theater opened in 1950 and closed in 1985 on the Derby Road (Route 5).

<text>Derby Line is an incorporated village in the town of Derby in Orleans County, Vermont, United States, slightly north of the 45th parallel, the nominal U.S.-Canada boundary. The population was 687 at the 2020 census.

The village is located on the Canada–United States border and is contiguous with the district of Rock Island in the town of Stanstead, Quebec.

Notable buildings include the Haskell Free Library and Opera House.

==History==
The village was incorporated in 1791. It lies on an elevation at the far north of Derby, which was chartered on October 29, 1779, and first settled in 1795. By 1859, the area was noted for the beauty of its farmhouses and luxuriant farmland, set before the distant vista of Lake Memphremagog and the Green Mountains.

Because of an erratic survey, the border separating Canada from the United States was drawn incorrectly by the surveyors in the 18th century, above the 45th parallel which was the agreed boundary. Derby Line was founded based on that line, above the 45th parallel. The boundary was confirmed by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842.

==Description==
Derby Line is known for the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a line house deliberately constructed on the international border and opened in 1904. The founders were a binational couple: Carlos F. Haskell was a local American businessman who owned a number of sawmills, while Martha Stewart Haskell was Canadian. The intent was that people on both sides of the border would have use of the facility, which is now a designated historic site. Patrons of the library from either side of the border may use the facility without going through border security.

Besides the library, five inhabited structures are divided by the border. Most residents use the US entrances to avoid problems with the border patrol; crossing the border within buildings does not require official permission. A tool-and-die factory, once operated by the Butterfield division of Litton Industries, is also divided. The factory in Canada closed in 1982 after a lengthy strike by Canadian workers. The factory in Derby Line is open. It was bought in 1988 by Group Tivoly, a cutting tools company based in France, and has 160 employees.

There are ramifications to living directly on the border of another country. For example, the US Border Patrol expressed a desire to close off streets (such as Canusa Street) which have historically run together with those of Stanstead Town. [In many US locales the term for such a political entity is &quot;township&quot;.] Border officials were concerned about illegal immigration. In 2007, the village of Derby Line met with the Mayor and Council of Stanstead in joint session in Québec, to be addressed by the authorities. This meant that the Vermont village&#x27;s trustee meeting was held in a foreign country, following Vermont procedural rules.

A telephone call between Derby Line, Vermont, and Rock Island, Québec, is local.

Derby Line shares emergency crews with Stanstead. Each responds to calls on both sides of the border.

<text>Glover is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, in the United States. As of the 2020 census, the town&#x27;s population was 1,114. It contains two unincorporated villages, Glover and West Glover.

The town is named for Brigadier General John Glover, who served in the American Revolutionary War. He was the prime proprietor of the town.

Glover is home to three museums: the Bread &amp; Puppet Museum, the Glover Historical Society museum, and The Museum of Everyday Life.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.6 square miles (100.0 km2), of which 37.9 square miles (98.1 km2) is land and 0.7 square mile (1.9 km2) (1.92%) is water.

The surface of the town is uneven, with hills and valleys. The highest elevation is Black Hills, at , in the south part of town. The town drains northward via the northern branches of the Barton River, and southward via branches of the Passumpsic, Lamoille, and Black Rivers, which have their sources here. Four ponds of considerable size also are found here, Parker Pond, in the north, Clark&#x27;s pond, in the central, and Sweeney pond in the west, as well as Shadow Lake. Shadow Lake was first called Chambers Pond, then Stone Pond about 1822. In 1922 it was given its current name. The Abenaki had called it Pekdabowk, or Smoke Pond.

==History==
In 1802, the town decided to construct one school at the Parker settlement. Operating expenses were limited to $20 for that year.

In the most cataclysmic natural catastrophe affecting Orleans County in post-Columbian times, the banks of Glover&#x27;s Long Pond gave way on June 6, 1810, and flooded the Barton River valley. The hero of the day was laborer Spencer Chamberlain who ran ahead of the flood to warn people at the mill. The wayward pond was forever after known as &quot;Runaway Pond&quot;.

By 1851, there were 450 grammar school students. In 2017, the number of students at that level had dropped to about 100.

From about the 1820s to the 1930s, there was a settlement, Slab City, near the outlet from Shadow Lake, whose economy was dependent on the logging, and three sawmills in the area. The settlement also contained a lime kiln, butter tub factory, a cider mill, a one-room schoolhouse, a post office, a church, and other allied businesses. In 1836, a suit against the height of the water retained in a dam to power the sawmills was successful. The suit was motivated in large part by the Runaway Pond catastrophe. The end of the dam power marked the beginning of the end for Slab City.

The unincorporated village of West Glover had a municipal septic system which failed in 2008. This was replaced in 2012. It connected to the main sewage line in Glover village, which in turns was connected to the wastewater treatment facility in adjacent Barton. This was funded by USDA Rural Development Agency.

<doc id="137374" wikidata="Q2971268" url="?curid=137374" title="Greensboro, Vermont">
<text>Greensboro is the southernmost town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 811 at the 2020 census. The town includes the places of Campbells Corners, East Greensboro, Gebbie Corner, Greensboro Four Corners, Greensboro Bend, Tolman(s) Corner, and Burlington Point. Greensboro Bend and the central village of Greensboro are classified as census-designated places.

==History==
Greensboro was chartered in 1781. The town was named for Timothy Green, one of the original charter recipients and an original landowner under the charter. However, there is no evidence that he ever visited the town, and his land was sold for non-payment of taxes a few decades after he received it.:13-14 Only three of the original proprietors settled in the town; most likely, the others were land speculators who sold their land to others or let it be sold at tax sales when buyers could not be found.:18

The Bayley Hazen Military Road, built before the town was chartered, allowed its development. The road passed to the west of Caspian Lake, and a wooden blockhouse was constructed there in 1779:21-22 on what is now known as Block House Hill:frontispiece. In 1781, the blockhouse&#x27;s party of four was attacked by Abenaki; two were killed and two were captured.:22-23 A second road was built by Timothy Hinman between 1791 and 1793. This road, which came to be known as the Hinman Settler Road, branched off from the Bayley-Hazen in Greensboro and continued to Derby. These two roads were of major importance to the settlement of northern Vermont.:23

The town sent many soldiers to fight in the Civil War. Of eight prisoners of war from the town, confined to Andersonville Prison, one returned.
In the early 20th century, a development near the Highland Lodge contained restrictive covenants in the title forbidding subsequent resale to Jews. These restrictions were found to be illegal by the US Supreme Court in 1948.

The Highland Lodge opened in 1954. It had a hotel and restaurant that was open year-round. It had a beach on Caspian Lake with sailboats, kayaks, and canoes; children&#x27;s play programs and nature programs in the summer and nature hikes and cross-country ski trails in the winter. Special events included wedding, business retreats, music programs, workshops, and talks. It was largely closed in 2011, being open only for room and cottage rentals, but a group of investors purchased the property in December 2016 and have reopened the Lodge and restaurant seasonally.
