<text>The Armenian genocide was the systematic destruction of the Armenian people and identity in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Spearheaded by the ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), it was implemented primarily through the mass murder of around one million Armenians during death marches to the Syrian Desert and the forced Islamization of others, primarily women and children.

Before World War I, Armenians occupied a somewhat protected, but subordinate, place in Ottoman society. Large-scale massacres of Armenians had occurred in the 1890s and 1909. The Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats and territorial losses—especially during the 1912–1913 Balkan Wars—leading to fear among CUP leaders that the Armenians would seek independence. During their invasion of Russian and Persian territory in 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians. Ottoman leaders took isolated instances of Armenian resistance as evidence of a widespread rebellion, though no such rebellion existed. Mass deportation was intended to permanently forestall the possibility of Armenian autonomy or independence.

On 24 April 1915, the Ottoman authorities arrested and deported hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and leaders from Constantinople. At the orders of Talaat Pasha, an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million Armenians were sent on death marches to the Syrian Desert in 1915 and 1916. Driven forward by paramilitary escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to robbery, rape, and massacres. In the Syrian Desert, the survivors were dispersed into concentration camps. In 1916, another wave of massacres was ordered, leaving about 200,000 deportees alive by the end of the year. Around 100,000 to 200,000 Armenian women and children were forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim households. Massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian survivors continued through the Turkish War of Independence after World War I, carried out by Turkish nationalists.

This genocide put an end to more than two thousand years of Armenian civilization in eastern Anatolia. Together with the mass murder and expulsion of Assyrian/Syriac and Greek Orthodox Christians, it enabled the creation of an ethnonationalist Turkish state, the Republic of Turkey. The Turkish government maintains that the deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action that cannot be described as genocide. 34 countries have recognized the events as genocide, concurring with the academic consensus.
== Background ==
=== Armenians in the Ottoman Empire ===
The presence of Armenians in Anatolia has been documented since the sixth century BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens under the Seljuk dynasty. The Kingdom of Armenia adopted Christianity as its national religion in the fourth century CE, establishing the Armenian Apostolic Church. Following the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, two Islamic empires—the Ottoman Empire and the Iranian Safavid Empire—contested Western Armenia, which was permanently separated from Eastern Armenia (held by the Safavids) by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab. The Ottoman Empire was multiethnic and multireligious, and its millet system offered non-Muslims a subordinate but protected place in society. Sharia law encoded Islamic superiority but guaranteed property rights and freedom of worship to non-Muslims (&quot;dhimmis&quot;) in exchange for a special tax.

On the eve of World War I in 1914, around two million Armenians lived in Ottoman territory, mostly in Anatolia, a region with a total population of 15–17.5 million. According to the Armenian Patriarchate&#x27;s estimates for 1913–1914, there were 2,925 Armenian towns and villages in the Ottoman Empire, of which 2,084 were in the Armenian highlands adjacent to the Russian border. Armenians were a minority in most places where they lived, alongside Turkish and Kurdish Muslim and Greek Orthodox Christian neighbors. According to the Patriarchate&#x27;s figure, 215,131 Armenians lived in urban areas, especially Constantinople, Smyrna, and Eastern Thrace. Although most Ottoman Armenians were peasant farmers, they were overrepresented in commerce. As middleman minorities, despite the wealth of some Armenians, their overall political power was low, making them especially vulnerable.

=== Land conflict and reforms ===

Armenians in the eastern provinces lived in semi-feudal conditions and commonly encountered forced labor, illegal taxation, and unpunished crimes against them including robberies, murders, and sexual assaults. Beginning in 1839, the Ottoman government issued a series of reforms to centralize power and equalize the status of Ottoman subjects regardless of religion. The reforms to equalize the status of non-Muslims were strongly opposed by Islamic clergy and Muslims in general, and remained mostly theoretical. Because of the abolition of the Kurdish emirates in the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman government began to directly tax Armenian peasants who had previously paid taxes only to Kurdish landlords. The latter continued to exact levies illegally.

From the mid-nineteenth century, Armenians faced large-scale land usurpation as a consequence of the sedentarization of Kurdish tribes and the arrival of Muslim refugees and immigrants (mainly Circassians) following the Russo-Circassian War. In 1876, when Sultan Abdul Hamid II came to power, the state began to confiscate Armenian-owned land in the eastern provinces and give it to Muslim immigrants as part of a systematic policy to reduce the Armenian population of these areas. This policy lasted until World War I. These conditions led to a substantial decline in the population of the Armenian highlands; 300,000 Armenians left the empire, and others moved to towns. Some Armenians joined revolutionary political parties, of which the most influential was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), founded in 1890. These parties primarily sought reform within the empire and found only limited support from Ottoman Armenians.

Russia&#x27;s decisive victory in the 1877–1878 war forced the Ottoman Empire to cede parts of eastern Anatolia, the Balkans, and Cyprus. Under international pressure at the 1878 Congress of Berlin, the Ottoman government agreed to carry out reforms and guarantee the physical safety of its Armenian subjects, but there was no enforcement mechanism; conditions continued to worsen. The Congress of Berlin marked the emergence of the Armenian question in international diplomacy as Armenians were for the first time used by the Great Powers to interfere in Ottoman politics. Although Armenians had been called the &quot;loyal millet&quot; in contrast to Greeks and others who had previously challenged Ottoman rule, the authorities began to perceive Armenians as a threat after 1878. In 1891, Abdul Hamid created the &quot;Hamidiye&quot; regiments from Kurdish tribes, allowing them to act with impunity against Armenians. From 1895 to 1896 the empire saw widespread massacres; at least 100,000 Armenians were killed primarily by Ottoman soldiers and mobs let loose by the authorities. Many Armenian villages were forcibly converted to Islam. The Ottoman state bore ultimate responsibility for the killings, whose purpose was violently restoring the previous social order in which Christians would unquestioningly accept Muslim supremacy, and forcing Armenians to emigrate, thereby decreasing their numbers.

=== Young Turk Revolution ===

Abdul Hamid&#x27;s despotism prompted the formation of an opposition movement, the Young Turks, which sought to overthrow him and restore the 1876 Constitution of the Ottoman Empire, which he had suspended in 1877. One faction of the Young Turks was the secret and revolutionary Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), based in Salonica, from which the charismatic conspirator Mehmed Talaat (later Talaat Pasha) emerged as a leading member. Although skeptical of a growing, exclusionary Turkish nationalism in the Young Turk movement, the ARF decided to ally with the CUP in December 1907. In 1908, the CUP came to power in the Young Turk Revolution, which began with a string of CUP assassinations of leading officials in Macedonia. Abdul Hamid was forced to reinstate the 1876 constitution and restore the Ottoman parliament, which was celebrated by Ottomans of all ethnicities and religions. Security improved in parts of the eastern provinces after 1908 and the CUP took steps to reform the local gendarmerie, although tensions remained high. Despite an agreement to reverse the land usurpation of the previous decades in the 1910 Salonica Accord between the ARF and the CUP, the latter made no efforts to carry this out.
In early 1909 an unsuccessful countercoup was launched by conservatives and some liberals who opposed the CUP&#x27;s increasingly repressive governance. When news of the countercoup reached Adana, armed Muslims attacked the Armenian quarter and Armenians returned fire. Ottoman soldiers did not protect Armenians and instead armed the rioters. Between 20,000 and 25,000 people, mostly Armenians, were killed in Adana and nearby towns. Unlike the 1890s massacres, the events were not organized by the central government but instigated by local officials, intellectuals, and Islamic clerics, including CUP supporters in Adana. Although the massacres went unpunished, the ARF continued to hope that reforms to improve security and restore lands were forthcoming, until late 1912, when they broke with the CUP and appealed to the European powers. On 8 February 1914, the CUP reluctantly agreed to reforms brokered by Germany that provided for the appointment of two European inspectors for the entire Ottoman east and putting the Hamidiye regiments in reserve. CUP leaders feared that these reforms, which were never implemented, could lead to partition and cited them as a reason for the elimination of the Armenian population in 1915.

===Balkan Wars===
The 1912 First Balkan War resulted in the loss of almost all of the empire&#x27;s European territory and the mass expulsion of Muslims from the Balkans. Ottoman Muslim society was incensed by the atrocities committed against Balkan Muslims, intensifying anti-Christian sentiment and leading to a desire for revenge. Blame for the loss was assigned to all Christians, including the Ottoman Armenians, many of whom had fought on the Ottoman side. The Balkan Wars put an end to the Ottomanist movement for pluralism and coexistence; instead, the CUP turned to an increasingly radical Turkish nationalism to preserve the empire. CUP leaders such as Talaat and Enver Pasha came to blame non-Muslim population concentrations in strategic areas for many of the empire&#x27;s problems, concluding by mid-1914 that they were internal tumors to be excised. Of these, Ottoman Armenians were considered the most dangerous, because CUP leaders feared that their homeland in Anatolia—claimed as the last refuge of the Turkish nation—would break away from the empire as the Balkans had.

In January 1913, the CUP launched another coup, installed a one-party state, and strictly repressed all real or perceived internal enemies. After the coup, the CUP shifted the demography of border areas by resettling Balkan Muslim refugees while coercing Christians to emigrate; immigrants were promised property that had belonged to Christians. When parts of Eastern Thrace were reoccupied by the Ottoman Empire during the Second Balkan War in mid-1913, there was a campaign of looting and intimidation against Greeks and Armenians, forcing many to emigrate. Around 150,000 Greek Orthodox from the Aegean coast were forcibly deported in May and June 1914 by Muslim bandits, who were secretly backed by the CUP and sometimes joined by the regular army. Historian Matthias Bjørnlund states that the perceived success of the Greek deportations allowed CUP leaders to envision even more radical policies &quot;as yet another extension of a policy of social engineering through Turkification&quot;.
==Ottoman entry into World War I==

A few days after the outbreak of World War I, the CUP concluded an alliance with Germany on 2 August 1914. The same month, CUP representatives went to an ARF conference demanding that, in the event of war with Russia, the ARF incite Russian Armenians to intervene on the Ottoman side. Instead, the delegates resolved that Armenians should fight for the countries of their citizenships. During its war preparations, the Ottoman government recruited thousands of prisoners to join the paramilitary Special Organization, which initially focused on stirring up revolts among Muslims behind Russian lines beginning before the empire officially entered the war. On 29 October 1914, the empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers by launching a surprise attack on Russian ports in the Black Sea. Many Russian Armenians were enthusiastic about the war, but Ottoman Armenians were more ambivalent, afraid that supporting Russia would bring retaliation. Organization of Armenian volunteer units by Russian Armenians, later joined by some Ottoman Armenian deserters, further increased Ottoman suspicions against their Armenian population.

Wartime requisitions were often corrupt and arbitrary, and disproportionately targeted Greeks and Armenians. Armenian leaders urged young men to accept conscription into the army, but many soldiers of all ethnicities and religions deserted due to difficult conditions and concern for their families. At least 10 percent of Ottoman Armenians were mobilized, leaving their communities bereft of fighting-age men and therefore largely unable to organize armed resistance to deportation in 1915. During the Ottoman invasion of Russian and Persian territory, the Special Organization massacred local Armenians and Assyrian/Syriac Christians. Beginning in November 1914, provincial governors of Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum sent many telegrams to the central government pressing for more severe measures against the Armenians, both regionally and throughout the empire. These requests were endorsed by the central government already before 1915. Armenian civil servants were dismissed from their posts in late 1914 and early 1915. In February 1915, the CUP leaders decided to disarm Armenians serving in the army and transfer them to labor battalions. The Armenian soldiers in labor battalions were systematically executed, although many skilled workers were spared until 1916.

== Onset of genocide ==

Minister of War Enver Pasha took over command of the Ottoman armies for the invasion of Russian territory, and tried to encircle the Russian Caucasus Army at the Battle of Sarikamish, fought from December 1914 to January 1915. Unprepared for the harsh winter conditions, his forces were routed, losing more than 60,000 men. The retreating Ottoman army destroyed dozens of Ottoman Armenian villages in Bitlis vilayet, massacring their inhabitants. Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians who he claimed had actively sided with the Russians, a theory that became a consensus among CUP leaders. Reports of local incidents such as weapons caches, severed telegraph lines, and occasional killings confirmed preexisting beliefs about Armenian treachery and fueled paranoia among CUP leaders that a coordinated Armenian conspiracy was plotting against the empire. Discounting contrary reports that most Armenians were loyal, the CUP leaders decided that the Armenians had to be eliminated to save the empire.

Massacres of Armenian men were occurring in the vicinity of Bashkale in Van vilayet from December 1914. ARF leaders attempted to keep the situation calm, warning that even justifiable self-defense could lead to escalation of killing. The governor, Djevdet Bey, ordered the Armenians of Van to hand over their arms on 18 April 1915, creating a dilemma: If they obeyed, the Armenians expected to be killed, but if they refused, it would provide a pretext for massacres. Armenians fortified themselves in Van and repelled the Ottoman attack that began on 20 April. During the siege, Armenians in surrounding villages were massacred at Djevdet&#x27;s orders. Russian forces captured Van on 18 May, finding 55,000 corpses in the province—about half its prewar Armenian population. Djevdet&#x27;s forces proceeded to Bitlis and attacked Armenian and Assyrian/Syriac villages; the men were killed immediately, many women and children were kidnapped by local Kurds, and others marched away to be killed later. By the end of June, there were only a dozen Armenians in the vilayet.

The first deportations of Armenians were proposed by Djemal Pasha, the commander of the Fourth Army, in February 1915 and targeted Armenians in Cilicia (specifically Alexandretta, Dörtyol, Adana, Hadjin, Zeytun, and Sis) who were relocated to the area around Konya in central Anatolia. In late March or early April, the CUP Central Committee decided on the large-scale removal of Armenians from areas near the front lines. During the night of 23–24 April 1915 hundreds of Armenian political activists, intellectuals, and community leaders were rounded up in Constantinople and across the empire. This order from Talaat, intended to eliminate the Armenian leadership and anyone capable of organizing resistance, eventually resulted in the murder of most of those arrested. The same day, Talaat banned all Armenian political organizations and ordered that the Armenians who had previously been removed from Cilicia be deported again, from central Anatolia—where they would likely have survived—to the Syrian Desert.

== Systematic deportations ==
===Aims===

During World War I, the CUP—whose central goal was to preserve the Ottoman Empire—came to identify Armenian civilians as an existential threat. CUP leaders held Armenians—including women and children—collectively guilty for betraying the empire, a belief that was crucial to deciding on genocide in early 1915. At the same time, the war provided an opportunity to enact what Talaat called the &quot;definitive solution to the Armenian Question&quot;. The CUP wrongly believed that the Russian Empire sought to annex eastern Anatolia, and ordered the genocide in large part to prevent this eventuality. The genocide was intended to permanently eliminate any possibility that Armenians could achieve autonomy or independence in the empire&#x27;s eastern provinces. Ottoman records show the government aimed to reduce Armenians to no more than five percent of the local population in the sources of deportation and ten percent in the destination areas. This goal could not be accomplished without mass murder.

The deportation of Armenians and resettlement of Muslims in their lands was part of a broader project intended to permanently restructure the demographics of Anatolia. Armenian homes, businesses, and land were preferentially allocated to Muslims from outside the empire, nomads, and the estimated 800,000 (largely Kurdish) Ottoman subjects displaced because of the war with Russia. Resettled Muslims were spread out (typically limited to 10 percent in any area) among larger Turkish populations so that they would lose their distinctive characteristics, such as non-Turkish languages or nomadism. These migrants were exposed to harsh conditions and, in some cases, violence or restriction from leaving their new villages. The ethnic cleansing of Anatolia—the Armenian genocide, Assyrian genocide, and expulsion of Greeks after World War I—paved the way for the formation of an ethno-national Turkish state. In September 1918, Talaat emphasized that regardless of losing the war, he had succeeded at &quot;transforming Turkey to a nation-state in Anatolia&quot;.

Deportation amounted to a death sentence; the authorities planned for and intended the death of the deportees. Deportation was only carried out behind the front lines, where no active rebellion existed, and was only possible in the absence of widespread resistance. Armenians who lived in the war zone were instead killed in massacres. Although ostensibly undertaken for security reasons, the deportation and murder of Armenians did not grant the empire any military advantage and actually undermined the Ottoman war effort. The empire faced a dilemma between its goal of eliminating Armenians and its practical need for their labor; those Armenians retained for their skills, in particular for manufacturing in war industries, were indispensable to the logistics of the Ottoman Army. By late 1915, the CUP had extinguished Armenian existence from eastern Anatolia.

===Administrative organization===

On 23 May 1915, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians in Van, Bitlis, and Erzerum. To grant a cover of legality to the deportation, already well underway in the eastern provinces and Cilicia, the Council of Ministers approved the Temporary Law of Deportation, which allowed authorities to deport anyone deemed suspect. On 21 June, Talaat ordered the deportation of all Armenians throughout the empire, even Adrianople, from the Russian front. Following the elimination of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia, in August 1915, the Armenians of western Anatolia and European Turkey were targeted for deportation. Some areas with a very low Armenian population and some cities, including Constantinople, were partially spared.

Overall, national, regional, and local levels of governance cooperated with the CUP in the perpetration of genocide. The Directorate for the Settlement of Tribes and Immigrants (IAMM) coordinated the deportation and the resettlement of Muslim immigrants in the vacant houses and lands. The IAMM, under the control of Talaat&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior, and the Special Organization, which took orders directly from the CUP Central Committee, all closely coordinated their activities. A dual-track system was used to communicate orders; those for the deportation of Armenians were communicated to the provincial governors through official channels, but orders of a criminal character, such as those calling for annihilation, were sent through party channels and destroyed upon receipt. Deportation convoys were mostly escorted by gendarmes or local militia. The killings near the front lines were carried out by the Special Organization, and those farther away also involved local militias, bandits, gendarmes, or Kurdish tribes depending on the area. Within the area controlled by the Third Army, which held eastern Anatolia, the army was only involved in genocidal atrocities in the vilayets of Van, Erzerum, and Bitlis.

Many perpetrators came from the Caucasus (Chechens and Circassians), who identified the Armenians with their Russian oppressors. Nomadic Kurds committed many atrocities during the genocide, but settled Kurds only rarely did so. Perpetrators had several motives, including ideology, revenge, desire for Armenian property, and careerism. To motivate perpetrators, state-appointed imams encouraged the killing of Armenians and killers were entitled to a third of Armenian movable property (another third went to local authorities and the last to the CUP). Embezzling beyond that was punished. Ottoman politicians and officials who opposed the genocide were dismissed or assassinated. The government decreed that any Muslim who harbored an Armenian against the will of the authorities would be executed.

===Death marches===

Although the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription. Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting. Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed. Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger. Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men. Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses. The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians. Those unable to pay were murdered. Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites; escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing.

At least 150,000 Armenians passed through Erzindjan from June 1915, where a series of transit camps were set up to control the flow of victims to the killing site at the nearby Kemah gorge. Thousands of Armenians were killed near Lake Hazar, pushed by paramilitaries off the cliffs. More than 500,000 Armenians passed through the Firincilar plain south of Malatya, one of the deadliest areas during the genocide. Arriving convoys, having passed through the plain to approach the Kahta highlands, would have found gorges already filled with corpses from previous convoys. Many others were held in tributary valleys of the Tigris, Euphrates, or Murat and systematically executed by the Special Organization. Armenian men were often drowned by being tied together back-to-back before being thrown in the water, a method that was not used on women.
Authorities viewed disposal of bodies through rivers as a cheap and efficient method, but it caused widespread pollution downstream. So many bodies floated down the Tigris and Euphrates that they sometimes blocked the rivers and needed to be cleared with explosives. Other rotting corpses became stuck to the riverbanks, and still others traveled as far as the Persian Gulf. The rivers remained polluted long after the massacres, causing epidemics downstream. Tens of thousands of Armenians died along the roads and their bodies were buried hastily or, more often, simply left beside the roads. The Ottoman government ordered the corpses to be cleared as soon as possible to prevent both photographic documentation and disease epidemics, but these orders were not uniformly followed.

Women and children, who made up the great majority of deportees, were usually not executed immediately, but subjected to hard marches through mountainous terrain without food and water. Those who could not keep up were left to die or shot. During 1915, some were forced to walk as far as in the summer heat. Some deportees from western Anatolia were allowed to travel by rail. There was a distinction between the convoys from eastern Anatolia, which were eliminated almost in their entirety, and those from farther west, which made up most of those surviving to reach Syria. For example, around 99 percent of Armenians deported from Erzerum did not reach their destination.

===Islamization===

The Islamization of Armenians, carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy, was a major structural component of the genocide. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized, and it is estimated that as many as two million Turkish citizens in the early 21st century may have at least one Armenian grandparent. Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but the regime insisted on their destruction wherever their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or there was a risk of them being able to preserve their nationality and culture. Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war. Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim. Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms.

The CUP allowed Armenian women to marry into Muslim households, as these women would lose their Armenian identity. Young women and girls were often appropriated as house servants or sex slaves. Some boys were abducted to work as forced laborers for Muslim individuals. Some children were forcibly seized, while others were sold or given up by their parents to save their lives. Special state-run orphanages were also set up with strict procedures intending to deprive their charges of an Armenian identity. Most Armenian children who survived the genocide endured exploitation, hard labor without pay, forced conversion to Islam, and physical and sexual abuse. Armenian women captured during the journey ended up in Turkish or Kurdish households; those who were Islamized during the second phase of the genocide found themselves in an Arab or Bedouin environment.

The rape, sexual abuse, and prostitution of Armenian women were all very common. Although Armenian women tried to avoid sexual violence, suicide was often the only alternative. Deportees were displayed naked in Damascus and sold as sex slaves in some areas, constituting an important source of income for accompanying gendarmes. Some were sold in Arabian slave markets to Muslim Hajj pilgrims and ended up as far away as Tunisia or Algeria.

===Confiscation of property===
A secondary motivation for genocide was the destruction of the Armenian bourgeoisie to make room for a Turkish and Muslim middle class and build a statist national economy controlled by Muslim Turks. The campaign to Turkify the economy began in June 1914 with a law that obliged many non-Muslim merchants to hire Muslims. Following the deportations, the businesses of the victims were taken over by Muslims who were often incompetent, leading to economic difficulties. The genocide had catastrophic effects on the Ottoman economy; Muslims were disadvantaged by the deportation of skilled professionals and entire districts fell into famine following their farmers&#x27; deportation. The Ottoman and Turkish governments passed a series of Abandoned Properties Laws to manage and redistribute property confiscated from Armenians. Although the laws maintained that the state was simply administering the properties on behalf of the absent Armenians, there was no provision to return them to the owners—it was presumed that they had ceased to exist.

Historians Taner Akçam and Ümit Kurt argue that &quot;The Republic of Turkey and its legal system were built, in a sense, on the seizure of Armenian cultural, social, and economic wealth, and on the removal of the Armenian presence.&quot; The proceeds from the sale of confiscated property was often used to fund the deportation of Armenians and resettlement of Muslims, as well as for army, militia, and other government spending. Ultimately this formed much of the basis of the industry and economy of the post-1923 republic, endowing it with capital. The dispossession and exile of Armenian competitors enabled many lower-class Turks (i.e. peasantry, soldiers, and laborers) to rise to the middle class. Confiscation of Armenian assets continued into the second half of the twentieth century, and in 2006 the National Security Council ruled that property records from 1915 must be kept closed to protect national security. Outside Istanbul, the traces of Armenian existence in Turkey, including churches and monasteries, libraries, &quot;khachkars&quot;, and animal and place names, have been systematically erased, beginning during the war and continuing for decades afterward.

== Destination ==


The first arrivals in mid-1915 were accommodated in Aleppo. From mid-November, the convoys were denied access to the city and redirected along the Baghdad Railway or the Euphrates towards Mosul. The first transit camp was established at Sibil, east of Aleppo; one convoy would arrive each day while another would depart for Meskene or Deir ez-Zor. Dozens of concentration camps were set up in Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. By October 1915, some 870,000 deportees had reached Syria and Upper Mesopotamia. Most were repeatedly transferred between camps, being held in each camp for a few weeks, until there were very few survivors. This strategy physically weakened the Armenians and spread disease, so much that some camps were shut down in late 1915 due to the threat of disease spreading to the Ottoman military. In late 1915, the camps around Aleppo were liquidated and the survivors were forced to march to Ras al-Ayn; the camps around Ras al-Ayn were closed in early 1916 and the survivors sent to Deir ez-Zor.

In general, Armenians were denied food and water during and after their forced march to the Syrian desert; many died of starvation, exhaustion, or disease, especially dysentery, typhus, and pneumonia. Some local officials gave Armenians food; others took bribes to provide food and water. Aid organizations were officially barred from providing food to the deportees, although some circumvented these prohibitions. Survivors testified that some Armenians refused aid as they believed it would only prolong their suffering. The guards raped female prisoners and also allowed Bedouins to raid the camps at night for looting and rape; some women were forced into marriage. Thousands of Armenian children were sold to childless Turks, Arabs, and Jews, who would come to the camps to buy them from their parents. In the western Levant, governed by the Ottoman Fourth Army under Djemal Pasha, there were no concentration camps or large-scale massacres, rather Armenians were resettled and recruited to work for the war effort. They had to convert to Islam or face deportation to another area.

The ability of the Armenians to adapt and survive was greater than the perpetrators expected. A loosely organized, Armenian-led resistance network based in Aleppo succeeded in helping many deportees, saving Armenian lives. At the beginning of 1916 some 500,000 deportees were alive in Syria and Mesopotamia. Afraid that surviving Armenians might return home after the war, Talaat Pasha ordered a second wave of massacres in February 1916. Another wave of deportations targeted Armenians remaining in Anatolia. More than 200,000 Armenians were killed between March and October 1916, often in remote areas near Deir ez-Zor and on parts of the Khabur valley, where their bodies would not create a public health hazard. The massacres killed most of the Armenians who had survived the camp system.

== International reaction ==

The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent journalists and photographers from documenting the atrocities, threatening them with arrest. Nevertheless, substantiated reports of mass killings were widely covered in Western newspapers. On 24 May 1915, the Triple Entente (Russia, Britain, and France) formally condemned the Ottoman Empire for &quot;crimes against humanity and civilization&quot;, and threatened to hold the perpetrators accountable. Witness testimony was published in books such as &quot;The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire&quot; (1916) and &quot;Ambassador Morgenthau&#x27;s Story&quot; (1918), raising public awareness of the genocide.

The German Empire was a military ally of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. German diplomats approved limited removals of Armenians in early 1915, and took no action against the genocide, which has been a source of controversy.

Relief efforts were organized in dozens of countries to raise money for Armenian survivors. By 1925, people in 49 countries were organizing &quot;Golden Rule Sundays&quot; during which they consumed the diet of Armenian refugees, to raise money for humanitarian efforts. Between 1915 and 1930, Near East Relief raised $110 million ($ billion adjusted for inflation) for refugees from the Ottoman Empire.

==Aftermath==
===End of World War I===

Intentional, state-sponsored killing of Armenians mostly ceased by the end of January 1917, although sporadic massacres and starvation continued. Both contemporaries and later historians have estimated that around 1 million Armenians died during the genocide, with figures ranging from 600,000 to 1.5 million deaths. Between 800,000 and 1.2 million Armenians were deported, and contemporaries estimated that by late 1916 only 200,000 were still alive. As the British Army advanced in 1917 and 1918 northwards through the Levant, they liberated around 100,000 to 150,000 Armenians working for the Ottoman military under abysmal conditions, not including those held by Arab tribes.

As a result of the Bolshevik Revolution and the subsequent separate peace with the Central Powers, the Russian army withdrew and Ottoman forces advanced into eastern Anatolia. The First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed in May 1918, at which time 50 percent of its population were refugees and 60 percent of its territory was under Ottoman occupation. Ottoman troops withdrew from parts of Armenia following the October 1918 Armistice of Mudros. From 1918 to 1920, Armenian militants committed revenge killings of thousands of Muslims, which have been cited as a retroactive excuse for genocide. In 1918, at least 200,000 people in Armenia, mostly refugees, died from starvation or disease, in part due to a Turkish blockade of food supplies and the deliberate destruction of crops in eastern Armenia by Turkish troops, both before and after the armistice.

Armenians organized a coordinated effort known as &quot;vorpahavak&quot; () that reclaimed thousands of kidnapped and Islamized Armenian women and children. Armenian leaders abandoned traditional patrilineality to classify children born to Armenian women and their Muslim captors as Armenian. An orphanage in Alexandropol held 25,000 orphans, the largest number in the world. In 1920, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople reported it was caring for 100,000 orphans, estimating that another 100,000 remained captive.

=== Trials ===

Following the armistice, Allied governments championed the prosecution of Armenian genocide perpetrators. Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha publicly recognized that 800,000 Ottoman citizens of Armenian origin had died as a result of state policy and stated that &quot;humanity, civilizations are shuddering, and forever will shudder, in face of this tragedy&quot;. The postwar Ottoman government held the Ottoman Special Military Tribunal, by which it sought to pin the Armenian genocide onto the CUP leadership while exonerating the Ottoman Empire as a whole, therefore avoiding partition by the Allies. The court ruled that &quot;the crime of mass murder&quot; of Armenians was &quot;organized and carried out by the top leaders of CUP&quot;. Eighteen perpetrators (including Talaat, Enver, and Djemal) were sentenced to death, of whom only three were ultimately executed as the remainder had fled and were tried &quot;in absentia&quot;. The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, which awarded Armenia a large area in eastern Anatolia, eliminated the Ottoman government&#x27;s purpose for holding the trials. Prosecution was hampered by a widespread belief among Turkish Muslims that the actions against the Armenians were not punishable crimes. Increasingly, the genocide was considered necessary and justified to establish a Turkish nation-state.

On 15 March 1921, Talaat was assassinated in Berlin as part of a covert operation of the ARF to kill the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide. The trial of his admitted killer, Soghomon Tehlirian, focused on Talaat&#x27;s responsibility for genocide. Tehlirian was acquitted by a German jury.

===Turkish War of Independence===
The CUP regrouped as the Turkish nationalist movement to fight the Turkish War of Independence, relying on the support of perpetrators of the genocide and those who had profited from it. This movement saw the return of Armenian survivors as a mortal threat to its nationalist ambitions and the interests of its supporters. The return of survivors was therefore impossible in most of Anatolia and thousands of Armenians who tried were murdered. Historian Raymond Kévorkian states that the war of independence was &quot;intended to complete the genocide by finally eradicating Armenian, Greek, and Syriac survivors&quot;. In 1920 Kâzım Karabekir, a Turkish general, invaded Armenia with orders &quot;to eliminate Armenia physically and politically&quot;. Nearly 100,000 Armenians were massacred in Transcaucasia by the Turkish army and another 100,000 fled from Cilicia during the French withdrawal. According to Kévorkian, only the Soviet occupation of Armenia prevented another genocide.

The victorious nationalists subsequently declared the Republic of Turkey in 1923. CUP war criminals were granted immunity and later that year, the Treaty of Lausanne established Turkey&#x27;s current borders and provided for the Greek population&#x27;s expulsion. Its protection provisions for non-Muslim minorities had no enforcement mechanism and were disregarded in practice.

Armenian survivors were left mainly in three locations. About 295,000 Armenians had fled to Russian-controlled territory during the genocide and ended up mostly in Soviet Armenia. An estimated 200,000 Armenian refugees settled in the Middle East, forming a new wave of the Armenian diaspora. In the Republic of Turkey, about 100,000 Armenians lived in Constantinople and another 200,000 lived in the provinces, largely women and children who had been forcibly converted. Though Armenians in Constantinople faced discrimination, they were allowed to maintain their cultural identity, unlike those elsewhere in Turkey who continued to face forced Islamization and kidnapping of girls after 1923. Between 1922 and 1929, the Turkish authorities eliminated surviving Armenians from southern Turkey, expelling thousands to French-mandate Syria.

== Legacy ==
According to historian Margaret Lavinia Anderson, the Armenian genocide reached an &quot;iconic status&quot; as &quot;the apex of horrors conceivable&quot; before World War II. It was described by contemporaries as &quot;the murder of a nation&quot;, &quot;race extermination&quot;, &quot;the greatest crime of the ages&quot;, and &quot;the blackest page in modern history&quot;. According to historian Stefan Ihrig, in Germany, the Nazis viewed post-1923 Turkey as a post-genocidal paradise and, &quot;incorporated the Armenian genocide, its &#x27;lessons&#x27;, tactics, and &#x27;benefits&#x27;, into their own worldview&quot;.

=== Turkey ===

In the 1920s, Kurds and Alevis replaced Armenians as the perceived internal enemy of the Turkish state. Militarism, weak rule of law, lack of minority rights, and especially the belief that Turkey is constantly under threat—thus justifying state violence—are among the main legacies of the genocide in Turkey. In postwar Turkey, the perpetrators of the genocide were hailed as martyrs of the national cause. Turkey&#x27;s official denial of the Armenian genocide continues to rely on the CUP&#x27;s justification of its actions. The Turkish government maintains that the mass deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action to combat an existential threat to the empire, but that there was no intention to exterminate the Armenian people. The government&#x27;s position is supported by the majority of Turkish citizens. Many Kurds, who themselves have suffered political repression in Turkey, have recognized and condemned the genocide.

The Turkish state perceives open discussion of the genocide as a threat to national security because of its connection with the foundation of the republic, and for decades strictly censored it. In 2002, the AK Party came to power and relaxed censorship to a certain extent, and the profile of the issue was raised by the 2007 assassination of Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian journalist known for his advocacy of reconciliation. Although the AK Party softened the state denial rhetoric, describing Armenians as part of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s war losses, during the 2010s political repression and censorship increased again. Turkey&#x27;s century-long effort to prevent any recognition or mention of the genocide in foreign countries has included millions of dollars in lobbying, as well as intimidation and threats.

=== Armenia and Azerbaijan ===

Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day is commemorated on 24 April each year in Armenia and abroad, the anniversary of the deportation of Armenian intellectuals. On 24 April 1965, 100,000 Armenians protested in Yerevan, and diaspora Armenians demonstrated across the world in favor of recognition of the genocide and annexing land from Turkey. A memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above Yerevan.

Since 1988, Armenians and Turkic Azeris have been involved in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. Initially involving peaceful demonstrations by Armenians, the conflict turned violent and has featured massacres by both sides, resulting in the displacement of more than half a million people. During the conflict, the Azerbaijani and Armenian governments have regularly accused each other of plotting genocide. Azerbaijan has also joined the Turkish effort to deny the Armenian genocide.

===International recognition===

In response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many Armenian diaspora activists have lobbied for international formal recognition of the Armenian genocide, an effort that has become a central concern of the Armenian diaspora. From the 1970s onward, many countries avoided recognition to preserve good relations with Turkey. , 31 UN member states have formally recognized the genocide, along with Pope Francis and the European Parliament. Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Turkey explicitly deny the genocide.

===Cultural depictions===

After meeting Armenian survivors in the Middle East, Austrian–Jewish writer Franz Werfel wrote &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot;, a fictionalized retelling of the successful Armenian uprising in Musa Dagh, as a warning of the dangers of Nazism. According to Ihrig, the book, released in 1933, is among the most important works of twentieth-century literature to address genocide and &quot;is still considered essential reading for Armenians worldwide&quot;. The genocide became a central theme in English-language Armenian-American literature. The first film about the Armenian genocide, &quot;Ravished Armenia,&quot; was released in 1919 as a fundraiser for Near East Relief, based on the survival story of Aurora Mardiganian, who played herself. Since then more films about the genocide have been made, although it took several decades for any of them to reach a mass-market audience. The abstract expressionist paintings of Arshile Gorky were influenced by his experience of the genocide. More than 200 memorials have been erected in 32 countries to commemorate the event.

=== Archives and historiography ===

The genocide is extensively documented in the archives of Germany, Austria, the United States, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the Ottoman archives, despite systematic purges of incriminating documents by Turkey. There are also thousands of eyewitness accounts from Western missionaries and Armenian survivors. Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term &quot;genocide&quot; in 1944, became interested in war crimes after reading about the 1921 trial of Soghomon Tehlirian for the assassination of Talaat Pasha. Lemkin recognized the fate of the Armenians as one of the most significant genocides in the twentieth century. Almost all historians and scholars outside Turkey, and an increasing number of Turkish scholars, recognize the destruction of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide.

<text>Saarbrücken (; Rhenish Franconian: &quot;Sabrigge&quot; ; ; ; ; ) is the capital and largest city of the state of Saarland, Germany. Saarbrücken has 181,959 inhabitants and is Saarland&#x27;s administrative, commercial and cultural centre. It is located on the Saar River (a tributary of the Moselle), directly borders the French department of Moselle, and is Germany&#x27;s second-westernmost state capital after Düsseldorf.

The modern city of Saarbrücken was created in 1909 by the merger of the three cities of Saarbrücken (now called &quot;Alt-Saarbrücken&quot;), [[Sankt Johann (Saarbrücken)|St. Johann a. d. Saar]], and [[Malstatt-Burbach]]. It was the industrial and transport centre of the Saar coal basin. Products included iron and steel, sugar, beer, pottery, optical instruments, machinery, and construction materials.

Historic landmarks in the city include the stone bridge across the Saar (1546), the Gothic church of St. Arnual, the 18th-century Saarbrücken Castle, and the old part of the town, the &quot;Sankt Johanner Markt&quot; (Market of St. Johann).

Saarbrücken has an international airport (&quot;Flughafen Saarbrücken&quot;) in the borough of Saarbrücken-Ensheim. The main campus of the University of the Saarland (&quot;Universität des Saarlandes&quot;) is located within the city forest of Saarbrücken-St. Johann, while the university hospital (&quot;Universitätsklinikum des Saarlandes&quot;) can be found in Homburg. The public broadcaster of the Saarland, Saarländischer Rundfunk (&quot;Saarlandian Broadcasting&quot;), has its seat on the Halberg Mountain in Saarbrücken-Brebach-Fechingen, and its transmission mast (&quot;Sendemast Halberg&quot;) can be seen from afar.

In the 20th century, Saarbrücken was twice separated from Germany: from 1920 to 1935 as capital of the Territory of the Saar Basin and from 1947 to 1956 as capital of the Saar Protectorate.

==Etymology==
In modern German, &quot;Saarbrücken&quot; literally translates to &quot;Saar bridges&quot; (&quot;Brücken&quot; is the plural of &quot;&quot;), and indeed there are about a dozen bridges across the Saar river. However, the name actually predates the oldest bridge in the historic centre of Saarbrücken, the &quot;Alte Brücke&quot;, by at least 500 years.

The name &quot;Saar&quot; stems from the Celtic word &quot;sara&quot; (&quot;streaming water&quot;), and the Roman name of the river, &quot;Saravus&quot;.

There are two hypotheses about the origin of the second part of the name Saar&quot;brücken&quot;. Most popular states that the historical name of the town, &quot;Sarabrucca&quot;, derived from the Celtic word &quot;&quot; (&quot;hill&quot;, or &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;big stone&quot;), which became &quot;&quot; (which means &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;boulder&quot;) in High German. The castle of &quot;Sarabrucca&quot; was located on a large rock by the name of &quot;Saarbrocken&quot; overlooking the river Saar. Another opinion holds that the historical name of the town, &quot;Sarabrucca&quot;, derived from the Old High German word &quot;Brucca&quot; , meaning &quot;bridge&quot;, or more precisely a corduroy road, which was also used in fords. Next to the castle, there was a ford allowing land-traffic to cross the Saar.

==History==

===Roman Empire===

In the last centuries BC, the Mediomatrici settled in the Saarbrücken area. When Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in the first century BC, the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire. 

From the first century AD to the fifth century, there was the Gallo-Roman settlement called &quot;vicus Saravus&quot; west of Saarbrücken&#x27;s &quot;Halberg&quot; hill, on the roads from Metz to Worms and from Trier to Strasbourg.
Since the first or second century AD, a wooden bridge, later upgraded to stone, connected &quot;vicus Saravus&quot; with the south-western bank of the Saar, today&#x27;s St Arnual, where at least one Roman villa was located.
In the third century AD, a Mithras shrine was built in a cave in &quot;Halberg&quot; hill, on the eastern bank of the Saar river, next to today&#x27;s old &quot;Osthafen&quot; harbor, and a small Roman camp was constructed at the foot of Halberg hill next to the river.

Toward the end of the fourth century, the Alemanni destroyed the castra and &quot;vicus Saravus&quot;, removing permanent human presence from the Saarbrücken area for almost a century.

===Middle Ages to 18th century===

The Saar area came under the control of the Franks towards the end of the fifth century. In the sixth century, the Merovingians gave the village &quot;Merkingen&quot;, which had formed on the ruins of the villa on the south-western end of the (in those times still usable) Roman bridge, to the Bishopric of Metz. Between 601 and 609, Bishop Arnual founded a community of clerics, a &quot;Stift&quot;, there. Centuries later the &quot;Stift&quot;, and in 1046 &quot;Merkingen&quot;, took on his name, giving birth to &quot;St Arnual&quot;.

The oldest documentary reference to Saarbrücken is a deed of donation from 999, which documents that Emperor Otto III gave the &quot;castellum Sarabrucca&quot; (Saarbrücken castle) to the Bishops of Metz. The Bishops gave the area to the Counts of &quot;Saargau&quot; as a fief. By 1120, the county of Saarbrücken had been formed and a small settlement around the castle developed. In 1168, Emperor Barbarossa ordered the slighting of Saarbrücken because of a feud with Count Simon I. The damage cannot have been grave, as the castle continued to exist.
In 1321/1322 Count Johann I of Saarbrücken-Commercy gave city status to the settlement of Saarbrücken and the fishing village of St Johann on the opposite bank of the Saar, introducing a joint administration and emancipating the inhabitants from serfdom.

From 1381 to 1793 the counts of Nassau-Saarbrücken were the main local rulers. In 1549, Emperor Charles V prompted the construction of the &quot;Alte Brücke&quot; (old bridge) connecting Saarbrücken and St Johann. At the beginning of the 17th century, Count Ludwig II ordered the construction of a new Renaissance-style castle on the site of the old castle, and founded Saarbrücken&#x27;s oldest secondary school, the &quot;Ludwigsgymnasium&quot;. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the population of Saarbrücken was reduced to just 70 by 1637, down from 4500 in 1628. During the Franco-Dutch War, King Louis XIV&#x27;s troops burned down Saarbrücken in 1677, almost completely destroying the city such that just 8 houses remained standing. The area was incorporated into France for the first time in the 1680s. In 1697 France was forced to relinquish the Saar province, but from 1793 to 1815 regained control of the region.

During the reign of Prince William Henry from 1741 to 1768, the coal mines were nationalized and his policies created a proto-industrialized economy, laying the foundation for Saarland&#x27;s later highly industrialized economy. Saarbrücken was booming, and Prince William Henry spent on building and on infrastructure like the &quot;Saarkran&quot; river crane (1761), far beyond his financial means. However, the famous baroque architect Friedrich Joachim Stengel created not only the &quot;Saarkran&quot;, but many iconic buildings that still shape Saarbrücken&#x27;s face today, like the &quot;Friedenskirche&quot; (Peace Church), which was finished in 1745, the &quot;Old City Hall&quot; (1750), the catholic &quot;St. John&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Basilica&quot; (1754), and the famous &quot;Ludwigskirche&quot; (1775), Saarbrücken&#x27;s landmark.

===19th century===

In 1793, Saarbrücken was captured by French Revolutionary troops and in the treaties of Campo Formio and Lunéville, the county of Saarbrücken was ceded to France.

After 1815 Saarbrücken became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. The office of the mayor of Saarbrücken administered the urban municipalities Saarbrücken and St Johann, and the rural municipalities &quot;Malstatt&quot;, &quot;Burbach&quot;, &quot;Brebach&quot;, and &quot;Rußhütte&quot;. The coal and iron resources of the region were developed: in 1852, a railway connecting the Palatine Ludwig Railway with the French Eastern Railway was constructed, the Burbach ironworks started production in 1856, beginning in 1860 the Saar up to Ensdorf was channeled, and Saarbrücken was connected to the French canal network.

At the start of the Franco-Prussian War, Saarbrücken was the first target of the French invasion force which drove off the Prussian vanguard and occupied Alt-Saarbrücken on 2 August 1870. Oral tradition has it that 14-year-old French Prince Napoléon Eugène Louis Bonaparte fired his first cannon in this battle, an event commemorated by the &quot;Lulustein&quot; memorial in Alt-Saarbrücken. On 4 August 1870 the French left Saarbrücken, driven away towards Metz in the Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870. Saarbrücken would remain the only German territory occupied by French forces during the conflict.

===20th century===
In 1909 the cities of Saarbrücken, St Johann and Malstatt-Burbach merged and formed the major city of Saarbrücken with a population of over 100,000.

During World War I, factories and railways in Saarbrücken were bombed by British forces. The Royal Naval Air Service raided Saarbrücken with 11 DH4s on 17 October 1917, and a week later with 9 HP11s. The Royal Air Force raided Saarbrücken&#x27;s railway station with 5 DH9s on 31 July 1918, on which occasion one DH9 crashed near the town centre.

Saarbrücken became capital of the Saar territory established in 1920. Under the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the Saar coal mines were made the exclusive property of France for a period of 15 years as compensation for the destruction of French mines during the First World War. The treaty also provided for a plebiscite, at the end of the 15-year period, to determine the territory&#x27;s future status, and in 1935 more than 90% of the electorate voted for reunification with Germany, while only 0.8% voted for unification with France. The remainder wanted to rejoin Germany but not while the Nazis were in power. This &quot;status quo&quot; group voted for maintenance of the League of Nations&#x27; administration. In 1935, the Saar territory rejoined Germany and formed a district under the name Saarland.

====World War II====
Saarbrücken was heavily bombed in World War II.
In total 1,234 people (1.1 percent of the population) in Saarbrücken were killed in bombing raids from 1942 to 1945. 11,000 homes were destroyed and 75 percent of the city left in ruins. Today more than a third of the city consists of buildings from before 1945.

The British Royal Air Force (RAF) raided Saarbrücken at least 10 times. Often employing area bombing, the RAF used a total of at least 1,495 planes to attack Saarbrücken, killing a minimum of 635 people and heavily damaging more than 8,400 buildings, of which more than 7,700 were completely destroyed, thus dehousing more than 50,000 people. The first major raid on Saarbrücken was undertaken by 291 aircraft of the RAF on 29 July 1942, targeting industrial facilities. Losing nine aircraft, the bombers destroyed almost 400 buildings, damaging more than 300 others, and killed more than 150 people. On 28 August 1942, 113 RAF planes raided Saarbrücken doing comparatively little damage due to widely scattered bombing. After the RAF mistakenly bombed Saarlouis instead of Saarbrücken on 1 September 1942, it raided Saarbrücken with 118 planes on 19 September 1942, causing comparatively little damage as the bombing scattered to the west of Saarbrücken due to ground haze. There were small raids with 28 Mosquitos on 30 April 1944, with 33 Mosquitos on 29 June 1944, and with just 2 Mosquitos on 26 July 1944. At the request of the American Third Army, the RAF massively raided Saarbrücken on 5 October 1944, to destroy supply lines, especially the railway. The 531 Lancasters and 20 Mosquitos achieved these goals, but lost 3 Lancasters and destroyed large parts of Malstatt and nearly all of Alt-Saarbrücken. From 13 to 14 January, the RAF raided Saarbrücken three times, targeting the railway yard. The attacks with 158, 274, and 134 planes, respectively, were very effective.

The 8th US Air Force raided Saarbrücken at least 16 times, from 4 October 1943, to 9 November 1944. Targeting mostly the marshalling yards, a total of at least 2,387 planes of the 8th USAF killed a minimum of 543 people and heavily damaged more than 4,400 buildings, of which more than 700 were completely destroyed, thus depriving more than 2,300 people of shelter. Donald J. Gott and William E. Metzger, Jr. were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the bombing run on 9 November 1944.

On the ground, Saarbrücken was defended by the 347th Infantry Division commanded by Wolf-Günther Trierenberg in 1945. The US 70th Infantry Division was tasked with punching through the Siegfried Line and taking Saarbrücken. As the fortifications were unusually strong, it first had to take the Siegfried Line fortifications on the French heights near Spicheren overlooking Saarbrücken. This &quot;Spichern-Stellung&quot; had been constructed in 1940 after the French had fallen back on the Maginot Line during the Phoney War. The 276th Infantry Regiment attacked Forbach on 19 February 1945, and a fierce battle ensued, halting the American advance at the rail-road tracks cutting through Forbach on 22 February 1945. The 274th and 275th Infantry Regiments took Spicheren on 20 February 1945. When the 274th Infantry Regiment captured the Spicheren Heights on 23 February 1945, after a heavy battle on the previous day, the Germans counter-attacked for days, but by 27 February 1945, the heights were fully under American control. A renewed attack on 3 March 1945, allowed units of the 70th Infantry Division to enter Stiring-Wendel and the remainder of Forbach. By 5 March 1945, all of Forbach and major parts of Stiring-Wendel had been taken. However, fighting for Stiring-Wendel, especially for the &quot;Simon&quot; mine, continued for days. After the German defenders of Stiring-Wendel fell back to Saarbrücken on 12 and 13 March 1945, the 70th Infantry Division still faced a strong segment of the Siegfried Line, which had been reinforced around Saarbrücken as late as 1940. After having the German troops south of the Saar fall back across the Saar at night, the German defenders of Saarbrücken retreated early on 20 March 1945. The 70th Infantry Division flanked Saarbrücken by crossing the Saar north-west of Saarbrücken. The 274th Infantry Regiment entered Saarbrücken on 20 March 1945, fully occupying it the following day, thus ending the war for Saarbrücken.

====After World War II====
In 1945, Saarbrücken temporarily became part of the French Zone of Occupation. In 1947, France created the nominally politically independent Saar Protectorate and merged it economically with France to exploit the area&#x27;s vast coal reserves. Saarbrücken became capital of the new Saar state. A referendum in 1955 came out with over two-thirds of the voters rejecting an independent Saar state. The area rejoined the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, sometimes called &quot;Kleine Wiedervereinigung&quot; (little reunification). Economic reintegration would, however, take many more years. Saarbrücken became capital of the &quot;Bundesland&quot; (federal state) Saarland. After the administrative reform of 1974, the city had a population of more than 200,000.

From 1990 to 1993, students and an arts professor from the town first secretly, then officially, created an invisible memorial to Jewish cemeteries. It is located on the fore-court of the Saarbrücken Castle.

On 9 March 1999 at 4:40 am, there was a bomb attack on the controversial Wehrmachtsausstellung exhibition next to Saarbrücken Castle, resulting in minor damage to the Volkshochschule building housing the exhibition and the adjoining &quot;Schlosskirche&quot; church; this attack did not cause any injuries.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

===Region===
Some of the closest cities are Trier, Luxembourg, Nancy, Metz, Kaiserslautern, Karlsruhe and Mannheim. Saarbrücken is connected by the city&#x27;s public transport network to the town of Sarreguemines in France, and to the neighboring town of Völklingen, where the old steel works were the first industrial monument to be declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994 – the Völklinger Hütte.

==Demographics==
Saarbrücken has a population of about 180,000. In 1957, when Saar Protectorate and Saarbrücken transformed to Saarland and became a part of West Germany, it had a population of about 125,000. In 1960s many Italian guest workers came to Saarbrücken, since then Italians are the largest number of foreigners in Saarbrücken. The 2nd largest foreign groups are the French people due to its former part of France and the fact that Saarbrücken is located on the French border. Saarbrücken reached its highest number of population in 1975 when it had about 205,000 people. With population of about 180,000 people today Saarbrücken is the 2nd smallest German state capital after Schwerin.

==Politics==
===Mayor===

The current mayor of Saarbrücken is Uwe Comradt of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2019. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2019, with a runoff held on 9 June, and the results were as follows:

The city is served by Saarbrücken Airport (SCN), and since June 2007 ICE high speed train services along the LGV Est line provide high speed connections to Paris from Saarbrücken Hauptbahnhof. Saarbrücken&#x27;s Saarbahn (modelled on the Karlsruhe model light rail) crosses the French–German border, connecting to the French city of Sarreguemines.

===Science and education===

Saarbrücken is also the home of the main campus of Saarland University (&quot;Universität des Saarlandes&quot;). There are several research institutes and centres on or near the campus, including:
* the Max Planck Institute for Informatics,
* the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems,
* the Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS),
* the Fraunhofer Institute for Non-destructive Testing,

The Saarland University also has a &quot;Centre Juridique Franco-Allemand&quot;, offering a French and a German law degree program.

The Botanischer Garten der Universität des Saarlandes (a botanical garden) was closed in 2016 due to budget cuts.

The main campus of the Saarland University also houses the office of the Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik computer science research and meeting centre.

Furthermore, Saarbrücken houses the administration of the Franco-German University (&quot;Deutsch-Französische Hochschule&quot;), a French-German cooperation of 180 institutions of tertiary education mainly from France and Germany but also from Bulgaria, Canada, Spain, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain, Russia and Switzerland, which offers bi-national French-German degree programs and doctorates as well as tri-national degree programs.

Saarbrücken houses several other institutions of tertiary education as well:
* the University of Applied Sciences &quot;Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft des Saarlandes&quot;,
* the University of Arts &quot;Hochschule der Bildenden Künste Saar&quot;,
* the University of Music &quot;Hochschule für Musik Saar&quot;, and
* the private Fachhochschule for health promotion and physical fitness &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Prävention und Gesundheitsmanagement&quot;
* the Höhere Berufsfachschule für Wirtschaftsinformatik (HBFS-WI) providing higher vocational education and awarding the degree &quot;Staatlich geprüfte(r) Wirtschaftsinformatiker(in)&quot; (English: &quot;state-examined business business informatics/software engineer&quot;)

Saarbrücken also houses a Volkshochschule.

With the end of coal mining in the Saar region, Saarbrücken&#x27;s Fachhochschule for mining, the &quot;Fachhochschule für Bergbau Saar&quot;, was closed at the beginning of the 21st century. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier&#x27;s &quot;Katholische Hochschule für Soziale Arbeit&quot;, a Fachhochschule for social work, was closed in 2008 for cost cutting reasons. The Saarland&#x27;s Fachhochschule for administrative personnel working for the government, the &quot;Fachhochschule für Verwaltung des Saarlandes&quot;, was moved from Saarbrücken to &quot;Göttelborn&quot; in 2012.

Saarbrücken houses several institutions of primary and secondary education. Notable is the Saarland&#x27;s oldest grammar school, the &quot;Ludwigsgymnasium&quot;, which was founded in 1604 as a latin school. The building of Saarbrücken&#x27;s bi-lingual French-German &quot;Deutsch-Französisches Gymnasium&quot;, founded in 1961 and operating as a laboratory school under the Élysée Treaty, also houses the &quot;École française de Sarrebruck et Dilling&quot;, a French primary school which offers bi-lingual German elements. Together with several Kindergartens offering bi-lingual French-German education, Saarbrücken thus offers a full bi-lingual French-German formal education.

==Sport==

The city is home to several different teams, most notable of which is association football team based at the Ludwigsparkstadion, 1. FC Saarbrücken, which also has a reserve team and a women&#x27;s section.

<text>Abbottabad ( ; Urdu and , ) is a city in the Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It is the 40th largest city in the country and 6th largest in the province by population, and serves as the headquarter of its namesake tehsil and district. It is about north of Islamabad-Rawalpindi and east of Peshawar, at an elevation of . Kashmir lies a short distance to the east.

==Etymology==
The name combines the name of the city founder, Major James Abbott, and the Persian ending &quot;ābād&quot;, meaning &quot;settlement, town of&quot;.

==History==
Following the Second Anglo-Sikh War, The British annexed the entire Punjab region up to Peshawar. Abbottabad was founded in the early 1850s, by a British military officer in the Bengal Army of the British Raj, James Abbott, and replaced Haripur as Hazara&#x27;s capital.

On 9 November 1901, the British established a North-West Frontier Province from the north-western districts of The Punjab. This meant that Abbottabad was now a part of the newly formed province.

Following the Announcement of Partition of the British Raj into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Dominion of India, a referendum was held in the NWFP and the result was in favor of Pakistan. In 1955, Abbottabad and the whole NWFP became a part of West Pakistan, but the province was established again in 1970, and Hazara District and the two tribal agencies were merged to form the new Hazara Division with its capital at Abbottabad.

Osama bin Laden, founder of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, held refuge at a compound in Abbottabad, where he was shot and killed by U.S. forces on 2 May 2011.

Established in 1947, Abbottabad houses the Pakistan Army&#x27;s initial officer training academy, the Pakistan Military Academy, referred to by its acronym, PMA.

Abbottabad was founded and named after Major James Abbott in January 1853 as the headquarters of Hazara District during the British Raj after the annexation of Punjab. He remained the first Deputy Commissioner of the Hazara district from 1845 until April 1853. Major Abbott is noted for having written a poem titled &quot;Abbottabad&quot;, before his return to Britain, in which he wrote of his fondness for the town and his sadness at having to leave it. In 1849, Major Abbott, a Deputy Commissioner appointed by the British East Company, shifted Hazara Gojaran&#x27;s headquarter from Haripur Gojaran to the newly established Abbottabad.

In the early 20th century, Abbottabad became an important military cantonment and sanatorium, serving as the headquarters of a brigade in the Second Division of the Northern Army Corps. The garrison consisted of four battalions of native infantry, of the Frontier Force (including the 5th Gurkha Rifles) and two native mountain batteries.

In 1901, the population of the town and cantonment was 7,764 with an average income of Rs. 14,900. This increased to Rs. 22,300 in 1903, chiefly derived from octroi. During this time chief public institutions were built such as the Albert Victor Unaided Anglo-Vernacular High School, the Municipal Anglo-Vernacular High School and the government dispensary. In 1911, the population had risen to 11,506 and the town contained four battalions of Gurkhas. In June 1948, the British Red Cross opened a hospital in Abbottabad to deal with thousands of injured people being brought in from Kashmir.

===October 2005 earthquake===

In October 2005, Abbottabad was devastated by the Kashmir earthquake. Although most of Abbottabad survived, many older buildings were destroyed or severely damaged.

===Recent events===
On 25 January 2011, Indonesian terrorist Umar Patek was arrested in Abbottabad. Patek, a member of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group, was wanted in connection with a deadly series of church bombings in Indonesia in 2000, and three attacks that killed 202 people in tourist districts of Indonesia in what became known as the Bali bombings.

===Osama bin Laden&#x27;s hideout===
On 2 May 2011, Abbottabad gained worldwide attention when U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed in his compound in the city. In February 2012, nine months after bin Laden was killed, Pakistani authorities demolished the compound where Osama bin Laden had lived.

== Demography ==
==Topography==
Abbottabad is in the Orash Valley lying between 34°92′N latitude and 73°13′E longitude at an altitude of . To the north is the picturesque Kaghan Valley.

==Climate==
Abbottabad has a humid subtropical climate, with mild to warm temperatures during the spring and autumn months, hot temperatures during June and July, and cool to mild temperatures during the winter. The temperature can rise as high as during the mid-summer months and drop below during the extreme cold waves. Snowfall occurs occasionally in December and January, though it is sparse, while heavy rainfall occurs during the monsoon season stretching from July to September and frequently cause flooding in lower lying parts of the city.

==Tourism==
Abbottabad has been attracting tourists to the city since the colonial era, as it is a major transit point to all major tourist regions of Pakistan such as Nathiagali, Ayubia and Naran. According to the Imperial Gazetteer of India, &quot;the town is picturesquely situated at the southern corner of the Rash (Orash) plain, above the sea&quot;.

The Karakoram Highway, which traces one of the paths of the ancient Silk Road, starts from Hasan Abdal on the N5 and heads north passing through the city, eventually reaching Khunjerab Pass. The Karakorum Highway is a major attraction itself for its views. The Karakoram, Himalayas and the Hindu Kush ranges can be approached from Abbottabad, and it continues to be a transit city for tourists, serving as a base for visiting nearby places, such as Hunza, Gilgit, Skardu and Indus Kohistan, of the Karakoram Range.

There was an influx of migrants from Azad Kashmir after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, another from the Swat District during military operations against militants in 2009 and 2010, and from Waziristan after the army launched major operations against the Taliban in 2009. A £19M amusement park is under construction in the city on a site; it includes a zoo, adventure sports facilities, restaurants and artificial waterfalls.

==Education==


Abbottabad has a very healthy literacy rate approximately 56% on an average. The city has a young demographic (ages 15–30) due to the large number of students who have come from across the country to study in its schools, for example PIPS, Army Burn Hall College, Army Public College Kakul and Abbottabad Public School.

The city has a wide variety of post-secondary institutions, such as Ayub Medical College, Frontier Medical College, COMSATS University of Science and Technology, and the University of Engineering &amp; Technology.

Abbottabad is home to the Pakistan Military Academy, a coeducational federal service military academy that provides training to the officers of the Pakistan Army. The academy has three training battalions and 12 companies. Another 2,000 guests each year, from over 34 countries, receive some training at PMA.

According to the &quot;Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2014&quot;, Abbottabad is ranked 37 out of 146 districts in Pakistan in the quality of education. For facilities and infrastructure, the district is ranked 67 out of 146.

<text>Mitanni (–1260 BC), earlier called Ḫabigalbat in old Babylonian texts, ; Hanigalbat or Hani-Rabbat in Assyrian records, or in Egyptian texts, was a Hurrian-speaking state in northern Syria and southeast Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) with Indo-Aryan linguistic and political influences. Since no histories, royal annals or chronicles have yet been found in its excavated sites, knowledge about Mitanni is sparse compared to the other powers in the area, and dependent on what its neighbours commented in their texts.

The Hurrians were in the region as of the late 3rd millennium BC. A king of Urkesh with a Hurrian name, Tupkish, was found on a clay sealing dated at Tell Mozan. The first recorded inscription of their language was of Tish-atal (), king of Urkesh. Later on, Hurrians made up the main population of Mitanni, which was firstly known as &quot;Ḫabigalbat&quot;, at Babylonia, in two texts of the late Old Babylonian period, during the reign of Ammi-Saduqa, (–1618 BC), in low middle chronology.

The Mitanni Empire was a strong regional power limited by the Hittites to the north, Egyptians to the west, Kassites to the south, and later by the Assyrians to the east. At its maximum extent Mitanni ranged as far west as Kizzuwatna by the Taurus Mountains, Tunip in the south, Arraphe in the east, and north to Lake Van. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the Levant of a distinct pottery type, Nuzi ware.

==Etymology==
===Mitanni===

The earliest recorded form of the name of this state is , composed of a Hurrian suffix added to the Indo-Aryan stem , meaning &quot;to unite&quot; and comparable with the Sanskrit verb (; ). The name thus meant the &quot;united kingdom.&quot;

Paralleling the evolution of Proto-Indo-Aryan , meaning , into Sanskrit (), the name evolved into the later form , where the stem had given way to .

Andrea Trameri (15 October 2024), along with Gernot Wilhelm (1997: 290), regards that &quot;Maitani&quot; means &quot;of M(a)itta,&quot; the name of &quot;an individual leader (or clan), and not a territory or population.&quot;

===Ḫani-Rabbat===
The Mitanni kingdom was firstly known as &quot;Ḫabingalbat&quot; before 1600 BC in Babylonia, during the reign of Ammi-Saduqa, attested as &quot;ḫa-bi-in-gal-ba-ti-i&quot;, and &quot;ḫa-bi-in-ga-al-ba-at&quot;, in two texts of the late Old Babylonian period. Egyptians referred to it as &quot;Naharin&quot; and &quot;Mitanni&quot;, it was &quot;Ḫurri&quot; to the Hittites, and &quot;Ḫanigalbat&quot; or &quot;Ḫani-Rabbat&quot; to the Assyrians. These names seem to have referred to the same kingdom and were often used interchangeably, according to Michael C. Astour. Hittite annals mention a people called &quot;Hurri&quot; (&quot;&quot;), located in northeastern Syria. A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of Mursili I, mentions a &quot;King of the Hurri,&quot; and the Assyro-Akkadian version of the text renders &quot;Hurri&quot; as &quot;Hanigalbat&quot;. Tushratta, who styles himself &quot;king of Mitanni&quot; in his Akkadian Amarna letters, refers to his kingdom as Hanigalbat.

The earliest attestation of the term &quot;Ḫanigalbat&quot; can be read in Akkadian, along with the Hittite version mentioning &quot;the Hurrian enemy,&quot; in a copy from the 13th century BC of the &quot;Annals of Ḫattušili I,&quot; who possibly reigned after 1630 BC.

The reading of the Assyrian term &quot;Ḫanigalbat&quot; has a history of multiple renderings. The first portion has been connected to, &quot; &#x27;,&quot; &quot;Hanu&quot; or &quot;Hana,&quot; first attested in Mari to describe nomadic inhabitants along the southern shore of the northern Euphrates region, near the vicinity of Terqa (capital of the Kingdom of Hana) and the Khabur River. The term developed into more than just a designation for a people group, but also took on a topographic aspect as well. In the Middle Assyrian period, a phrase &quot;&quot; &quot;&#x27;,&quot; &quot;cities of the Upper Hanu&quot; has suggested that there was a distinction between two different Hanu&#x27;s, likely across each side of the river. This northern side designation spans much of the core territory of Mitanni state.

The two signs that have led to variant readings are &quot; &#x27;&quot; and its alternative form &quot; &#x27;&quot;. The first attempts at decipherment in the late 19th century rendered forms interpreting &quot;&quot;gal&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;great&quot; in Sumerian, as a logogram for Akkadian &quot;rab&quot; having the same meaning; &quot;Ḫani-Rabbat&quot; denoting &quot;the Great Hani&quot;. J. A. Knudtzon, and E. A. Speiser after him, supported instead the reading of &quot;&quot;gal&quot; on the basis of its alternative spelling with &quot;gal9&quot;, which has since become the majority view.

There is still a difficulty to explain the suffix &quot;-bat&quot; if the first sign did not end in &quot;b&quot;,&quot; or the apparent similarity to the Semitic feminine ending &quot;&quot;-at&quot;,&quot; if derived from a Hurrian word. More recently, in 2011, scholar Miguel Valério, then at the New University of Lisbon provided detailed support in favor of the older reading &quot;Hani-Rabbat&quot;. The re-reading makes an argument on the basis of frequency, where &quot;&quot;gal&quot; not &quot;gal9&quot;,&quot; is far more numerous; the later being the deviation found in six documents, all from the periphery of the Akkadian sphere of influence. It is additionally argued that although they are graphically distinct, there is a high degree of overlap between the two signs, as &quot;&quot;gal9&quot; denotes &quot;dannum&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;&quot; opposed to &quot;great&quot;, easily being used as synonyms. Both signs also represent correlative readings; alternative readings of &quot;&quot;gal9&quot; include &quot;rib&quot; and &quot;rip&quot;,&quot; just like &quot;&quot;gal&quot; being read as &quot;rab&quot;.&quot;

The situation is complicated by there being, according to linguists, three separate dialects of Hurrian, central-western, northern, and eastern.

The Egyptians considered the Euphrates River to form the boundary between Syria and &quot;Naharain&quot;.

==History==
===Early Kingdom===

As early as Akkadian times, Hurrians are known to have lived east of the river Tigris on the northern rim of Mesopotamia, and in the Khabur Valley. The group which became Mitanni gradually moved south into Mesopotamia before the 17th century BC. It was already a powerful kingdom at the end of the 17th century or in the first half of the 16th century BC, and its beginnings date to well before the time of Thutmose I, dating actually to the time of the Hittite sovereigns Hattusili I and Mursili I.

Hurrians are mentioned in the private Nuzi texts, in Ugarit, and the Hittite archives in Hattusa (Boğazköy). Cuneiform texts from Mari mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both &quot;Amurru&quot; (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for Urshum and Hassum, and tablets from Alalakh (layer VII, from the later part of the Old Babylonian period) mention people with Hurrian names at the mouth of the Orontes. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these onomastic sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.

A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of Mursili I, mentions a &quot;King of the Hurrians&quot; (&quot;LUGAL ERÍN.MEŠ Hurri&quot;). This terminology was last used for King Tushratta of Mitanni, in a letter in the Amarna archives. The normal title of the king was &#x27;King of the Hurri-men&#x27; (without the determinative &quot;KUR&quot; indicating a country).
The Egyptian official astronomer and clockmaker Amenemhet (Amen-hemet) apparently ordered to be written on his tomb that he returned from the &quot;foreign country called &quot;Mtn&quot; (&quot;Mi-ti-ni&quot;),&quot; but Alexandra von Lieven (2016) and Eva von Dassow (2022) consider that the expedition to Mitanni could have taken place in pharaoh Ahmose I&#x27;s reign (–1525 BC), actually by Amenemhet&#x27;s father. During the reign of pharaoh Thutmose I (1506–1493 BC), the names Mitanni and Naharin are among the reminiscences of several of the pharaoh&#x27;s officers. One of them, Ahmose si-Abina, wrote: &quot;...His Majesty arrived at Naharin...&quot; Another one, Ahmose pa-Nekhbit, recorded: &quot;...when I captured for him in the land of Naharin...&quot;

After the Battle of Megiddo, an officer of pharaoh Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC), in the pharaoh&#x27;s 22 regnal year, reported: &quot;That [wretched] enemy of Kadesh has come and has entered into Megiddo. He is [there] at this moment. He has gathered to him the princes of [every] foreign country [which had been] loyal to Egypt, as well as (those) as far as Naharin and M[itanni], them of Hurru, them of Kode, their horses, their armies.&quot; In several later military campaigns the Annals of Thutmose III mention Naharin, in particular those of his regnal years 33, 35, and 42. After that time, records become more available from local sources until the empire&#x27;s end in the mid-13th century BC.

The first known use of Indo-Aryan names for Mitanni rulers begins with Shuttarna I who succeeded his father Kirta on the throne. King Barattarna of Mitanni expanded the kingdom west to Aleppo and made the Amorite king Idrimi of Alalakh his vassal, and five generations seems to separate this king (also known as Parattarna) from the rise of Mitanni kingdom. The state of Kizzuwatna in the west also shifted its allegiance to Mitanni, and Assyria in the east had become largely a Mitannian vassal state by the mid-15th century BC. The nation grew stronger during the reign of Shaushtatar, but the Hurrians were keen to keep the Hittites inside the Anatolian highland. Kizzuwatna in the west and Ishuwa in the north were important allies against the hostile Hittites.

Mitanni&#x27;s major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite Empire, Mitanni and Egypt struck an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. After a few successful clashes with the Egyptians over the control of Syria, Mitanni sought peace with them, and an alliance was formed. During the reign of Shuttarna II, in the early 14th century BC, the relationship was very amicable, and he sent his daughter Gilu-Hepa to Egypt for marriage with Pharaoh Amenhotep III. Mitanni was now at its peak of power.
However, by the reign of Eriba-Adad I (1390–1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna II, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs. King Ashur-uballit I (1365–1330 BC) of Assyria attacked Shuttarna and annexed Mitanni territory in the middle of the 14th century BC, making Assyria once more a great power.

At the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession. Eventually Tushratta, a son of Shuttarna, ascended the throne, but the kingdom had been weakened considerably and both the Hittite and Assyrian threats increased. At the same time, the diplomatic relationship with Egypt went cold, the Egyptians fearing the growing power of the Hittites and Assyrians. The Hittite king Suppiluliuma I invaded the Mitanni vassal states in northern Syria and replaced them with loyal subjects.

====Great Syrian War====
The War waged by Suppiluliuma on Tushrata&#x27;s Mitanni was called &#x27;the Great Syrian War&#x27;. The war goals were the Destruction of the Mitanni Heartlands and conquest of its Syrian vassal states. This included persuading Ugarit to join the side of Suppiluliuma. Mukish and Nuhašši retaliated against Ugarit, but once Suppiluliuma arrived, they were defeated by the Hittite-Ugaritic alliance, and Ugarit got a significant portion of their lands annexed to it. Suppiluliuma then crossed the Euphrates and sacking Washukanni, Tushrata escaping with some of his troops before the sack. After which Suppiluliuma turned back to Syria and subjugated Aleppo, Mukish, Niya, Arahtu, Qatna and Nuhašši. This campaign was fought in 1345 BC. A number of years later in 1327 BC Carchemish too was taken after an siege and Tushratta got murdered sometime after the war by Mitannians.

====After the war====
In the capital Washukanni, a new power struggle broke out. The Hittites and the Assyrians supported different pretenders to the throne. Finally a Hittite army conquered the capital Washukanni and installed Shattiwaza, the son of Tushratta, as their vassal king of Mitanni in the late 14th century BC. The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley. The Assyrians had not given up their claim on Mitanni, and in the 13th century BC, Shalmaneser I annexed the kingdom.

The Mitanni dynasty had ruled over the northern Euphrates-Tigris region between and 1350 BC, but succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks, and Mitanni was reduced to the status of a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire between and 1260 BC.

===After the fall of Mitanni===
With the final decline of the Mitanni Empire the western portions of its territory came under direct control of the Hittites and the eastern portions came under direct control of the Assyrians. The middle part continued on as the rump state of Hanigalbat. Eventually, under Shalmaneser I, that remaining part of the former Mitanni territory came under direct Assyrian control. This continued until the decline of Middle Assyrian power after the death of Tukulti-Ninurta I.

While under direct Assyrian control Hanigalbat was ruled by appointed governors such as the Assyrian grand-vizier Ilī-padâ, father of Ninurta-apal-Ekur (1191–1179), who took the title of King of Hanigalbat. He resided in the newly built (over an existing Mitanni tower and residence) Assyrian administrative centre at Tell Sabi Abyad.

The Babylonian Kings List A names the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and his son Ashur-nadin-shumi (700–694) as being &quot;Dynasty of Ḫabigal&quot;.

The name Hanigalbat was still in use as late as the later portion of the 1st millennium BC.

==Indo-Aryan influences==
A number of theonyms, proper names and glosses (technical terminology) of the Mitanni are of Indo-Aryan or Proto-Indo-Aryan origins. Starting from Shuttarna I who is the first Mitanni ruler historically attested to have existed, the Mitanni had Indo-Aryan throne names. The Kikkuli&#x27;s horse training text includes technical terms of Indo-Aryan origin, and the Indo-Aryan deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (Ashvins) are listed and invoked in two treaties found in Hattusa, between the kings Sattiwaza of Mitanni and Šuppiluliuma I the Hittite: (treaty KBo I 3) and (treaty KBo I 1 and its duplicates). The toponym of the Mitanni capital of Washukanni is also &quot;unanimously accepted&quot; to have been derived from an Indo-Aryan dialect. Annelies Kammenhuber (1968) suggested that this vocabulary was derived from the still undivided Indo-Iranian language, but Mayrhofer has shown that specifically Indo-Aryan features are present.

It is generally believed that Indo-Aryan peoples settled in Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria, and established the Kingdom of Mitanni following a period of political vacuum, while also adopting Hurrian. This is considered a part of the Indo-Aryan migrations. Since the late 20th century, the view that the Mitanni kingdom was ruled by royal house and aristocracy of Indo-Aryan origin has been prevalent among the scholars; accordingly, a branch of Indo-Aryans separated from the other Indo-Iranians around the turn of second millennium BCE and migrated into West Asia, hence giving rise to the Mitanni kingdom, while also adopting Hurrian language. Some of the recent studies such as those by Eva von Dassow (2022) and Cotticelli-Kurras and Pisaniello (2023), while noting the modern identification of Mittani as Indo-Aryan and the role of Indo-Aryan speakers in establishing its dynasty, have disputed the significance of Indo-Aryan vocabulary in an otherwise Hurrian-speaking state stating that it does not indicate any Indo-Aryan origins for Mitanni kings. According to Alexander Lubotsky (2023), however, the military elite of the Mitanni kingdom (see Maryannu) was of Aryan descent and their language displays a clear Indo-Aryan character.

Jasper Eidem in 2014 reported on Farouk Ismail&#x27;s earlier study, in reference to the word &quot;marijannu&quot; that was found in a letter from Tell Leilan in northeastern Syria dating to a period slightly before 1761 BC, which is the time when the reign of Zimri-Lim ended in the region of Mari. Kroonen et al. (2018) consider this as an early Indo-Aryan linguistic presence in Syria two centuries prior to the formation of the Mitanni realm, as &quot;mariannu&quot; is generally seen as a Hurrianized form of the Indo-Aryan &quot;*marya&quot;, which means &#x27;man&#x27; or &#x27;youth&#x27;, associated to military affairs and chariots.

==Archaeology==
A concept known as &quot;Dark Age&quot; was applied, until recently, to the archaeological gap between the Middle and Late Bronze Age on Northern Mesopotamian sites, but Costanza Coppini considers it a &quot;transition&quot; instead, which can be called &quot;Late Bronze Age 0,&quot; attested from the Tell Leilan&#x27;s end caused by Samsu-iluna during his 23rd year of reign, c. 1728 BCE [Middle Chronology], to Mitanni&#x27;s predominance (c. 1600-1550 BCE). These are the first traces of what, in the Late Bronze Age I, was Mitanni in historical terms, at the emergence of the third phase of Khabur ware.

The archaeological core zone of Mitanni is Upper Mesopotamia and the Trans-Tigridian region (Northeastern Iraq).

===Upper Mesopotamia===
Sites with Mitannian remains were found mainly in three regions of Upper Mesopotamia: Northeastern Syria Jazira Region, Northern Syria, and Southeastern Turkey (Upper Tigris).

====Northeastern Syria (Jazira Region)====

Mitanni&#x27;s first phase in Jazira Region features Late Khabur Ware from around 1600 to 1550 BC; this pottery was a continuity from the previous non-Mitannian Old Babylonian period. From around 1550 to 1270 BC, Painted Nuzi Ware (the most characteristic pottery in Mitanni times) developed as a contemporary to Younger Khabur Ware.

Mitanni had outposts centred on its capital, Washukanni, whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the Khabur River, most likely at the site of Tell Fekheriye as recent German archaeological excavations suggest. The city of Taite was also known to be a Mitanni &quot;royal city&quot; whose current location is unknown.

The major 3rd millennium urban center of Tell Brak which had dwindled to a minor settlement in Old Babylonian times, saw major development by the Mitanni. Monumental buildings including a palace and temple were constructed on the high ground and a 40 hectare lower town developed. The Mitanni occupation lasted until the site was destroyed (in two phases) between and 1275 BC, presumably by the Assyrians. Two Mitanni-era tablets were found during the modern excavation. One (TB 6002) mentioned &quot;Artassumara the king, son of Shuttarna the king&quot;. Seventeen late period Mitanni tablets were found at Tall Al-Hamidiya.

====Northern Syria====
The oldest tablet issued by an unknown Mitannian king was found in the site of Tell Hammam et-Turkman, dated to c. 1500 BCE.
Mitanni period occupation, between 1400 and 1200 BC (radiocarbon) was found at the site of Tell Bazi. Finds included a Mitanni cylinder seal and several ritual bowls. Two cuneiform tablets of the Mitanni period sealed by Mitanni ruler Saushtatar, one by Artatama I were also found. There is also a record of Mitanni governance at Tell Hadidi (Azu).

====Southeastern Turkey (Upper Tigris)====
The (2017) salvage excavations at the Ilısu Dam in the right bank of upper Tigris, southern Turkey, have shown a very early beginning of Mitanni period, as in the ruins of a temple in Müslümantepe, ritual artefacts and a Mitannian cylinder seal were found, radiocarbon-dated to 1760–1610 BC. Archaeologist Eyyüp Ay, in his (2021) paper, describes the second phase of the temple as an &quot;administrative center, which had craftsmen working in its workshops as well as farmers, gardeners and shepherds, [that] might have been ruled by a priest bound to a powerful Mitannian leader.&quot;

===Trans-Tigridian region (Northeastern Iraq)===
To the east of upper Tigris river, Trans-Tigridian region in northern Iraq, a site now called Bassetki was excavated, which in all likelihood was the ancient town of Mardama with Mitanni layers from 1550 to 1300 BC, as its Phase A9 (in trench T2) may alternatively represent a Middle Bronze/Late Bronze transitional, or Proto-Mitanni occupation within 16th century BC. In a subsequent excavation season, the deeper Phase A10 was identified as having a mix of Middle Bronze and Mitanni potteries, considered to be in the turn of the Middle to the Late Bronze Age transitional period (late 17th – early 16th century BC).

In 2010, the 3,400-year-old ruins of Kemune, a Bronze Age Mitanni palace on the banks of the Tigris in modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan, were discovered. It became possible to excavate the ruins in 2018 and again in 2022 when a drought caused water levels to drop considerably. In the 1st excavation 10 Mitanni-era tablets were found, in Babylonian cuneiform written in Akkadian, bearing Hurrian names, dating to the Middle-Trans-Tigridian IA and IB periods. Middle Trans-Tigridian IA and IB are dated to (-1350 BC) and (-1270 BC) respectively by Peter Pfälzner (2007). In the 2nd excavation the entire city was mapped and 100 Middle Assyrian tablets were discovered. They were dated to after the city&#x27;s destruction by earthquake and have not yet been published.

The three phases of Mitanni at Kurd Qaburstan, were obtained as c. 1538–1505 BC for Phase three, with Phase two beginning c. 1512–1491 BC and ending c. 1501–1479 BC, and with Phase One beginning c. 1489–1463 BC and ending c. 1475–1435 BC. The data suggests a two century abandonment between the MBA destruction and the Mitanni re-occupation.

===Pottery and other characteristics===
At least since around 1550 BC, at the beginning of Late Bronze Age, Painted Nuzi Ware was identified as a characteristic pottery in Mitanni sites. The origin of this decorated pottery is an unsolved question, but a possible previous development as Aegean Kamares Ware has been suggested by Pecorelia (2000); S. Soldi claims that Tell Brak was one of the first centers specializing in the production of this Painted Nuzi Ware, and analyses on samples support the assumption that it was produced locally in various centers throughout the Mitanni kingdom. It was particularly appreciated in Upper Mesopotamia, but appears only sporadically in western Syrian cities such as Alalakh and Ugarit.

At the height of its power, during the 15th and the first half of 14th century BC, a large region from North-West Syria to the Eastern Tigris was under Mitanni&#x27;s control.

==Mitanni rulers==
Mitanni, which first rose to power before 1550 BC, presents the following known kings:
:All dates are Middle chronology
All dates must be taken with caution since they are worked out only by comparison with the chronology of other ancient Near Eastern nations.

===Parattarna I / Barattarna===

King Barattarna is known from a cuneiform tablet in Nuzi and an inscription by Idrimi of Alalakh. He reigned –1480 BC. Egyptian sources do not mention his name; that he was the king of Naharin whom Thutmose III (1479 – 1425 BC) fought against, can only be deduced from assumptions. This king, also known as Parratarna is considered, by J. A. Belmonte-Marin quoting H. Klengel, to have reigned –1490 BC (middle chronology). Parsha(ta)tar, known from another Nuzi inscription (HSS 13 165), an undated inventory list which mentions his death, is considered a different king than Barattarna by M. P. Maidman, Eva von Dassow, and Ian Mladjov.

Thutmose III again waged war in Mitanni in the 33rd year of his rule. The Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish and reached a town called Iryn (maybe present day Erin, 20 km northwest of Aleppo.) They sailed down the Euphrates to Emar (Maskanah) and then returned home via Mitanni. A hunt for elephants at Lake Nija was important enough to be included in the annals.

Victories over Mitanni are recorded from the Egyptian campaigns in &quot;Nuhašše&quot; (middle part of Syria). Barattarna or his son Shaushtatar controlled the North Mitanni interior up to &quot;Nuhašše&quot;, and the coastal territories from Kizzuwatna to Alalakh in the kingdom of Mukish at the mouth of the Orontes. Idrimi of Alalakh, returning from Egyptian exile, could only ascend his throne with Barattarna&#x27;s consent. While he got to rule Mukish and Ama&#x27;u, Aleppo remained with Mitanni.

===Shaushtatar===
Shaushtatar reigned as King of Mitanni –1460 BC. He sacked the Assyrian capital of Assur some time in the 15th century during the reign of Nur-ili, and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to Washukanni. This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of Eriba-Adad I (1390–1366 BC).

The states of Aleppo in the west, and Nuzi and Arrapha in the east, seem to have been incorporated into Mitanni under Shaushtatar as well. A letter (HSS 9 1) sealed with the seal of Shaushtatar was discovered in the house (Room A26) of Prince Šilwa-teššup in Nuzi which lay just north of the main mound. The letter is addressed to Ithia, vassal ruler of Arrapha under Mitanni. Because Šauštatar is not mentioned in the letter and dynastic seals were often used after the reign of a ruler, especially in the periphery of empire, it is difficult to date this letter. Stein, based on various factors, puts the date at . His seal shows heroes and winged geniuses fighting lions and other animals, as well as a winged sun. This style, with a multitude of figures distributed over the whole of the available space, is taken as typically Hurrian. A second seal, belonging to Shuttarna I and found in Alalakh, used by Shaushtatar in two letters (AT 13 and 14) shows a more traditional Post-Akkadian - Ur III style.

During the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep II, Mitanni seems to have regained influence in the middle Orontes valley that had been conquered by Thutmose III. Amenhotep II fought in Syria in 1425 BC, presumably against Mitanni as well, but did not reach the Euphrates.

===Artatama I and Shuttarna II===

Later on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King Shuttarna II himself was received at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Three Amarna letters (EA 182 EA 183 and EA 185) were sent by Shutarna with two being sent from &quot;Mušiḫuna&quot;. Mitanni was especially interested in Egyptian gold. This culminated in a number of royal marriages: the daughter of King Artatama I was married to Thutmose IV. Kilu-Hepa, or Gilukhipa, the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or Tadukhipa, the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.

When Amenhotep III fell ill, the king of Mitanni sent him a statue of the goddess Shaushka (Ishtar) of Nineveh that was reputed to cure diseases. A more or less permanent border between Egypt and Mitanni seems to have existed near Qatna on the Orontes River; Ugarit was part of Egyptian territory.

The reason Mitanni sought peace with Egypt may have been trouble with the Hittites. A Hittite king called Tudḫaliya I conducted campaigns against Kizzuwatna, Arzawa, Ishuwa, Aleppo, and maybe against Mitanni itself. Kizzuwatna may have fallen to the Hittites at that time.

===Artashumara and Tushratta===
Artašumara, reigned -1358 BC, is known only from a single mention in a tablet found in Tell Brak: &quot;Artassumara the king, son of Shuttarna the king,&quot; and a mention in Amarna letter 17. According to the later, after the death of Shuttarna II he briefly took power but was then murdered (by someone named Tuhi) and succeeded by his brother Tushratta, who reigned -1335 BC.

Knowledge of Tushratta comes from two sources, the Amarna letters and the texts of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaties between Hittite ruler Suppiluliuma I and a son of Tushratta named Shattiwaza. These pair of treaties found at the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa codify the Mitanni Shattiwaza, probable son of Tushratta, entering the status of vassal to Suppiluliuma I. One (CTH 51, also known as KBo I 1) includes a historical prologue from the Hittite point of view which is complete, this tablet also confirms that the existing Hittite treaty with Artatama II is still in effect so perhaps Suppiluliuma was hedging his bets. The other (CTH 52) includes a historical prologue from the Mitanni point of view which is partially lost though another fragment to this tablet was found in recent years. These prologues provide information about the events of the time of Tushratta but must be considered under the self interest of the two treaty parties. While the preambles of the treaties are a later retrospective and are filtered through the interests of the treaty parties, the tablets found in Egypt provide direct information. Eight Amarna letters were sent to pharaoh Amenhotep III (including EA 19 and EA 23) and four to pharaoh Akhenaten (including EA 27). A single Amarna letter was sent by Tushratta to Queen Tiye, wife of Amenhotep III, mother of Akhenaten and grandmother of Tutankhamun (EA 26). A note in hieratic on the tablet stated that EA 23 arrived in the 36th year of Amenhotep III reign or roughly 1350 BC in the standard Egyptian Chronology.

Some of the Amarna letters covered minor matters between Tushratta and the pharaohs. Amenhotep III asked for Tushratta&#x27;s daughter Tadukhipa in marriage and after some back and forth over bride-price she traveled to Egypt and became a wife of the pharaoh. And when that pharaoh was ill near the end of his reign Tushratta sent (EA 23) the Hurrian goddess Šauška of Nineveh (actually her cult statue) to him as had been done in the time of Shuttarna II. The main focus of the Amarna letters, though, was a consequence of the realignment of power in Syria with the decline of Egyptian influence and rise of Hittite power, with a number of lesser powers caught in the middle. In the first letter from Tusratta he claimed to have destroyed the Hittite forces that had invaded his territory and included a selection of the booty, including a chariot and several slaves. In later letters we see the Hittite ruler working to improve previously poor relations with the pharaoh so as to counterbalance Mitanni. According to other Amarna letters (EA 85, EA86, EA95) from Rib-Hadda, king of Byblos, Tushratta personally joined a large Mitanni raid into Amurru. In another Amarna letter (EA 75) Rib-Hadda tells Ahkenaten that all the lands of the Mitanni have been conquered by the Hittites but its date is uncertain.

The Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty says:
Tusratta faced a difficult situation, an ascendant Hittite New Kingdom in the west and in the east an Assyrian power beginning to free itself of Mitanni control at the start of the Middle Assyrian Period. A rule book-ended by succession crises. With no Mitanni or Assyrian records we are left with the historical claims of the Hittite king, for better or worse. In summary they are:

*Political - With the death of Shutarna II a crisis involving Tushratta and Artashumara resulted in Tushratta taking the throne. To counter this the Hittites entered a treaty with another brother Artatama II, which did not pan out. Then, after a reasonably long reign (based on the timing of Amarna letters), Tushratta is killed by his son (unnamed but generally thought to be Shuttarna III) who then allies with the Assyrians to take power in Mitanni with Assyria getting some Mitanni territory in exchange. Another son of Tushratta, Shattiwaza, then becomes a vassal of the Hittite king in exchange for help retaking part of the Mitanni territory (with the rest going to the Suppiluliuma&#x27; son Piyassili made king of Carchemish). And this comes to pass. Note that the original treaty with Artatama II is specifically kept in force, suggesting he outlived Tushratta.
*Military - Tushratta having insulted the Hittite king, perhaps by refusing to be deposed, Suppiluliuma launched two campaigns against Mitanni interests, a &quot;One Year War&quot; and a &quot;Six Year War&quot;. The first war is believed to have occurred roughly in the 15th regnal year of Ahkenaten. It is unclear how much time passes between them. Though unsuccessful at defeating Tushratta, the military efforts do manage to seize control of several Mitanni vassals/allies, including Kizzuwatna, Amurru, Aleppo, and Nuhašše.

===Shattiwaza===
Shattiwaza reigned –1305 BC, (alternately Šattiwaza, Kurtiwaza, or Mattiwaza). What little is known about his period, like the later parts of the reign of his father, Tushratta, all comes from the partially recovered pair of Hittite texts in which Shattiwaza becomes a vassal of Hittite king Suppiluliuma I. The first text (CTH 51) lays out the condition of vassalage and in the second (CTH 52) Shattiwaza accepts these conditions. The text can be difficult to interpret because of gaps and the obtuse prose. The Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty reads:

The best that can be parsed out of the Hittite text is that some (unnamed) son killed the prior king Tushratta resulting in a succession crisis between Atratama II, brother of Tushratta, Shuttarna III, son of Tusratta, and Shattiwaza. son of Tushratta. The Hittites then made a treaty with Atratama II (still in effect as of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty). Some combination of Atratama II and Shuttarna III made an alliance with the Assyrians to hold power in Mitanni. returning cultic items taken when Mitanni king Shaushtatar sacked Asshur . This resulted in Shattiwaza going to Hittite king Suppiluliuma and declaring vassalage in exchange for Hittite military assistance. This ploy succeeded as the Hittite forces carried the day but the cost, besides becoming a vassal, was the ceding of some Mitanni territory to the Hittites, subsequently ruled by the king&#x27;s son Piyassili as King of Carchemesh. As part of the agreement Shattiwaza would marry a daughter of Suppiluliuma as Queen and would be allowed ten wives but none of the other wives could be primary and the children from his marriage with the Queen would succeed. The Hittite text does include some tidbits about the war of succession which are hard to interpret. At one point the Hurrian nobles were taken to Taite and &quot;crucified&quot; though that practice was unknown in the ancient Near East until classical times. And at one point Shattiwaza flees to the Kassites with 200 chariots but the Kassites impounded the chariots and tried to kill him, which he mirsculously escapes and finds his way to Suppiluliuma. After presumably ascending the throne of what was left of Mitanni, Shattiwaza is lost to history.

===Shattuara I===

Shattuara reigned –1285 BC. The royal inscriptions of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (–1275 BC) relate how the vassal king Shattuara of Mitanni rebelled and committed hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara was related to the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza&#x27;s one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King Mursili II, but there is no exact date.

===Wasashatta===

According to an inscription (BM 115687) by Assyrian king Adad-nirari I, Shattuara&#x27;s son Wasashatta (also read Uasašatta), who reigned -1265 BC, attempted to rebel. He sought Hittite help which did not come. The Hittites took Wasashatta&#x27;s money but did not help. The Assyrians expanded further, and conquered the royal city of Taidu, and took Washukanni, Amasakku, Kahat, Shuru, Nabula, Hurra and Shuduhu as well. They conquered Irridu, destroyed it utterly and sowed salt over it. The wife, sons and daughters of Wasashatta were taken to Ashur, together with much booty and other prisoners. As Wasashatta himself is not mentioned, he may have escaped capture. There is a letter (KBo. 1, 14) from a Hittite king (to probably the Egyptian king) referring to a &quot;King of Hanigalbat&quot; which was possibly Wasašatta.

===Shattuara II===

According to the royal annals (A.0.77.1) of Assyrian king Shalmaneser I (1270s–1240s) King Shattuara II of Hanigalbat, rebelled against Assyrian control with the help of the Hittites and the nomadic Ahlamu around 1250 BC. Shalmaneser I claimed to have defeated the Hittites and Mitanni slaying 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were &quot;turned into rubble mounds,&quot; and Shalmaneser &quot;slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies.&quot; The cities from Taidu to Irridu were captured, as well as all of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the restoration of a temple to god Adad in Kahat, a city of Mitanni that must have been occupied as well.

<text>MacArthur Park (originally Westlake Park) is a park dating back to the late 19th century in the Westlake neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. In the early 1940s, it was renamed after General Douglas MacArthur, and later designated City of Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument #100.

The lake in MacArthur Park is fed by natural springs (although an artificial bottom to the lake was laid during the construction of the Red Line, opened in 1993). In the past, a fountain with a reflecting pool on the northern end was also fed by the springs. The Westlake/MacArthur Park B and D Line station is across the street.

== Description ==
The park is divided in two by Wilshire Boulevard. The southern portion primarily consists of a lake, while the northern half includes an amphitheatre, bandshell, soccer fields, and children&#x27;s playground, along with a recreation center operated by the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. The bandshell was once home to many organizations and events, such as Jugaremos en Familia (a live event hosted by Memo Flores for the Hispanic community).

Public artworks installed in the park have included the MacArthur Monument, &quot;Entry Arch&quot;, &quot;General Harrison Gray Otis&quot;, the Hungarian Freedom Fighters Memorial, &quot;MacArthur Park Singularity&quot;, &quot;Mine Was the Better Punch, But It Didn&#x27;t Win the Wristwatch&quot;, and &quot;Prometheus Bringing Fire to Earth&quot;. Previously, the statue of Charles III of Spain was installed in the park.

== History ==

The park, originally named Westlake Park, was built in the 1880s, along with a similar Eastlake Park, whose lake is artificial, in Los Angeles. Westlake Park was renamed May 7, 1942; Eastlake Park was renamed Lincoln Park. Both Westlake and Eastlake (as well as Echo Park) were built as drinking water reservoirs connected to the city&#x27;s system, Zanja Madre. When the city abandoned the non-pressurized &quot;zanja&quot; system for a pressurized pipe system, these smaller, shallow reservoirs located at low points no longer provided much benefit and were converted into parks.

The park was named for Henricus Wallace Westlake, a Canadian physician who had moved to Los Angeles around 1888, settled in the area and donated a portion of his property to the city for a park.

In the mid-19th century the area was a swampland; by the 1890s, it was a vacation destination, surrounded by luxury hotels. In the early part of the 20th century, the Westlake neighborhood became known as the Champs-Élysées of Los Angeles.
Wilshire Boulevard formerly ended at the lake, but in 1934 a berm was built for it to cross and link up with the existing Orange Street (which ran from Alvarado to Figueroa Streets) into downtown Los Angeles. Orange Street was renamed Wilshire and extended east of Figueroa Street to Grand Avenue. This divided the lake into two halves; the northern one was subsequently drained. From the 1940s, the lake featured the rental of electric boats, with the names of comic book animal characters.

According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; news story from 1956, two swans, named Rudie and Susie, hatched their five new cygnets on the island in MacArthur Park Lake, and according to the park superintendent, these were the first swans born in the park in over a decade.

For many years, Filipino World War II veterans protested in the park named after their former commander regarding promises made when they enlisted that the United States had reneged on. In 2009 as part of the stimulus package, Congress awarded lump-sum payments of $15,000 to Filipino veterans who are American citizens and $9,000 to those who are noncitizens.

MacArthur Park became known for violence after 1985 when prostitution, drug dealing, shoot-outs, and the occasional rumored drowning became commonplace, with as many as 30 murders in 1990. When the lake was drained in 1973 and 1978, hundreds of handguns and other firearms were found disposed of in the lake.

=== May Day Mêlée with the Los Angeles Police Department ===

Two May Day rallies calling for U.S. citizenship for undocumented immigrants were held at MacArthur Park on May 1, 2007. When the protest overflowed onto city streets, police drove motorcycles through the crowd, then ordered the crowd to disperse. Some people began throwing plastic bottles and rocks at officers. Members of the Los Angeles Police Department then used batons and rubber bullets in a manner later found by the LAPD&#x27;s own investigation, as well as by the courts, to be excessive. After community mobilization, pressure from the Mayor, and an extensive internal review, LAPD Chief William Bratton apologized, the commanding officer was demoted, seventeen other officers faced penalties, and the LAPD paid more than $13 million in damages.

=== Redevelopment ===

Beginning in 2002, the Los Angeles Police Department and business and community leaders led a redevelopment effort that has led to the installation of surveillance cameras, the opening of a recreation center, increased business, early-morning drink vendors, a new Metro station, the return of the paddle boats and the fountain, and large community festivals attracting thousands. Along with determined campaigns to improve community relations between the neighborhood and the police, crime rates went down through the mid-2000s.

In 2007, Levitt Pavilion Los Angeles opened, offering 50 free concerts each summer and attracting a wide range of audiences from around the country and globally. Currently programmed &amp; produced (as of 2017) by local resident Matthew Himes, notable acts that have performed include Celso Pina, Fishbone, Bomba Estereo, La Sonora Dinamita, Jimmy Webb, Kinky, La Resistencia, Nortec Collective and many more. In the same year, the paddle boats returned. They were available for rent on the weekends in 2009. By early 2010, the boathouse was closed. Eventually, the paddle boats were removed. The boathouse was demolished in 2014.

The MacArthur Park bandshell was painted by local artists and graffiti artists under the direction of Otis Parsons. Some of the artists involved were: Robert Williams, Skill, John &quot;Zender&quot; Estrada, Hector &quot;Hex&quot; Rios, Geo, Exit, Trip, Hate Prime, Relic, Galo &quot;MAKE&quot; Canote, RickOne and others. Some of the artwork was featured in the book &quot;Spraycan Art&quot; by Henry Chalfant and Jim Prigoff.

The lakeside portion of the park closed for 10 weeks in October 2021.

=== Crime ===

The area surrounding MacArthur Park, one of the poorest areas of Los Angeles, has widely reported crime rates. Considered to be MS-13 territory, many poorer locals of the area, especially those doing illicit business in the park, are forced to pay a &quot;tax&quot; to the gang in exchange for being left alone. In 2021, multiple attacks on transgender sex workers in the park had led to increased police presence and were widely reported.

== In popular culture ==
MacArthur Park has been used as a filming location numerous times. In &quot;Hard Luck&quot; (1921), Buster Keaton eludes the police by posing with a statue in the park. In &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; (1923), Charlie Chaplin uses the north side of the park and the Ansonia in two scenes. MacArthur Park/Westlake Park and its boats figure prominently as the scene of a murder in the 1949 film noir &quot;Killer Bait&quot; (also known as &quot;Too Late for Tears&quot;) with Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea and Arthur Kennedy. 

In 1973, &quot;The Phantom of Herald Square&quot; an episode of the TV horror anthology series &quot;Circle of Fear&quot; included a significant number of scenes filmed within the park, as well as &quot;The Bank Examiner Swindle&quot; (season 9, episode 6 of &quot;Dragnet&quot;) and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (1977), and &quot;72 Hours&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, wherein Carlton plans to conduct illegal sales of counterfeit merchandise in the park, hoping to prove his street cred to Will and his friends.

It is featured in the Gym Class Heroes music video for Cupid&#x27;s Chokehold (the &quot;As Cruel as School Children&quot; version) and Lorde&#x27;s 2017 music video for &quot;Green Light&quot;.

The movie &quot;In MacArthur Park&quot; (1976) was written and directed by Bruce Schwartz.

The 1968 hit song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, written by Jimmy Webb and originally recorded by Richard Harris and later famously covered by Donna Summer, was inspired by this location.

In an episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, the park is humorously suggested as a place to visit by a hotel concierge.

<text>The KL Monorail Line is the only operational monorail system in Malaysia. Operated as part of the Rapid KL system by Rapid Rail, a subsidiary of Prasarana Malaysia, it is one of the components of the [[Klang Valley Integrated Transit System]]. The line is numbered 8 and coloured light green on official transit maps.

Due to improper infrastructure planning and the inadequate size of the rolling stock (to transport a large number of passengers in or out of the downtown Kuala Lumpur area during rush hour), the KL Monorail is commonly cited as the most unsatisfactory rail line of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System.

==History==
This urban monorail line was opened on 31 August 2003, with 11 stations running on two parallel elevated tracks. It connects the KL Sentral transport hub in the south and Titiwangsa in the north with the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;, a commercial, shopping, and entertainment area consisting of the Bukit Bintang area, and surrounded by &quot;Jalan Imbi&quot;, &quot;Jalan Bukit Bintang&quot;, Jalan Sultan Ismail, and &quot;Jalan Raja Chulan&quot;.

The monorail scheme was announced by Kuala Lumpur City Hall in January 1990 after the Malaysian Government gave the go-ahead to the scheme at a cabinet meeting in June 1989. Its cost was then estimated at RM 143 million. The , 22-station system is designed to carry more than 34,000 passengers a day on a 20-minute loop through Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s bustling commercial core. The plan is to build it in two phases: in the first, 16 stations will be served over ; and in the later stage, another loop will be added. The first phase was expected to be completed within two years.

According to plans dating back to the 1990s, the planned line was to have two branches (similar to the Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines), with one branch going via Maharajalela station and then on to the city centre, and the other branch going to Mid Valley, Abdullah Hukum, Jalan Klang Lama and ending at Kampung Pasir, which will probably include integration with KTM Komuter&#x27;s Port Klang Line at Petaling or Pantai Dalam stations. KL Sentral and Tun Sambanthan were planned to be the common stations. Ultimately only the downtown branch was built, due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

While another plan from Kuala Lumpur People-Mover Rapid Transit (PRT), under the &quot;Kuala Lumpur Linear City&quot; development plan, depicts that the project will include building of twin track monorail guideway beams, 20 elevated stations, two depots and 14 monorail trains. There will be two phases to the project&#x27;s construction. Between Jalan Tun Razak and Brickfields, Section 1 will span approximately 8 kilometres, while Section 2 would connect Tun Sambanthan and KL Sentral Station via a 12-stop shuttle service. Section 2, which is unfinished and spans , begins in Brickfields and travels via Kampung Abdullah Hukum, Lembah Pantai, Pantai Dalam, Taman Desa, OUG, and finally ends at Kampung Pasir. KL PRT Sdn Bhd would oversee the project management while carrying out the PRT transport system&#x27;s construction, upkeep, and operation during the course of a 30-year concession. The PRT system planned to accommodate up to 18,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd) with 168 seats in each train and 630 passengers per train at a headway of up to two minutes between trains. The first section of the project, which runs between P. Ramlee Station and Hang Tuah Station, was supposed to be finished in time for trial runs during the Commonwealth Games in September 1998. Construction on the project started in December 1996 and Sections 1 and 2 were scheduled to be finished in early 1999 and 2000 respectively.

Work was scheduled to begin in June 1990, but was postponed to May 1991 after the city&#x27;s mayor complained that tenders submitted for preparatory work were too high. There has been no activity on the project since and few details are available on how the project is expected to proceed. The main contractor is a local company, BNK, which had little success in its search for backers to finance its share of the venture. Part of its problem in securing money stems from the project&#x27;s escalating cost estimates, and part from its lack of a track record in handling such huge projects.

Construction was re-initiated by Hitachi, Ltd., but the 1997 Asian financial crisis led to cessation of work in December 1997. When work was resumed in July 1998, MTrans Holdings took over, locally manufacturing its own rolling stock and completing the project to save cost; the line was completed at a cost of MYR 1.18 billion.

As the line was opened in 2003, it was agreed that the parent company and owner of the KL Monorail Line, KL Monorail System Sdn Bhd (KLMS) under its parent company KL Infrastructure Group (KL Infra), would hold a 40-year concession to operate the monorail. The line and number of stations remains unchanged since 2003. Based on 1999 transit map, Originally KL monorail line have 19 stations, start from Titiwangsa, Chow Kit, Wawasan, P. Ramlee, Raja Chulan, Bukit Bintang, Imbi, Hang Tuah, Merdeka, Sultan Sulaiman (cancelled), Tun Sambanthan, subsequently unbuild line from Syed Putra, Taman Seputeh, Abdullah Hukum, Lembah Pantai, Pantai Dalam, Taman Desa, OUG and Kampung Pasir.

Since the start of operations, the KL Infrastructure Group suffered losses due largely to depreciation and interest repayment costs. For the financial year to 30 April 2004, KL Infra posted a net loss of MYR 46.24 million on a MYR 15.08 million revenue. KL Infra had also taken up a MYR 300 million Malaysian government loan and a MYR 260 million infrastructure loan from the Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad (BPMB) (The development bank of Malaysia) (, BPM). In addition, KL Infra had proposed to buy MTrans&#x27; three subsidiary companies to improve its business, but failed after Scomi bought up some of the targeted companies.

===Government takeover===
In April 2007, talks were under way between KL Infra and the government and the Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Berhad to sell the KL Monorail Line to the Prasarana Malaysia, which then had already owned both the Kelana Jaya line and the Ampang line, as well as 10% of KL Infra shares. KL Infra was cited as intending to exit Malaysia&#x27;s monorail business. The takeover is part of the government&#x27;s master plan to improve the urban public transport sector.

SPN gave its agreement in principle to the takeover on 22 December 2006 and a follow-up meeting was held on 6 February 2007 with the government on the takeover of its operational assets and assumption of loan liabilities. A due diligence audit was conducted from 5 March 2007 to 27 April 2007 by consultants appointed by the government. Following agreement to the takeover, BPM granted KL Monorail an extension until 29 April 2007 for an interest repayment amounting to MYR 4,244,801.91, which was originally due on 29 December 2006.

However, the takeover seemed to have suffered a setback at least from the perspective of KL Infra when on 26 March 2007, it was notified by BPM that it was not going to entertain any further extensions for interest repayment. Subsequently on 27 April 2007, the bank notified that it would not be granting any moratorium on interest repayments. On 29 April 2007, KL Monorail was not able to make the repayment of the interest instalment which had become due.

On 3 May 2007, KL Monorail was issued a default notice by BPM which sought repayment of the entire principal sum of MYR 609,616,423.73 and capitalised interest of MYR 296,428,910.88 totalling MYR 906,045,334.61. The company was granted seven days from that day to repay the entire sum, which it failed to do. On 14 May 2007, Mohd Anwar Bin Yahya and Cho Choo Meng were appointed receivers and managers by Amanah Raya, the Security Trustee for BPM. Nevertheless, the takeover process is still deemed ongoing, KL Infra stating that it will continue to engage the government and BPM to address the proposed takeover of KL Monorail by Prasarana based on earlier discussions and an approval in principle.

One of the effects of the appointment of receivers and managers is the possibility that KL Infra will not be receiving any compensation for KL Monorail should the takeover by SPN go through.

The trading of KL Infra was suspended from 15 May 2007. On the same day, KL Infra&#x27;s board announced to Bursa Malaysia that it had formed the opinion that it was not solvent and would not be able to pay all its debts in full within a period not exceeding twelve months. On 28 November 2007, Prasarana Malaysia signed a sale-and-purchase agreement with KL Monorail Systems, effectively making Prasarana the operator of KL Monorail, and resulting in Prasarana taking over the MYR 882 million BPM loan.

==List of stations==

The line consists of a single dual-way line that links areas of inner Kuala Lumpur not served by rail transport, namely Brickfields, Bukit Bintang, and Chow Kit, with existing LRT, MRT, ERL and KTM Komuter stations at KL Sentral, Muzium Negara, Hang Tuah, Bukit Bintang, Bukit Nanas, Medan Tuanku and Titiwangsa. The two termini are on a single track with a Spanish solution layout.

The stations are designed as elevated structures with ticketing facilities on either the ground level (as seen in the KL Sentral station) or the first-floor level. The platforms are on the top floor, separated from the monorail lines by fencing. They were originally covered by large canvas roofs, which were replaced in 2014 by aluminium zinc roofs. Certain stations are situated above roadways, or are slightly longer than others. Each station used to be designated with a sponsor, with route maps associating each station with a particular product brand.

The depot is between KL Sentral and Tun Sambanthan.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;

===Expansion===
To some extent, the line has been designed to accommodate future expansion. While some stations are significantly longer than the current two-car sets, providing room for longer train sets, extension works for other stations have been necessary. An expansion project known as the KL Monorail Fleet Expansion project is being carried out by Prasarana to ensure a more efficient and user-friendly monorail services in the future. The installation of the Platform Automatic Gate System (PAGS) is one such work under the project. This gate system is necessary to improve passenger safety as before this, there are no barriers between the passenger platforms and the tracks and this may pose dangers to the users. The project also includes the installation of a new signalling system, construction of a new depot to accommodate larger train sets, and other station upgrades and universal access facilities.

An example of station upgrades is at Bukit Bintang station. Touted as one of the busiest stations of the line due to its proximity to Bukit Bintang, the hub of shopping and entertainment in Kuala Lumpur, it used to have only one exit, but the upgrading project now provided the station with added an alternative entrance and exit walkway and a direct entry to the Lot 10 and Sungei Wang Plaza shopping complexes. The monorail station is also equipped with new ticket vending machines and ticketing gates. Other than that, escalators and lifts as well as a new Customer Service Office are also provided. Another example is at the second busiest monorail station, Kuala Lumpur Sentral station, where the Nu Sentral Mall overhead bridge becomes the new entrance to the station. Previously, monorail users needed to exit KL Sentral and cross the busy main thoroughfare in Brickfields to reach the station. The completion of the overhead bridge now enables customers to travel between KL Sentral and the monorail station safely and conveniently.

The main goal of the fleet expansion project is, however, the introduction of new, state-of-the-art four-car trains. Two four-car trains have been introduced to the public while the rest will be delivered in stages until the fourth quarter of 2015. The new four-car trains can accommodate up to 430 passengers per trip and could significantly reduce the waiting time for passengers. They are also more comfortable and spacious than the prevoious two-car trains. After all sets of four-car trains have been delivered and commissioned, the two-car sets, which have been in operation since 2003, would be retired. Besides having a larger capacity, the new trains are also fitted with better safety features including open-door windows, on-board closed-circuit television cameras and &quot;run-flat&quot; features, which allow the trains to continue moving in the event of a puncture.

==Rolling stock==

=== 2-car ALWEG rolling stock ===
The first trains used on the KL Monorail line were 10 sets permanently coupled two-car trains of a similar design to the Seattle Center Monorail&#x27;s ALWEG trains. Each monorail train can accommodate 158 passengers during regular operations. The monorail carriages themselves were constructed by Scomi Rail, a Malaysian monorail manufacturer, at the Scomi Rail plant in Rawang, which also featured its own tracks for monorail train tests. In June 2017, the monorail was operated solely using 6 sets two-car trains. As of December 2022, all two-car trains had been fully withdrawn from service.

=== 4-car Scomi SUTRA rolling stock ===

KL Monorail subsequently began upgrading its rolling stock to brand-new, four-car trains. These were also manufactured by Scomi, this time to the company&#x27;s in-house-developed SUTRA design, which was also ordered by the Mumbai Monorail line in India. Each of these trains can accommodate 430 passengers per trip, compared with 213 passengers for the two-car trains. The new trains are equipped with four closed-circuit television cameras and space for wheelchairs and strollers.

The first two sets four-car trains entered service in December 2014, with the remaining units scheduled to be arriving in stages. While they were initially all scheduled to be in operation by the end of 2015, only five have been delivered so far. They were taken out of service in May 2017 due to safety reasons. Three of the four-car trains have been reinstated in August 2019, with two more expected to re-enter service in November of the same year. In 2019 KL monorail service is operated using five sets 4-car trains and four sets 2-car trains. Once delivery of the remaining 7 sets of four-car trains is complete, the original ALWEG two-car trains will be decommissioned.

==Ridership==
The monthly ridership increased from 341,850 passengers in September 2003 to 1.18 million passengers in August 2004. In January 2007, the monorail attained its 50 millionth passenger since its opening. On 29 July 2009, the monorail reportedly reached the 100 million passenger mark.

==Accident and incidents==
===David Chelliah accident===
Prior to the opening, on 16 August 2002 an accident occurred during a test run involving a safety wheel falling off a train and hitting the head of a pedestrian walking under the monorail viaduct at Jalan Sultan Ismail. The victim, David Chelliah, a journalist, suffered injuries that required hospitalisation.

On 7 March 2003, Chelliah filed a MYR 5 million negligence suit against the companies involved in the design, installation and operation of the trains, as well as the Director-General of Railways. On 8 April 2003, the High Court ruled that the Monorail company was liable for the incident, but not the Director-General of Railways. Although the monorail company reported that any such accident was &quot;unlikely&quot; as six bolts would have to be removed for it to occur and furthermore, a check of all 23 other safety wheels on the train involved did not turn up any other issues, the high court judgement ruled that the monorail company &quot;failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to how the safety wheel had come off the train and instead relied on the possibility that there had been tampering by unknown persons&quot;.

As a result of this accident, the launch of the monorail was postponed.

===Burst tyre incident===
On 22 January 2005, a pneumatic load tyre suddenly burst and caused two women passengers to be injured. The train, carrying about 30 passengers, was about to move from Chow Kit station to Titiwangsa station when the incident occurred at about 8.50pm. The burst tyre caused a rubber sidewall panel to flip open which then hit the side of a passenger seat and injured a woman&#x27;s legs and another woman&#x27;s hands. Train services were suspended for about 30 minutes following the incident.

===Breakdown===
On 11 August 2012, a train stalled near Tun Sambanthan in Brickfields. The breakdown caused 183 passengers to be trapped for about two hours. The air conditioning system in the carriage stopped functioning when the power supply was cut. As a result, some passengers had to break the windows to allow air in while awaiting rescue. Fire and Rescue Department personnel later used a skylift to rescue passengers trapped in the carriage. Investigation revealed that the issue was due to a power supply disruption at the circuit breaker, causing the auxiliary power system to fail.

Six days later, another breakdown occurred. A train stalled between Imbi and Bukit Bintang for about 30 minutes, trapping around 200 passengers. This time however, there was power in the train and the air-conditioning system was functional. Train services resumed after half an hour.

===Titiwangsa station fire===
On 30 March 2015, a monorail service was temporarily delayed when a tyre of a two-car train coach caught fire at the Titiwangsa Station. The scene was recovered hours later.

===Maharajalela station fire===
On 24 December 2020, at around 7:15am a KL Monorail train bound for KL Sentral was approaching the Maharajalela station when one of its tires burst, catching fire. While the Scomi&#x27;s 4-car train set 24 sustained significant damage, there are no injuries/casualties reported in the incident.

===Tyre fire===
On 19 December 2023, a coach guide tyre caught fire and fell from the coach onto the road underneath. The incident happened near Titiwangsa Station. The train was halted and passengers evacuated while the fire brigade dealt with the fire. There were no casualties.

===Tree collapsed nearby monorail tracks===
On 7 May 2024, a 50-year old tree near Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur collapsed on Jalan Sultan Ismail, hitting 17 vehicles and the nearby monorail tracks, causing one death and 1 injured. The monorail service was disrupted, with temporary suspension of stations between KL Sentral and Medan Tuanku stations for cleaning and repair of the tracks. Normal services resumed at 5.00 pm the next day.

==Proposed extension==

*Phase 1: from KL Sentral to Happy Garden/Jalan Klang Lama (part of the original 1990s proposal)
*Phase 2: from Happy Garden to Sunway (replaced by LRT Kelana Jaya Line extension and BRT Sunway Line)
*Phase 3: from Titiwangsa to Matrade

<text>Freedom of information in the United States relates to the public&#x27;s ability to access government records, meetings, and other information. In the United States, freedom of information legislation exists at all levels of government: federal level, state level, and local level.

==Federal level==
Since the founding of the United States, the public&#x27;s right to know the affairs of their government has been foundational democracy. James Madison wrote during the United States Constitutional Convention, &quot;The right of freely examining public characters and measures and free communication, is the only effective guardian of every other right.&quot;

Several federal laws have strengthened the public&#x27;s ability to access public records.

===Federal legislation===

The most important was the Freedom of Information Act, signed into law on July 4, 1966, by President Lyndon Johnson.

* Administrative Procedure Act PL 79-404; 1946
* Freedom of Information Act PL 85-619; 1966
* Federal Advisory Committee Act PL 92-463; 1972
* Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act PL 93-344; 1974
* Government in the Sunshine Act PL 94-409; 1976
* Inspector General Act PL 95-452; 1978
* Ethics in Government Act PL 95-521; 1978
* Presidential Records Act PL 95-591; 1978
* Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments PL 104-231; 1996

===Proposed legislation===
* FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) - would amend the FOIA to speed up the response time and ease of making a &quot;FOIA request&quot;, among other changes.

===Miscellaneous Authoritative Federal Sources===
*Executive Order 13233, drafted by Alberto R. Gonzales and issued by George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, is used to limit the FOIA by restricting access to the records of former presidents.
*Executive Order 13392: Improving Agency Disclosure of Information.

===U.S. Attorney General Memoranda===

====History====

The Holder Memo is part of series of policy memos on how federal agencies should apply FOIA exemptions. Beginning in 1977 with Attorney General Griffin Bell, and continued by Attorney General William French Smith in 1981 and Attorney General Janet Reno in 1993, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced how the executive branch should approach FOIA, its application, and DOJ&#x27;s defense of agency&#x27;s actions. In other words, DOJ&#x27;s position on when they would defend in a FOIA suit has seesawed for about the last three decades.

=====Reno Memo=====

The Reno Memo established a &quot;presumption&quot; in favor of disclosure by providing that &quot;it shall be the policy of the Department of Justice to defend the assertion of a FOIA exemption only in those cases where the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption&quot;. It encouraged all government agencies to review FOIA requests in a manner most favorable to openness and to release information, even though it might fall within one of the nine exemption categories, if no &quot;foreseeable harm&quot; would result from the disclosure. The goal was to achieve the &quot;maximum responsible disclosure&quot;.

=====Ashcroft Memo=====

On October 12, 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a policy memorandum on FOIA to all federal executive agencies. The AG declared the Department of Justice (DOJ) would defend agencies&#x27; decisions to withhold documents from a FOIA requester under one of the statute&#x27;s exemptions &quot;unless they lack a sound legal basis or present an unwarranted risk of adverse impact on the ability of other agencies to protect other important records&quot;.

The Ashcroft Memorandum reversed the Reno standard. Agencies were told that in making discretionary FOIA decisions they should carefully consider the fundamental values behind the exemptions—national security, privacy, government&#x27;s interests, etc.—and to lean in their favor whenever possible. The Ashcroft Memo with its &quot;sound legal basis&quot; standard encouraged (or at least seemed to support) greater use of FOIA exemptions by federal agency personnel.

=====AG Holder Memo=====

The Ashcroft Memo was rescinded by Attorney General Eric Holder on March 14, 2009. The AG Holder Memo appears to have reinstated the Reno Memo standard and extends the policy. The policy of the executive branch is to be open, responsive, transparent, and accountable. The current memo encourages the maximum disclosure possible in discretionary exemptions and to, whenever possible, reasonably segregate exempt information and release the rest.

==State legislation==

All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia also have freedom of information laws that govern the public&#x27;s access to government records at state and local levels. These laws go by many different names including Sunshine Laws, Public Records Laws, Open Records Laws, etc. Additionally, Open Meeting Laws govern the public&#x27;s access to meetings of public officials or appointed boards.

All Freedom of Information style laws supports the ideal that in a democracy, people have the right to know the business of their government. However, the laws vary in scope and strength among jurisdictions. For example, Florida&#x27;s Sunshine Law creates both a statutory and constitutional right to access whereas many states only provide the statutory right. Additionally, while a state may have strong legislation the state&#x27;s compliance with its own laws may negatively impact the public&#x27;s ability to access records.

<doc id="140406" wikidata="Q7380561" url="?curid=140406" title="Rural Utilities Service">
<text>The United States Rural Utilities Service (RUS) administers programs that provide infrastructure or infrastructure improvements to rural communities. These include water and waste treatment, electric power, and telecommunications services. It is an operating unit of the USDA Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was created in 1935 as the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), a New Deal agency promoting rural electrification.

==Overview==
The RUS administers the following programs:

* Water and Environmental: provides financial assistance for drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid waste and storm drainage facilities in rural areas and communities with a population of 10,000 or less.
* Electric Programs: help maintain, expand, upgrade and modernize the rural electric infrastructure. It also supports demand-side management, energy efficiency and conservation programs, and on- and off-grid renewable energy systems.
* Telecommunications: helps deploy the rural telecommunications infrastructure.

==Financial assistance==
A total of 890 rural electric and 800 rural telecommunications utilities in 47 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia have received financial assistance. Approximately 7,200 rural communities are served through financial assistance received from water and waste loans and grants.

In 2023, RUS was in charge of the ReConnect Program; this Biden administration program is overseen by the Agriculture Department to expand broadband Internet access to rural parts of America, including the Marshall Islands.

== Rural Electrification Administration ==
The RUS originated with the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), one of the agencies created under the New Deal in 1935 to promote rural electrification. The REA was created by on May 11, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Enacted the following year, the Rural Electrification Act provided federal loans for the installation of electrical distribution systems to serve rural areas of the United States.

In the 1930s, the U.S. lagged behind Europe in providing electricity to rural areas. In 1934, less than 11% of U.S. farms had electricity. That same year, in France and Germany, nearly 90% of farms had electricity.
Backed by the 1936 Rural Electrification Act the REA gave loans and other help to rural organizations setting up their own power systems and was one of the New Deal&#x27;s most successful programs. By 1937, hundreds of new municipal power utilities were created nationwide. In 1939, 288,000 households had their electricity provided by rural electric cooperatives. Most of these electric co-ops had applied for and received loans from REA. By 1942, nearly 50% of US farms had electricity, and by 1952 almost all US farms had electricity.

In 1949, the REA became authorized to provide loans to rural telephone cooperatives.

Under the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 the REA was absorbed by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS).

<doc id="140409" wikidata="Q25596" url="?curid=140409" title="Saint Martin (island)">
<text>Saint Martin (; ) is an island in Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles in the northeastern Caribbean, approximately east of Puerto Rico. The island is divided roughly 60:40 between the French Republic () and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (), but the Dutch part is more populated than the French. Divided since 1648, the northern French part comprises the Collectivity of Saint Martin and is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic. The southern Dutch part comprises Sint Maarten and is one of four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Even though the island is an overseas possession of two European Union member states, only the French part of the island is part of the EU.

On 1 January 2019, the population of the whole island was 73,777 inhabitants, with 41,177 living on the Dutch side and 32,489 on the French side. Note that the figure for the French side is based on censuses that took place after the devastation of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, whereas the figure for the Dutch side is only a post-censal estimate still based on the 2011 census. The first census since Hurricane Irma on the Dutch side of the island took place in October 2022. The population of the island on 1 January 2017, before Hurricane Irma, was 75,869 (40,535 on the Dutch side, 35,334 on the French side).

The island&#x27;s pre-colonial names include (Arawakan, meaning &#x27;the island of women&#x27;) and (Kalinago, meaning &#x27;the island of salt&#x27;).

Collectively, the two territories are known as &quot;Saint-Martin / Sint Maarten&quot;, or sometimes &quot;SXM&quot;, the IATA identifier for Princess Juliana International Airport, the island&#x27;s main airport. St. Martin (the French portion) received the ISO 3166-1 code MF in October 2007. In 2010, the Dutch part had its status changed to that of a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and was given the code SX.

==Geography==

Saint Martin has a land area of , of which is under the sovereignty of the French Republic, and under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This is the only land border shared by the French Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The main cities are Philipsburg on the Dutch side and Marigot on the French side. The Dutch side is more heavily populated. The most populous settlement on the entire island is Lower Prince&#x27;s Quarter, which is on the Dutch side.

The highest hilltop is the Pic Paradis () in the centre of a hill chain on the French side. Both sides are hilly with large mountain peaks. This forms a valley where many houses are located. There are no rivers on the island, but there are many dry gullies. Hiking trails give access to the dry forest that covers tops and slopes. The 1648 Treaty of Concordia was signed on the hill lying on the international border between Marigot and Philipsburg, now known as Mount Concordia, Concordia Hill, or .

The island is located south of Anguilla and is separated from that British overseas territory by the Anguilla Channel. Saint Martin is northwest of Saint Barthélemy and is separated from that French overseas collectivity by the Saint-Barthélemy Channel.

Neighbouring islands include Saint Barthélemy (French), Anguilla (British), Saba (Dutch), Sint Eustatius &quot;Statia&quot; (Dutch), and Saint Kitts and Nevis (independent, formerly British). With the exception of Nevis, all of these islands are easily visible on a clear day from St. Martin.

==History==

It is commonly believed that Christopher Columbus named the island in honour of Saint Martin of Tours when he encountered it on his second voyage of discovery. However, he actually applied the name to the island now called Nevis when he anchored offshore on 11 November 1493, the feast day of Saint Martin. The confusion of numerous poorly charted small islands in the Leeward Islands meant that this name was accidentally transferred to the island now known as Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten.

After jointly reclaiming the island, on 23 March 1648, the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic agreed to divide the island between their two territories, and created a formal border with the signing of the Treaty of Concordia. Later conflicts resulted in 16 border changes over the years, but it has been stable since 1816. The French side has and the Dutch side, .

==Politics==

There currently is a movement aiming to unite the Dutch and French halves of the island of Saint Martin. A &quot;Unity Flag&quot; for representing this unification was created in 1990.

Currently, the island is divided into Sint Maarten (the southern half of the island, part of the Netherlands) and the Collectivity of Saint Martin (the northern half of the island, part of France). The island has been divided since the signing of the Treaty of Concordia in 1648, which today remains as one of the oldest treaties still in effect. Unification of the island enjoys support from the population of both halves.

The Treaty of Concordia allows freedom of movement between both parts of the island, which has promoted a common sentiment among the island&#x27;s inhabitants, although this is also the reason why some see a formal unification as unnecessary. Other arguments against unification of the island are that neither France nor the Netherlands would allow it and that both sides would require full independence to achieve it.

On 31 August 1990, the &quot;Unity Flag&quot; of Saint Martin was adopted at the Preliminary Conference on National Symbols at the Philipsburg Jubilee Library, in Sint Maarten. This flag was created to represent the people of both halves of the island and the unification of the latter, and is hoisted today on some houses and sometimes by churches and religious groups in Saint Martin. In August 2020, when restrictions and controls were added to the Saint Martin–Sint Maarten border to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, some protesters against these measures flew this flag with them. In September 2020, these restrictions were lifted, and people from both sides of the island started chanting &quot;One island, one people, one destiny&quot;.

Some notable supporters of this movement include Albert Fleming, former leader of the Collectivity of Saint Martin, who in 2014 stated his support for the unification of the island.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, the island has a tropical savanna climate (Aw) with a dry season from January to April and a rainy season from August to December. The precipitation patterns are due to the movement of the Azores High during the year. With the wind direction predominantly from the east or the northeast, northeasterly trades, temperatures remain stable throughout the year and temperatures rarely exceed or fall below . Temperatures remain steady throughout the year with an average mean temperature of . The average sea temperature is ranging from a low of in February to a high of in October. The total average yearly rainfall is , with 142 days of measurable rainfall. Thunderstorms can occasionally occur, with 18 days with thunder per year. Precipitation totals are quite variable from year to year, depending on the number of passing tropical cyclones.

Because the island is located within the tropics, it is regularly threatened by Atlantic hurricane activity in the late summer and early fall.
===Hurricane Irma (2017)===
On 6 September 2017 the island was hit by Hurricane Irma (Category 5 at landfall), which caused widespread and significant damage, estimated at $3 billion, to buildings and infrastructure. A total of 11 deaths had been reported as of 9 July 2018. France&#x27;s Minister of the Interior, Gérard Collomb, said on 8 September 2017 that most of the schools were destroyed on the French half of the island. In addition to damage caused by high winds, there were reports of serious flood damage to businesses in the village of Marigot. Looting was also a serious problem. Both France and the Netherlands sent aid as well as additional police and emergency personnel to the island. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that 95% of the structures on the French side and 75% of the structures on the Dutch side were damaged or destroyed.

Some days after the storm had abated, a survey by the Dutch Red Cross estimated that nearly a third of the buildings in Sint Maarten had been destroyed and that over 90 per cent of structures on the island had been damaged. Princess Juliana Airport was extensively damaged but reopened on a partial basis in two days to allow incoming relief flights and for flights that would take evacuees to other islands.

==Economy==
INSEE estimated that the nominal GDP of the French side of Saint Martin amounted to 582 million euros in 2014 (US$772 million at 2014 exchanges rates; US$660 million at Feb. 2022 exchange rates) The nominal GDP of the Dutch side of the island, Sint Maarten, was estimated at 2,229 million Antillean guilders (US$1,245 million at the official peg) in 2014. The nominal GDP of the entire island was thus US$2.01 billion in 2014.

The nominal GDP per capita of the entire island stood at US$27,923 in 2014.

The Dutch side of the island experienced a deep recession in 2017 and 2018 due to the devastation of Hurricane Irma which struck the island in September 2017. Real GDP experienced a negative growth of -5.8% in 2017 and -6.6% in 2018 (GDP figures after 2018 have not been published yet). GDP of the French side of the island has not been estimated since 2014.

The main industry of the island is tourism. In 2000, the island had about one million visitors annually. About 85% of the workforce was engaged in the tourist industry.

==Demographics==
On 1 January 2019, the population of the whole island was 73,777 inhabitants, with 41,177 living on the Dutch side and 32,489 on the French side. Note that the figure for the French side is based on censuses that took place after the devastation of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, whereas the figure for the Dutch side is only a post-censal estimate still based on the 2011 census. The first census since Hurricane Irma on the Dutch side of the island is scheduled to take place in October 2022. Population of the island on 1 January 2017, before Hurricane Irma, was 75,869 (40,535 on the Dutch side, 35,334 on the French side).

Due to a major influx of immigrants searching for better employment and living conditions over the past 30 years, the number of Creoles has been surpassed by the number of immigrants. The island&#x27;s population is highly diverse, containing people from more than 70 countries.

With so many nationalities present, quite a few languages are spoken. An English-based creole is the main local vernacular. However, the official languages are French for Saint-Martin, with Dutch and English being official for Sint Maarten. Other common languages include various French creoles (spoken by French Caribbean immigrants), Spanish (spoken by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and various South American countries), and Papiamento (spoken by immigrants from Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao).

==Culture==

The island&#x27;s culture is a blend of its African, French, British, Dutch, Amerindian, and Asian . Although each side&#x27;s culture is influenced by their respective administering countries, they share enough similar heritage and traditions that it can be difficult to tell where Saint-Martin ends and Sint Maarten begins.

The Creole population can trace most of their roots to Africa, France, the Netherlands and the British Isles. Only some stones remain from the ruins of the two forts built by the Spanish occupation in its early takeover. But during the colonial period, the British settlers and several military dominations left their idiom as the main language spoken on the island, and have made a large impact on St. Martin&#x27;s culture.

In French Saint-Martin, the most practised religion is Roman Catholicism. Dutch Sint Maarten favors Protestant denominations, particularly Methodism. The island also has small Jewish, Seventh-day Adventist, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, and Rastafari communities.

The whole island is known for its excellent cuisine. Creole, French, and West Indian cooking are particularly renowned.

Popular music on St. Martin includes a variety of styles found throughout the Caribbean. Calypso, merengue, soca, zouk, reggae, and chutney all contribute to the festive culture.

St. Martin&#x27;s Dutch side is known for its festive nightlife, beaches, jewellery, drinks made with native rum-based guavaberry liquors, and casinos. The island&#x27;s French side is known for its nude beaches, clothes, shopping (including outdoor markets), and French and Indian Caribbean cuisine. English is the most commonly spoken language along with a local dialect. The official languages are French for Saint-Martin, and both Dutch and English for Sint Maarten. Other common languages include various French-based creoles (spoken by immigrants from other French Caribbean islands), Spanish (spoken by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and various South American countries), and Papiamento (spoken by immigrants from Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao).

Among the leading cultural artists of the island are Youth Waves, music band; Isidore &quot;Mighty Dow&quot; York, kaisonian, panman; Roland Richardson, Impressionist painter; Ruby Bute, painter; Nicole de Weever, dancer and Broadway star; Lasana M. Sekou, poet, author, independence advocate; Drisana Deborah Jack, multimedia visual artist, poet; Clara Reyes, choreographer; and Tanny and The Boys, string band music group.

News publications on St. Martin include &quot;The Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;Soualiga News Day&quot;, &quot;Soualiga News&quot;, &quot;St. Maarten News&quot;, &quot;SMN News&quot;, &quot;SXM Island Time&quot;, and &quot;SXM Talks&quot;.

==Currency==
The official currency of Saint Martin is the euro, while Sint Maarten uses the Netherlands Antillean guilder, pegged at 1.79 per US dollar. As a consequence of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands Antillean guilder will cease to be legal tender and be replaced by the Caribbean guilder, which was scheduled for circulation in the first half of 2021, but now scheduled for 2024. Almost every store on the island also accepts the United States dollar, although sometimes a more expensive exchange rate is used.

==Transport==
Public buses are the primary mode of transportation for visitors staying on the island.

===Border checks===
Neither side of the island is part of the Schengen Area; full border checks are performed when travelling in and out of the island. Passport controls are also exercised when taking the ferry from Marigot or Princess Juliana International Airport to Anguilla. There are rarely checks at the border between the two sides of the island.

In 1994, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France signed the Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls, which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called &quot;risk flights&quot; arriving from off-island and only admitting foreigners having permission to travel on both sides of the island. After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007. Its provisions are not yet implemented as the working group specified in the treaty is not yet installed. The treaty requires a working group that has never been set up, to harmonize external checks at the two main airports. The Dutch side has expressed concern that new and tighter French visa requirements would harm their tourism income.

===Airports=== 
The island is served by the Princess Juliana International Airport, in the Dutch part of the island.

There is also a small airport on the French side of the island at Grand Case, L&#x27;Espérance Airport for small aircraft serving neighbouring Caribbean islands. It frequently suffers thick fog during the hurricane season due to its location.

<text>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance. Established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to unite several foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency, statute law places USAID under &quot;the direct authority and policy guidance of the Secretary of State&quot;. It implements programs in global health, disaster relief, socioeconomic development, environmental protection, democratic governance and education. With average annual disbursements of about $23bn since 2001, USAID has been one of the world&#x27;s largest aid agencies and accounts for most U.S. foreign assistancethe highest in the world in absolute dollar terms. USAID has missions in over 100 countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

USAID has faced scrutiny over its role in political operations of influence abroad and potential conflicts of interest. In January 2025, the Trump administration ordered a near-total freeze on foreign aid, making false and misleading allegations of wasteful spending and fraud and planning to reduce employee numbers from around 10,000 to 290. Elon Musk, who has been carrying out Trump&#x27;s cost-cutting agenda as a special government employee through the Department of Government Efficiency, announced the intention of shutting down USAID. The legality of Trump&#x27;s order was contested, and a federal court issued a temporary restraining order pausing staff reductions.

==Creation==

Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act on September 4, 1961, which reorganized U.S. foreign assistance programs and mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic aid. The goal of this agency was to counter Soviet Union influence during the Cold War and to advance US soft power through socioeconomic development. USAID was subsequently established by the executive order of President John F. Kennedy, who sought to unite several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency.

Congress authorizes USAID&#x27;s programs in the Foreign Assistance Act, which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. As an official component of U.S. foreign policy, USAID operates subject to the guidance of the president, secretary of state, and the National Security Council.

Congress also passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which established USAID as an &quot;independent establishment&quot; outside of the U.S. Department of State.

==History==
When the U.S. government created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID&#x27;s predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961. Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965–70, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.

After his inauguration as president on January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy created the Peace Corps by Executive Order on March 1, 1961. On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a &quot;Decade of Development&quot; and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency. He sent a proposed &quot;Act for International Development&quot; to Congress in May and the resulting &quot;Foreign Assistance Act&quot; was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act. In November, Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the &quot;Agency for International Development&quot; (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID), as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund. With these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.

===Second Trump administration===
In 2024, USAID&#x27;s Inspector General had launched a probe into Starlink, which is operated by Musk; this led to concerns that Musk’s role in the agency&#x27;s downsizing constituted a conflict of interest.

On January 24, 2025, President Donald Trump ordered a near-total freeze on all foreign aid. Several days later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver for humanitarian aid. Despite the waiver, there was still much confusion about what agencies should do. More than 1,000 USAID employees and contractors were fired or furloughed following the near-total freeze on U.S. global assistance that the second Trump administration implemented. Matt Hopson, the USAID chief of staff appointed by the Trump administration, resigned.

On January 27, 2025, the agency&#x27;s official government website was shut down. On February 3, 2025, Elon Musk, who has been carrying out parts of Trump&#x27;s cost-cutting agenda, announced that he and Trump were in the process of shutting down USAID, claiming it to be a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and that it was &quot;beyond repair&quot;. Also on February 3, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he had been appointed Acting Administrator of USAID by Trump and that the agency was being merged into the State Department. The legality of these actions is disputed given the mandate for its creation in the Foreign Assistance Act.

It was announced that on February 6, 2025, at 11:59 pm (EST) all USAID direct hire personnel would be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs. By the evening of February 6, reports had emerged indicating that the total number of employees to be retained was 294, out of a total of more than 10,000. Trump declared that agency leaders were &quot;radical left lunatics&quot;, while the State Department ordered them to halt virtually all their projects, even if that meant ceasing programs that helped to eradicate smallpox and prevented millions of HIV cases. The freeze in HIV relief programs, including PEPFAR, is estimated to jeopardize treatment access for 20 million people, including 500,000 children. This drastic action led to sudden pauses in over 30 clinical trials for ailments such as HIV, malaria, cholera, cervical cancer, and tuberculosis, leaving participants with medical devices in their bodies and cut off from researchers, likely going against the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. It also led to a pause in other efforts such as wartime help in Ukraine, hospital assistance in Syria, education programs in Mali, and conservation efforts in the Amazon. In a statement explaining the threat to billions of dollars the agency spends on American businesses, the American Farm Bureau Federation said, &quot;AID plays a critical role in reducing hunger around the world while sourcing markets for the surplus foods America’s farmers and ranchers grow&quot;.

The action of the Trump administration also caused frustration among conservatives. Andrew Natsios, the administrator for USAID during the George W. Bush administration, told PBS that, &quot;With all due respect, none of these people know anything about AID. What does Musk know about international development? Absolutely nothing. He has a bunch of young kids in their 20s. They don&#x27;t know. They&#x27;re techies. They don&#x27;t know anything about international development. They don&#x27;t know anything about the Global South. They don&#x27;t know anything about these — the programs and policies of the agency. AID is the most pro-business and pro-market of all aid agencies in the world. I can tell you that categorically. I am a conservative Republican. I&#x27;m not a liberal. And I have served in repeated Republican administrations.&quot;

==== Lawsuits ====
A lawsuit was filed on February 6 by the American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on February 6, requesting a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the administration, claiming that it violated separation of powers, the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act and requesting that all attempts to shut down the agency be halted, all recent actions be reversed, and a new acting director be appointed. The following day, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, nominated by President Trump in 2019, stated from the bench that he would enter in a &quot;temporary restraining order&quot;, pausing the plan to put thousands of employees on leave and pausing the accelerated removal of workers from their posts abroad.

On February 21, Judge Nichols cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world, as part of an administration plan to also provide those abroad with a 30-day deadline to move back to the U.S. at government expense. Nichols had previously argued that Trump&#x27;s actions threaten the safety of USAID workers abroad because many are deployed in unstable regions.
==Purposes==
USAID&#x27;s decentralized network of resident field missions is drawn on to manage U.S. government programs in low-income countries for various purposes.

* Disaster relief
* Poverty relief
* Technical cooperation on global issues, including the environment
* U.S. bilateral interests
* Socioeconomic development

=== Disaster relief ===
Some of the U.S. government&#x27;s earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in war-created crises. In 1915, U.S. government assistance through the Commission for Relief in Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion. After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the &quot;Marshall Plan&quot;) helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.

=== Poverty relief ===

After 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations. USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest. USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Also, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.

=== Global issues ===
Technical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth. The United States has specialized federal agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency. USAID&#x27;s special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other U.S. government agencies&#x27; international work on global concerns.

==== Environment ====
Among these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention. USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife. USAID also assists projects in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building resilience to the risks associated with global climate change. U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally sustainable.

=== U.S. national interests ===
Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies to support U.S. geopolitical interests, mainly in the form of &quot;Economic Support Funds&quot; (ESF). USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF and is instructed: &quot;To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].&quot;

Also, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the &quot;Civil Affairs&quot; programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations. In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.

U.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law&#x27;s requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors. American farms supplied about 41 percent of the food aid according to a 2021 report by the Congressional Research Service.

=== Socioeconomic development ===
To help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving the management of their own resources. USAID&#x27;s assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance. Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector and other U.S. government agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.

Programs of the various types above frequently reinforce one another. For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (&quot;Economic Support Funds&quot;) to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.

==Modes of assistance==
USAID delivers both technical and financial assistance:

===Technical assistance===
Technical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities. USAID contracts or procures technical assistance and provides it in-kind to recipients. For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country&#x27;s pool of expertise and from specialized U.S. government agencies. Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID&#x27;s technical assistance to develop IT systems and procure computer hardware to strengthen their institutions.

To build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists in the strengthening of developing countries&#x27; universities. Local universities&#x27; programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.

The various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity-building packages for the development of local institutions.

===Financial assistance===
Financial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets. USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international NGOs who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries. Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of non-reimbursable grants.

In recent years, the United States has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance. In 2004, the Bush administration created the Millennium Challenge Corporation as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama administration initiated a major realignment of USAID&#x27;s own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as &quot;government-to-government&quot; or &quot;G2G&quot; assistance.

=== Public–private partnerships ===
In April 2023, USAID and the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to improve food safety and sustainable food systems in Africa. GFSI&#x27;s work in benchmarking and standard harmonisation aims to foster mutual acceptance of GFSI-recognized certification programmes for the food industry.

==Organization==
USAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (&quot;USAID missions&quot;), supported by USAID&#x27;s global headquarters in Washington, D.C.

===Country development programs===
USAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a &quot;mission&quot;. The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a &quot;framework bilateral agreement&quot; between the government of the United States and the host government. Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.

USAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID&#x27;s assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socio-economic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.

As countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions. USAID has closed missions in a number of countries that had achieved a substantial level of prosperity, including South Korea, Turkey, and Costa Rica.

USAID also closes missions when requested by host countries for political reasons. In September 2012, the U.S. closed USAID/Russia at that country&#x27;s request. Its mission in Moscow had been in operation for two decades. On May 1, 2013, the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, asked USAID to close its mission, which had worked in the country for 49 years. The closure was completed on September 20, 2013.

USAID missions are led by mission directors and are staffed both by USAID Foreign Service officers and by development professionals from the country itself, with the host-country professionals forming the majority of the staff. The length of a Foreign service officer&#x27;s &quot;tour&quot; in most countries is four years, to provide enough time to develop in-depth knowledge about the country. (Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)

The mission director is a member of the U.S. Embassy&#x27;s &quot;Country Team&quot; under the direction of the U.S. ambassador. As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities. Since the passage of the Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act in 1998 and the bombings of U.S. Embassy chanceries in East Africa in the same year, missions have gradually been moved into U.S. Embassy chancery compounds.

===USAID/Washington===

The country programs are supported by USAID&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C., &quot;USAID/Washington&quot;, where about half of USAID&#x27;s Foreign Service officers work on rotation from foreign assignments, alongside USAID&#x27;s Civil Service staff and top leadership.

USAID is headed by an administrator. Under the Biden administration, the administrator became a regular attendee of the National Security Council.

USAID/Washington helps define overall federal civilian foreign assistance policy and budgets, working with the State Department, Congress, and other U.S. government agencies. It is organized into &quot;Bureaus&quot; covering geographical areas, development subject areas, and administrative functions. Each bureau is headed by an assistant administrator appointed by the president.

(Some tasks similar to those of USAID&#x27;s Bureaus are performed by what are termed &quot;Independent Offices&quot;.)

* Geographic bureaus
** AFRAfrica
** ASIAAsia
** LACLatin America &amp; the Caribbean
** E&amp;EEurope and Eurasia
** MEthe Middle East
* Subject-area bureaus
** GHGlobal Health
*** Every year, the Global Health Bureau reports to the U.S. Congress through its Global Health Report to Congress. The Global Health Bureau also submits a yearly report on the Call to Action: ending preventable child and maternal deaths. This is part of USAID&#x27;s follow-up to the 2012, where it committed to ending preventable child and maternal deaths in a generation with A Promise Renewed.
** E3Economic Growth, Education, and the Environment
*** Economic Growth offices in E3 define Agency policy and provide technical support to Mission assistance activities in the areas of economic policy formulation, international trade, sectoral regulation, capital markets, microfinance, energy, infrastructure, land tenure, urban planning and property rights, gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment. The Engineering Division, in particular, draws on licensed professional engineers to support USAID Missions in a multibillion-dollar portfolio of construction projects, including medical facilities, schools, universities, roads, power plants, and water and sanitation plants.
*** The Education Office in E3 defines Agency policy and provides technical support to Mission assistance activities for both basic and tertiary education.
*** Environment offices in E3 define Agency policy and provide technical support to Mission assistance activities in the areas of climate change and biodiversity.
** Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance 
** Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Governance
*** The mission of the DRG Bureau is to lead USAID&#x27;s efforts to invigorate democracy, enhance human rights and justice, and bolster governance that advances the public interest and delivers inclusive development.
** LABU.S. Global Development Lab
*** The Lab serves as an innovation hub, taking smart risks to test new ideas and partner within the Agency and with other actors to harness the power of innovative tools and approaches that accelerate development impact.
** RFSResilience and Food Security
* Headquarters bureaus
** MManagement
** OHCTMOffice of Human Capital and Talent Management
** LPALegislative and Public Affairs
** PPLPolicy, Planning, and Learning
** BRMOffice of Budget and Resource Management

Independent oversight of USAID activities is provided by its Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development, which conducts criminal and civil investigations, financial and performance audits, reviews, and inspections of USAID activities around the world.

===Staffing===
USAID&#x27;s staffing reported to Congress in June 2016 totaled 10,235, including both field missions &quot;overseas&quot; (7,176) and the Washington, D.C. headquarters (3,059). Of this total, 1,850 were USAID Foreign Service officers who spend their careers mostly residing overseas (1,586 overseas in June 2016) and partly on rotation in Washington, D.C. (264). The Foreign Service officers stationed overseas worked alongside the 4,935 local staff of USAID&#x27;s field missions.

Host-country staff normally work under one-year contracts that are renewed annually. Formerly, host-country staff could be recruited as &quot;direct hires&quot; in career positions and at present many host-country staff continue working with USAID missions for full careers on a series of one-year contracts. In USAID&#x27;s management approach, local staff may fill highly responsible, professional roles in program design and management.

U.S. citizens can apply to become USAID Foreign Service officers by competing for specific job openings based on academic qualifications and experience in development programs. Within five years of recruitment, most Foreign Service officers receive tenure for an additional 20+ years of employment before mandatory retirement. Some are promoted to the Senior Foreign Service with extended tenure, subject to the Foreign Service&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 65. (This recruitment system differs from the State Department&#x27;s use of the &quot;Foreign Service Officer Test&quot; to identify potential U.S. diplomats. Individuals who pass the test become candidates for the State Department&#x27;s selection process, which emphasizes personal qualities in thirteen dimensions such as &quot;Composure&quot; and &quot;Resourcefulness&quot;. No specific education level is required.)

In 2008, USAID launched the &quot;Development Leadership Initiative&quot; to reverse the decline in USAID&#x27;s Foreign service officer staffing, which had fallen to a total of about 1,200 worldwide. Although USAID&#x27;s goal was to double the number of Foreign Service officers to about 2,400 in 2012, actual recruitment net of attrition reached only 820 by the end of 2012. USAID&#x27;s 2016 total of 1,850 Foreign Service officers compared with 13,000 in the State Department.

==Field missions==

While USAID can have as little presence in a country as a single person assigned to the U.S. Embassy, a full USAID mission in a larger country may have twenty or more USAID Foreign Service officers and a hundred or more professional and administrative employees from the country itself.

The USAID mission&#x27;s staff is divided into specialized offices in three groups: (1) assistance management offices; (2) the mission director&#x27;s and the Program office; and (3) the contracting, financial management, and facilities offices.

===Assistance management offices===
Called &quot;technical&quot; offices by USAID staff, these offices design and manage the technical and financial assistance that USAID provides to their local counterparts&#x27; projects. The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.

====Health and Family Planning====
Examples of projects assisted by missions&#x27; Health and Family Planning offices are projects for the eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, HIV-AIDS monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID&#x27;s poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socio-economic development.

====Education====
USAID&#x27;s Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening the coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials. Larger programs have included school construction. Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country&#x27;s universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices. The Education office&#x27;s emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID&#x27;s poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.

====Environment====
Examples of projects assisted by environmental offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people&#x27;s lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change. Environment assistance corresponds to USAID&#x27;s objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID&#x27;s socioeconomic development objective in the long term.

USAID (United States Agency for International Development) has recently initiated the HEARTH (Health, Ecosystems and Agriculture for Resilient, Thriving Societies) program, which operates in 10 countries with 15 activities aimed at promoting conservation of threatened landscapes and enhancing community well-being by partnering with the private sector to align business goals with development objectives. Through HEARTH, USAID implements One Health principles to achieve sustainable benefits for both people and the environment through projects focused on livelihoods, well-being, conservation, biodiversity, and governance.

====Democracy====
Examples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country&#x27;s political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations. Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil society organizations that monitor government performance. Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID&#x27;s objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID&#x27;s socioeconomic development objective.

====Economic Growth====

Examples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized &quot;Agriculture&quot; office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate the growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for the industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). In USAID&#x27;s early years and some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants. Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work. It corresponds to USAID&#x27;s socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction. Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide &quot;cash transfer&quot; payments to low-income families.

====Special assistance====
Some USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.

Disaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID&#x27;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.

===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===
The mission director&#x27;s signature authorizes technical offices to assist according to the designs and budgets they propose. With the help of the Program Office, the mission director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation. The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.

===Contracting, financial management and management offices===
While the mission director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the &quot;support&quot; offices.

====Contracting====
Commitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID&#x27;s assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and agreement officers. The mission director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country&#x27;s government agencies.

====Financial management====
Funds can be committed only when the Mission&#x27;s Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose. &quot;FM&quot; offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted. They evaluate potential recipients&#x27; management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers&#x27; expenditure reports with great care. This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.

====Management====
Called the &quot;Executive Office&quot; in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy&#x27;s Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), &quot;EXO&quot; provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property, and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies&#x27; chancery complexes, and the State Department&#x27;s recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID&#x27;s EXO and the embassy&#x27;s Management section.

==Budget==


The Congressional Research Service (CRS) states that some USAID appropriations are programmed collaboratively with the Department of State, which makes any calculation of the USAID budget imprecise, and the CRS generally refers to USAID-managed funds. The CRS stated USAID managed more than $40 billion of combined appropriations in 2023, and had a workforce of more than 10,000. The mean average managed foreign assistance disbursed in the fiscal years 2001 to 2024 was $22.9 billion in inflation adjusted to 2023 dollars; 2023 was an exceptional year because of an extra $16 billion of funds for Ukraine.

The U.S. government USAspending.gov website included International Security Assistance, Special Assistance Initiatives and a small amount of other spending alongside direct USAID spending in its assessment of the 2023 $50.1 billion of budgetary resources available to USAID, about $10 billion more than the headline CRS assessment. International Security Assistance was budgeted about $9 billion in 2023, of which Foreign Military Financing to strengthen military support of key U.S. allies and partner governments was $6 billion.

In fiscal year 2022, the cost of supplying USAID&#x27;s assistance includes the agency&#x27;s &quot;Operating Expenses&quot; of $1.97 billion, and &quot;Bilateral Economic Assistance&quot; program costs of $25.01 billion (the vast bulk of which was administered by USAID). In fiscal year 2012, &quot;Operating Expenses&quot; were $1.53 billion, and &quot;Bilateral Economic Assistance&quot; was $20.83 billion.

U.S. assistance budget totals are shown along with other countries&#x27; total assistance budgets in tables in a webpage of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most of the world&#x27;s governments adopted a program for action under the auspices of the United Nations Agenda 21, which included an Official Development Assistance (ODA) aid target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) for rich nations, specified as roughly 22 members of the OECD and known as the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Most countries do not adhere to this target, as the OECD&#x27;s table indicates that the DAC average ODA in 2011 was 0.31% of GNP. The U.S. figure for 2011 was 0.20% of GNP, which still left the U.S. as the largest single source of ODA among individual countries. According to the OECD, The United States&#x27; total official development assistance (ODA) (US$55.3 billion, preliminary data) increased in 2022, mainly due to support to Ukraine, as well as increased costs for in-donor refugees from Afghanistan. ODA represented 0.22% of gross national income (GNI).

==Activities by region==

===Haiti===
Following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, USAID helped provide safer housing for almost 200,000 displaced Haitians; supported vaccinations for more than 1 million people; cleared more than 1.3 million cubic meters of the approximately 10 million cubic meters of rubble generated; helped more than 10,000 farmers double the yields of staples like corn, beans, and sorghum; and provided short-term employment to more than 350,000 Haitians, injecting more than $19 million into the local economy. USAID has provided nearly $42 million to help combat cholera, helping to decrease the number of cases requiring hospitalization and reduce the case fatality rate.

===Afghanistan===
With American entry into Afghanistan in 2001, USAID worked with the Department of State and Department of Defense to coordinate reconstruction efforts.

===Iraq===
The interactions between USAID and other U.S. government agencies in the period of planning the Iraq operation of 2003 are described by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction in its book &quot;Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience&quot;.

Subsequently, USAID played a major role in the U.S. reconstruction and development effort in Iraq. , USAID had invested approximately $6.6 billion on programs designed to stabilize communities; foster economic and agricultural growth; and build the capacity of the national, local, and provincial governments to represent and respond to the needs of the Iraqi people.

In June 2003, C-SPAN followed USAID administrator Andrew Natsios as he toured Iraq. The special program C-SPAN produced aired over four nights.

===Lebanon===
USAID has periodically supported the Lebanese American University and the American University of Beirut financially, with major contributions to the Lebanese American University&#x27;s Campaign for Excellence.

=== Europe ===
==== Ukraine ====
In the twenty years prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine USAID dispersed modest funds, averaging $115 million, in Ukraine. Following the invasion Congress enacted large sums for Ukraine through USAID to support the operation of its government and civil society. In fiscal year 2022 nearly $9 billion was disbursed, and $16 billion in 2023 causing that year to be the highest total spending year for USAID with 36.6% of its managed funds being disbursed to Ukraine.

==== United Kingdom ====
USAID has donated funds to international charity BBC Media Action, with approximately $3.23 million (£2.6 million) given in 2024. This funding supports media development, journalism training, and public education initiatives in over 30 countries.

===Cuba===
A USAID subcontractor was arrested in Cuba in 2009 for distributing satellite equipment to provide Cubans with internet access. The subcontractor was released during Obama&#x27;s second presidential term as part of the measures to improve relations between the two countries.

USAID has been used as a mechanism for &quot;hastening transition&quot;, i.e., regime change in Cuba. Between 2009 and 2012, USAID ran a multimillion-dollar program, disguised as humanitarian aid and aimed at inciting rebellion in Cuba. The program consisted of two operations: one to establish an anti-regime social network called ZunZuneo, and the other to attract potential dissidents contacted by undercover operatives posing as tourists and aid workers.

USAID engineered a subversive program using social media aimed at fueling political unrest in Cuba to overthrow the Cuban government. On 3 April 2014 the Associated Press published an investigative report that revealed USAID was behind the creation of a social networking text messaging service aimed at creating political dissent and triggering an uprising against the Cuban government. The name of the messaging network was ZunZuneo, a Cuban slang term for a hummingbird&#x27;s tweet and a play on &quot;Twitter&quot;. According to the AP&#x27;s report, the plan was to build an audience by initially presenting non-controversial content like sports, music and weather. Once a critical mass of users was reached the US government operators would change the content to spark political dissent and mobilize the users into organized political gatherings called &quot;smart mobs&quot; that would trigger an uprising against the Cuban government.

The messaging service was launched in 2010 and gained 40,000 followers at its peak. Extensive efforts were made to conceal the USAID involvement in the program, using offshore bank accounts, front companies and servers based overseas. According to a memo from one of the project&#x27;s contractors, Mobile Accord: &quot;There will be absolutely no mention of United States government involvement,&quot; &quot;This is absolutely crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the success of the Mission.&quot;
ZunZuneo&#x27;s subscribers were never aware that it was created by the US government or that USAID was gathering their private data to gain useful demographics that would gauge their levels of dissent and help USAID &quot;maximize our possibilities to extend our reach&quot;.

USAID officials realized they needed an exit strategy to conceal their involvement in the program, at one point seeking funding from Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey as part of a plan for it to go independent. The service was abruptly closed down around mid-2012, which USAID said was due to the program running out of money.

The ZunZuneo operation was part of a program that included a second operation which started in October 2009 and was financed jointly with ZunZuneo. In the second operation, USAID sent Venezuelan, Costa Rican and Peruvian children to Cuba to recruit Cubans into anti-regime political activities. The operatives posed as traveling aid workers and tourists. In one of the covert operations, the workers formed a HIV prevention workshop, which leaked memos called &quot;the perfect excuse&quot; for the programme&#x27;s political goals. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the operation could undermine US efforts to work toward improving health globally.

The operation was also criticized for putting the undercover operatives themselves at risk. The covert operatives were given limited training about evading Cuban authorities suspicious of their actions. After Alan Gross, a development specialist and USAID subcontractor, was arrested in Cuba, the US government warned USAID about the safety of covert operatives. Regardless of safety concerns, USAID refused to end the operation.

In light of the AP&#x27;s report, Rajiv Shah, the head of USAID, testified before the Senate Appropriations State Department and Foreign Operations Subcommittee on 8 April 2014.

===Bolivia===

USAID operated in the coca-growing Chapare region, including under a 1983 agreement to support crop-substitution programs to encourage other crops. No later than 1998, this funding was conditional on farmers eradicating all their coca plants. In 2008, the coca growers union affiliated with Bolivian President Evo Morales ejected the 100 employees and contractors from USAID working in the Chapare region, citing frustration with U.S. efforts to persuade them to switch to growing unviable alternatives. Other rules, such as the requirement that participating communities declare themselves &quot;terrorist-free zones&quot; as required by U.S. law irritated people, said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network. &quot;Eradicate all your coca and then you grow an orange tree that will get fruit in eight years but you don&#x27;t have anything to eat in the meantime? A bad idea. The thing about kicking out USAID, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an anti-American sentiment overall but rather a rejection of bad programs.&quot;

Also in 2008, USAID&#x27;s Bolivian programs under the Office of Transitional Initiatives and the Democracy Program, as well as separate funding by the National Endowment for Democracy, were the subject of critical investigative reports that documented them supporting political initiatives in regions governed by separatist movements. During the September 2008 political crisis, President Evo Morales expelled US Ambassador Philip S. Goldberg and spoke out against USAID interference. The US government had previously ended OTI spending in Bolivia and subsequently redirected Democracy Program funds to other purposes, while denying USAID had interfered in Bolivian politics.

President Evo Morales expelled USAID from Bolivia on May 1, 2013, for allegedly seeking to undermine his government following ten years of operations within the country. At the time, the USAID had seven American staffers and 37 Bolivian staffers in the country, with an annual budget of $26.7 million. President Morales explained that the expulsion was because USAID&#x27;s objectives in Bolivia were to advance American interests, not to advance the interests of the Bolivian people. More specifically, President Morales noted the American &quot;counter-narcotic&quot; programs that harms the interests of Bolivian coca farmers who get caught in the middle of American operations.

Following the 2019 Bolivian political crisis that saw Jeanine Áñez&#x27;s assumption of power, President Áñez invited USAID to return to Bolivia to provide &quot;technical aid to the electoral process in Bolivia&quot;. In October 2020, USAID provided $700,000 in emergency assistance in fighting wildfires to the government of Luis Arce.

===Brazil===
During the Brazilian Military Dictatorship, the organization launched , responsible for transforming the Brazilian education politics closer to the USA. USAID also acted in the countries public security. Between 1960 and 1972, USAID trained cops that were involved in political repression in Brazil.

&quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s largest newspaper, accused USAID of trying to influence political reform in Brazil in a way that would have purposely benefited right-wing parties. USAID spent $95,000 US in 2005 on a seminar in the Brazilian Congress to promote a reform aimed at pushing for legislation punishing party infidelity. According to USAID papers acquired by Folha under the Freedom of Information Act, the seminar was planned to coincide with the eve of talks in that country&#x27;s Congress on a broad political reform. The papers read that although the &quot;pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] Worker&#x27;s Party.&quot; The papers also expressed a concern about the &quot;&#x27;indigenization&#x27; of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.&quot; The event&#x27;s main sponsor was the International Republican Institute.

In February 2025, Michael Benz, a former state department official, affirmed in an interview with Steve Bannon on &quot;The War Room&quot; that Bolsonaro was seen in USAID as &quot;Tropical Trump&quot; and &quot;if USAID didn&#x27;t exist, Bolsonaro would still be the president of Brazil&quot;. In February 3, Eduardo Bolsonaro, federal deputy and son of Jair Bolsonaro, answered Benz in his social media by, accusing USAID of financing institutions involved with fighting against fake news during the presidential elections in 2022, such as the International Center for Journalists, Sleeping Giants Brazil and Vero Institute, created by the YouTuber Felipe Neto, with the objective of &quot;manipulating narratives and interfering with Brazilian democracy&quot;. He and Gustavo Gayer also began to collect signatures to open a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission to investigate the supposed interference. His accusations are largely considered as fake news and many of the accused institutions affirmed that never received money from USAID. Shortly after, in a speech for the Ação Política Conservadora, president of Argentina Javier Milei alleged without evidence that USAID used millions of dollars to falsify the 2022 election.

===East Africa===
On September 19, 2011, USAID and the Ad Council launched the &quot;Famine, War, and Drought&quot; (FWD) campaign to raise awareness about that year&#x27;s severe drought in East Africa. Through TV and internet ads as well as social media initiatives, FWD encouraged Americans to spread awareness about the crisis, support the humanitarian organizations that were conducting relief operations, and consult the Feed the Future global initiative for broader solutions. Celebrities Geena Davis, Uma Thurman, Josh Hartnett and Chanel Iman took part in the campaign via a series of Public Service Announcements. Corporations like Cargill, General Mills, and PepsiCo also signed on to support FWD.

===Palestinian territories===
USAID halted its assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip on January 31, 2019, reportedly at the request of the Palestinian Authority. The request was related to new U.S. legislation, the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018, that exposed foreign aid recipients to anti-terrorism lawsuits. USAID restarted assistance to Palestinians in April 2021 under President Biden. The agency increased assistance during the Israel–Hamas war that began in October 2023. Since October 7, 2023, USAID gave more than $2.1 billion in assistance to Palestinians. On November 10, 2023, more than 1,000 USAID employees signed an open letter calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war.

=== Vietnam ===
USAID, alongside the Department of State and Defence, has supported NGOs to removing UXO and landmines, and remediating soil contaminated by Agent Orange from multiple regions in Vietnam, as well as supporting victims of Agent Orange.

==Concerns and criticism==
U.S. foreign economic assistance has been the subject of debate and criticism since at least the 1950s.

===Non-career contracts===
USAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years. It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. government employees instead. United States government staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s. It soon became necessary for the federal government technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of technical assistance in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress&#x27;s requirement of major reductions of U.S. government staffing in 1953. By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift toward re use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).

===Financial conflicts of interest===
USAID states that &quot;U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America&#x27;s foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.&quot; In 2008, a report found that approximately 40% of aid money spent in Afghanistan had returned to donor countries through corporate profits, consultants&#x27; salaries, and other costs.

Although USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watchdog groups, politicians, foreign governments, and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current presidential administration. Under the Bush administration, for instance, it emerged that all five implementing partners selected to bid on a $600 million Iraq reconstruction contract enjoyed close ties to the administration.

===Political operations abroad===

William Blum has said that in the 1960s and early 1970s, USAID has maintained &quot;a close working relationship with the CIA, and Agency officers often operated abroad under USAID cover.&quot; The 1960s-era Office of Public Safety, a now-disbanded division of USAID, has been mentioned as an example of this, having served as a front for training foreign police in counterinsurgency methods (including torture techniques).

In 2008, Benjamin Dangl wrote in &quot;The Progressive&quot; that the Bush administration was using USAID to fund efforts in Bolivia to &quot;undermine the Morales government and coopt the country’s dynamic social movementsjust as it has tried to do recently in Venezuela and traditionally throughout Latin America&quot;.

From 2010 to 2012, the agency operated ZunZuneo, a social media site similar to Twitter in an attempt to instigate uprisings against the Cuban government. Its involvement was concealed in order to ensure mission success. The plan was to draw in users with non-controversial content until a critical mass is reached, after which more political messaging would be introduced. At its peak, more than 40,000 unsuspecting Cubans interacted on the platform.

In the summer of 2012, ALBA countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.

Critics have accused USAID of being a tool for US interventionism.
Additionally, the agency has been accused of covert political operations abroad, allegedly collaborating with the CIA on regime-change efforts and controversial funding decisions, leading to strained relations with some foreign governments.

===Influence on the United Nations===
Studies have found correlations between U.S. foreign aid levels and nations&#x27; membership on the United Nations Security Council, suggesting the use of aid to influence council votes.

In 1990, after Yemen voted against a resolution for a U.S.-led coalition to use force against Iraq, U.S. ambassador to the UN Thomas Pickering told Yemen&#x27;s UN Ambassador Abdullah Saleh al-Ashtal, &quot;That&#x27;s the most expensive No vote you ever cast.&quot; Within days, USAID ceased operations and funding in Yemen.

===State Department terrorist list===
USAID requires NGOs to sign a document renouncing terrorism, as a condition of funding. Issam Abdul Rahman, media coordinator for the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations&#x27; Network, a body representing 135 NGOs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said his organization &quot;takes issue with politically conditioned funding&quot;. Also, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, listed as a terrorist organization by the US Department of State, said that the USAID condition was nothing more than an attempt &quot;to impose political solutions prepared in the kitchens of Western intelligence agencies to weaken the rights and principles of Palestinians, especially the right of return.&quot;

===Renouncing prostitution and sex trafficking===
In 2003, Congress passed a law providing U.S. government funds to private groups to help fight AIDS and other diseases all over the world through USAID grants. One of the conditions imposed by the law on grant recipients was a requirement to have &quot;a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking&quot;. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.&quot; that the requirement violated the First Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against compelled speech.

=== Involvement in Peru&#x27;s forced sterilizations ===
For three decades, USAID has been the principal foreign donor to family planning in Peru. Until the 1990s, the Peruvian government&#x27;s commitment to providing family planning services was limited. In 1998, concerns arose regarding the involvement of USAID in forced sterilization campaigns in Peru. Some far-right politicians in Washington opposed USAID&#x27;s funding of family planning initiatives in the country. In January 1998, David Morrison, from the U.S.-based NGO Population Research Institute (PRI), traveled to Peru to investigate claims of human rights abuses related to these programs. During his visit, Morrison gathered testimony from Peruvian politicians and other figures opposed to family planning but did not meet with USAID officials in Peru. Upon his return to the United States, the PRI submitted its findings to U.S. Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the Republican Party, urging for the suspension of USAID&#x27;s family planning efforts in Peru. Smith subsequently dispatched a member of his staff to Peru for further investigation.

In February 1998, another far-right U.S. organization, the Latin American Alliance for the Family, sent its director to Peru to examine the situation, again without consulting USAID officials. On February 25, 1998, a subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on International Relations, chaired by Smith, held a hearing on &quot;the Peruvian population control program&quot;. Allegations that USAID was funding forced sterilizations in Peru prompted Congressman Todd Tiahrt to introduce the &quot;Tiahrt Amendment&quot; in 1998. However, the subcommittee concluded that USAID&#x27;s funding had not supported the abuses committed by the Peruvian government.

=== Office of Inspector General investigation into alleged terror-linked funding ===
According to a February 2024 report, the USAID&#x27;s Office of Inspector General launched an investigation in 2023 into the agency for awarding $110,000 in 2021 to Helping Hand for Relief and Development (HHRD), a charity in Michigan that Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee have accused in recent years of sharing ties to terrorism organizations in South Asia. In August 2023, USAID&#x27;s Vetting Support Unit cleared HHRD to receive the grant. In 2024, researchers at George Mason University reported that allegations against HHRD were part of a campaign targeting large American Muslim charities based on the manipulation of poorly-sourced information.

=== Trump administration&#x27;s claims of wasteful spending ===

In 2025, the Trump administration accused USAID of &quot;wasting massive sums of taxpayer money&quot; over several decades, including during Trump&#x27;s first presidency from 2017 to 2021. The administration cited a number of projects, including $1.5 million for LGBT workplace inclusion in Serbia, $2.5 million to build electric vehicle chargers in Vietnam, $6 million for tourism promotion in Egypt, and &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; (the largest item) purportedly allocated to discourage Afghanistan farmers from growing poppies for opium, which allegedly ended up supporting poppy cultivation and benefiting the Taliban. Fact checkers found that these claims were largely false, &quot;highly misleading,&quot; or wrong.

On February 3, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized four expenditures putatively uncovered by DOGE. Fact-checkers found that several of the alleged wasteful grants were actually administered by the State Department, not USAID. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, in his February 2025 order blocking the Trump administration from placing certain USAID employees on leave, &quot;noted that despite Trump&#x27;s claim of massive &#x27;corruption and fraud&#x27; in the agency, government lawyers had no support for that argument in court.&quot;

During Trump&#x27;s first term, his daughter Ivanka Trump, who served as Advisor to the President, used over $11,000 from USAID in 2019 to purchase video recording and reproducing equipment for a White House event. Both Ivanka and then-First Lady Melania Trump had publicly praised USAID&#x27;s work during the first Trump administration. Melania Trump visited Africa in 2018, speaking about USAID&#x27;s efforts and stating, &quot;We care, and we want to show the world that we care, and I’ve partnered and am working with USAID.&quot; Ivanka Trump also toured Africa on behalf of USAID, lauding her father&#x27;s creation of the &quot;Women&#x27;s Global Development and Prosperity&quot; initiative and emphasizing its alignment with U.S. national security interests.

In 2025, the White House&#x27;s allegations of fraud led to a drastic reduction in USAID&#x27;s staff from over 10,000 employees to fewer than 300. Critics, including former USAID administrators, decried this move, calling it &quot;one of the worst and most costly foreign policy blunders in U.S. history&quot;, and have argued that the cuts will result in job losses, damage to American businesses, and harm to vulnerable populations worldwide. The Inspector General for USAID issued a report on the spending pause and staff furloughs noting that these actions limited USAID&#x27;s efforts to assure that its distributed funds &quot;do not benefit terrorists and their supporters.&quot; The Inspector General also warned that $489 million in humanitarian food aid was at risk of spoiling due to staff furloughs and unclear guidance. The Office of Presidential Personnel fired the Inspector General the next day, despite a law requiring 30 days notice to Congress before firing an Inspector General.

=== Aid freeze victims ===

Pe Kha Lau, 71, died after she was discharged from a USAID-funded healthcare facility operated by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) while still relying on oxygen to survive. In the Umpiem Mai camp in Thailand, witnesses reported the deaths of multiple patients who too relied on oxygen. The IRC offered their condolences to the family and friends of Pe Kha Lau.

Christine Stegling, deputy executive director at UNAIDS, estimates that there could be a 400% increase in AIDS-related deaths around the world if PEPFAR is not formally reauthorized for USAID funding.

According to Pio Smith, UNFPA’s Asia-Pacific regional director, the USAID freeze could lead to 1,200 maternal deaths and 109,000 additional unwanted pregnancies in the next three years in Afghanistan.

<text>Alfred Brendel (born 5 January 1931) is a Czech-born Austrian classical pianist, poet, author, composer, and lecturer who is noted for his performances of Mozart, Schubert and Beethoven.

==Biography==

Brendel was born in Wizemberk, Czechoslovakia (now Loučná nad Desnou, Czech Republic) to a non-musical family. They moved to Zagreb, Yugoslavia (now Croatia), when Brendel was three years old and he began piano lessons there at the age of six with Sofija Deželić. He later moved to Graz, Austria, where he studied piano with Ludovica von Kaan at the Graz Conservatory and composition with Artur Michel. Towards the end of World War II, the 14-year-old Brendel was sent back to Yugoslavia to dig trenches.

After the war, Brendel composed music as well as continued to play the piano, to write and to paint. But he never had more formal piano lessons and, although he attended master classes with Edwin Fischer and Eduard Steuermann, was largely self-taught after age 16.

Aged 17, Brendel performed publicly for the first time, in the city of Graz. Titled &quot;The Fugue in Piano Literature&quot;, it included fugal works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt, as well as a sonata by Brendel himself. In 1949 he won fourth prize in the Ferruccio Busoni Piano Competition in Bolzano, Italy. Subsequent tours in Europe and Latin America began to establish his reputation, and he undertook masterclasses by Paul Baumgartner, Eduard Steuermann and Edwin Fischer.

Brendel&#x27;s first recording was of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 5 in 1950. Two years later he made the world premiere recording of Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Weihnachtsbaum&quot;. He went on to make a string of other records, including three complete sets of the Beethoven piano sonatas (one on Vox Records and two on Philips Records). He was the first performer to record Beethoven&#x27;s complete solo piano works. He has also recorded numerous works by Liszt, Brahms (including Brahms&#x27;s concertos), Robert Schumann, and particularly Franz Schubert. Brendel recorded the complete Mozart piano concertos with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, which is included in the Philips 180-CD complete Mozart Edition. He has recorded or performed little of the music of Frédéric Chopin, but not because of any lack of admiration for the composer. He considers Chopin&#x27;s Preludes &quot;the most glorious achievement in piano music after Beethoven and Schubert&quot;.

Brendel recorded extensively for the Vox label, providing it his first of three sets of the complete Beethoven sonatas. His breakthrough came after a recital of Beethoven at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, the day after which three major record labels called his agent. Around this time he moved to Hampstead, London, where he still lives. Since the 1970s, Brendel has recorded for Philips Classics Records. Brendel completed many tours in Europe, the United States, South America, Japan and Australia. He had a particularly close association with the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, but played regularly with all major orchestras in the US and elsewhere. Brendel has performed many cycles of the Beethoven sonatas and concertos, and was one of the few pianists who, in later years, could continue to fill large halls. He is only the third pianist (after Emil von Sauer and Wilhelm Backhaus) to have been awarded honorary membership of the Vienna Philharmonic, and he was awarded the Hans von Bülow Medal by the Berlin Philharmonic.

Reviewing his 1993 &quot;Beethoven: The Late Piano Sonatas&quot; (Philips Duo 438374), Damian Thompson of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;a more magisterial approach ... sprinkled with touches of Brendel&#x27;s strange, quirky humour.&quot;

In April 2007 Brendel was one of the initial signatories of the &quot;Appeal for the Establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations&quot;.

In 2009 Brendel was featured in the German-Austrian documentary &quot;Pianomania&quot;, about a Steinway &amp; Sons piano tuner, directed by Lilian Franck and Robert Cibis. The film premiered theatrically in North America, where it was met with positive reviews by The New York Times, as well as in Asia and Europe, and is a part of the Goethe-Institut catalogue.

==Work==

Brendel frequently performed the music of Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert and Mozart. He has played relatively few 20th century works but has performed Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Piano Concerto.

Brendel was lauded by music critic Michael Steinberg as &quot;the new Schnabel&quot;, whereas NY Times critic Harold C. Schonberg noted that some critics and specialists accused the pianist of &quot;pedanticism&quot;. Brendel&#x27;s playing is sometimes described as &quot;cerebral&quot;, and he has said that he believes the primary job of the pianist is to respect the composer&#x27;s wishes without showing off himself, or adding his own spin on the music: &quot;I am responsible to the composer, and particularly to the piece&quot;. Brendel cites, in addition to his mentor and teacher Edwin Fischer, pianists Alfred Cortot, Wilhelm Kempff, and the conductors Bruno Walter and Wilhelm Furtwängler as particular influences on his musical development.

Brendel has worked with younger pianists such as Paul Lewis, Amandine Savary, Till Fellner and, most recently, Kit Armstrong. He has also performed in concert and recorded with his son Adrian and has appeared in many Lieder recitals with Hermann Prey, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and Matthias Goerne.

In 2007 Brendel announced that he would retire from the concert platform after his concert of 18 December 2008 in Vienna, which featured him as soloist in Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 9; the orchestra (the Vienna Philharmonic) was conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras. His final concert in New York was at Carnegie Hall on 20 February 2008, with works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. Since his debut at Carnegie Hall on 21 January 1973 he performed there 81 times, including complete cycles of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas in 1983 and 1993.

==Personal life==
Brendel has been married twice. His first marriage, from 1960 to 1972, was to Iris Heymann-Gonzala, and produced a daughter, Doris, who is a progressive rock and pop rock musician. In 1975, Brendel married Irene Semler, and they have three children; a son, Adrian, who is a cellist, and two daughters, Katharina and Sophie.

<doc id="140419" wikidata="Q113368579" url="?curid=140419" title="New Federalism">
<text>New Federalism is a political philosophy of devolution, or the transfer of certain powers from the United States federal government back to the states. The primary objective of New Federalism, unlike that of the eighteenth-century political philosophy of Federalism, is the restoration of some of the autonomy and power, which individual states had lost to the federal government as a result of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. Many of the ideas of New Federalism originated with Richard Nixon.

As a policy theme, New Federalism typically involves the federal government providing block grants to the states to resolve a social issue. The federal government then monitors outcomes but provides broad discretion to the states for how the programs are implemented. Advocates of this approach sometimes cite a quotation from a dissent by Louis Brandeis in &quot;New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann&quot;:
==On the Supreme Court==
From 1937 to 1995, the Supreme Court of the United States did not void a single Act of Congress for exceeding Congress&#x27;s power under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, instead holding that anything that could conceivably impact interstate commerce was subject to federal regulation. It was thus seen as a (narrow) victory for new federalism when the Rehnquist Court reined in federal regulatory power in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995) and &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot; (2000) by limiting Congress’s power to legislate under the Commerce Clause.

The Supreme Court, in &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; (2005), held that the federal government could outlaw the use of marijuana for medical purposes under the Commerce Clause even if the marijuana was never bought or sold, and never crossed state lines. Justice O&#x27;Connor dissented in &quot;Gonzalez&quot;, beginning her opinion by citing &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;, which she followed with a federalist reference to Justice Louis Brandeis&#x27;s dissenting opinion in &quot;New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann.&quot;

== Education ==
Education has been controversial under New Federalism, but for different reasons. Almost all groups, state and federal, agree that a controlled education system is absolutely critical. The division, however, is that some believe that the education system should be nationally united (and therefore controlled by the federal government), while opponents believe that education should vary by state (and therefore be controlled by the state governments).

Some New Federalists, such as President Ronald Reagan, have flirted with the idea of abolishing the Department of Education, but the effort has been unsuccessful. During the Presidency of George W. Bush, the President and Congress cooperated to pass the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation, which required states to meet federal testing standards. Utah was the first state to reject NCLB, and the Attorney General of Connecticut sued the federal government for underfunding NCLB.

In April 2017, President Donald Trump used an executive order to lessen federal influence over education.

<text>Bedřich Smetana ( ; ; 2 March 1824 – 12 May 1884) was a Czech composer who pioneered the development of a musical style that became closely identified with his people&#x27;s aspirations to a cultural and political &quot;revival&quot;. He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. Internationally he is best known for his 1866 opera &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; and for the symphonic cycle &quot;Má vlast&quot; (&quot;My Fatherland&quot;), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer&#x27;s native Bohemia. It contains the famous symphonic poem &quot;Vltava&quot;, also popularly known by its German name &quot;Die Moldau&quot; (in English, &quot;The Moldau&quot;).

Smetana was naturally gifted as a composer, and gave his first public performance at the age of six. After conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in Prague. His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, in which he briefly participated. After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for Sweden, where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, and began to write large-scale orchestral works.

In the early 1860s, a more liberal political climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, &quot;The Brandenburgers in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, were premiered at Prague&#x27;s new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre&#x27;s principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city&#x27;s musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and may have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.

By the end of 1874, Smetana had become completely deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. His reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana&#x27;s works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.

==Biography==

===Family background and childhood===
Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Linková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives.

The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.

František Smetana played violin in a string quartet, and Barbora Smetana was a dancer. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl&#x27;s Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber&#x27;s overture to &quot;La muette de Portici&quot;, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (&quot;Kvapiček&quot;, or &quot;Little Galop&quot;), survives in sketch form.

In 1835, František retired to Růžkovy Lhotice Castle. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to the gymnasium at Jihlava, where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the Premonstratensian school at Německý Brod, where he was happier and made good progress. Among the friends he made here was the future Czech revolutionary poet Karel Havlíček Borovský, whose departure for Prague in 1838 may have influenced Smetana&#x27;s own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with František&#x27;s approval, he enrolled at Prague&#x27;s Academic Grammar School under Josef Jungmann, a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the movement for Czech national revival.

===Apprentice musician===

====First steps====
Smetana arrived in Prague in the autumn of 1839. Finding Jungmann&#x27;s school uncongenial (he was mocked by his classmates for his country manners), he soon began missing classes. He attended concerts, visited the opera, listened to military bands and joined an amateur string quartet for whom he composed simple pieces. After Liszt gave a series of piano recitals in the city, Smetana became convinced that he would find satisfaction only in a musical career. He confided to his journal that he wanted &quot;to become a Mozart in composition and a Liszt in technique&quot;. However, the Prague idyll ended when František discovered his son&#x27;s truancy and removed him from the city. František at this time saw music as a diverting pastime, not as a career choice. Smetana was placed temporarily with his uncle in Nové Město, where he enjoyed a brief romance with his cousin Louisa. He commemorated their passion in &quot;Louisa&#x27;s Polka&quot;, Smetana&#x27;s earliest complete composition that has survived.

An older cousin, Josef Smetana, a teacher at the Premonstratensian School in Plzeň (German: Pilsen), then offered to supervise the boy&#x27;s remaining schooling, and in the summer of 1840 Smetana departed for Plzeň. He remained there until he completed his schooling in 1843. His skills as a pianist were in great demand at the town&#x27;s many soirées, and he enjoyed a hectic social life. This included a number of romances, the most important of which was with Kateřina Kolářová, whom he had known briefly in his early childhood. Smetana was entirely captivated with her, writing in his journal: &quot;When I am not with her I am sitting on hot coals and have no peace&quot;. He composed several pieces for her, among which are two &quot;Quadrilles&quot;, a song duet, and an incomplete piano study for the left hand. He also composed his first orchestral piece, a B-flat minuet.

====Student and teacher====
By the time Smetana completed his schooling, his father&#x27;s fortunes had declined. Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty florins, and no immediate prospects. Kateřina Kolářová&#x27;s mother introduced Smetana to Josef Proksch, then head of the Prague Music Institute (where Kateřina was studying), with whom he began composition lessons. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician&#x27;s financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun. During the course of his studies, Proksch introduced Smetana to both Liszt and Berlioz.

For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.

===Early career===

====Revolutionary====
Smetana&#x27;s concert tour to Western Bohemia was poorly supported, so he abandoned it and returned to Prague, where he made a living from private pupils and occasional appearances as an accompanist in chamber concerts. He also began work on his first major orchestral work, the Overture in D major.

For a brief period in 1848, Smetana was a revolutionary. In the climate of political change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year, a pro-democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana&#x27;s old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy. A Citizens&#x27; Army (&quot;Svornost&quot;) was formed to defend the city against possible attack. Smetana wrote a series of patriotic works, including two marches dedicated respectively to the Czech National Guard and the Students&#x27; Legion of the University of Prague, and &quot;The Song of Freedom&quot; to words by Ján Kollár. In June 1848, as the Habsburg armies moved to suppress rebellious tendencies, Prague came under attack from the Austrian forces led by the Prince of Windisch-Grätz. As a member of Svornost, Smetana helped to man the barricades on the Charles Bridge. The nascent uprising was quickly crushed, but Smetana avoided the imprisonment or exile received by leaders such as Havlíček. During his brief spell with Svornost, he met the writer and leading radical, Karel Sabina, who would later provide libretti for Smetana&#x27;s first two operas.

====Piano Institute====
Early in 1848, Smetana wrote to Franz Liszt, whom he had not yet met, asking him to accept the dedication of a new piano work, &quot;Six Characteristic Pieces&quot;, and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400 florins, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance. This encouragement was the beginning of a friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career. Despite Liszt&#x27;s lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students. After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism, in whose eyes Smetana was developing a reputation. Proksch wrote of Smetana&#x27;s support for his people&#x27;s cause, and said that he &quot;could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language.&quot; In 1849 the institute was relocated to the home of Kateřina&#x27;s parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor Ferdinand, who had settled in Prague, attended the school&#x27;s matinée concerts. Smetana&#x27;s performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague&#x27;s musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married his beloved, the young pianist Kateřina Kolářová, on 27 August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.

====Budding composer====
In 1850, notwithstanding his revolutionary sentiments, Smetana accepted the post of Court Pianist in Ferdinand&#x27;s establishment in Prague Castle. He continued teaching in the Piano Institute, and devoted himself increasingly to composition. His works, mainly for the piano, included the three-part &quot;Wedding Scenes&quot;, some of the music of which was later used in &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;. He also wrote numerous short experimental pieces collected under the name &quot;Album Leaves&quot;, and a series of polkas. During 1853–54 he worked on a major orchestral piece, the &quot;Triumphal Symphony&quot;, composed to commemorate the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph. The symphony was rejected by the Imperial Court, possibly on the grounds that the brief musical references to the Austrian national anthem were not sufficiently prominent. Undeterred, Smetana hired an orchestra at his own expense to perform the symphony at the Konvikt Hall in Prague on 26 February 1855. The work was coolly received, and the concert was a financial failure.

====Private sorrows and professional disenchantment====

In the years between 1854 and 1856 Smetana suffered a series of personal blows. In July 1854 his second daughter, Gabriela, died of tuberculosis. A year later his eldest daughter Bedřiška, who at the age of four was showing signs of musical precocity, died of scarlet fever. Smetana wrote his Piano Trio in G minor as a tribute to her memory; it was performed in Prague on 3 December 1855 and, according to the composer, was received &quot;harshly&quot; by the critics, although Liszt praised it. Smetana&#x27;s sorrows continued; just after Bedřiška&#x27;s death a fourth daughter, Kateřina, had been born but she, too, died in June 1856. By this time Smetana&#x27;s wife Kateřina had also been diagnosed with tuberculosis.

In July 1856, Smetana received news of the death in exile of his revolutionary friend Karel Havlíček. The political climate in Prague was a further source of gloom; hopes of a more enlightened government and social reform following Franz Joseph&#x27;s accession in 1848 had faded as Austrian absolutism reasserted itself under Baron Alexander von Bach. Despite the good name of the Piano Institute, Smetana&#x27;s status as a concert pianist was generally considered below that of contemporaries such as Alexander Dreyschock. Critics acknowledged Smetana&#x27;s &quot;delicate, crystalline touch&quot;, closer in style to Chopin than Liszt, but believed that his physical frailty was a serious drawback to his concert-playing ambitions. His main performance success during this period was his playing of Mozart&#x27;s D minor Piano Concerto at a concert celebrating the centenary of Mozart&#x27;s birth, in January 1856. His disenchantment with Prague was growing and, perhaps influenced by Dreyschock&#x27;s accounts of opportunities in Sweden, Smetana decided to seek success there. On 11 October 1856, after writing to his parents that &quot;Prague did not wish to acknowledge me, so I left it&quot;, he departed for Gothenburg.

===Years of travel===

====Gothenburg====
Smetana initially went to Gothenburg without Kateřina. Writing to Liszt, he said that the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity &quot;for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague.&quot; Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications, and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music. In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled &quot;Frithjof&quot; and &quot;The Viking&#x27;s Voyage&quot;, were sketched but abandoned.

In summer 1857, Smetana came home to Prague and found Kateřina in failing health. In June, Smetana&#x27;s father František died. That autumn Smetana returned to Gothenburg, with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; and the symphonic poem &quot;Die Ideale&quot;, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana&#x27;s principal teacher throughout the latter&#x27;s creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.

Back in Sweden, Smetana found among his new pupils a young housewife, Fröjda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana transcribed two songs from Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; cycle, and transformed one of his own early piano pieces into a polka entitled &quot;Vision at the Ball&quot;. He also began composing on a more expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem &quot;Richard III&quot;, his first major orchestral composition since the &quot;Triumphal Symphony&quot;. He followed this with &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot;, inspired by Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Wallenstein&quot; drama trilogy, and began a third symphonic poem &quot;Hakon Jarl&quot;, based on the tragic drama by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger. Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: &quot;Macbeth and the Witches&quot;, and an Étude in C in the style of Liszt.

====Bereavement, remarriage and return to Prague====
Kateřina&#x27;s health gradually worsened and in the spring of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19 April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died &quot;gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew my attention to her.&quot; After placing Žofie with Kateřina&#x27;s mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera &quot;Der Barbier von Bagdad&quot;, by Liszt&#x27;s pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana&#x27;s own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, and fell in love with Karel&#x27;s sister-in-law , sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10 July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.

Meanwhile, the defeat of Franz Joseph&#x27;s army at Solferino in 1859 had weakened the Habsburg Empire and led to the fall from power of Baron von Bach. This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture. Before deciding his own future, in September he set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure. Back in Prague, he conducted performances of &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot; in the Žofín Palace concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the &quot;New German&quot; school represented primarily by Liszt; Smetana responded that &quot;a prophet is without honour in his own land.&quot; In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: &quot;My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there do I find real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself.&quot;

===National prominence===

====Seeking recognition====
In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre&#x27;s conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a &quot;dangerous modernist&quot;, in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by , which offered prizes of 600 florins each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina&#x27;s text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of &quot;The Brandenburgers in Bohemia&quot;.
At this stage in his career, Smetana&#x27;s command of Czech was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in Czech developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; &quot;The Three Riders&quot; and &quot;The Renegade&quot; were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in Czech to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech-language newspaper &quot;Národní listy&quot;. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.

On 23 April 1864, Smetana conducted Berlioz&#x27;s choral symphony &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; at a concert celebrating the Shakespeare tercentenary, adding to the programme his own &quot;March for the Shakespearean Festival&quot;. That year, Smetana&#x27;s bid to become Director of the Prague Conservatory failed. He had set high hopes on this appointment: &quot;My friends are trying to persuade me that this post might have been especially created for me,&quot; he wrote to . Again his hopes were thwarted by his association with the perceived radical Liszt, and the appointing committee chose the conservative patriot for the post.
Almost three years passed before Smetana was declared the winner of Harrach&#x27;s opera competition. Before then, on 5 January 1866, &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot; had been performed to an enthusiastic reception at the Provisional Theatre—over strong opposition from Maýr, who had refused to rehearse or conduct the piece. The idiom was too advanced for Maýr&#x27;s liking, and the opera was eventually staged under the composer&#x27;s own direction. &quot;I was called on stage nine times,&quot; Smetana wrote, recording that the house was sold out and that the critics were full of praise. Music historian Rosa Newmarch believes that, although &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot; has not stood the test of time, it contains all the germs of Smetana&#x27;s operatic art.

====Opera maestro====
In July 1863, Sabina had delivered the libretto for a second opera, a light comedy entitled &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because of the success of &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot;, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30 May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana&#x27;s international reputation. The opera&#x27;s first performance was a failure; it was held on one of the hottest evenings of the year, on the eve of the Austro-Prussian War, with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.

Back in 1866, as the composer of &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot; with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana thought he might be targeted by the invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition—appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200 florins. In the absence of a body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own &quot;Bartered Bride&quot;. The quality of Smetana&#x27;s production of Glinka&#x27;s &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; angered Glinka&#x27;s champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 28 February 1868 Smetana conducted another national opera by another Slavic composer, &quot;Halka&quot; by Stanisław Moniuszko. On 16 May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he had written a &quot;Festive Overture&quot; for the occasion. That same evening Smetana&#x27;s third opera, &quot;Dalibor&quot;, was premièred at Prague&#x27;s . Although its initial reception was warm, its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.

====Opposition====
Early in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana had made a powerful enemy in , the director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana, Pivoda was aggrieved when the conductor recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda&#x27;s school. In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda said Smetana was using his position to further his own career, at the expense of other composers.

Pivoda then took issue with &quot;Dalibor&quot;, calling it an example of extreme &quot;Wagnerism&quot; and thus unsuited as a model for Czech national opera. &quot;Wagnerism&quot; meant the adoption of Wagner&#x27;s theories of a continuous role for the orchestra and the building of an integrated musical drama, rather than a stringing together of lyrical numbers. The Provisional Theatre&#x27;s chairman, František Ladislav Rieger, had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot;, and the issue eventually divided Prague&#x27;s musical society. The music critic Otakar Hostinský believed that Wagner&#x27;s theories should be the basis of the national opera, and argued that &quot;Dalibor&quot; was the beginning of the &quot;correct&quot; direction. The opposite camp, led by Pivoda, supported the principles of Italian opera, in which the voice rather than the orchestra was the predominant dramatic device.

Even within the theatre itself there was division. Rieger led a campaign to eject Smetana from the conductorship and reappoint Maýr, and in December 1872 a petition signed by 86 subscribers to the theatre called for Smetana&#x27;s resignation. Strong support from vice-chairman , and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana&#x27;s survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger salary and increased responsibility as artistic director.

Smetana gradually brought more operas by emergent Czech composers to the theatre, but little of his own work. By 1872 he had completed his monumental fourth opera, &quot;Libuše&quot;, his most ambitious work to date, but was withholding its premiere for the future opening of the forthcoming National Theatre. The machinations of Pivoda and his supporters distracted Smetana from composition, and he had further vexation when &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; was produced in Saint Petersburg, in January 1871. Although the audience was enthusiastic, press reports were hostile, one describing the work as &quot;no better than that of a gifted fourteen-year-old boy.&quot; Smetana was deeply offended, and blamed his old adversary, Balakirev, for inciting negative feelings against the opera.

===Final decade===
====Deafness====
In the respite following his reappointment, Smetana concentrated on his fifth opera, &quot;The Two Widows&quot;, composed between June 1873 and January 1874. After its first performance at the Provisional Theatre on 27 March 1874, Smetana&#x27;s supporters presented him with a decorative baton. But his opponents continued to attack him, comparing his conductorship unfavourably with the Maýr regime and saying that under Smetana &quot;Czech opera sickens to death at least once annually.&quot; By the summer Smetana was ill; a throat infection was followed by a rash and an apparent blockage to the ears. By mid-August, unable to work, he transferred his duties to his deputy, Adolf Čech. A press announcement stated that Smetana had &quot;become ill as a result of nervous strain caused by certain people recently.&quot;

In September, Smetana told the theatre he would resign his appointment unless his health improved. He had become totally deaf in his right ear, and in October lost all hearing in his left ear also. After his subsequent resignation the theatre offered him an annual pension of 1,200 florins for the continued right to perform his operas, an arrangement Smetana reluctantly accepted. Money raised in Prague by former students, and by former lover Fröjda Benecke in Gothenburg, amounted to 1,244 florins. This allowed Smetana to seek medical treatment abroad, but to no avail. In January 1875 he wrote in his journal: &quot;If my disease is incurable, then I should prefer to be liberated from this life.&quot; His spirits were further lowered at this time by a deterioration in his relationship with Bettina, mainly over money matters. &quot;I cannot live under the same roof as a person who hates and persecutes me&quot;, he informed her. Although divorce was considered, the couple stayed unhappily together.

====Late flowering====
In worsening health, Smetana continued to compose. From 1875 he stayed as a guest in Jabkenice, the home of his eldest daughter Žofie, where he was able to work undisturbed in tranquil surroundings. From June 1876 he, Bettina, and their two daughters left Prague for Jabkenice permanently. Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called &quot;Má vlast&quot; (&quot;My Fatherland&quot;), and had completed the first two, &quot;Vyšehrad&quot; and &quot;Vltava&quot;, which had both been performed in Prague during 1875. In Jabkenice, Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5 November 1882 under the baton of Adolf Čech. Other major works composed in these years were the E minor String Quartet, &quot;From My Life&quot;, a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: &quot;The Kiss&quot;, &quot;The Secret&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Wall&quot;, all of which received their first performances between 1876 and 1882.

The long-delayed premiere of Smetana&#x27;s opera &quot;Libuše&quot; finally arrived when the National Theatre opened on 11 June 1881. He had not initially been given tickets, but at the last minute was asked into the theatre director&#x27;s box. The audience received the work enthusiastically, and Smetana was called to the stage repeatedly. Shortly after this event the new theatre was destroyed by fire; despite his infirmities, Smetana helped to raise funds for the rebuilding. The restored theatre reopened on 18 November 1883, again with &quot;Libuše&quot;.

These years saw Smetana&#x27;s growing recognition as the principal exponent of Czech national music. This status was celebrated by several events during Smetana&#x27;s final years. On 4 January 1880, a special concert in Prague marked the 50th anniversary of his first public performance; Smetana attended, and played his Piano Trio in G minor from 1855. In May 1882 &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; was given its 100th performance, an unprecedented event in the history of Czech opera. It was so popular that a repeat &quot;100th performance&quot; was staged. A gala concert and banquet was arranged to honour Smetana&#x27;s 60th birthday in March 1884, but he was too ill to attend.

===Illness and death===

In 1879, Smetana had written to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, revealing fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, &quot;Prague Carnival&quot;, but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, &quot;Viola&quot;, based on the character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; by the middle of February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23 April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12 May 1884.

The hospital registered the cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana&#x27;s family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana&#x27;s exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr. , who has argued that Vlček&#x27;s tests do not provide a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana&#x27;s that were incompatible with syphilis.

Smetana&#x27;s funeral took place on 15 May, at the Týn Church in Prague&#x27;s Old Town. The subsequent procession to the Vyšehrad Cemetery was led by members of the Hlahol, bearing torches, and was followed by a large crowd. The grave later became a place of pilgrimage for musical visitors to Prague. On the funeral evening, a scheduled performance of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; at the National Theatre was allowed to proceed, the stage draped with black cloth as a mark of respect.

Smetana was survived by Bettina, their daughters Zdeňka and Božena, and by Žofie. None of them played any significant role in Smetana&#x27;s musical life. Bettina lived until 1908; Žofie, who had married Josef Schwarz in 1874, predeceased her stepmother, dying in 1902. The younger daughters eventually married, living out their lives away from the public eye. A permanent memorial to Smetana&#x27;s life and work is the Bedřich Smetana Museum in Prague, founded in 1926 within the Charles University&#x27;s Institute for Musicology. In 1936 the museum moved to the former Waterworks building on the banks of the Vltava, and since 1976 has been part of the Czech Museum of Music.

==Music==
The basic materials from which Smetana fashioned his art, according to Newmarch, were nationalism, realism and romanticism. A particular feature of all his later music is its descriptive character—all his major compositions outside his operas are written to programmes, and many are specifically autobiographical. Smetana&#x27;s champions have recognised the major influences on his work as Liszt, Wagner and Berlioz—the &quot;progressives&quot;—while those same advocates have often played down the significance of &quot;traditionalist&quot; composers such as Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi and Meyerbeer.

===Piano works===
All but a handful of Smetana&#x27;s compositions before his departure for Gothenburg are piano works. Some of these early pieces have been dismissed by music historian Harold Schonberg as &quot;bombastic virtuoso rhetoric derived from Liszt&quot;. Under Proksch, however, Smetana acquired more polish, as revealed in works such as the G minor Sonata of 1846 and the E-flat Polka of the same year. The set of &quot;Six Characteristic Pieces&quot; of 1848 was dedicated to Liszt, who described it as &quot;the most outstanding, finely felt and finely finished pieces that have recently come to my note.&quot; In this period Smetana planned a cycle of so-called &quot;album leaves&quot;, short pieces in every major and minor key, after the manner of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Preludes&quot;. The project became somewhat disorganised; in the pieces completed, some keys are repeated while others are unrepresented. After Smetana&#x27;s final return from Gothenburg, when he committed himself primarily to the development of Czech opera, he wrote nothing for the piano for 13 years.

In his last decade Smetana composed three substantial piano cycles. The first, from 1875, was entitled &quot;Dreams&quot;. It was dedicated to former pupils of Smetana&#x27;s, who had raised funds to cover medical expenses, and is also a tribute to the composer&#x27;s models of the 1840s—Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. Smetana&#x27;s last major piano works were the two &quot;Czech Dances&quot; cycles of 1877 and 1879. The first of these had the purpose, as Smetana explained to his publisher, of &quot;idealising the polka, as Chopin in his day did with the mazurka.&quot; The second cycle is a medley of dances, each given a specific title so that people would know &quot;which dances with real names we Czechs have.&quot;

===Vocal and choral===
Smetana&#x27;s early songs are settings of German poems for single voice. Apart from his 1848 &quot;Song of Freedom&quot;, he did not begin to write pieces for a full choir until after his Gothenburg sojourn, when he composed numerous works for the Hlahol choral society, mostly for unaccompanied male voices. Smetana&#x27;s choral music is generally nationalistic in character, ranging in scale from the short &quot;Ceremonial Chorus&quot; written after the death of the composer&#x27;s revolutionary friend Havlíček, to the setting of &quot;Song of the Sea&quot;, a substantial work with the character of a choral drama.

Towards the end of his life Smetana returned to simple song-writing, with five &quot;Evening Songs&quot; (1879) to words by the poet Vítězslav Hálek. His final completed work, &quot;Our Song&quot; (1883), is the last of four settings of texts by . Despite the state of Smetana&#x27;s health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and dance. The piece was lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.

===Chamber===
Apart from a juvenile fantasia for violin and piano, Smetana composed only four chamber works, yet each had a deep personal significance. The Piano Trio in G minor of 1855 was composed after the death of his daughter Bedřiška; its style is close to that of Robert Schumann, with hints of Liszt, and the overall tone is elegiac. It was 20 years before he returned to the chamber genre with his first String Quartet. This E minor work, subtitled &quot;From My Life&quot;, was autobiographical in character, illustrating the composer&#x27;s youthful enthusiasm for his art, his friendships and loves and, in a change of mood, the onset of his deafness represented by a long harmonic E in the final movement above ominous string tremolos. His second String Quartet, in D minor, written in 1882–83 in defiance of his physician&#x27;s orders to refrain from all musical activity, was composed in short snatches, &quot;a swirl of music of a person who has lost his hearing.&quot; It represents Smetana&#x27;s frustrations with his life, but is not wholly gloomy, and includes a bright polka. It was one of his final compositions; between the two quartets he wrote a violin and piano duet &quot;From the homeland&quot;, a mixture of melancholy and happiness with strong affinity to Czech folk material.

===Orchestral===
Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his &quot;Triumphal Symphony&quot; of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as &quot;an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince&quot;, Smetana&#x27;s biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer&#x27;s more mature works. Despite the symphony&#x27;s rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the &quot;triumphal&quot; tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the &quot;Festive Symphony&quot;.

Smetana&#x27;s visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; and &quot;Die Ideale&quot;, caused a material reorientation of Smetana&#x27;s orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (&quot;Richard III, Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot; and &quot;Hakon Jarl&quot;), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.

From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning &quot;Má vlast&quot; in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets &quot;Má vlast&quot; with the opera Libuše as &quot;direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle&quot;. &quot;Má vlast&quot; is the first of Smetana&#x27;s mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents &quot;a cross-section of Czech history and legend and impressions of its scenery, and ... conveys vividly to us Smetana&#x27;s view of the ethos and greatness of the nation.&quot; Despite its nationalistic associations this work has, according to Newmarch, carried Smetana&#x27;s name further afield than anything he wrote, with the exception of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; Overture. Smetana dedicated &quot;Má vlast&quot; to the city of Prague; after its first performance in November 1882 it was acclaimed by the Czech musical public as the true representation of Czech national style. Its &quot;Vltava&quot; (or &quot;The Moldau&quot; in German) movement, depicting the river that runs through Prague towards its junction with the Elbe, is Smetana&#x27;s best-known and most internationally popular orchestral composition.

===Opera===

Smetana had virtually no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission to create a new canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.

Although a follower of Wagner&#x27;s reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with &quot;Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!&quot; The predominantly &quot;national&quot; character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana&#x27;s deafness. The first of this final trio, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch as a work of serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana&#x27;s librettist for &quot;The Kiss&quot; was the young feminist Eliška Krásnohorská, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana&#x27;s powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in Czech meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas.

Smetana&#x27;s eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; is performed regularly outside the composer&#x27;s homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, while not a &quot;gem of the first order&quot;, is nevertheless &quot;a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind.&quot; Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says &quot;lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity&quot;, was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: &quot;&quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; was merely child&#x27;s play, written straight off the reel&quot;. In the view of the critic William Ritter, Smetana&#x27;s creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, &quot;Dalibor&quot;.

===Reception===

Even in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognise Smetana. As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public&#x27;s lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his &quot;prophet without honour&quot; remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot; at Žofín Island in January 1862.

Smetana&#x27;s first noteworthy public success was his initial opera &quot;The Brandenburgers in Bohemia&quot;, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, &quot;Dalibor&quot;, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana&#x27;s tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874.

In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, &quot;The Two Widows&quot; and &quot;The Secret&quot; were warmly received, while &quot;The Kiss&quot; was greeted by an &quot;overwhelming ovation&quot;. The ceremonial opera &quot;Libuše&quot; was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Wall&quot; were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling &quot;dishonoured and dispirited.&quot; This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim that followed the first performance of the complete &quot;Má vlast&quot; cycle in November: &quot;Everyone rose to his feet and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after each of the six parts ... At the end of &quot;Blaník&quot; [the final part] the audience was beside itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer.&quot;

Smetana has a star on the &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; in Vienna, opened to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Theater an der Wien. The asteroid 2047 Smetana was named in his honour.

==Character and reputation==

Smetana&#x27;s biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a &quot;joie-de-vivre&quot; that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the &quot;Wagnerism&quot; in &quot;Dalibor&quot; he responded by writing &quot;Libuše&quot;, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was &quot;crying as though her heart would break&quot;.

There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether &quot;nationalistic music&quot; can in fact exist: &quot;We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.&quot; He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.
According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana&#x27;s close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland &quot;monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged&quot; by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century. As a result, Tyrrell argues, a view of Czech music has been propagated that plays down the contributions of contemporaries and successors such as Dvořák, Janáček, Josef Suk and other, lesser known, composers. This is at odds with perceptions in the outside world, where Dvořák is far more frequently played and much better known. Harold Schonberg observes that &quot;Smetana was the one who founded Czech music, but Antonín Dvořák ... was the one who popularized it.&quot;

Smetana has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music.

<text>Hepatology is the branch of medicine that incorporates the study of liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, and pancreas as well as management of their disorders. Although traditionally considered a sub-specialty of gastroenterology, rapid expansion has led in some countries to doctors specializing solely on this area, who are called hepatologists.

Diseases and complications related to viral hepatitis and alcohol are the main reason for seeking specialist advice. More than two billion people have been infected with hepatitis B virus at some point in their life, and approximately 350 million have become persistent carriers. Up to 80% of liver cancers can be attributed to either hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. In terms of mortality, the former is second only to smoking among known agents causing cancer. With more widespread implementation of vaccination and strict screening before blood transfusion, lower infection rates are expected in the future. In many countries, however, overall alcohol consumption is increasing, and consequently the number of people with cirrhosis and other related complications is commensurately increasing.

==Scope of specialty==
As for many medical specialties, patients are most likely to be referred by family physicians (i.e., GP) or by physicians from different disciplines. The reasons might be:
* Drug overdose. Paracetamol overdose is common.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension related to liver damage
* Abnormal blood test suggesting liver disease
* Enzyme defects leading to bigger liver in children commonly named storage disease of liver
* Jaundice / Hepatitis virus positivity in blood, perhaps discovered on screening blood tests
* Ascites or swelling of abdomen from fluid accumulation, commonly due to liver disease but can be from other diseases like heart failure
* All patients with advanced liver disease e.g. cirrhosis should be under specialist care
* To undergo ERCP for diagnosing diseases of biliary tree or their management
* Fever with other features suggestive of infection involving mentioned organs. Some exotic tropical diseases like hydatid cyst, kala-azar or schistosomiasis may be suspected. Microbiologists would be involved as well
* Systemic diseases affecting liver and biliary tree e.g. haemochromatosis
* Follow-up of liver transplant
* Pancreatitis - commonly due to alcohol or gallstone
* Cancer of above organs. Usually multi-disciplinary approach is undertaken with involvement of oncologist and other experts.

==History==

Evidence from autopsies on Egyptian mummies suggests that liver damage from the parasitic infection bilharziasis was widespread in the ancient society.
It is possible that the Greeks may have been aware of the liver&#x27;s ability to exponentially duplicate as illustrated by the story of Prometheus. However, knowledge about liver disease in antiquity is questionable. Most of the important advances in the field have been made in the last 50 years.
* In 400 BC Hippocrates mentioned liver abscess in aphorisms.
* Roman anatomist Galen thought the liver was the principal organ of the body. He also identified its relationship with the gallbladder and spleen.
* Around 100 CE Aretaeus of Cappadocia wrote on jaundice
* In the medieval period Avicenna noted the importance of urine in diagnosing liver conditions.
* In 1770, French anatomist Antoine Portal noted bleeding due to oesophageal varices,
* In 1844, Gabriel Valentin showed pancreatic juices break down food in digestion.
* 1846 Justus Von Leibig discovered pancreatic juice tyrosine
* 1862 Austin Flint described the production of &quot;stercorin&quot;.
* 1875 Victor Charles Hanot described cirrhotic jaundice and other diseases of the liver
* In 1958, Moore developed a standard technique for canine orthotopic liver transplantation.
* The first human liver transplant was performed in 1963 by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl on a three-year-old male afflicted with biliary atresia after perfecting the technique on canine livers.
* Baruch S. Blumberg discovered hepatitis B virus in 1966 and developed the first vaccine against it 1969. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1976.
* In 1989, investigators from the CDC (Daniel W. Bradley) and Chiron (Michael Houghton) identified the hepatitis C virus, which had previously been known as non-A, non-B hepatitis and could not be detected in the blood supply.
* Only in 1992 was a blood test created that could detect hepatitis C in donated blood.

The word &quot;hepatology&quot; is from Ancient Greek ἧπαρ (&quot;hepar&quot;) or ἡπατο- (&quot;hepato-&quot;), meaning &quot;liver&quot;, and -λογία (&quot;-logia&quot;), meaning &quot;study&quot;.

==Disease classification==
1. International Classification of Disease (ICD 2007) – WHO classification:
* Chapter XI: Diseases of the digestive system
** K70-K77 Diseases of liver
** K80-K87 Disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas

3. National Library of Medicine Catalogue
* WI 700-740 Liver and biliary tree Diseases
* WI 800-830 Pancrease
&quot;Also see Hepato-biliary diseases&quot;

==Important procedures==

* Transhepatic pancreato-cholangiography (TPC)
* Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS)
* Liver transplant and pancreas transplant

<doc id="140437" wikidata="Q1004336" url="?curid=140437" title="Fun Lovin' Criminals">
<text>Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals are an American rap rock band from New York City. They are best known for their hit &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot;, which features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino, and the song &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;, which recalls Barry White&#x27;s backing vocal group. Their songs often focus on life in New York City, as well as urban life in general. Their lyrics can be gritty or existentialist in nature, touching on topics such as organized crime and urban violence, but they are just as often humorous or satirical. The band gained a large following internationally, notably in Northwest Europe, around the release of their first two albums in the late 1990s.

== History ==
=== Formation and first albums: 1993–1999 ===
The band was formed in 1993 by Huey Morgan, Brian &quot;Fast&quot; Leiser and Steve Borgovini after Leiser, who was already friends with Borgovini, met Morgan at the club where they both worked. They started playing together and would provide the entertainment for the club when a booked act failed to show up. It was during one of these stand-in gigs that they came to the attention of EMI and they were offered a record deal.

&quot;Come Find Yourself&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album, was released in the summer of 1996 by Chrysalis Records and followed their single &quot;The Grave And The Constant&quot; (UK No. 72), which was released a month earlier, into the UK charts. The album also featured the UK Top 40 hits &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot; (UK No. 22), &quot;The Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminal&quot; (UK No. 26) and &quot;King Of New York&quot; (UK No. 28). The subject of the latter touched on the imprisonment of Italian-American mafioso John Gotti, the wannabe gangsters emulating his style, and his fans and followers in his community that maintained his innocence. The biggest hit, &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot;, features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino and a guitar sample from Tones On Tail song &quot;Movement of Fear&quot;, interspersed with rap verses and a sung, anthemic, chorus. &quot;Come Find Yourself&quot; had a slow rise up the UK Albums Chart, finally peaking at No. 7 and spending well over a year in the chart, but it failed to make any impact in the US, despite the band appearing as musical guests on MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Jenny McCarthy Show&quot;. The success of the album prompted the re-release of &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot; as a single, alongside a cover of the 10cc classic &quot;I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot;, which this time reached UK No. 12.

&quot;100% Colombian&quot;, released in August 1998 by Virgin Records, had a far grittier sound tempered by three upbeat songs, and several downtempo tracks, including &quot;Love Unlimited&quot;, a tribute to Barry White. &quot;Korean Bodega&quot;, one of the aforementioned upbeat songs, was the biggest hit from the album, reaching No. 15, their second-highest-placing single so far after the re-release of &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot;.

In June 1999 the band played at Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage. Their December 1999 album &quot;Mimosa&quot;, released by EMI, was a compilation album consisting mostly of laid-back lounge-style covers and different versions of earlier released tracks. While making reasonable sales, the album was their weakest-selling album yet and remained so for some years. It was around this time, in 1999, that Steve Borgovini left the band. He was replaced by Maxwell &quot;Mackie&quot; Jayson. A permanent replacement was found in 2003 in the form of Mark Reid (a.k.a. Frank Benbini) from Leicester, United Kingdom, who had previously worked with the band as Jayson&#x27;s technician.

=== Mainstream success: 2000–2008 ===

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Loco&quot;, was released in early 2001. Back under EMI, the album had all new songs including the eponymous single, which became their biggest hit yet, reaching No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the only single release from the album to reach the UK Top 40, and its success helped &quot;Loco&quot; to reach No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart.

Their final album under EMI was a &quot;best of&quot; compilation called &quot;Bag of Hits&quot; released in 2002. It was released in both one- and two-disc versions, with the second disc featuring remixes of Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals songs by other artists. EMI released this album against the wishes of the band, who were not happy with the two-disc version. However, despite their objections it reached No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart.

After parting company with EMI the band was picked up by Sanctuary Records in the UK, under which they released their fourth studio album, &quot;Welcome to Poppy&#x27;s&quot; (2003). While it received strong, but not fantastic, music reviews it failed to live up to the commercial success of any previous album, peaking at No. 20 in the UK Albums Chart. The best-selling single from the album reached No. 61.

EMI continued to release the band&#x27;s back catalog, as well as unreleased songs on two more albums. The Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals made no further releases until 2005 album &quot;Livin&#x27; in the City&quot;, still under Sanctuary Records. This was considered a love letter to New York with many songs extolling the virtues of the city.

In June 2008 they made their second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival, this time on the Jazz World Stage.

=== Releases, touring &amp; Huey Morgan&#x27;s departure: 2009–2021 ===
In April 2010 &quot;Classic Fantastic&quot; was released, kicking off a European tour which began in Manchester. Legal wranglings with their previous manager meant that this album was their first official output in five years, although they had played live during this period. Leiser and Benbini had produced much of the album in London, while Morgan recorded his parts in New York.

&quot;Classic Fantastic&quot; was the first album on Kilohertz, the band&#x27;s own label, and signaled a new business model for the Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals based on touring their live shows rather than relying on record sales alone. Singles from the album were the title track &quot;Classic Fantastic&quot; followed by &quot;Mr Sun&quot;. The official video for &quot;Mr Sun&quot; was cancelled due to volcanic ash, and a montage of old home movies was used in its place.

The third single was the double A-side &quot;We The Three&quot; and &quot;Keep On Yellin&quot; featuring South London&#x27;s Roots Manuva, released August 16, 2010. In July 2010, the band recorded a special series of songs with Roots Manuva. The project, dubbed &quot;Criminal Manuvas&quot;, was recorded at Maida Vale studios for BBC Radio 6 Music; songs included a reggae version of &quot;Scooby Snacks&quot; and an alternative version of &quot;Witness&quot;.

In September 2010, the band were touring, and they announced a live album: &quot;Fun, Live and Criminal&quot; via Pledge Music.

In March 2014, they released &quot;The Bong Remains The Same&quot;, a live concert video.

In February 2016, they released a deluxe, expanded edition of debut album &quot;Come Find Yourself&quot; to mark its 20th anniversary, and the band toured the album by performing it in full alongside some of their other tracks, throughout the UK and Europe, and at a number of festivals that summer and into 2017.

In January 2019, the band released the follow-up to their &quot;Mimosa&quot; compilation, titled &quot;Another Mimosa&quot;, which features covers of some of their favourite songs.

On 12 November 2021, their official Facebook page confirmed that frontman Huey Morgan had left the band. The announcement was made after the band had cancelled their planned UK tour for October 2021. On 25 March 2022, in a live Instagram video between Leiser and Benbini, Leiser confirmed that relations between the band and Huey Morgan had become &quot;strained&quot;, with Morgan deciding that he didn&#x27;t want to tour with the band, but instead continue presenting and DJing, which led to his decision to quit the band. Leiser told The Star in August 2022 that Morgan wouldn&#x27;t play much of the band&#x27;s back catalogue live and that the band had &quot;spent almost 10 years playing the same set to our fans&quot;, before revealing that &quot;We got bored and some fans got bored too. It was one of the reasons cracks began to appear in our relationship&quot;. Leiser also revealed that he is now the group&#x27;s lead singer, and that Naim Cortazzi would be the band&#x27;s new guitarist. Leiser then announced a tour for September 2022, as well as new material for a forthcoming album. Brian &quot;Fast&quot; Leiser is now the only founding member left in the group. Morgan had not given any official statement regarding his departure, but in October 2023 he revealed that his former bandmates had blocked him on Twitter and stated that the band had &quot;tried to pull a fast one&quot; on fans by keeping his departure a secret, whilst the band were promoting an upcoming Australian tour to promote the 25th anniversary of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;100% Colombian&quot;. Morgan stated that his former bandmates were being &quot;sad and creepy&quot; and felt that they were &quot;just a tribute act now&quot;. In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in April 2024, Morgan revealed that he&#x27;d been informed by Alan McGee that the other band members had secretly trademarked the band name whilst Morgan was still in the band, one of the reasons Morgan is no longer a member.

=== New line-up and releases and activities: 2022–present ===

On 3rd September 2022, a new song called &quot;Shake It Loose&quot; was given a debut play on Dean Jackson&#x27;s show The Beat. The song comes from their Roosevelt Sessions EP, which was released digitally on 9 September 2022. The band toured the UK in September, with gigs in St Albans, Oxford, Leicester, London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Birmingham and then toured Europe, including dates in Greece, the Netherlands and Belgium before a tour of the US in November.

In autumn/winter 2023 the band toured Europe and the UK with the 25th Anniversary of the &quot;100% Colombian&quot; album&#x27;s release. This included nine gigs in Europe in November, and sixteen gigs in the UK during late November and December.

In February 2025, the band announced the release of their upcoming studio album &quot;A Matter Of Time&quot;, due for release 29 August 2025, as well as a tour in September.

== Musical style ==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the music of Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals as &quot;a melting pot of local flavors: hip-hop, funk, blues and rock blended into a heavy, spliffy groove.&quot; &quot;BrumNotes&quot; magazine described the band&#x27;s style as a fusion of hip hop and blues rock. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; called Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals a &quot;soul-infused rock ensemble&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; John Bush described the band&#x27;s style as &quot;a blend of hip-hop beats, alternative style, and bluesy rhythms&quot;. &quot;getHampshire&quot; called the band &quot;the world’s finest and only purveyors of cinematic, hobo, hip-hop, rock ‘n’ roll, blues-jazz, soul-review vibes.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; described the band&#x27;s style as a &quot;blend of New York rock, funk, hip-hop and even punk&quot;. &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; placed their style within the rap rock genre, while Bush categorized them as an alternative rock and hip hop band.

== Side projects ==
Huey Morgan is a radio personality on the BBC. Morgan has appeared on Jack Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Adrenaline Junkie&quot;, a boy racer show &quot;Slips&quot;, sat in for Jonathan Ross and Dermot O&#x27;Leary on BBC Radio 2, appeared in &quot;Soulboy&quot; as a Dick Van Dyke accented London record shop owner, voiced a character in the &quot;&quot; video game, and appeared with Liza Tarbuck on &quot;Liza &amp; Huey&#x27;s Pet Nation&quot; on prime-time Sky TV. Morgan now presents regular shows on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music.

All three band members have released side projects. Benbini&#x27;s band Uncle Frank has released an album, as has Leiser, albeit with some of his previous unreleased work. Both Leiser and Benbini have collaborated on myriad remixes as well as a full remix album in a reggae-dub style under the moniker Radio Riddler. Morgan has released an album, &quot;Say It to My Face&quot;, and toured with several acquaintances, including Benbini, as Huey and the New Yorkers, raising money for veterans in the process.

<text>In astronomy, a semiregular variable star, a type of variable star, is a giant or supergiant of intermediate and late (cooler) spectral type. It shows considerable periodicity in its light changes, accompanied or sometimes interrupted by various irregularities. Periods lie in the range from 20 to more than 2000 days, while the shapes of the light curves may be rather different and variable with each cycle. The amplitudes may be from several hundredths to several magnitudes (usually 1-2 magnitudes in the V filter).

==Classification==
The semiregular variable stars have been sub-divided into four categories for many decades, with a fifth related group defined more recently. The original definitions of the four main groups were formalised in 1958 at the tenth general assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) has updated the definitions with some additional information and provided newer reference stars where old examples such as S Vul have been re-classified.

==Pulsation==
The semiregular variable stars, particularly the SRa and SRb sub-classes, are often grouped with the Mira variables under the long-period variable heading. In other situations, the term is expanded to cover almost all cool pulsating stars. The semi-regular giant stars are closely related to the Mira variables: Mira stars generally pulsate in the fundamental mode; semiregular giants pulsate in one or more overtones.

Photometric studies in the Large Magellanic Cloud looking for gravitational microlensing events have shown that essentially all cool evolved stars are variable, with the coolest stars showing very large amplitudes and warmer stars showing only micro-variations. The semiregular variable stars fall on one of five main period-luminosity relationship sequences identified, differing from the Mira variables only in pulsating in an overtone mode. The closely related OSARG (OGLE small amplitude red giant) variables pulsate in an unknown mode.

Many semiregular variables show long secondary periods around ten times the main pulsation period, with amplitudes of a few tenths of a magnitude at visual wavelengths. The cause of the pulsations is not known.

==Bright examples==
η Gem is the brightest SRa variable, and also an eclipsing binary. GZ Peg is an SRa variable and S-type star with a maximum magnitude of 4.95. T Cen is listed as the next-brightest SRa example, but it is suggested that it may actually be an RV Tauri variable, which would make it by far the brightest member of that class.

There are numerous naked-eye SRb stars, with third-magnitude L2 Pup being the brightest listed in the GCVS. σ Lib and ρ Per are also third-magnitude SRb stars at maximum brightness. β Gru is a second magnitude star classified as a slow irregular variable by the GCVS, but reported to be of SRb type by later research. These four are all class M giants, although some SRb variables are carbon stars such as UU Aur or S-type stars such as Pi1 Gru.

Catalogued SRc stars are less numerous, but include some of the brightest stars in the sky such as Betelgeuse and α Her. Although SRc stars are defined as being supergiants, a number of them have giant spectral luminosity classes and some such as α Her are known to be asymptotic giant branch stars.

Many SRd stars are extremely luminous hypergiants, including the naked-eye ρ Cas, V509 Cas, and ο1 Cen. Others are classified as giant stars, but the brightest example is the seventh-magnitude LU Aqr.

Most SRS variables have been discovered in deep large-scale surveys, but the naked-eye stars V428 And, AV Ari, and EL Psc are also members.

<doc id="140444" wikidata="Q706931" url="?curid=140444" title="A. J. P. Taylor">
<text>Alan John Percivale Taylor (25 March 1906 – 7 September 1990) was a British historian who specialised in 19th- and 20th-century European diplomacy. Both a journalist and a broadcaster, he became well known to millions through his television lectures. His combination of academic rigour and popular appeal led the historian Richard Overy to describe him as &quot;the Macaulay of our age&quot;. In a 2011 poll by &quot;History Today&quot; magazine, he was named the fourth most important historian of the previous 60 years.

==Life==
===Early life===
Taylor was born in 1906 in Birkdale, Southport, which was then part of Lancashire, only child of cotton merchant Percy Lees Taylor and schoolmistress Constance Sumner Taylor (née Thompson). In 1919 his family returned to Ashton-on-Ribble, Preston, where both his parents&#x27; families had lived for several decades. His wealthy parents held left-wing views, which he inherited. Both his parents were pacifists who vocally opposed the First World War, and sent their son to Quaker schools as a way of protesting against the war (his grandmother was from an old Quaker family). These schools included The Downs School at Colwall and Bootham School in York. Geoffrey Barraclough, a contemporary at Bootham School, remembered Taylor as &quot;a most arresting, stimulating, vital personality, violently anti-bourgeois and anti-Christian&quot;. In 1924, he went to Oriel College, Oxford, to study modern history. During his time as an undergraduate, in 1925 and 1926, he was the first student to hold the position of secretary of the junior common room. 

In the 1920s, Taylor&#x27;s mother, Constance, was a member of the Comintern while one of his uncles was a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Constance was a suffragette, feminist, and advocate of free love who practised her teachings via a string of extramarital affairs, most notably with Henry Sara, a communist who in many ways became Taylor&#x27;s surrogate father. Taylor has mentioned in his reminiscences that his mother was domineering, but his father enjoyed exasperating her by following his own ways. Taylor had a close relationship with his father, and enjoyed his father&#x27;s quirkiness. Taylor himself was recruited into the Communist Party of Great Britain by a friend of the family, the military historian Tom Wintringham, while at Oriel; a member from 1924 to 1926. Taylor broke with the Party over what he considered to be its ineffective stand during the 1926 General Strike. After leaving, he was an ardent supporter of the Labour Party for the rest of his life, remaining a member for over sixty years. Despite his break with the Communist Party, he visited the Soviet Union in 1925, and again in 1934.
===Academic career===
Taylor graduated from Oxford in 1927 with a first-class honours degree. After working briefly as a legal clerk, he began his post-graduate work, going to Vienna to study the impact of the Chartist movement on the Revolutions of 1848. When this topic turned out not to be feasible, he switched to studying the question of Italian unification over a two-year period. This resulted in his first book, &quot;The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49&quot; published in 1934.

===Manchester years===
Taylor was a lecturer in history in the Victoria University of Manchester from 1930 to 1938. He initially lived with his wife in an unfurnished flat on the top floor of an eighteenth-century house called The Limes, at 148 Wilmslow Road, which was set back from the street, opposite the entrance to Didsbury Park, at the southern end of Didsbury village. A few years later Taylor purchased a house in the village of Disley on the edge of the Peak District.

===Oxford years===
He became a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1938, a post he held until 1976. He was also a lecturer in modern history at the University of Oxford from 1938 to 1963. At Oxford he was such a popular speaker that he had to give his lectures at 8:30 a.m. to avoid the room becoming over-crowded.

In 1962, Taylor wrote in a review of &quot;The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845–1849&quot; by Cecil Woodham-Smith that: &quot;All Ireland was a Belsen. ... The English governing class ran true to form. They had killed two million Irish people.&quot; Taylor added that if the death rate from the Great Famine was not higher it &quot;was not for want of trying&quot; on the part of the British government, quoting Benjamin Jowett, the Master of Balliol College: &quot;I have always felt a certain horror of political economists since I heard one of them say that the Famine in Ireland would not kill more than a million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do much good.&quot; Taylor later reprinted his book review under the stark title &quot;Genocide&quot; in his 1976 book &quot;Essays in English History&quot;.&quot;

In 1964, whilst he retained his college fellowship, the University of Oxford declined to renew Taylor&#x27;s appointment as a university lecturer in modern history. This apparently sudden decision came in the aftermath of the controversy around his book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;. Moving to London, he became a lecturer at the Institute of Historical Research at University College London and at the Polytechnic of North London.

An important step in Taylor&#x27;s &quot;rehabilitation&quot; was a &quot;festschrift&quot; organised in his honour by Martin Gilbert in 1965. He was honoured with two more &quot;festschriften&quot;, in 1976 and 1986. The &quot;festschriften&quot; were testaments to his popularity with his former students as receiving even a single &quot;festschrift&quot; is considered to be an extraordinary and rare honour.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Taylor served in the Home Guard and befriended émigré statesmen from Central Europe, such as the former Hungarian President Count Mihály Károlyi and Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš. These friendships helped to enhance his understanding of the region. His friendship with Beneš and Károlyi may help explain his sympathetic portrayal of them, in particular Károlyi, whom Taylor portrayed as a saintly figure. Taylor became friends with Hubert Ripka, the press attache for Beneš, who lived in Oxford, and through him, got to know President Beneš who lived in London. Taylor wrote that because Beneš was a President, &quot;he was not allowed to brave the front line in London and had to live in a sovereign state at Aston Abbotts – a Rothschild house of, for them, a modest standard. Bored and isolated, Beneš summoned an audience whatever he could and I was often swept over to Aston Abbots in the presidential car&quot;.

In 1943, Taylor wrote his first pamphlet, &quot;Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Place in a Free Europe&quot;, explaining his view that Czechoslovakia would after the war serve as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the Western world and the Soviet Union. &quot;Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Place in a Free Europe&quot; began as a lecture Taylor had given at the Czechoslovak Institute in London on 29 April 1943 and at the suggestion of Jan Masaryk was turned into a pamphlet to explain Czechoslovakia&#x27;s situation to the British people. Taylor argued that the Czechoslovaks would have to &quot;explain&quot; democracy to the Soviets and &quot;explain&quot; socialism to the British, saying: &quot;You must appear to the English people as communists and to the Russians as democrats and therefore receive nothing, but abuse from both sides &quot;Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Place in a Free Europe&quot; reflected Beneš&#x27;s theory of &quot;convergence&quot; as he felt based on what he was seeing in wartime Britain that the western nations would become socialist after the war while the Soviet Union would become more democratic. In 1945, Taylor wrote: &quot;Beck, Stojadinović, Antonescu and Bonnet despised [Beneš&#x27;s] integrity and prided themselves on their cunning; but their countries, too, fell before the German aggressor and every step they took has made the resurrection of their countries more difficult. [In contrast] the foreign policy of Dr. Beneš during the present war has won for Czechoslovakia a secure future.&quot; During the same period, Taylor was employed by the Political Warfare Executive as an expert on Central Europe and frequently spoke on the radio and at various public meetings. During the war, he lobbied for British recognition of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans as the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.

===Resignation from British Academy===
In 1979, Taylor resigned in protest from the British Academy over its dismissal of Anthony Blunt, who had been exposed as a Soviet spy. Taylor took the position that:

===Personal life===
Taylor married three times. He married his first wife Margaret Adams in 1931, they had four children together and divorced in 1951. For some time in the 1930s, he and his wife shared a house with the writer Malcolm Muggeridge and his wife Kitty. From the 1940s Margaret&#x27;s infatuations with Robert Kee and Dylan Thomas pushed the couple towards separation. His second wife was Eve Crosland, the sister of Anthony Crosland MP, whom Taylor married in 1951; they had two children and divorced in 1974. His third wife was the Hungarian historian Éva Haraszti. They married in 1976.

==Work==
===&quot;The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49&quot;===
Taylor&#x27;s first book, published in 1934, addressed the question of Italian unification &quot;The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49&quot;. However, Taylor&#x27;s speciality was in Central European, British and diplomatic history. He was especially interested in the Habsburg dynasty and Bismarck. His main mentors in this period were the Austrian-born historian Alfred Francis Pribram and the Polish-born historian Sir Lewis Namier. Taylor&#x27;s earlier writings reflected Pribram&#x27;s favourable opinion of the Habsburgs; however, his 1941 book &quot;The Habsburg Monarchy 1809–1918&quot; (published in a revised edition in 1948) showed the influence of Namier&#x27;s unfavourable views. In &quot;The Habsburg Monarchy&quot;, Taylor stated that the Habsburgs saw their realms entirely as a tool for foreign policy and thus could never build a genuine nation-state. To hold their realm together, they resorted to playing one ethnic group off against another and promoted German and Magyar hegemony over the other ethnic groups in Austria-Hungary.

===&quot;The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918&quot;===
In 1954 he published his masterpiece, &quot;The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918&quot;, and followed it up with &quot;The Trouble Makers&quot; in 1957, a critical study of British foreign policy. &quot;The Trouble Makers&quot; was a celebration of those who had criticised the government over foreign policy, a subject dear to his heart. &quot;The Trouble Makers&quot; had originally been the Ford Lectures in 1955 and was his favourite book by far. When invited to deliver the Ford Lectures, he was initially at a loss for a topic, and it was his friend Alan Bullock who suggested the topic of foreign policy dissent.

===&quot;Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman&quot;===
The recurring theme of accidents deciding history appeared in Taylor&#x27;s best-selling 1955 biography of Bismarck. Taylor controversially argued that the Iron Chancellor had unified Germany more by accident than by design; a theory that contradicted those put forward by the historians Heinrich von Sybel, Leopold von Ranke, and Heinrich von Treitschke in the latter years of the 19th century, and by other historians more recently.

===&quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;===
In 1961, he published his most controversial book, &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, which earned him a reputation as a revisionist. Gordon Martel notes that &quot;it made a profound impact. The book became a classic and a central point of reference in all discussion on the Second World War.&quot;

In the book Taylor argued against the widespread belief that the outbreak of the Second World War (specifically between Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and France, September 1939) was the result of an intentional plan on the part of Adolf Hitler. He began his book with the statement that too many people have accepted uncritically what he called the &quot;Nuremberg Thesis&quot;, that the Second World War was the result of criminal conspiracy by a small gang comprising Hitler and his associates. He regarded the &quot;Nuremberg Thesis&quot; as too convenient for too many people and held that it shielded the blame for the war from the leaders of other states, let the German people avoid any responsibility for the war and created a situation where West Germany was a respectable Cold War ally against the Soviets.

Taylor&#x27;s thesis was that Hitler was not the demoniacal figure of popular imagination but in foreign affairs a normal German leader. Citing Fritz Fischer, he argued that the foreign policy of Nazi Germany was the same as those of the Weimar Republic and the German Empire. Moreover, in a partial break with his view of German history advocated in &quot;The Course of German History&quot;, he argued that Hitler was not just a mainstream German leader but also a mainstream Western leader. As a normal Western leader, Hitler was no better or worse than Gustav Stresemann, Neville Chamberlain or Édouard Daladier. His argument was that Hitler wished to make Germany the strongest power in Europe but he did not want or plan war. The outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone&#x27;s part and was not a part of Hitler&#x27;s plan.

Taylor portrayed Hitler as a grasping opportunist with no beliefs other than the pursuit of power and anti-Semitism. He argued that Hitler did not possess any sort of programme and his foreign policy was one of drift and seizing chances as they offered themselves. He did not consider Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism unique: he argued that millions of Germans were just as ferociously anti-Semitic as Hitler and there was no reason to single out Hitler for sharing the beliefs of millions of others.

Taylor argued that the basic problem with an interwar Europe was a flawed Treaty of Versailles that was sufficiently onerous to ensure that the overwhelming majority of Germans would always hate it, but insufficiently onerous in that it failed to destroy Germany&#x27;s potential to be a Great Power once more. In this way, Taylor argued that the Versailles Treaty was destabilising, for sooner or later the innate power of Germany that the Allies had declined to destroy in 1918–1919 would inevitably reassert itself against the Versailles Treaty and the international system established by Versailles that the Germans regarded as unjust and thus had no interest in preserving. Though Taylor argued that the Second World War was not inevitable and that the Versailles Treaty was nowhere near as harsh as contemporaries like John Maynard Keynes believed, what he regarded as a flawed peace settlement made the war more likely than not.

===&quot;English History 1914–1945&quot;===
In 1965 he rebounded from the controversy surrounding &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; with the spectacular success of his book &quot;English History 1914–1945&quot;, his only venture into social and cultural history, where he offered a loving, affectionate portrayal of the years between 1914 and 1945. &quot;English History 1914–1945&quot; was an enormous best-seller and in its first year in print sold more than all of the previous volumes of the &quot;Oxford History of England&quot; combined. Though he felt there was much to be ashamed of in British history, especially in regard to Ireland, he was very proud to be British and more specifically English. He was fond of stressing his nonconformist Northern English background and saw himself as part of a grand tradition of radical dissent that he regarded as the real glorious history of England.

===&quot;The Reichstag Fire&quot; (introduction)===
In 1964 Taylor wrote the introduction for &quot;The Reichstag Fire&quot; by the journalist Fritz Tobias. He thus became the first English-language historian and the first historian after Hans Mommsen to accept the conclusions of the book, that the Nazis had not caused the &quot;Reichstag&quot; fire and that Marinus van der Lubbe had acted alone. Tobias and Taylor argued that the new Nazi government had been looking for something to increase its share of the vote in the elections of 5 March 1933 so as to activate the Enabling Act, and that van der Lubbe had serendipitously (for the Nazis) provided it by burning down the Reichstag. Even without the fire, the Nazis were quite determined to destroy German democracy. In Taylor&#x27;s opinion, van der Lubbe had made their task easier by providing a pretext. The German Communist propaganda chief Willi Münzenberg and his OGPU handlers had manufactured the evidence implicating the Nazis in the arson. Tobias and Taylor pointed out that the so-called &quot;secret tunnels&quot; that supposedly gave the Nazis access to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; were in fact tunnels for water piping. At the time Taylor was widely attacked by many other historians for endorsing what was considered to be a self-evident perversion of established historical facts.

===&quot;War by Timetable&quot;===
In his 1969 book &quot;War by Timetable&quot;, Taylor examined the origins of the First World War, concluding that though all of the great powers wished to increase their own power relative to the others, none consciously sought war before 1914. Instead, he argued that all of the great powers believed that if they possessed the ability to mobilise their armed forces faster than any of the others, this would serve as a sufficient deterrent to avoid war and allow them to achieve their foreign policy aims. Thus, the general staffs of the great powers developed elaborate timetables to mobilise faster than any of their rivals. When the crisis broke in 1914, though none of the statesmen of Europe wanted a world war, the need to mobilise faster than potential rivals created an inexorable movement towards war. Thus Taylor claimed that the leaders of 1914 became prisoners of the logic of the mobilisation timetables and the timetables that were meant to serve as deterrent to war instead relentlessly brought war.

===&quot;Beaverbrook: A Biography&quot;===
In the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor befriended Lord Beaverbrook and later wrote his biography in 1972. Beaverbrook, Canadian in origin, was a Conservative who believed strongly in the British Empire and whose entry into politics was in support of Bonar Law, a Conservative leader strongly connected with the establishment of Northern Ireland. Despite the disdain for most politicians expressed in his writings, Taylor was fascinated by politics and politicians and often cultivated relations with those who possessed power. Beside Lord Beaverbrook, whose company Taylor very much enjoyed, his favourite politician was the Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whom he often described as the greatest Prime Minister Britain never had.

===Introductions===
Taylor also wrote significant introductions to British editions of Marx&#x27;s &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; and of &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World&quot;, by John Reed. He had long been an advocate of a treaty with the Soviet Union so British Communists expected him to be friendly. In 1963, the British Communist Party, which held the copyright to &quot;Ten Days that Shook the World&quot; in the United Kingdom, offered Taylor the opportunity to write the introduction to a new edition. The introduction Taylor wrote was fairly sympathetic towards the Bolsheviks. However, it also pointed out certain contradictions between Reed&#x27;s book and the official historiography in the Soviet Union—for instance, that Leon Trotsky played a very prominent, heroic role in &quot;Ten Days That Shook The World&quot; while in 1963 Trotsky was almost a non-person in Soviet historiography, mentioned only in terms of abuse. The British Communist Party rejected Taylor&#x27;s introduction as anti-Soviet. The rejection annoyed Taylor. When the copyright expired in 1977 and a non-Communist publisher reissued the book, asking Taylor to write the introduction, he strengthened some of his criticisms. Taylor also wrote the introduction for &quot;&quot; by Len Deighton.

===Journalism===
Starting in 1931, Taylor worked as book reviewer for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, and from 1957 he was a columnist with the &quot;Observer&quot;. In 1951 Taylor made his first move into mass-market journalism, spending just over a year as a columnist at the tabloid &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;. His first article was an attack on the stance of the United Nations during the Korean War, in which he argued that the UN was merely a front for American policy. After leaving the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; in 1952, in the wake of editor Philip Zec&#x27;s dismissal, he began writing a weekly column the following year for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; until 1956.

From 1957 until 1982 he wrote for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, owned by his friend and patron Lord Beaverbrook. His first column for that paper was &quot;Why Must We Soft-Soap The Germans?&quot;, in which he complained that the majority of Germans were still Nazis at heart and argued the European Economic Community was little more than an attempt by the Germans to achieve via trade what they failed to accomplish through arms in the First and Second World Wars. At a time when the relationship with the EEC was a major issue in Britain, Taylor&#x27;s pro-Commonwealth Euroscepticism became a common theme in many of his articles. Other frequent targets were the BBC, the anti-smoking lobby, and reversing his earlier stance, the motor car, with Taylor calling for all private motor vehicles to be banned.

===Broadcasting===
The Second World War gave Taylor the opportunity to branch out from print journalism, initially into radio and then later television. On 17 March 1942 Taylor made the first of seven appearances on &quot;The World at War – Your Questions Answered&quot; broadcast by BBC Forces&#x27; Radio. After the war Taylor became one of the first television historians. His appearances began with his role as a panellist on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;In The News&quot; from 1950 to 1954. Here he was noted for his argumentative style, and in one episode he declined to acknowledge the presence of the other panellists. The press came to refer to him as the &quot;sulky don&quot; and in 1954 he was dropped. From 1955 Taylor was a panellist on ITV&#x27;s rival discussion programme &quot;Free Speech&quot;, where he remained until the series ended in 1961. In 1957, 1957–1958 and 1961 he made a number of half-hour programmes on ITV in which he lectured without notes on a variety of topics, such as the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the First World War. These were huge ratings successes. Despite earlier strong feelings against the BBC, he lectured for a BBC historical series in 1961 and made more series for it in 1963, 1976, 1977 and 1978. He also hosted additional series for ITV in 1964, 1966 and 1967. In &quot;Edge of Britain&quot; in 1980 he toured the towns of northern England. Taylor&#x27;s final TV appearance was in the series &quot;How Wars End&quot; in 1985, where the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on him were apparent.

Taylor had a famous rivalry with the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, with whom he often debated on television. One of the more famous exchanges took place in 1961. Trevor-Roper said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that your book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; may damage your reputation as a historian&quot;, to which Taylor replied &quot;Your criticism of me would damage your reputation as a historian, if you had one.&quot;

The origins of the dispute went back to 1957 when the Regius Professorship for History at Oxford was vacant. Despite their divergent political philosophies, Taylor and Trevor-Roper had been friends since the early 1950s, but with the possibility of the Regius Professorship, both men lobbied for it. The Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan awarded the chair to the Tory Trevor-Roper rather than the Labourite Taylor. In addition, a number of the other Oxford dons had felt that Taylor&#x27;s profile in journalism was &quot;demeaning&quot; to the historian&#x27;s craft and had lobbied against him.

In public, Taylor declared that he would never have accepted any honour from a government that had &quot;the blood of Suez on its hands&quot;. In private, he was furious with Trevor-Roper for holding an honour that Taylor considered rightfully his. Adding to Taylor&#x27;s rancour was the fact that he had arrived at Oxford a decade before Trevor-Roper. From then on, Taylor never missed a chance to disparage Trevor-Roper&#x27;s character or scholarship. The famously combative Trevor-Roper reciprocated. The feud was given much publicity by the media, not so much because of the merits of their disputes but rather because their acrimonious debates on television made for entertaining viewing. Likewise, the various articles written by Taylor and Trevor-Roper denouncing each other&#x27;s scholarship, in which both men&#x27;s considerable powers of invective were employed with maximum effect, made for entertaining reading. Beyond that, it was fashionable to portray the dispute between Taylor and Trevor-Roper as a battle between generations. Taylor, with his populist, irreverent style, was nearly a decade older than Trevor-Roper, but was represented by the media as a symbol of the younger generation that was coming of age in the 1950s–1960s. Trevor-Roper, who was unabashedly old-fashioned (he was one of the last Oxford dons to lecture wearing his professor&#x27;s robes) and inclined to behave in a manner that the media portrayed as pompous and conceited, was seen as a symbol of the older generation. A subtle but important difference in the style between the two historians was their manner of addressing each other during their TV debates: Trevor-Roper always addressed Taylor as &quot;Mr Taylor&quot; or just &quot;Taylor&quot;, while Taylor always addressed Trevor-Roper as &quot;Hugh&quot;.

Another frequent sparring partner on TV for Taylor was the writer Malcolm Muggeridge. The frequent television appearances helped to make Taylor the most famous British historian of the 20th century. He featured in a cameo in the 1981 film &quot;Time Bandits&quot; and was satirised in an episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, in which a scantily clad woman (identified by an onscreen caption as &quot;A. J. P. Taylor, Historian&quot;), dubbed over with a man&#x27;s voice, delivers a lecture on &quot;Eighteenth Century Social Reform&quot;. Another foray into the world of entertainment occurred in the 1960s when he served as the historical consultant for both the stage and film versions of &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot; Though he possessed great charm and charisma and a sense of humour, as he aged he presented himself as, and came to be seen as, cantankerous and irascible.

==Opinions==
Throughout his life, Taylor took public stands on the great issues of his time. In the early 1930s, he was in a left-wing pacifist group called the Manchester Peace Council, for which he frequently spoke in public. Until 1936, Taylor was an opponent of British rearmament as he felt that a re-armed Britain would ally itself with Germany against the Soviet Union. However, after 1936, he resigned from the Manchester Peace Council, urged British rearmament in the face of what Taylor considered to be the Nazi menace, and advocated an Anglo-Soviet alliance to contain Germany. After 1936, he also fervently criticised appeasement, a stance that he would disavow in 1961.

In 1938, he denounced the Munich Agreement at several rallies and may have written several leaders in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; criticising it; later, he would compare the smaller number of Czechoslovak dead with the number of Polish dead. In October 1938, Taylor attracted particular controversy by a speech he gave at a dinner held every October to commemorate a protest by a group of Oxford dons against James II in 1688, an event that was an important prelude to the Glorious Revolution. He denounced the Munich Agreement and those who supported it, warning the assembled dons that if action were not taken immediately to resist Nazi Germany, then they might all soon be living under the rule of a much greater tyrant than James II. Taylor&#x27;s speech was highly contentious, in part because in October 1938 the Munich Agreement was popular with the public even if subsequently it was to be reviled along with the policy of appeasement, and also because he used a non-partisan and non-political occasion to make a highly partisan, politically charged attack on government policy.

Throughout his life, Taylor was sympathetic to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, and after 1941 he was overjoyed to have the Soviet Union as Britain&#x27;s ally, as this was the realisation of his desire for an Anglo-Soviet alliance. The Second World War further increased Taylor&#x27;s pro-Soviet feelings, as he was always profoundly grateful for the Red Army&#x27;s role in destroying Nazi Germany. Despite his pro-Soviet views, he was strongly critical of Stalinism, and in 1948 he attended and did his best to sabotage a Stalinist cultural congress in Wrocław, Poland. His speech, which was broadcast live on Polish radio and via speakers on the streets of Wrocław, about the right of everyone to hold different views from those who hold power, was enthusiastically received by the delegates and was met with thunderous applause. The speech was clearly intended as a rebuttal of a speech given by the Soviet writer Alexander Fadeyev the previous day, who had demanded obedience on the part of everyone to Joseph Stalin.

As a socialist, Taylor saw the capitalist system as wrong on practical and moral grounds, although he rejected the Marxist view that capitalism was responsible for wars and conflicts. He felt that the status quo in the West was highly unstable and prone to accidents, and prevented a just and moral international system from coming into being. Moreover, Taylor was enraged by the decision of the Western powers, which he blamed on the US, to re-build and establish the West German state in the late 1940s, which Taylor saw as laying the foundations for a Fourth Reich that would one day plunge the world back into war.

He also blamed the United States for the Cold War, and in the 1950s and 1960s was one of the leading lights of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Though he preferred that the United Kingdom be neutral in the Cold War, he felt that if Britain should have to align itself with a major power, the best partner was the Soviet Union rather than America, which in Taylor&#x27;s opinion was carrying out reckless policies that increased the risk of World War Three. Taylor never visited the United States, despite receiving many invitations.

In 1950, he was again temporarily banned by the BBC when he attempted to deliver a radio address against British participation in the Korean War. After a public outcry, the BBC relented and allowed him to deliver his address. In 1956 Taylor demonstrated against the Suez War, though not the Soviet crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, which he believed had saved Hungary from a return to the rule of Admiral Miklós Horthy. He also championed Israel, which he saw as a model socialist democracy threatened by reactionary Arab dictatorships. Taylor was also opposed to, and condemned, the US intervention in the Vietnam War.

Taylor was also opposed to the British Empire and against Britain&#x27;s participation in the European Economic Community and NATO.

In an interview with Irish State radio in April 1976, Taylor argued that the British presence in Northern Ireland was perpetuating the conflict there. Taylor claimed the best solution would be for an &quot;armed push&quot; by the Irish nationalists to drive out the one million Ulster Protestants from Ireland. He cited as a successful precedent the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War. On the question of whether there would be a civil war should Britain quit Northern Ireland, Taylor answered: &quot;What we have, after all, is an incipient civil war. To put it brutally, if there were a civil war in Northern Ireland, and I am not convinced that there would be, quite a lot of people would be killed and the war would be decided within a few months. Spread over the years, probably more people have been killed&quot;.

In 1980 Taylor resigned from the British Academy in protest against the expulsion of the art historian and Soviet spy Anthony Blunt, which he saw as an act of McCarthyism. Closer to his work as a historian, Taylor espoused less government secrecy and, paradoxically for a staunch leftist, fought for more privately owned television stations. His experiences with being banned by the BBC had led him to appreciate the value of having many broadcasters. In regard to government archives, Taylor took part in a successful attempt to lobby the British government to replace the 50-year rule with a 30-year rule.

===Germanophobia===

Taylor held fierce Germanophobic views. In 1944, he was temporarily banned from the BBC following complaints about a series of lectures he gave on air in which he gave full vent to his anti-German feelings. In his 1945 book, &quot;The Course of German History&quot;, he argued that National Socialism was the inevitable product of the entire history of the Germans going back to the days of the Germanic tribes. He was an early champion of what has since been called the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; (Special Way) interpretation of German history, that German culture and society developed over the centuries in such a way as to make Nazi Germany inevitable. Moreover, he argued that there was a symbiotic relationship between Hitler and the German people, with Adolf Hitler needing the Germans to fulfil his dreams of conquest and the German people needing Hitler to fulfil their dreams of subjugation of their neighbours. In particular, he accused the Germans of waging an endless Drang nach Osten against their Slavic neighbours since the days of Charlemagne.

For Taylor, Nazi racial imperialism was a continuation of policies pursued by every German ruler. &quot;The Course of German History&quot; was a best-seller in both the United Kingdom and the United States; it was the success of this book that made Taylor&#x27;s reputation in the United States. Its success also marked the beginning of the breach between Taylor and his mentor Namier, who wanted to write a similar book. By the 1950s, relations between Taylor and Namier had noticeably cooled and in his 1983 autobiography, &quot;A Personal History&quot;, Taylor, though acknowledging a huge intellectual debt to Namier, portrayed him as a pompous bore.

===Populism===
Taylor&#x27;s approach to history was a populist one. He felt that history should be open to all and enjoyed being called the &quot;People&#x27;s Historian&quot; and the &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Historian&quot;. He usually favoured an anti-great man theory, history being made for the most part by towering figures of stupidity rather than of genius. In his view, leaders did not make history; instead they reacted to events – what happened in the past was due to sequences of blunders and errors that were largely outside anyone&#x27;s control. To the extent that anyone made anything happen in history, it was only through their mistakes.

Though Taylor normally preferred to portray leaders as fools blundering their way forward, he did think that individuals sometimes could play a positive role in history; his heroes were Vladimir Lenin and David Lloyd George. But for Taylor, people like Lloyd George and Lenin were the exceptions. Despite Taylor&#x27;s increasing ambivalence toward appeasement from the late 1950s, which became explicitly evident in his 1961 book &quot;Origins of the Second World War&quot;, Winston Churchill remained another of his heroes. In &quot;English History 1914–1945&quot; (1965), he famously concluded his biographical footnote of Churchill with the phrase &quot;the saviour of his country&quot;. Another person Taylor admired was the historian E. H. Carr, who was his favourite historian and a good friend.

===Irony and humour===
His narratives used irony and humour to entertain as well as inform. He examined history from odd angles, exposing what he considered to be the pomposities of various historical characters. He was famed for &quot;Taylorisms&quot;: witty, epigrammatic, and sometimes cryptic remarks that were meant to expose what he considered to be the absurdities and paradoxes of modern international relations. An example is in his television piece &quot;Mussolini&quot; (1970), in which he said the dictator &quot;kept up with his work – by doing none&quot;; or, about Metternich&#x27;s political philosophies: &quot;Most men could do better while shaving&quot;. His determination to bring history to everyone drove his frequent appearances on radio and later on television. He was also careful to puncture any aura of infallibility that historians might have. On one occasion when asked what he thought the future might bring, he replied &quot;Dear boy, you should never ask an historian to predict the future – frankly we have a hard enough time predicting the past.&quot; Taylor wrote about &quot;English History 1914–1945&quot; that he offered up a parody of Oxford historians &quot;delivering the Judgement of History in the highest Olympian spirit. I followed their example except the poor were always right and the rich always wrong – a judgement that happens to be correct historically. Some of the details were also a parody, as for instance the solemn discussion as when &#x27;Fuck&#x27; attained literary though not conversational respectability. I had more fun writing &quot;English History 1914–1945&quot; than in writing any of my other books&quot;.

===&quot;The Establishment&quot;===
Taylor has been credited with coining the term &quot;the Establishment&quot; in a 1953 book review, but this is disputed. On 29 August 1953, in reviewing a biography of William Cobbett in &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Taylor wrote &quot;The Establishment draws in recruits from outside as soon as they are ready to conform to its standards and become respectable. There is nothing more agreeable in life than to make peace with the Establishment – and nothing more corrupting.&quot;

===Speed limits===
In 1967, Taylor wrote an article for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; in which he argued that speed limits had made absolutely no positive difference to road safety and that &quot;on the contrary, [speed limits] tend to increase the risks and dangers&quot;. Taylor went on to claim &quot;I have been driving a car for 45 years. I have consistently ignored all the various speed limits. Never once have I encountered the slightest risk as a result.&quot; The article caused a member of the public to lodge a complaint with the Press Council, on the grounds that Taylor&#x27;s remarks &quot;amount[ed] to an indirect incitement to drivers to break the law&quot;. The Council eventually rejected the complaint and ruled that &quot;while Mr Taylor&#x27;s views are controversial, he has an unchallengeable right to express them&quot;.

==Criticisms==
===&quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;===

&quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; was received negatively in some quarters when it was published in 1961. The book set off a huge storm of controversy and debate that lasted for years. At least part of the vehement criticism was due to the confusion in the public&#x27;s mind between Taylor&#x27;s book and another book published in 1961, &quot;Der Erzwungene Krieg&quot; (&quot;The Forced War&quot;) by the American historian David Hoggan. Taylor criticised Hoggan&#x27;s thesis that Germany was the innocent victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939 as nonsense, but many critics confused Taylor&#x27;s thesis with that of Hoggan. Most of the criticism was over Taylor&#x27;s arguments for appeasement as a rational political strategy, his mechanistic portrayal of a world destined for another world war by post-war settlement of 1918–1919, his depiction of the Second World War as an &quot;accident&quot; caused by diplomatic blunders, his portrayal of Hitler as a &quot;normal leader&quot; and what many considered his flippant dismissal of Nazi ideology as a motivating force. Leading the charge against Taylor was his arch-enemy Trevor-Roper, who contended that Taylor had wilfully and egregiously misinterpreted the evidence. In particular, Trevor-Roper criticised Taylor&#x27;s argument that the Hossbach Memorandum of 1937 was a meaningless document because none of the scenarios outlined in the Memorandum as the prerequisite for war, such as the Spanish Civil War leading to a war between Italy and France in the Mediterranean, or civil war breaking out in France, occurred. In Trevor-Roper&#x27;s opinion, what really mattered about the Hossbach Memorandum was that Hitler clearly expressed an intention to go to war sooner rather than later and it was Hitler&#x27;s intentions rather than his plans at the time which mattered. However, in the last edition of the book, Taylor argues that the significant parts, if not the whole, of the memorandum are in fact fabrications.

Other historians who criticised &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; included: Isaac Deutscher, Barbara Tuchman, Ian Morrow, Gerhard Weinberg, Elizabeth Wiskemann, W. N. Medlicott, Tim Mason, John Lukacs, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Frank Freidel, Harry Hinsley, John Wheeler-Bennett, Golo Mann, Lucy Dawidowicz, Gordon A. Craig, A. L. Rowse, Raymond Sontag, Andreas Hillgruber and Yehuda Bauer. Rowse, who had once been a close friend of Taylor&#x27;s, attacked him with an intensity and vehemence that was second only to Trevor-Roper&#x27;s. In addition, several historians wrote books on the origins of the Second World War with the aim of refuting Taylor&#x27;s thesis. Taylor was angered by some of the criticism, especially the implication that he had set out to exonerate Hitler, writing that &quot;to the best of my recollection, those who now display indignation against me were not active [against appeasement] on the public platform&quot;. Some notable examples include Gerhard Weinberg&#x27;s two-volume &quot;The Foreign Policy of Hitler&#x27;s Germany&quot; and Andreas Hillgruber&#x27;s &quot;Deutschlands Rolle in der Vorgeschichte der beiden Weltkriege&quot; [&quot;Germany&#x27;s Role in the Background to Both World Wars&quot;], translated as &quot;Germany and the Two World Wars&quot;.

The issue of misinterpretation is also addressed in Gordon A. Craig&#x27;s book &quot;Germany: 1866–1945&quot;, where it is argued that Taylor dismissed Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy, as presented in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and in particular, the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, as a jumble of idle thoughts written down under the impact of the French occupation of the Ruhr.

As angry as the reaction in Britain was to &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, it was greater when the book was published in January 1962 in the United States. With the exception of Harry Elmer Barnes and Murray Rothbard, every American historian who reviewed Taylor&#x27;s book gave it a negative review. Perhaps ironically, Taylor had indirectly criticised Barnes when he wrote contemptuously of certain self-styled American Revisionist historians whose work Taylor characterised as marked by obsessive loathing for their own country, nostalgia for isolationism, hatred for the New Deal and a tendency to engage in bizarre conspiracy theories. Despite the best efforts of Barnes and his protégé David Hoggan to recruit Taylor to their cause, Taylor always made clear that he wanted nothing to do with either Barnes or Hoggan.

Despite the criticism, &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; is regarded as a watershed in the historiography of the origins of the Second World War. In general, historians have praised Taylor for the following:
* In focussing on the improvised character of German and Italian foreign policy, he helped to create a debate over the degree to which fascist states were fulfilling a programme versus taking advantage of events.
* In highlighting certain continuities in German foreign policy between 1871 and 1939, he helped to place Nazi foreign policy in a wider perspective, although the degree of continuity is still subject to considerable debate.
* As the first English-language historian to bring attention to the work of the French economist and historian Étienne Mantoux, especially his 1946 book &quot;The Carthaginian Peace: or The Economic Consequences of Mr Keynes&quot;, he was able to show that Germany was capable of paying reparations to France after the First World War; the only problem was that the Germans were unwilling. In this way, he started an important debate over who was really responsible for the hyperinflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923.
* In showing that appeasement was a popular policy and that there was continuity in British foreign policy after 1933, he shattered the common view of the appeasers as a small, degenerate clique that had mysteriously hijacked the British government sometime in the 1930s and who had carried out their policies in the face of massive public resistance.
* In showing that the &quot;Anschluss&quot; was enormously popular in Austria, he helped to discredit the notion of Austria as a victim of Nazi aggression brought unwillingly into the &quot;Reich&quot;.
* In portraying the leaders of the 1930s as real people attempting to deal with real problems, he made the first strides towards attempting an explanation of the actions of the appeasers rather than merely condemning them.
* He was one of the first historians to present Hitler as an ordinary human being rather than as a &quot;madman&quot;, albeit one who held morally repellent beliefs, thus offering possibilities to explain his actions.
* In showing that Hitler just as often reacted as acted, he offered a balance to previous accounts in which Hitler was portrayed as the sole agent and the leaders of Britain and France as entirely reactive.

In response to Taylor&#x27;s argument that Hitler had no programme because his foreign policy seemed to operate in a haphazard and slapdash way, Taylor&#x27;s critics such as Trevor-Roper construed a theorem in which Hitler held &quot;consistent aims&quot; but sought to achieve them via &quot;flexible methods&quot;.

===Portrayal of Mussolini===
Taylor drew a picture of Benito Mussolini as a great showman, but also as an inept leader with no beliefs. The first part of this picture has not been generally challenged by historians, but the second part has. Taylor argued that Mussolini was sincere when he helped forge the Stresa Front with Britain and France to resist any German challenge to the &quot;status quo&quot; in Europe and that only the League of Nations sanctions imposed on Fascist Italy for Italian invasion of Ethiopia drove Mussolini into an alliance with Nazi Germany. Recently, a number of specialists in Italian history have challenged this by arguing that Mussolini possessed a belief in the &quot;spazio vitale&quot; (vital space) as a guiding foreign policy concept in which the entire Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Middle East and the Horn of Africa were regarded as rightfully belonging to Italy, leading to inevitable conflict with the two dominant Mediterranean powers, Britain and France.

===The French Third Republic===
Taylor has been criticised for promoting the &quot;La décadence&quot; view of the French Third Republic. This historical concept portrays the Third Republic as a decadent state, forever on the verge of collapse. In particular, advocates of the &quot;La décadence&quot; concept have asserted that inter-war France was riven by political instability; possessed a leadership that was deeply divided, corrupt, incompetent and pusillanimous, which ruled over a nation rent by mass unemployment, strikes, a sense of despair over the future, riots and a state of near-civil war between the Left and the Right. Of all the French governments of the interwar era, only the Popular Front government of Léon Blum was presented sympathetically by Taylor, which he praised for carrying out what he regarded as long overdue social reforms. Many experts in French history have admitted that there is a kernel of truth to Taylor&#x27;s picture of France but have complained that Taylor presented French politics and society in such a manner as to border on caricature.

==Retirement==
Taylor was badly injured in 1984 when he was run over by a car while crossing Old Compton Street in London. The effect of the accident led to his retirement in 1985. In his last years, he endured Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which left him incapable of writing. His last public appearance was at his 80th birthday, in 1986, when a group of his former students, including Sir Martin Gilbert, Alan Sked, Norman Davies and Paul Kennedy, organised a public reception in his honour. He had, with considerable difficulty, memorised a short speech, which he delivered in a manner that managed to hide the fact that his memory and mind had been permanently damaged by Parkinson&#x27;s.

In 1987, he entered a nursing home in Barnet, London, where he died on 7 September 1990 aged 84. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

<text>A religious order is a subgroup within a larger confessional community with a distinctive high-religiosity lifestyle and clear membership. Religious orders often trace their lineage from revered teachers, venerate their founders, and have a document describing their lifestyle called a rule of life. Such orders exist in many of the world&#x27;s religions.

==Buddhism==

In Buddhist societies, a religious order is one of the number of monastic orders of monks and nuns, many of which follow a certain school of teaching—such as Thailand&#x27;s Dhammayuttika order, a monastic order founded by King Mongkut (Rama IV). A well-known Chinese Buddhist order is the ancient Shaolin order in Ch&#x27;an (Zen) Buddhism; and in modern times, the Order of Hsu Yun.

==Christianity==
===Catholic tradition===
A religious order in the Catholic Church is a kind of religious institute, a society whose members (referred to as &quot;religious&quot;) make solemn vows that are accepted by a superior in the name of the Church, who wear a religious habit and who live a life of brothers or sisters in common. Religious orders are to be distinguished from religious congregations, which are religious institutes whose members profess simple vows, and from secular institutes, including societies of apostolic life and lay ecclesial movements. Unless they are also deacons or priests in Holy Orders members of religious orders are not clergy but laity. However, particular orders and institutes are classified as either specifically clerical or lay depending on their charism. 

Among the traditional forms of solemnly vowed religious order, there are four key categories:
* canons regular (canons and canonesses regular who recite the Divine Office and serve a church and perhaps a parish);
* clerics regular (priests who take religious vows and have an active apostolic life);
* mendicants (friars and religious sisters, possibly living and working in a friary or a convent, who live from alms, recite the Divine Office, and, in the case of the men, participate in apostolic activities); and
* monastics (monks and nuns living and working in a monastery or a nunnery and reciting the Divine Office).

Religious life began in the Latin Church as early as the 3rd century, with the Order of Saint Benedict being formed in the 6th, in 529. All the earliest religious foundations were either essentially monastic or canonical depending on how much weight they placed on monastic enclosure or pastoral care respectively. Initially rules of life tended to vary between communities but gradually by the 10th century the Rule of St Benedict became the standardised norm among the Latin Church’s monks and nuns while the Rule of St Augustine was standardised among its canons and canonesses. The earliest orders include the Cistercians (1098), the Premonstratensians (1120), the Poor Clares founded by Francis of Assisi (1212), and the Benedictine reform movements of Cluny (1216). These orders consist entirely of independent abbeys and priories where power rests in the hands of the individual communities and their abbot or abbess, prior or prioress. Their members remain in the same community for life.

 Later in the 13th century the mendicant orders like the Carmelites, the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Preachers, the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and the Order of Saint Augustine formed. These Mendicant orders did not hold property for their Religious Communities, instead begging for alms and going where they were needed. Their leadership structure included each member, as opposed to each Abbey or House, as subject to their direct superior. In the 16th century the orders of clerics regular began to emerge, including such institutes as the Society of Jesus, the Theatines, the Barnabites, the Somascans. Most of these groups began to turn away from the common public celebration of the divine office. 

In accordance with the concept of independent communities in the Rule of Saint Benedict, the Benedictines, Cistercians, and Trappists have autonomous abbeys (so-called &quot;independent houses&quot;). Their members profess &quot;stability&quot; to the abbeys where they make their religious vows; hence their abbots or abbesses may not move them to other abbeys. An &quot;independent house&quot; may occasionally make a new foundation which remains a &quot;dependent house&quot; (identified by the name &quot;priory&quot;) until it is granted independence by Rome and itself becomes an abbey. Each house&#x27;s autonomy does not prevent it being affiliated into a congregation—whether national or based on some other joint characteristic—and these, in turn, form the supra-national Benedictine Confederation.

Non-monastic religious institutes typically have a motherhouse, generalate, or general curia with jurisdiction over any number of dependent religious communities, whose members may be moved by their superior general to its other communities as the institute&#x27;s needs require.

Well-known Roman Catholic religious institute include Augustinians, Basilians, Benedictines, Bethlehemites, Bridgettines, Camaldolese, Carmelites, Carthusians, Cistercians, Conceptionists, Crosiers, Dominicans, Franciscans, Hieronymites, Jesuits, Minims, Piarists, Salesians, Olivetans, Theatines, Trappists and the Visitandines.

Several religious orders evolved during the Crusades to incorporate a military mission becoming &quot;religious military orders&quot;, such as the Knights of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Knights of the Order of the Temple and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.

===Orthodox tradition===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, there is only one type of monasticism. The profession of monastics is known as tonsure (referring to the ritual cutting of the monastic&#x27;s hair which takes place during the service) and is considered by monks to be a Sacred Mystery (Sacrament). The Rite of Tonsure is printed in the &quot;Euchologion&quot; (Church Slavonic: &quot;Trebnik&quot;), the same book as the other Sacred Mysteries and services performed according to need.

===Lutheran tradition===

Martin Luther had concerns with the spiritual value of monastic life at the time of the Reformation. After the foundation of the Lutheran Churches, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum) and convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.

Other examples of Lutheran religious orders include the &quot;Order of Lutheran Franciscans&quot; in the United States. Also, a Lutheran religious order following the Rule of St. Benedict, &quot;The Congregation of the Servants of Christ&quot;, was established at St. Augustine&#x27;s House in Oxford, Michigan, in 1958 when some other men joined Father Arthur Kreinheder in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. This order has strong ties to Lutheran Benedictine orders in Sweden (Östanbäck Monastery) and in Germany (Priory of St. Wigbert).

===Anglican tradition===

Religious orders in England were dissolved by King Henry VIII upon the separation of the English church from Roman primacy. For three hundred years, there were no formal religious orders in Anglicanism, although some informal communities – such as the Little Gidding community – occasionally sprang into being. With the advent of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England and worldwide Anglicanism in the middle of the 19th century, several orders appeared. In 1841, the first order for women was established. The first order for men was founded 25 years later.

Anglican religious voluntarily commit themselves for life, or a term of years, to holding their possessions in common or in trust; to a celibate life in community; and obedience to their Rule and Constitution.

There are presently thirteen active religious orders for men, fifty-three for women, and eight mixed gender.

===Methodist tradition===
The Methodist Church of Great Britain, and its ancestors, have established a number of orders of Deaconesses, who are now ordained as clergy and are Ministers in equal standing alongside their presbyteral colleagues. The Methodist Diaconal Order (MDO) currently admits both men and women to the Order and all are now known as Deacons. Since the functions of a deacon are primarily pastoral, the MDO may therefore be regarded as an order of Regular clerics.

The Order of Saint Luke is a religious order in the United Methodist Church dedicated to sacramental and liturgical scholarship, education, and practice.

===Anabaptist tradition===
Some Protestant religious orders follow Anabaptist theology. These would include the Hutterites and Bruderhof, who live in full community of goods and living as a peace church.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Among their corporations, the Religious Order of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses cares for matters specific to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses special full-time servants. In a particular branch, traveling overseers, special pioneers, and branch staff are considered members of the &quot;Order of Special Full-time Servants and the Bethel Family&quot;. Globally, their order is the &quot;Worldwide Order of Special Full-Time Servants of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;. Male and female members of such religious orders typically make a formal vow of poverty and are granted certain status and exemptions by many governments. While Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not consider members of their religious orders to be a clergy separate from other Witnesses, who are also ordained ministers, they do recognize that a government may consider them such for administrative purposes.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not have a separate clergy class, but consider an adherent&#x27;s qualified baptism to constitute his ordination as a minister. Governments have generally recognized that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; full-time appointees qualify as ministers regardless of sex or appointment as an elder or deacon (&quot;ministerial servant&quot;); the religion itself asserts what is sometimes termed &quot;ecclesiastical privilege&quot; only for its appointed elders.

==Islam==

===Sufis===
A tariqah is how a religious order is described in Sufism. It especially refers to the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking &quot;ḥaqīqah&quot; &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. Such tariqas typically have a &quot;murshid&quot; (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. Members and followers of a tariqa are known as &quot;murīdīn&quot; (singular &quot;murīd&quot;), meaning &quot;desirous&quot;, viz. &quot;desiring the knowledge of knowing God and loving God&quot; (also called a &quot;faqīr&quot; ). Tariqas have silsilas () which is the spiritual lineage of the Shaikhs of that order. Almost all orders trace their silsila back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Tariqas are spread all over the Muslim world.

===Shia===
Among Shias, Noorbakshia Islam is an order that blends Sufi principles with Shia doctrine. It claims to trace its direct spiritual lineage and chain (silsilah) to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Ali, the first imam of Shia Islam.

===Salafi===
There is some historical connection between certain schools of Sufism and the development of Wahhabism and Salafism due to the history of these denominations.

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab was inspired by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 14th-century scholar and dedicated Sufi, who is however remembered mainly as an outspoken critic of the excesses of certain schools of Sufism during his time.

==Judaism==
==Other traditions==
A form of ordered religious living is common also in many tribes and religions of Africa and South America, though on a smaller scale, and some parts of England. Due to the unorganized character of these small religious groups, orders are not as visible as in other well-organised religions.

Cults and coercive groups such as Scientology and Moonies often rely heavily on devout religious orders as a tactic to indoctrinate and control their followers. Scientology&#x27;s Sea Org, for example, are required to sign a one billion year contract and pledge allegiance to founder L. Ron Hubbard and are responsible for senior management positions within the Organization.

<text>The Stanford torus is a proposed NASA design for a space settlement capable of housing 10,000 permanent residents. It is a type of rotating wheel space station, consisting of a ring with a diameter of about 1.8 km.

==History of the concept==
The Stanford torus was proposed during the 1975 NASA Summer Study, conducted at Stanford University, with the purpose of exploring and speculating on designs for future space colonies, with the conclusions and the detailed proposal being published in 1977 in &quot;Space Settlements: A Design Study&quot; book, by Richard D. Johnson and Charles H. Holbrow (Gerard O&#x27;Neill later proposed his Island One or Bernal sphere as an alternative to the torus). &quot;Stanford torus&quot; refers only to this particular version of the design, as the concept of a ring-shaped rotating space station was previously proposed by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (&quot;Bublik-City&quot;, 1903), Herman Potočnik (1923) or Wernher von Braun (1952), among others.

==Design==
Stanford torus (the proposed 10,000 people habitat described in the 1975 Summer Study, to be distinguished from other rotating wheel space station designs) consists of a torus, or doughnut-shaped ring, that is 1.8 km in diameter and rotates once per minute to provide between 0.9 &quot;g&quot; and 1.0 &quot;g&quot; of artificial gravity on the inside of the outer ring via centrifugal force.

Sunlight is provided to the interior of the torus by a system of mirrors, including a large non-rotating primary solar mirror.

The ring is connected to a hub via a number of &quot;spokes&quot;, which serve as conduits for people and materials travelling to and from the hub. Since the hub is at the rotational axis of the station, it experiences the least artificial gravity and is the easiest location for spacecraft to dock. Zero-gravity industry is performed in a non-rotating module attached to the hub&#x27;s axis.

The interior space of the torus itself is used as living space, and is large enough that a &quot;natural&quot; environment can be simulated; the torus appears similar to a long, narrow, straight glacial valley whose ends curve upward and eventually meet overhead to form a complete circle. The population density is similar to a dense suburb, with part of the ring dedicated to agriculture and part to housing.

=== Chosen shape ===
The 1975 NASA Summer Study evaluated several options for the space habitat design, including spherical and cylindrical shapes, in addition to the toroidal one. The torus was chosen as the best option, among other reasons, because it minimized the amount of mass required to have the same area and radius of rotation.

===General characteristics===
* Location: Earth–Moon L5 Lagrangian point.
* Human population: 10,000.
* Total mass: 10 million tons (including radiation shield (95%), habitat, and atmosphere).
* Diameter: .
* Circumference: 5,623.45 m (3.49 mi).
* Rotation: 1 revolution per minute.
* Temperature: 23 ± 8 °C.
* Radiation shield: thick raw lunar soil.

===Components===
* Habitation tube (torus proper), with a diameter of . 2/3 of its surface are made of aluminum plates, and the remaining 1/3 is filled with glass windows mounted on aluminum ribs, to allow sunlight to enter inside the torus.
* Non-rotating main mirror, that directs sunlight towards the central hub.
* Central hub, with a diameter of . Secondary mirrors around the central hub direct sunlight towards the habitation tube.
* Fabrication sphere, connected to central hub&#x27;s &quot;South Pole&quot;, with a diameter of . It is also connected to a solar furnace and the habitat radiator.
* Docking module, connected to central hub&#x27;s &quot;North Pole&quot;, with a diameter of and a length of .
* Spokes: 6 spokes of diameter, connecting the central hub with the habitation tube. They have elevators, power cables, and heat exchange pipes between the torus and the hub.

=== Area and volume allocation ===
The circumference of the torus proper (about 5,600 m in all) would be divided into 6 sections of equal length. 3 of the sections would be used for agriculture, and the remaining 3 for residential uses. Agricultural and residential sections would alternate. A central plain would run through the full length of the torus. To gain space, structures would be terraced over the curved walls of the torus, while many commercial facilities (such as large shops, light industry or mechanical facilities) would be below the level of the central plain. According to the figures included in the study, the plain&#x27;s floor would be about 1/4 of tube&#x27;s diameter over the torus bottom, and each spoke would connect at the center of one of the 6 sections.

==== Totals ====
==Construction==
The torus would require nearly 10 million tons of mass. Construction would use materials extracted from the Moon and sent to space using a mass accelerator. A mass catcher at L2 would collect the materials, transporting them to L5 where they could be processed in an industrial facility to construct the torus. Only materials that could not be obtained from the Moon would have to be imported from Earth. Asteroid mining is an alternative source of materials.

==World ship proposal==
In 2012 paper &quot;World Ships - Architectures &amp; Feasibility Revisited&quot;, a generation ship (also called world ship) based on Stanford torus was proposed. Stanford torus was chosen over O&#x27;Neill colony designs because of its detailed design, that covers in depth aspects such as life support systems and wall thickness. For propulsion system, the one designed in Project Daedalus was chosen, to be used in combination with the Stanford torus.

<text>Sir Ronald Syme, (11 March 1903 – 4 September 1989) was a New Zealand-born historian and classicist. He was regarded as the greatest historian of ancient Rome since Theodor Mommsen and the most brilliant exponent of the history of the Roman Empire since Edward Gibbon. His great work was &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot; (1939), a masterly and controversial analysis of Roman political life in the period following the assassination of Julius Caesar.

==Life==
Syme was born to David and Florence Syme in Eltham, New Zealand in 1903, where he attended primary and secondary school; a bad case of measles seriously damaged his vision during this period. He moved to New Plymouth Boys&#x27; High School (a house of which bears his name today) at the age of 15, and was head of his class for both of his two years. He continued to the University of Auckland and Victoria University of Wellington, where he studied French language and literature while working on his degree in Classics. He then attended Oriel College, Oxford, between 1925 and 1927, gaining First Class honours in Literae Humaniores (ancient history and philosophy). In 1926, he won the Gaisford Prize for Greek Prose for translating a section of Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; into Platonic prose, and the following year won the Prize again (for Verse) for a translation of part of William Morris&#x27;s &quot;Sigurd the Volsung&quot; into Homeric hexameters.

His first scholarly work was published by the &quot;Journal of Roman Studies&quot; in 1928. In 1929 he became a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, where he became known for his studies of the Roman army and the frontiers of the Empire. During the Second World War, he worked as a press attaché in the British Embassies of Belgrade (where he acquired a knowledge of Serbo-Croatian) and Ankara, later taking a chair in classical philology at Istanbul University. His refusal to discuss the nature of his work during this period led some to speculate that he worked for the British intelligence services in Turkey, but proof for this hypothesis is lacking.

Sir Ronald&#x27;s work at Unesco is referred to in the autobiographical works of a collaborator, Jean d&#x27;Ormesson.

After being elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1944, Syme was appointed Camden Professor of Ancient History at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1949, a position which he held until his retirement in 1970. Syme was also appointed fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1970 until the late 1980s, where an annual lecture was established in his memory.

Syme was knighted in 1959. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the same year. He received the Order of Merit in 1976. He continued his prolific writing and editing until his death at the age of 86.

== Major works ==
The work for which Syme is chiefly remembered, &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot; (1939), is widely considered a masterly and controversial analysis of Roman political life in the period following the 44 BCE assassination of Julius Caesar. Inspired by the rise of fascist regimes in Germany and Italy, and following Tacitus in both literary style and pessimistic insight, the work challenged prevailing attitudes concerning the last years of the Roman Republic. Syme&#x27;s main conclusion was that the structure of the Republic and its Senate were inadequate for the needs of Roman rule; Augustus merely did what was necessary to restore order in public life, but was a dictatorial figure whose true nature was cloaked by the panegyrics written to honour him in his last years and after his death. &quot;The Roman constitution&quot;, Syme wrote, &quot;was a screen and a sham&quot;; Octavian&#x27;s supposed restoration of the Republic was a pretence on which he had built a monarchy based on personal relationships and the ambition of Rome&#x27;s political families. In &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot; Syme first used, with dazzling effect, the historical method of prosopography—tracing the linkages of kinship, marriage, and shared interest among the various leading families of republican and imperial Rome. By stressing prosopographical analysis, Syme rejected the force of ideas in politics, dismissing most such invocations of constitutional and political principle as nothing more than &quot;political catchwords&quot;. In this bleak cynicism about political ideas and political life, &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot; strongly resembled another controversial historical masterwork, &quot;The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III&quot;, published in 1930 by the specialist in eighteenth-century British political history, Sir Lewis B. Namier.

Syme&#x27;s next great work was his definitive two-volume biography of Tacitus (1958), his favourite among the ancient historians. The work&#x27;s forty-five chapters and ninety-five appendices make up the most complete study of Tacitus yet produced, backed by an exhaustive treatment of the historical and political background—the Empire&#x27;s first century—of his life. Syme blended biographical investigation, historical narrative and interpretation, and literary analysis to produce what may be the single most thorough study of a major historian ever published.

In 1958, Oxford University Press published &quot;Colonial Élites. Rome, Spain and the Americas&quot;, which presents the three lectures that Syme offered at McMaster University in January 1958 as part of the Whidden Lectures. Syme compares the three empires that have endured for the longest periods of time in Western History: Rome, Spain, and Britain. Syme considers that the duration of an Empire links directly to the character of the men who are in charge of the imperial administration, in particular that of the colonies. In his own words, the &quot;strength and vitality of an empire is frequently due to the new aristocracy from the periphery&quot;. This book is currently out of print.

Syme&#x27;s biography of Sallust (1964), based on his Sather Lectures at the University of California, is also regarded as authoritative. His four books and numerous essays on the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, including the publication &quot;Emperors and Biography: Studies in the Historia Augusta,&quot; firmly established the fraudulent nature of that work; he famously dubbed the anonymous author &quot;a rogue grammarian&quot;. Allen M. Ward stated in &quot;The Classical World&quot;, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Nov., 1971), pp. 100–101, that: &quot;No one interested in the H.A. or Roman history of the third century A.D. can ignore this book.&quot; On the content of the book itself, Peter White writes: &quot;Syme recovers portions, though miserably small portions, of the true history of the emperors from Severus Alexander to Diocletian. There are still other essays that escape this enumeration. Among them are two of the best in the book, an investigation of the patterns by which personal names have been faked and an expose of the procedures by which the biographer concocted the first five lives of pretenders and heirs apparent.&quot; Syme gives 10 ways to decipher fictitious names in a chapter called &#x27;Bogus Names&#x27;. He states: IX. Perverted names. One example is clear. Using Suetonius, the author changed &#x27;Mummia&#x27; to &#x27;Memmia&#x27; (Alex. 20. 3, cf. above). That is a mere trifle in the devices of the HA. If an author is anxious to be plausible, he may try to convey an impression of novelty (and hence of authenticity) by names that look original because different. Thus &#x27;Avulnius&#x27; and &#x27;Murrentius&#x27; (Aur. 13. I). One trick is to modify the shape of familiar names. Several instances have been detected. As consul in 258, the HA produces &#x27;Nemmius Fuscus&#x27; (or &#x27;Memmius Fuscus&#x27;). Regarding the HA authors&#x27; identity, Syme states: &quot;From time to time the deceiver lowers the mask. For example, when scourging the follies and fraudulence of other biographers (whom he invents), notably &#x27;Adius Junius Cordus&#x27;. The prime revelation occurs in the exordium of the &quot;Vita Aureliani&quot;. The Prefect of the City, after friendly and encouraging discourse on the high themes of history and veracity, tells the author to write as his fancy dictates. All the classical historians were liars, and he can join their company with a clear conscience...&quot; – &quot;Well then, write as you will. You will be safe in saying whatever you wish, since you will have as comrades in falsehood those authors whom we admire for the style of their histories.&quot;(Aur. 2. 2)

His &quot;History in Ovid&quot; (1978) places the great Roman poet Ovid firmly in his social context.

Syme&#x27;s &quot;The Augustan Aristocracy&quot; (1986) traces the prominent families under Augustus as a sequel to &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot;. Syme examined how and why Augustus promoted bankrupt patrician families and new politicians simultaneously to forge a coalition in government that would back his agenda for a new Rome.

A posthumous work (edited for publication by A. Birley), &quot;Anatolica&quot; (1995), is devoted to Strabo and deals with the geography of southern Armenia and mainly eastern parts of Asia Minor. His shorter works are collected in the seven volumes of &quot;Roman Papers&quot; (1979–1991), the first two volumes of which are edited by E. Badian, and the remainder by Anthony Birley.

Syme&#x27;s doctoral students at the University of Oxford included Barbara Levick (whose thesis in the mid-1950s dealt with Roman colonies in south Asia Minor), and Miriam T. Griffin (1968), whose thesis was entitled &quot;Seneca: the statesman and the writer&quot;.

<doc id="140453" wikidata="Q335087" url="?curid=140453" title="Hugh Trevor-Roper">
<text>Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, (15 January 1914 – 26 January 2003) was an English historian. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford.

Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In the view of John Philipps Kenyon, &quot;some of [Trevor-Roper&#x27;s] short essays have affected the way we think about the past more than other men&#x27;s books&quot;. This is echoed by Richard Davenport-Hines and Adam Sisman in the introduction to &quot;One Hundred Letters from Hugh Trevor-Roper&quot; (2014): &quot;The bulk of his publications is formidable... Some of his essays are of Victorian length. All of them reduce large subjects to their essence. Many of them... have lastingly transformed their fields.&quot; On the other hand, his biographer Adam Sisman also writes that &quot;the mark of a great historian is that he writes great books, on the subject which he has made his own. By this exacting standard Hugh failed.&quot;

Trevor-Roper&#x27;s most commercially successful book was titled &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; (1947). It emerged from his assignment as a British intelligence officer in 1945 to discover what happened in the last days of Hitler&#x27;s bunker. From interviews with a range of witnesses and study of surviving documents, he demonstrated that Hitler was dead and had not escaped from Berlin. He also showed that Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship was not an efficient unified machine but a hodge-podge of overlapping rivalries.

Trevor-Roper&#x27;s reputation was &quot;severely damaged&quot; in 1983 when he authenticated the Hitler Diaries shortly before they were shown to be forgeries.

==Early life and education==
Trevor-Roper was born at Glanton, Northumberland, England, the son of Kathleen Elizabeth Davidson (died 1964) and Bertie William Edward Trevor-Roper (1885–1978), a doctor, descended from Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham and second husband of Anne, 16th Baroness Dacre. Trevor-Roper &quot;enjoyed (but not too seriously)... that he was a collateral descendant of William Roper, the son-in-law and biographer of Sir Thomas More... as a boy he was aware that only a dozen lives (several of them those of elderly bachelors) separated him from inheriting the Teynham peerage.&quot;

Trevor-Roper&#x27;s brother, Patrick, became a leading eye surgeon and gay rights activist. Trevor-Roper was educated at Belhaven Hill School, Charterhouse, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read first Classics (&quot;Literae Humaniores&quot;) and then Modern History. He got a first-class degree in Classical Moderations in 1934 and won the Craven, the Ireland, and the Hertford scholarships in Classics. Initially, both he and his brother intended to make their careers in the Classics, but Hugh became bored with what he regarded as the pedantic technical aspects of the classics course at Oxford and switched to history, where he obtained first-class honours in 1936. Whilst at Oxford, he was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society and was initiated as a Freemason in the Apollo University Lodge.

In 1937, he moved from Christ Church to Merton College, Oxford to become a research fellow. His first book was a 1940 biography of Archbishop William Laud, in which he challenged many of the prevailing perceptions surrounding Laud.

==Military service and the Second World War==
Trevor-Roper was a member of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Officer Training Corps, reaching the rank of officer cadet corporal. On 28 February 1939, he was commissioned in the British Army as a second lieutenant with seniority in that rank from 1 October 1938, and attached to the cavalry unit of the Oxford University Contingent of the OTC. On 15 July 1940, he was promoted to war substantive lieutenant and transferred to the Intelligence Corps, Territorial Army.

During the Second World War, he served as an officer in the Radio Security Service of the Secret Intelligence Service, and then on the interception of messages from the German intelligence service, the &quot;Abwehr&quot;. In early 1940, Trevor-Roper and E. W. B. Gill decrypted some of these intercepts, demonstrating the relevance of the material and spurring Bletchley Park efforts to decrypt the traffic. Intelligence from &quot;Abwehr&quot; traffic later played an important part in many operations including the Double-Cross System.

He formed a low opinion of most pre-war professional intelligence officers, but a higher one of some of the post-1939 recruits. In &quot;The Philby Affair&quot; (1968) Trevor-Roper argues that the Soviet spy Kim Philby was never in a position to undermine efforts by the chief of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, German Military Intelligence, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, to overthrow the Nazi regime and negotiate with the British government.

==Investigating Hitler&#x27;s last days==
In November 1945, Trevor-Roper was ordered by Dick White, then head of counter-intelligence in the British sector of Berlin, to investigate the circumstances of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s death, and to rebut the Soviet propaganda that Hitler was alive and living in the West. Using the alias of &quot;Major Oughton&quot;, Trevor-Roper interviewed or prepared questions for several officials, high and low, who had been present in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; with Hitler, and who had been able to escape to the West, including Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven.

For the most part Trevor-Roper relied on investigations and interviews by hundreds of British, American and Canadian intelligence officers. He did not have access to Soviet materials. Working rapidly, Trevor-Roper drafted his report, which served as the basis for his most famous book, &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot;, in which he described the last ten days of Hitler&#x27;s life and the fates of some of the higher-ranking members of the inner circle, as well as those of key lesser figures. Trevor-Roper transformed the evidence into a literary work, with sardonic humour and drama, and was much influenced by the prose styles of two of his favourite historians, Edward Gibbon and Lord Macaulay.

The book was cleared by British officials in 1946 for publication as soon as the war crimes trials ended. It was published in English in 1947; six English editions and many foreign language editions followed. According to American journalist Ron Rosenbaum, Trevor-Roper received a letter from Lisbon written in Hebrew stating that the Stern Gang would assassinate him for &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot;, which, they believed, portrayed Hitler as a &quot;demoniacal&quot; figure but let ordinary Germans who followed Hitler off the hook, and that for this he deserved to die. Rosenbaum reports that Trevor-Roper told him this was the most extreme response he had ever received for one of his books.

==Anti-communism==
In June 1950, Trevor-Roper attended a conference in Berlin of anti-Communist intellectuals along with Sidney Hook, Melvin J. Lasky, Ignazio Silone, Arthur Koestler, Raymond Aron and Franz Borkenau that resulted in the founding of the CIA front group Congress for Cultural Freedom and its magazine &quot;Encounter&quot;. In the 1950s and 1960s, he was a frequent contributor to &quot;Encounter&quot;, but had reservations about what he regarded as the over-didactic tone of some of its contributors, particularly Koestler and Borkenau.

== Historical debates and controversies ==
Trevor-Roper was famous for his lucid and acerbic writing style. In reviews and essays he could be pitilessly sarcastic, and devastating in his mockery. In attacking Arnold J. Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;A Study of History&quot;, for instance, Trevor-Roper accused Toynbee of regarding himself as a Messiah complete with &quot;the youthful Temptations; the missionary Journeys; the Miracles; the Revelations; the Agony&quot;.

For Trevor-Roper, the major themes of early modern Europe were its intellectual vitality, and the quarrels between Protestant and Catholic states, the latter being outpaced by the former, economically and constitutionally. In Trevor-Roper&#x27;s view, another theme of early modern Europe was expansion overseas in the form of colonies and intellectual expansion in the form of the Reformation and the Enlightenment. In Trevor-Roper&#x27;s view, the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries can ultimately be traced back to the conflict between the religious values of the Reformation and the rationalistic approach of what became the Enlightenment.

Trevor-Roper argued that history should be understood as an art, not a science and that the attribute of a successful historian was imagination. He viewed history as full of contingency, with the past neither a story of continuous advance nor of continuous decline but the consequence of choices made by individuals at the time. In his studies of early modern Europe, Trevor-Roper did not focus exclusively upon political history but sought to examine the interaction between the political, intellectual, social and religious trends.

His preferred medium of expression was the essay rather than the book. In his essays in social history, written during the 1950s and 1960s, Trevor-Roper was influenced by the work of the French &quot;Annales&quot; school, especially Fernand Braudel and did much to introduce the work of the &quot;Annales&quot; school to the English-speaking world. In the 1950s, Trevor-Roper wrote that Braudel and other Annalists were doing much innovative historical work but were &quot;totally excluded from Oxford which remains, in historical matters, a retrograde provincial backwater&quot;.

===English Civil War===
In Trevor-Roper&#x27;s opinion, the dispute between the Puritans and the Arminians was a major, although not the sole, cause of the English Civil War. For him, the dispute was over such issues as free will and predestination and the role of preaching versus the sacraments. Only later did the dispute become a matter of the structure of the Church of England. The Puritans desired a more decentralised and egalitarian church, with an emphasis on the laity, while the Arminians wished for an ordered church with a hierarchy, an emphasis on divine right and salvation through free will.

As a historian of early modern Britain, Trevor-Roper was known for his disputes with fellow historians such as Lawrence Stone and Christopher Hill, whose materialist, and in some measure &quot;inevitablist&quot;, explanations of the English Civil War he attacked. Trevor-Roper was a leading player in the historiographical storm over the gentry, also known as the &quot;Gentry controversy&quot;, a dispute with the historians R. H. Tawney and Stone, about whether the English gentry were, economically, on the way down or up, in the century before the English Civil War and whether this helped cause that war.

Stone, Tawney and Hill argued that the gentry were rising economically and that this caused the Civil War. Trevor-Roper argued that while office-holders and lawyers were prospering, the lesser gentry were in decline. A third group of history men around J. H. Hexter and Geoffrey Elton, argued that the causes of the Civil War had nothing to do with the gentry. In 1948, a paper put forward by Stone in support of Tawney&#x27;s thesis was vigorously attacked by Trevor-Roper, who showed that Stone had exaggerated the debt problems of the Tudor nobility. He also rejected Tawney&#x27;s theories about the rising gentry and declining nobility, arguing that he was guilty of selective use of evidence and that he misunderstood the statistics.

===World War II and Hitler===
Trevor-Roper attacked the philosophies of history advanced by Arnold J. Toynbee and E. H. Carr, as well as his colleague A. J. P. Taylor&#x27;s account of the origins of World War II. Another dispute was with Taylor and Alan Bullock over the question of whether Adolf Hitler had fixed aims. In the 1950s, Trevor-Roper was ferocious in his criticism of Bullock for his portrayal of Hitler as a &quot;mountebank&quot; instead of the ideologue Trevor-Roper believed him to be. When Taylor offered a picture of Hitler similar to Bullock&#x27;s, in his 1961 book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, the debate continued. Another feud was with the novelist and Catholic convert Evelyn Waugh, who was angered by Trevor-Roper&#x27;s repeated harsh attacks on the Catholic Church.

In the globalist–continentalist debate between those who argued that Hitler aimed to conquer the world and those who argued that he sought only the conquest of Europe, Trevor-Roper was one of the leading continentalists. He argued that the globalist case sought to turn a scattering of Hitler&#x27;s remarks made over decades into a plan. In his analysis, the only consistent objective Hitler sought was the domination of Europe, as laid out in &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;

The American historian Lucy Dawidowicz in &quot;The Holocaust and Historians&quot; (1981) delivered what the British historian David Cesarani called an &quot;&quot;ad hominem&quot; attack&quot;, writing that Trevor-Roper in his writings on Nazi Germany was indifferent to Nazi antisemitism, because she believed that he was a snobbish antisemite, who was apathetic about the murder of six million Jews. Cesarani wrote that Dawidowicz was wrong to accuse Trevor-Roper of antisemitism but argued that there was an element of truth to her critique in that the &quot;Shoah&quot; was a blind-spot for Trevor-Roper.

Trevor-Roper was a very firm &quot;intentionalist&quot; who treated Hitler as a serious, if slightly deranged thinker who, from 1924 until his death in 1945, was obsessed with &quot;the conquest of Russia, the extermination of the Slavs, and the colonization of the English&quot;. In his 1962 essay &quot;The Mind of Adolf Hitler&quot;, Trevor-Roper again criticized Bullock, writing &quot;Even Mr. Bullock seems content to regard him as a diabolical adventurer animated solely by an unlimited lust for personal power... Hitler was a systematic thinker and his mind is, to the historian, as important as the mind of Bismarck or Lenin&quot;. Trevor-Roper maintained that Hitler, on the basis of a wide range of antisemitic literature, from the writings of Houston Stewart Chamberlain to &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, had constructed a racist ideology that called for making Germany the world&#x27;s greatest power and the extermination of perceived enemies such as the Jews and Slavs.

Trevor-Roper wrote that the mind of Hitler was &quot;a terrible phenomenon, imposing indeed in its granite harshness and yet infinitely squalid in its miscellaneous cumber, like some huge barbarian monolith; the expression of giant strength and savage genius; surrounded by a festering heap of refuse, old tins and vermin, ashes and eggshells and ordure, the intellectual detritus of centuries&quot;. Cesarani wrote that Trevor-Roper regarded Hitler, in marked contrast to Bullock, as a man who was serious about what he said but at the same time, Trevor-Roper&#x27;s picture of Hitler as a somewhat insane leader, fanatically pursuing lunatic policies, meant paradoxically that it was hard to take Hitler seriously, at least on the basis of Trevor-Roper&#x27;s writings.

Cesarani stated that Trevor-Roper was sincere in his hatred and contempt for the Nazis and everything they stood for but he had considerable difficulty when it came to writing about the complicity and involvement of traditional German elites in National Socialism, because the traditional elites in Germany were so similar in many ways to the British establishment, which Trevor-Roper identified with so strongly.

In this respect, Cesarani argued that it was very revealing that Trevor-Roper in &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; was especially damning in his picture of the German Finance Minister, Count Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk, who Trevor-Roper noted &quot;had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but he had acquired none of its values&quot;. Cesarani wrote &quot;Thus, to Trevor-Roper the values of Oxford University stood at the opposite pole to those of Hitler&#x27;s Reich, and one reason for the ghastly character of Nazism was that it did not share them&quot;. Cesarani noted that while Trevor-Roper supported the Conservatives and ended his days as a Tory life-peer, he was broadly speaking a liberal and believed that Britain was a great nation because of its liberalism.

Because of this background, Cesarani wrote that Trevor-Roper naturally saw the liberal democracy Britain as anathema to Nazi Germany. Cesarani concluded that &quot;to maintain the illusion of virtuous British liberalism, Hitler had to be depicted as either a statesman like any other or a monster without equal, and those who did business with him as, respectively, pragmatists or dupes. Every current of Nazi society that made it distinctive could be charted, while the anti-Jewish racism that it shared with Britain was discreetly avoided&quot;.

===General crisis of the 17th century===
A notable thesis propagated by Trevor-Roper was the &quot;general crisis of the 17th century&quot;. He argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by demographic, social, religious, economic and political problems. In this &quot;general crisis&quot;, various events, such as the English Civil War; The Fronde in France; the climax of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany; troubles in the Netherlands; and revolts against the Spanish Crown in Portugal, the Kingdom of Naples and Catalonia; were all manifestations of the same problems.

The most important causes of the &quot;general crisis&quot; in Trevor-Roper&#x27;s opinion were conflicts between &quot;Court&quot; and &quot;Country&quot;; that is, between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states, represented by the Court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry, representing the country. In addition, he said that the religious and intellectual changes introduced by the Reformation and the Renaissance were important secondary causes of the &quot;general crisis&quot;.

The &quot;general crisis&quot; thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory, and those, such as the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, who agreed with him that there was a &quot;general crisis&quot;, but saw the problems of 17th century Europe as more economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow. A third faction denied that there was any &quot;general crisis&quot;, for example the Dutch historian Ivo Schöffer, the Danish historian Niels Steensgaard, and the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya. Trevor-Roper&#x27;s &quot;general crisis&quot; thesis provoked much discussion, and led experts in 17th century history such as Roland Mousnier, J. H. Elliott, Lawrence Stone, E. H. Kossmann, Eric Hobsbawm and J. H. Hexter to become advocates of the pros and cons of the theory.

At times the discussion became quite heated; the Italian Marxist historian Rosario Villari, speaking of the work of Trevor-Roper and Mousnier, claimed that: &quot;The hypothesis of imbalance between bureaucratic expansion and the needs of the state is too vague to be plausible, and rests on inflated rhetoric, typical of a certain type of political conservative, rather than on effective analysis.&quot; Villari accused Trevor-Roper of downgrading the importance of what Villari called the English Revolution (the usual Marxist term for the English Civil War), and insisted that the &quot;general crisis&quot; was part of a Europe-wide revolutionary movement.

Another Marxist critic of Trevor-Roper, the Soviet historian A. D. Lublinskaya, attacked the concept of a conflict between &quot;Court&quot; and &quot;Country&quot; as fiction, arguing there was no &quot;general crisis&quot;. Instead she maintained that the so-called &quot;general crisis&quot; was merely the emergence of capitalism.

===First World War===
In 1973, Trevor-Roper in the foreword to a book by John Röhl endorsed the view that Germany was largely responsible for the First World War. Trevor-Roper wrote that in his opinion far too many British historians had allowed themselves to be persuaded of the theory that the outbreak of war in 1914 had been the fault of all the great powers. He claimed that this theory had been promoted by the German government&#x27;s policy of selective publication of documents, aided and abetted by most German historians in a policy of &quot;self-censorship&quot;. He praised Röhl for finding and publishing two previously secret documents that showed German responsibility for the war.

===JFK Assassination===
Trevor-Roper was critical of the official account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He voiced his scepticism of the Warren Commission which concluded that a lone gunman by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald was responsible. In a 3500 word essay published in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; he said that the commission employed a &quot;smokescreen of often irrelevant material&quot; and &quot;accepted impermissible axioms, constructed invalid arguments, and failed to ask elementary and essential questions&quot;. He wrote the introduction to Mark Lane&#x27;s book &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; and was thanked in the acknowledgements section for being &quot;kind enough to read the manuscript and make suggestions&quot;. He also joined Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot;

===Backhouse frauds===
In 1973, Trevor-Roper was invited to visit Switzerland to examine a manuscript entitled &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot; written by the sinologist Sir Edmund Backhouse (1873–1944) in a mixture of English, French, Latin and Chinese that had been in the custody of Reinhard Hoeppli, a Swiss diplomat who was the Swiss consul in Beijing during World War II. Hoeppli, given &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot; in 1943 by his friend Backhouse, had been unable to publish it owing to its sexually explicit content. But by 1973 looser censorship and the rise of the gay rights movement meant a publisher was willing to release &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot; to the market. However, before doing so they wanted Trevor-Roper, who as a former MI6 officer was an expert on clandestine affairs, to examine some of the more outlandish claims contained in the text.

For an example, Backhouse claimed in &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot; that the wives and daughters of British diplomats in Beijing had trained their dogs and tamed foxes to perform cunnilingus on them, which the fascistic Backhouse used as evidence of British &quot;decadence&quot;, which explained why he was supporting Germany and Japan in the Second World War. Trevor-Roper regarded &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot; with considerable distaste calling the manuscript &quot;pornographic&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot; as Backhouse related in graphic detail sexual encounters he claimed to have had with the French poet Paul Verlaine, the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, Wilde&#x27;s lover Lord Alfred Douglas, the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, the Russian ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, the British Prime Minister Lord Rosebery and the Empress Dowager Cixi of China whom the openly gay Backhouse had maintained had forced herself on him.

Backhouse also claimed to have been the friend of the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. For the next two years, Trevor-Roper went on an odyssey that took him all over Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States, Canada and China as he sought to unravel the mystery of just who the elusive Backhouse was. Backhouse had between 1898 and his death in 1944 worked as a sinologist, the business agent for several British and American companies in China, a British spy, gun-runner and translator before ending his days in World War II China as a fascist and a Japanese collaborator who wished fervently for an Axis victory which would destroy Great Britain. Trevor-Roper noted that despite Backhouse&#x27;s homosexuality and Nazi Germany&#x27;s policy of persecuting homosexuals, Backhouse&#x27;s intense hatred of his own country together with his sadistic-masochistic sexual needs meant that Backhouse longed to be &quot;ravished and possessed by the brutal, but still perverted masculinity of the fascist &quot;.

The result was one of Trevor-Roper&#x27;s most successful later books, his 1976 biography of Backhouse, originally entitled &quot;A Hidden Life&quot; but soon republished in Britain and the US as &quot;The Hermit of Peking&quot;. Backhouse had long been regarded as a world&#x27;s leading expert on China. In his biography, Trevor-Roper exposed the vast majority of Sir Edmund&#x27;s life-story and virtually all of his scholarship as a fraud. In &quot;Décadence Mandchoue&quot;, Backhouse spoke of his efforts to raise money to pay the defence lawyers for Wilde while he was an undergraduate at Oxford.

Trevor-Roper established that while Backhouse raised money for the Wilde defence fund, he spent it all on buying expensive jewellery, especially pearl necklaces, which were a special passion of Backhouse&#x27;s. It was this embezzlement of the money Backhouse had raised for the Wilde defence fund that led to him fleeing Britain in 1895. The discrediting of Backhouse as a source led to much of China&#x27;s history being re-written in the West. Backhouse had portrayed Prince Ronglu as a friend of the West and an enemy of the Boxers when the opposite was true.

Trevor-Roper noted that in the &quot;diary&quot; of Ching-Shan, which Backhouse claimed to have looted from Ching&#x27;s house just before it was burned down by Indian troops in the Boxer Rebellion, it has Prince Ronglu saying in French about the government&#x27;s support of the Boxers: &quot;It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.&quot; Trevor-Roper argued that it was extremely unlikely that Prince Ronglu – who only knew Manchu and Mandarin – would be quoting a well-known French expression, but noted that Backhouse was fluent in French.

Backhouse was fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, lived most of his life in Beijing and after moving to China had declined to wear western clothes, preferring instead the gown of a Chinese mandarin, which led most Westerners to assume that Backhouse &quot;knew&quot; China. Trevor-Roper noted that despite his superficial appearance of affection for the Chinese, much of what Backhouse wrote about on China worked subtly to confirm Western &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; stereotypes, as Backhouse variously depicted the Chinese as pathologically dishonest, sexually perverted, morally corrupt and generally devious and treacherous – in short, Chinese civilization for Backhouse was a deeply sick civilization.

Derek Sandhaus, however, notes that Trevor-Roper did not consult specialists in Chinese affairs, and seems to have read only enough of the text to have been disgusted by its homosexuality. While conceding that Backhouse fabricated or imagined many of the purported assignations, others Sandhaus independently confirmed or found plausible, reasoning that Backhouse spoke Chinese, Manchu, and Mongolian (the languages of the imperial household), and that his account of the atmosphere and customs of the Empress Dowager&#x27;s court may be more reliable than Trevor-Roper allowed.

===Oxford activities===
In 1960, Trevor-Roper waged a successful campaign against the candidacy of Sir Oliver Franks who was backed by the heads of houses marshalled by Maurice Bowra, for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford, helping the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to be elected instead. In 1964, Trevor-Roper edited a &quot;Festschrift&quot; in honour of his friend Sir Keith Feiling&#x27;s 80th birthday. In 1970, he was the author of &quot;The Letters of Mercurius&quot;, a satirical work on the student revolts and university politics of the late 1960s, originally published as letters in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

===Debates on African history===
Another aspect of Trevor-Roper&#x27;s outlook on history and on scholarly research that has inspired controversy is his statement about the historical experiences of pre-literate societies. Following Voltaire&#x27;s remarks on the fall of the Roman Empire at the hands of barbarian tribes, he asserted that Africa had no history prior to European exploration and colonisation. Trevor-Roper said &quot;there is only the history of Europeans in Africa. The rest is darkness&quot;, its past &quot;the unedifying gyrations of barbarous tribes in picturesque but irrelevant corners of the globe&quot;.

These comments, recapitulated in a later article which called Africa &quot;unhistoric&quot;, spurred intense debate between historians, anthropologists, sociologists, in the emerging fields of postcolonial and cultural studies about the definition of &quot;history&quot;. Historians have argued, in response, that historical myths of the kind perpetrated by Trevor-Roper need to be actively countered: &quot;Only a process of counter-selection can correct this, and African historians have to concentrate on those aspects which were ignored by the disparaging mythologies&quot;.

Many historians now argue, against Trevor-Roper, that historical evidence should also include oral traditions as well as any type of written history, a former criterion for a society having left &quot;prehistory&quot;. Critics of Trevor-Roper&#x27;s claim have questioned the validity of systematic interpretations of the African past, whether by materialist, Annalist or the traditional historical methods used by Trevor-Roper. Some say approaches which compare Africa with Europe or directly integrate it into European history cannot qualify as accurate descriptions of African societies. Most scholars of any mettle now agree that Africa has a &quot;history&quot;. Despite controversies over historical accuracy in oral records, as in Alex Haley&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; and the popular TV mini-series based on it, many historians believe that African griots, or oral memoirists, provide an historical oral record.

===&quot;Hitler Diaries&quot; hoax===
The nadir of his career came in 1983, when as a director of &quot;The Times&quot;, Trevor-Roper (by now Baron Dacre of Glanton) made statements that authenticated the so-called Hitler Diaries. Others were unsure: holocaust denier David Irving, for example, initially decried them as forgeries but subsequently changed his mind and declared that they could be genuine, before finally stating that they were a forgery. Historians Gerhard Weinberg and Eberhard Jäckel had also expressed doubt regarding the authenticity of the diaries.

Within two weeks, forensic scientist Julius Grant demonstrated that the diaries were forgeries. The ensuing fiasco gave Trevor-Roper&#x27;s enemies the opportunity to criticise him openly, while Trevor-Roper&#x27;s initial endorsement of the diaries raised questions about his integrity: &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, a newspaper to which he regularly contributed book reviews and of which he was an independent director, had already paid a considerable sum for the right to serialise the diaries if and only if they were genuine.

Trevor-Roper explained that he had been given assurances (that turned out to be false) about how the diaries had come into the possession of their &quot;discoverer&quot;, and about the age of the paper and ink used in them and of their authenticity. Nonetheless, this incident prompted the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; to nickname him &quot;Hugh Very-Ropey&quot;, &quot;Lord Lucre of Claptout&quot;, or more concisely, &quot;Lord Facre&quot;.

Despite the shadow this cast over his later career, he continued to write and publish and his work remained well received.

==Election as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge==

In 1980 at the age of 67, he became Master of Peterhouse, the oldest and smallest college in the University of Cambridge. His election, which surprised his friends, was engineered by a group of fellows led by Maurice Cowling, then the leading Peterhouse historian. The fellows chose him because Cowling&#x27;s reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as:Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco’s death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (&quot;a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations&quot;), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman&#x27;s 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the &quot;Economist&quot; wrote that the picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was &quot;startling&quot;, stating the college had become under Cowling&#x27;s influence a sort of right-wing &quot;lunatic asylum&quot;, who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper&#x27;s reforms. In 1987 he retired complaining of &quot;seven wasted years&quot;.

==Festschrift==
In 1981 a Festschrift was published in honour of Trevor-Roper, &quot;History and the Imagination&quot;. Some of the contributors were Sir Geoffrey Elton, John Clive, Arnaldo Momigliano, Frances Yates, Jeremy Catto, Robert S. Lopez, Michael Howard, David S. Katz, Dimitri Obolensky, J. H. Elliott, Richard Cobb, Walter Pagel, Hugh Lloyd-Jones, Valerie Pearl and Fernand Braudel. The topics contributed by this group of American, British, French, Russian, Italian, Israeli, Canadian and German historians extended from whether the &quot;Odyssey&quot; was a part of an oral tradition that was later written down, to the question of the responsibility for the Jameson Raid.

==Personal life==
On 4 October 1954, Trevor-Roper married Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston (9 March 1907 – 15 August 1997), eldest daughter of Field Marshal The 1st Earl Haig by his wife, the former Hon. Dorothy Maud Vivian. Lady Alexandra was a goddaughter of Queen Alexandra and had previously been married to Rear-Admiral Clarence Dinsmore Howard-Johnston, by whom she had had three children. There were no children by his marriage with her.

Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He was raised to the Peerage on 27 September 1979, and was introduced to the House of Lords as Baron Dacre of Glanton, of Glanton in the County of Northumberland. He did not base his title on his surname, because &quot;double-barrelled titles are an invention, and a monopoly, of Wilsonian peers&quot;, and &quot;under the rules of the College of Arms either [&#x27;Lord Trevor&#x27; or &#x27;Lord Roper&#x27;] would require him to change his surname to either &#x27;Trevor&#x27; or &#x27;Roper.&#x27;&quot;

On mentioning the family&#x27;s connection to the Dacre title to his wife, who liked the sound of it, Trevor-Roper was persuaded to opt for the title of &quot;Baron Dacre&quot;, despite staunch opposition from the &quot;suo jure&quot; 27th Baroness Dacre (née Brand). She had her cousin, the 6th Viscount Hampden, &quot;as titular head of the Brand family&quot;, inform Trevor-Roper that the Dacre title belonged to the Brand family &quot;and no-one else should breach their monopoly&quot;, on the grounds of the title&#x27;s antiquity of over six centuries.

This high-handed treatment strengthened Trevor-Roper&#x27;s resolve in the face of his initial ambivalence. He observed &quot;why should the Brands be so &#x27;proud&#x27;, or so jealous, of a mere title... a gewgaw, which has been bandied intermittently from family to family for six centuries, without tradition or continuity or distinction (except for murder, litigation and extravagance) or, for the last 250 years, land? They only acquired this pretty toy, in 1829, because a Mr Brand, of whom nothing whatever is known, had married into the Trevor-Ropers, who had themselves acquired it by marrying into the Lennards. Now they behave as if they had owned it for six centuries and had a monopoly of it for ever. A fig for their stuffiness!&quot;. Notwithstanding objections, Trevor-Roper duly took the title of Baron Dacre of Glanton.

In his last years he had suffered from failing eyesight, which made it difficult for him to read and write. He underwent cataract surgery and obtained a magnifying machine, which allowed him to continue writing. In 2002, at the age of 88, Trevor-Roper submitted a sizable article on Thomas Sutton, the founder of Charterhouse School, to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in part with notes he had written decades earlier, which editor Brian Harrison praised as &quot;the work of a master&quot;. Trevor-Roper suffered several other minor ailments related to his advanced age, but according to his stepson, &quot;bore all his difficulties stoically and without complaint&quot;. In 2002, he was diagnosed with cancer. He died on 26 January 2003 in a hospice in Oxford, aged 89.

==Posthumous books==
Five books by Trevor-Roper were published posthumously. The first was &quot;Letters from Oxford&quot;, a collection of letters written by Trevor-Roper between 1947 and 1959 to his close friend the American art historian and collector Bernard Berenson. The second book was 2006&#x27;s &quot;Europe’s Physician&quot;, a biography of Sir Theodore de Mayerne, the Franco-Swiss court physician to Henri IV, James I and Charles I. The latter work was largely completed by 1979, but for unknown reasons was not finished.

The third book was &quot;The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History&quot;, a critique written in the mid-1970s of what Trevor-Roper regarded as the myths of Scottish nationalism. It was published in 2008. The fourth book collecting together some of his essays on &quot;History and the Enlightenment: Eighteenth Century Essays&quot; was published in 2010. The fifth book was &quot;The Wartime Journals&quot;, edited by Richard Davenport-Hines, published in 2011. &quot;The Wartime Journals&quot; are from the journals that Trevor-Roper kept during his years in the Secret Intelligence Service.

<text>Micro Channel architecture, or the Micro Channel bus, is a proprietary 16- or 32-bit parallel computer bus publicly introduced by IBM in 1987 which was used on PS/2 and other computers until the mid-1990s. Its name is commonly abbreviated as &quot;MCA&quot;, although not by IBM. In IBM products, it superseded the ISA bus and was itself subsequently superseded by the PCI bus architecture.

== Background ==

The development of Micro Channel was driven by both technical and business pressures.

=== Technology ===
The IBM AT bus, which later became known as the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, had a number of technical design limitations, including:
* A slow bus speed.
* A limited number of interrupts, fixed in hardware.
* A limited number of I/O device addresses, also fixed in hardware.
* Hardwired and complex configuration with no conflict resolution.
* Deep links to the architecture of the 80x86 chip family
In addition, it suffered from other problems:
* Poor grounding and power distribution.
* Undocumented bus interface standards that varied between systems and manufacturers.

These limitations became more serious as the range of tasks and peripherals, and the number of manufacturers for IBM PC-compatibles, grew. IBM was already investigating the use of RISC processors in desktop machines, and could, in theory, save considerable money if a single well-documented bus could be used across their entire computer lineup.

=== Market share ===
It was thought that by creating a new standard, IBM would regain control of standards via the required licensing. As patents can take three years or more to be granted, however, only those relating to ISA could be licensed when Micro Channel was announced. Patents on important Micro Channel features, such as Plug and Play automatic configuration, were not granted to IBM until after PCI had replaced Micro Channel in the marketplace. The overall reception was tepid and the impact of Micro Channel in the worldwide PC market was minor.

== Design ==
The Micro Channel architecture was designed by engineer Chet Heath. A lot of the Micro Channel cards that were developed used the Chips and Technologies P82C612 MCA interface controller; allowing MCA implementations to become a lot easier.
===Overview===
The Micro Channel was primarily a 32-bit bus, but the system also supported a 16-bit mode designed to lower the cost of connectors and logic in Intel-based machines like the IBM PS/2.

The situation was never that simple, however, as both the 32-bit and 16-bit versions initially had a number of additional optional connectors for memory cards which resulted in a huge number of physically incompatible cards for bus attached memory. In time, memory moved to the CPU&#x27;s local bus, thereby eliminating the problem. On the upside, signal quality was greatly improved as Micro Channel added ground and power pins and arranged the pins to minimize interference; a ground or a supply was thereby located within 3 pins of every signal.

Another connector extension was included for graphics cards. This extension was used for analog output from the video card, which was then routed through the system board to the system&#x27;s own monitor output. The advantage of this was that Micro Channel system boards could have a basic VGA or MCGA graphics system on board, and higher-level graphics (XGA or other accelerator cards) could then share the same port. The add-on cards were then able to be free of &#x27;legacy&#x27; VGA modes, making use of the on-board graphics system when needed, and allowing a single system board connector for graphics that could be upgraded.

Micro Channel cards also featured a unique, 16-bit software-readable ID, which formed the basis of an early plug and play system. The BIOS and/or OS can read IDs, compare against a list of known cards, and perform automatic system configuration to suit. This led to boot failures whereby an older BIOS would not recognize a newer card, causing an error at startup. In turn, this required IBM to release updated Reference Disks (The CMOS Setup Utility) on a regular basis. A fairly complete list of known IDs is available (see External links section). To accompany these reference disks were ADF files which were read by setup which in turn provided configuration information for the card. The ADF was a simple text file, containing information about the card&#x27;s memory addressing and interrupts.

Although MCA cards cost nearly double the price of comparable non-MCA cards, the marketing stressed that it was simple for any user to upgrade or add more cards to their PC, thus saving the considerable expense of a technician. In this critical area, Micro Channel architecture&#x27;s biggest advantage was also its greatest disadvantage, and one of the major reasons for its demise. To add a new card (video, printer, memory, network, modem, etc.) the user simply plugged in the MCA card and inserted a customized floppy disk (that came with the PC) to blend the new card into the original hardware automatically, rather than bringing in an expensively trained technician who could manually make all the needed changes. All choices for interrupts (an often perplexing problem) and other changes were accomplished automatically by the PC reading the old configuration from the floppy disk, which made necessary changes in software, then wrote the new configuration to the floppy disk. In practice, however, this meant that the user must keep that &quot;same floppy disk matched to that PC&quot;. For a small company with a few PCs, this was annoying, but practical. But for large organizations with hundreds or even thousands of PCs, permanently matching each PC with its own floppy disk was logistically unlikely or impossible. Without the original, updated floppy disk, no changes could be made to the PC&#x27;s cards. After this experience repeated itself thousands of times, business leaders realized their dream scenario for upgrade simplicity did not work in the corporate world, and they sought a better process.

=== Data transmission ===
The basic data rate of the Micro Channel was increased from ISA&#x27;s 8 MHz to 10 MHz. This may have been a modest increase in terms of clock rate, but the greater bus width, coupled with a dedicated bus controller that utilized burst mode transfers, meant that effective throughput was up to five times higher than ISA. For faster transfers the address bus could be reused for data, further increasing the effective width of the bus. While the 10 MHz rate allowed 40 MB/s of throughput at 32-bit width, later models of RS/6000 machines increased the data rate to 20 MHz, and the throughput to 80 MB/s. Some higher throughput functions of the Micro Channel bus were available to RS/6000 platform only, and were not initially supported on cards operating on an Intel platform.

With bus mastering, each card could talk to another directly. This allowed performance that was independent of the CPU. One potential drawback of multi-master design was the possible collisions when more than one card would try to bus master, but Micro Channel included an arbitration feature to correct for these situations, and also allowed a master to use a &quot;burst-mode&quot;. Micro Channel cards had complete control for up to 12 milliseconds. This was long enough to permit the maximum number of other devices on the bus to buffer inbound data from over-runnable devices like tape and communications.

Multiple bus-master support and improved arbitration mean that several such devices could coexist and share the system bus. Micro Channel bus-master-capable devices can even use the bus to talk directly to each other (peer-to-peer) at speeds faster than the system CPU, without any other system intervention. In theory, Micro Channel architecture systems could be expanded, like mainframes, with only the addition of intelligent masters, without periodic need to upgrade the central processor.

Arbitration enhancement ensures better system throughput since control is passed more efficiently. Advanced interrupt handling refers to the use of level-sensitive interrupts to handle system requests. Rather than a dedicated interrupt line, several lines can be shared to provide more possible interrupts, addressing the ISA-bus interrupt line conflict problems.

All interrupt request signals were &quot;public&quot; on Micro Channel architecture permitting any card on the bus to function as an I/O processor for direct service of I/O device interrupts. ISA had limited all such processing to just the system&#x27;s CPU. Likewise, bus master request and grant signals were public, such that bus attached devices could monitor latency to control internal buffering for I/O processors. These features were not adopted for PCI, requiring all I/O support to come uniquely from the system board processor.

The final major Micro Channel architecture improvement was POS, the &quot;Programmable Option Select&quot;, which allowed all setup to take place in software. This feature is taken for granted now, but at the time setup was a huge chore for ISA systems. POS was a simple system that included device IDs in firmware, which the drivers in the computer were supposed to interpret. (This type of software-configuration system is known as &quot;plug and play&quot; today.) The feature did not really live up to its promise; the automatic configuration was fine when it worked, but it frequently did not - resulting in an unbootable computer - and resolving the problem by manual intervention was much more difficult than configuring an ISA system, not least because the documentation for the MCA device would tend to assume that the automatic configuration &quot;would&quot; work and so did not provide the necessary information to set it up by hand, unlike ISA device documentation which by necessity provided full details (however having to physically remove and check all IRQ settings, then find and set the new IRQ for a new device—if a suitable one was available—for ISA was no fun at all, and beyond many users... it is obvious why the attempt was made to move to software-arbitrated configuration, and why this was to later succeed in the form of PnP.)

== Reception ==
In November 1983 &quot;The Economist&quot; stated that the IBM PC standard&#x27;s dominance of the personal computer market was not a problem because &quot;it can help competition to flourish&quot;. The magazine predicted that

Micro Channel architecture was publicly introduced at the launch of the PS/2 range in 1987, with three out of four of the new machines featuring it. IBM had actually discreetly introduced the Micro Channel architecture in October 1986, half a year before the introduction of the IBM PS/2, as part of their &quot;Gearbox&quot; Industrial Computer 7552 series. These computers were rack-mountable, ruggedized, modular industrial PCs. They featured a hybrid 16-bit MCA and ISA bus, with certain ISA signal lines disabled.

The use of MCA in IBM spread to the RS/6000, AS/400, and eventually to the IBM 9370 systems - smallest members of the System/370 range.

IBM licensed the architecture to other companies for one to five percent of revenue. Tandy Corporation was the first to ship a Micro Channel-based computer, the 5000 MC, but company head John Roach said &quot;I&#x27;m surprised anybody at all would want it&quot;; Tandy only sold the computer, he said, because there was some demand for it. NCR Corporation adopted Micro Channel comprehensively - they designed and built high-performance personal computer, workstation and server platforms supporting it, including their own Micro Channel architecture-based logic componentry, including SCSI, graphics, networking, and audio. A small number of other manufacturers, including Apricot, Dell, Research Machines, and Olivetti adopted it, but only for part of their PC range.

Despite the fact that MCA was a huge technical improvement over ISA, it soon became clear that its introduction and marketing by IBM was poorly handled. IBM had strong patents on Micro Channel architecture system features, and required Micro Channel system manufacturers to pay a licence fee - and actively pursued patents to block third parties from selling unlicensed implementations of it. The PC clone market did not want to pay royalties to IBM in order to use this new technology, and stayed largely with the 16-bit AT bus, (embraced and renamed as ISA to avoid IBM&#x27;s &quot;AT&quot; trademark) and manual configuration, although the VESA Local Bus (VLB) was briefly popular for Intel &#x27;486 machines.

For servers the technical limitations of the old ISA were too great, and, in late 1988, the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot;, led by Compaq, announced a rival high-performance bus - Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA). This offered similar performance benefits to Micro Channel, but with the twin advantage of being able to accept older ISA boards and being free from IBM&#x27;s control.

IBM&#x27;s announcement of the AT bus-based PS/2 Model 30 286 at the same time as EISA was the company&#x27;s acknowledgement that, 17 months after telling customers that the AT bus was obsolete, customers still wanted it. For several years EISA and Micro Channel battled it out in the server arena, but, in 1996, IBM effectively conceded defeat, when they themselves produced some EISA-bus servers. In 2001 IBM executive Robert Moffat said that of the company&#x27;s mistakes in the PC market, &quot;the most obvious one is Micro Channel&quot;.

Within a few years of its arrival in 1992, PCI had largely superseded Micro Channel, EISA, and VLB.

== Consortium ==

In response to the rise of EISA, IBM and thirteen Micro Channel card and peripheral manufacturers formed the Micro Channel Developers Association. This was a consortium that sought to consider and prioritize steps in the maturation of Micro Channel, as well as to explore better approaches to disseminating technical information about Micro Channel to third parties. In 1992, it reached 92 members, including IBM. Even after IBM discontinued MCA systems in 1995, the consortium still held meetings and maintained a catalog of MCA devices online.

==Third-party adoption==

A number of non-PS/2 computers were manufactured between the late 1980s and early 1990s. Such third-party computers were also referred to as &quot;PS/2 clones&quot; or &quot;MCA clones&quot;. The first third-party Micro Channel–based computer was Tandy Corporation&#x27;s 5000 MC in 1988. Despite expensive research and development costs on the part of third-party manufacturers of Micro Channel computers—in part due to the expensive licensing fees incurred by IBM in order to allow legal use of the Micro Channel technology—by 1990 most MCA clones were not fully compatible with the Micro Channel architecture or expansion cards based on Micro Channel. By the time IBM was winding down the PS/2 line of personal computers (which in 1987 acted as the means of introducing Micro Channel to the general public) in 1992, NCR Corporation remained the one of a few remaining committed vendors of MCA clones.

== Cards ==
Expansion cards for the Micro Channel bus typically targeted high-end graphic workstation or server requirements, with SCSI, Token Ring, Ethernet, IBM 5250 and IBM 3270 connections.

<text>Drachten (, ) is a town in the northern Netherlands. It is located in the municipality of Smallingerland, Friesland. It had a population of around 56.098 in 2023 and is the second largest town in the province of Friesland.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===


Drachten began as a small community on the east side of the Drait (or Dracht) river. There, early settlers started draining the land to use it for agriculture. As the process of draining progressed, residents began to move further eastward in order to use the drained land—former peatbogs—for agriculture.

Around 1200 A.D., a small stone church was built. It was used for 200 years afterward, until rising waters drove people even further east.

By 1550 the Dutch peat reserve had been exhausted. Peat had become an important source of energy, not only for private households but also for the industry. The need in the rapidly growing province of Holland during the 17th century was higher than Friesland could supply. Most of the transport was over water, therefore often by track boat. Peat exploitation meant a welcome activity for many villages, although most of the income did not flow into the pockets of the struggling peat cutters. In 1641, farmers in Drachten North and Drachten South entered into an agreement with wealthy residents of The Hague, the &#x27;Drachten Associates&#x27;. One of these moneylenders was businessman Passchier Hendriks Bolleman from The Hague. The agreement stipulated that peat cut in Smallingerland was designated for the Holland industry. For transport by boat the Drachtster Compagnonsvaart canal and two side channels had to be constructed. During one year 800 workers had been digging every day. And where people spent their days, other developments followed, such as dwellings, places for storage, hostels and businesses. Although the economic success of cutting peat was short-lived (it even led to Passchier Bolleman&#x27;s financial ruin), it spurred on to the foundation of Drachten.

The Drachtstervaart brought in ships and the ships brought in not only return freight, but also their own service industry: rope-yards, carpenter&#x27;s yards and forges. In 1746 the first real shipyard was established on the Langewijk, initially only for the construction of timber flatboats, but after 1895 also for iron hull ships. In 1902 a second shipyard followed on the Drachtstervaart.

===Drachten grows===
Along the side of the canal, pubs, shops, shipbuilding facilities, and public utilities, such as a rope-walk, were built. Around 1830, a town hall was built, and a notary public moved from nearby Oudega to Drachten.

The peat industry of Drachten lasted for 200 years. When it ended, the poorer workers stayed behind; some became small farmers, but most of them had no success.

===Accelerated growth===
In the post-war period between 1950 and 1991, Drachten grew by an average of 1,000 inhabitants a year. The arrival of the Philips company was a major contributor to this growth. Today there are approximately 45,000 people living in Drachten; its major industrial production includes electrical goods, transport equipment, machinery, food, chemicals and furniture.

== Geography ==

Drachten is situated in the municipality of Smallingerland in the east of the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. Leeuwarden is to the northwest, Groningen northeast, and Heerenveen southwest.

It is located along the Wijde Ee waterway, which flows into the larger Prinses Margriet Kanaal. It is surrounded by many small towns; its environment consists of lowlands with forests and peat moors, and nearby lakes.

==Culture==
=== Art project &quot;Water is Life&quot;===
In April 2007, artist Henk Hofstra painted a road in Drachten blue with white lettering and traffic markings. The road is called Moleneind. The lettering spells &quot;Water is Leven&quot; (Water is Life), meant to symbolize a prior waterway that was paved over.

The part of this water that was situated in the centre of Drachten was closed in the 1960s, in order to stimulate the local economy and give space to the increased road traffic. Now the centre of the town was no longer reachable by boat.

In 1996 the first plans were made to recreate the water way into the heart of the town so water tourists will come back to Drachten and visit the centre by boat; it is called the &quot;Drachtstervaart&quot; project. The reconstruction of the area started in 2001 and was supposed to last until 2011. Due to the economic crisis, the construction was stopped for about two years.

The construction on the water way continued in 2013, and it has since been completed.

== Infrastructure ==

Drachten is not served by the Dutch railway system but it is situated next to the A7 motorway. Its extensive bus system connects it to Leeuwarden, Groningen, Heerenveen, and other centres.

===Traffic experiment===
Drachten received international attention for a traffic experiment known as shared space, a concept pioneered by Hans Monderman. Almost all traffic lights and signs have been removed in the town&#x27;s centre in an effort to improve traffic safety, based on the theory that drivers pay more attention to their surroundings when they cannot rely on strict traffic rules. Previously the town&#x27;s centre had an average of eight accidents per year. In the first two years after the system was introduced, yearly accidents were reduced to one.

<doc id="140459" wikidata="Q11193" url="?curid=140459" title="Base (chemistry)">
<text>In chemistry, there are three definitions in common use of the word &quot;base&quot;: &quot;Arrhenius bases&quot;, &quot;Brønsted bases&quot;, and &quot;Lewis bases&quot;. All definitions agree that bases are substances that react with acids, as originally proposed by G.-F. Rouelle in the mid-18th century.

In 1884, Svante Arrhenius proposed that a base is a substance which dissociates in aqueous solution to form hydroxide ions OH−. These ions can react with hydrogen ions (H+ according to Arrhenius) from the dissociation of acids to form water in an acid–base reaction. A base was therefore a metal hydroxide such as NaOH or Ca(OH)2. Such aqueous hydroxide solutions were also described by certain characteristic properties. They are slippery to the touch, can taste bitter and change the color of pH indicators (e.g., turn red litmus paper blue).

In water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases yield solutions in which the hydrogen ion activity is lower than it is in pure water, i.e., the water has a pH higher than 7.0 at standard conditions. A soluble base is called an alkali if it contains and releases OH− ions quantitatively. Metal oxides, hydroxides, and especially alkoxides are basic, and conjugate bases of weak acids are weak bases.

Bases and acids are seen as chemical opposites because the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium (H3O+) concentration in water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. A reaction between aqueous solutions of an acid and a base is called neutralization, producing a solution of water and a salt in which the salt separates into its component ions. If the aqueous solution is saturated with a given salt solute, any additional such salt precipitates out of the solution.

In the more general Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory (1923), a base is a substance that can accept hydrogen cations (H+)—otherwise known as protons. This does include aqueous hydroxides since OH− does react with H+ to form water, so that Arrhenius bases are a subset of Brønsted bases. However, there are also other Brønsted bases which accept protons, such as aqueous solutions of ammonia (NH3) or its organic derivatives (amines). These bases do not contain a hydroxide ion but nevertheless react with water, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ion. Also, some non-aqueous solvents contain Brønsted bases which react with solvated protons. For example, in liquid ammonia, NH2− is the basic ion species which accepts protons from NH4+, the acidic species in this solvent.

G. N. Lewis realized that water, ammonia, and other bases can form a bond with a proton due to the unshared pair of electrons that the bases possess. In the Lewis theory, a base is an electron pair donor which can share a pair of electrons with an electron acceptor which is described as a Lewis acid. The Lewis theory is more general than the Brønsted model because the Lewis acid is not necessarily a proton, but can be another molecule (or ion) with a vacant low-lying orbital which can accept a pair of electrons. One notable example is boron trifluoride (BF3).

Some other definitions of both bases and acids have been proposed in the past, but are not commonly used today.

==Properties==
General properties of bases include:

*Concentrated or strong bases are caustic on organic matter and react violently with acidic substances.
*Aqueous solutions or molten bases dissociate in ions and conduct electricity.
*Reactions with indicators: bases turn red litmus paper blue, phenolphthalein pink, keep bromothymol blue in its natural colour of blue, and turn methyl orange-yellow.
*The pH of a basic solution at standard conditions is greater than seven.
*Bases are bitter.

== Reactions between bases and water ==
The following reaction represents the general reaction between a base (B) and water to produce a conjugate acid (BH+) and a conjugate base (OH−):&lt;chem display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;{B}_{(aq)} + {H2O}_{(l)} &lt;=&gt; {BH+}_{(aq)} + {OH- }_{(aq)}&lt;/chem&gt;The equilibrium constant, Kb, for this reaction can be found using the following general equation:

: formula_1

In this equation, the base (B) and the extremely strong base (the conjugate base OH−) compete for the proton. As a result, bases that react with water have relatively small equilibrium constant values. The base is weaker when it has a lower equilibrium constant value.

==Neutralization of acids==

Bases react with acids to neutralize each other at a fast rate both in water and in alcohol. When dissolved in water, the strong base sodium hydroxide ionizes into hydroxide and sodium ions:

:&lt;chem&gt;NaOH -&gt; Na+ + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;

and similarly, in water the acid hydrogen chloride forms hydronium and chloride ions:

:&lt;chem&gt;HCl + H2O -&gt; H3O+ + Cl-&lt;/chem&gt;

When the two solutions are mixed, the and ions combine to form water molecules:

:&lt;chem&gt;H3O+ + OH- -&gt; 2H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

If equal quantities of NaOH and HCl are dissolved, the base and the acid neutralize exactly, leaving only NaCl, effectively table salt, in solution.

Weak bases, such as baking soda or egg white, should be used to neutralize any acid spills. Neutralizing acid spills with strong bases, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, can cause a violent exothermic reaction, and the base itself can cause just as much damage as the original acid spill.

==Alkalinity of non-hydroxides==
Bases are generally compounds that can neutralize an amount of acid. Both sodium carbonate and ammonia are bases, although neither of these substances contains groups. Both compounds accept H+ when dissolved in protic solvents such as water:

:&lt;chem&gt;Na2CO3 + H2O -&gt; 2Na+ + HCO3- + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;NH3 + H2O -&gt; NH4+ + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;

From this, a pH, or acidity, can be calculated for aqueous solutions of bases.

A base is also defined as a molecule that has the ability to accept an electron pair bond by entering another atom&#x27;s valence shell through its possession of one electron pair. There are a limited number of elements that have atoms with the ability to provide a molecule with basic properties. Carbon can act as a base as well as nitrogen and oxygen. Fluorine and sometimes rare gases possess this ability as well. This occurs typically in compounds such as butyl lithium, alkoxides, and metal amides such as sodium amide. Bases of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen without resonance stabilization are usually very strong, or superbases, which cannot exist in a water solution due to the acidity of water. Resonance stabilization, however, enables weaker bases such as carboxylates; for example, sodium acetate is a weak base.

==Strong bases==
A strong base is a basic chemical compound that can remove a proton (H+) from (or &quot;deprotonate&quot;) a molecule of even a very weak acid (such as water) in an acid–base reaction. Common examples of strong bases include hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, like NaOH and , respectively. Due to their low solubility, some bases, such as alkaline earth hydroxides, can be used when the solubility factor is not taken into account.

One advantage of this low solubility is that &quot;many antacids were suspensions of metal hydroxides such as aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide&quot;; compounds with low solubility and the ability to stop an increase in the concentration of the hydroxide ion, preventing the harm of the tissues in the mouth, oesophagus, and stomach. As the reaction continues and the salts dissolve, the stomach acid reacts with the hydroxide produced by the suspensions.

Strong bases hydrolyze in water almost completely, resulting in the leveling effect.&quot; In this process, the water molecule combines with a strong base, due to the water&#x27;s amphoteric ability; and, a hydroxide ion is released. Very strong bases can even deprotonate very weakly acidic C–H groups in the absence of water. Here is a list of several strong bases:

The cations of these strong bases appear in the first and second groups of the periodic table (alkali and earth alkali metals). Tetraalkylated ammonium hydroxides are also strong bases since they dissociate completely in water. Guanidine is a special case of a species that is exceptionally stable when protonated, analogously to the reason that makes perchloric acid and sulfuric acid very strong acids.

Acids with a p&quot;Ka&quot; of more than about 13 are considered very weak, and their conjugate bases are strong bases.

===Superbases===

Group 1 salts of carbanions, amide ions, and hydrides tend to be even stronger bases due to the extreme weakness of their conjugate acids, which are stable hydrocarbons, amines, and dihydrogen. Usually, these bases are created by adding pure alkali metals such as sodium into the conjugate acid. They are called &quot;superbases&quot;, and it is impossible to keep them in aqueous solutions because they are stronger bases than the hydroxide ion (See the leveling effect.) For example, the ethoxide ion (conjugate base of ethanol) undergoes this reaction quantitatively in presence of water.

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3CH2O- + H2O -&gt; CH3CH2OH + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;

Examples of common superbases are:
*Butyl lithium (n-C4H9Li)
*Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) [(CH3)2CH]2NLi 
*Lithium diethylamide (LDEA) 
*Sodium amide (NaNH2)
*Sodium hydride (NaH)
*Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide 

Strongest superbases are synthesised in only gas phase:
*Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion (C6H4(C2)2)2− (the strongest superbase ever synthesized) 
*Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion (C6H4(C2)2)2− (second strongest superbase)
*Para-diethynylbenzene dianion (C6H4(C2)2)2− (third strongest superbase)
*Lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) was considered the strongest superbase before diethynylbenzene dianions were created.

== Weak bases ==

A weak base is one which does not fully ionize in an aqueous solution, or in which protonation is incomplete. For example, ammonia transfers a proton to water according to the equation
:NH3(aq) + H2O(l) → NH(aq) + OH−(aq)
The equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25 °C is 1.8 x 10−5, such that the extent of reaction or degree of ionization is quite small.

== Lewis bases ==
A Lewis base or &quot;electron-pair donor&quot; is a molecule with one or more high-energy lone pairs of electrons which can be shared with a low-energy vacant orbital in an acceptor molecule to form an adduct. In addition to H+, possible &quot;electron-pair acceptors&quot; (Lewis acids) include neutral molecules such as BF3 and high oxidation state metal ions such as Ag2+, Fe3+ and Mn7+. Adducts involving metal ions are usually described as coordination complexes.

According to the original formulation of Lewis, when a neutral base forms a bond with a neutral acid, a condition of electric stress occurs. The acid and the base share the electron pair that formerly belonged to the base. As a result, a high dipole moment is created, which can only be decreased to zero by rearranging the molecules.

== Solid bases ==
Examples of solid bases include:
* Oxide mixtures: SiO2, Al2O3; MgO, SiO2; CaO, SiO2
* Mounted bases: LiCO3 on silica; NR3, NH3, KNH2 on alumina; NaOH, KOH mounted on silica on alumina
* Inorganic chemicals: BaO, KNaCO3, BeO, MgO, CaO, KCN
* Anion exchange resins
*Charcoal that has been treated at 900 degrees Celsius or activates with N2O, NH3, ZnCl2-NH4Cl-CO2

Depending on a solid surface&#x27;s ability to successfully form a conjugate base by absorbing an electrically neutral acid, basic strength of the surface is determined. The &quot;number of basic sites per unit surface area of the solid&quot; is used to express how much basic strength is found on a solid base catalyst. Scientists have developed two methods to measure the amount of basic sites: one, titration with benzoic acid using indicators and gaseous acid adsorption. A solid with enough basic strength will absorb an electrically neutral acidic indicator and cause the acidic indicator&#x27;s color to change to the color of its conjugate base. When performing the gaseous acid adsorption method, nitric oxide is used. The basic sites are then determined by calculating the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed.

==Bases as catalysts==
Basic substances can be used as insoluble heterogeneous catalysts for chemical reactions. Some examples are metal oxides such as magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, and barium oxide as well as potassium fluoride on alumina and some zeolites. Many transition metals make good catalysts, many of which form basic substances. Basic catalysts are used for hydrogenation, the migration of double bonds, in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, the Michael reaction, and many others. Both CaO and BaO can be highly active catalysts if they are heated to high temperatures.

==Uses of bases==
*Sodium hydroxide is used in the manufacture of soap, paper, and the synthetic fiber rayon.
*Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is used in the manufacture of bleaching powder.
*Calcium hydroxide is also used to clean the sulfur dioxide, which is caused by the exhaust, that is found in power plants and factories.
*Magnesium hydroxide is used as an &#x27;antacid&#x27; to neutralize excess acid in the stomach and cure indigestion.
*Sodium carbonate is used as washing soda and for softening hard water.
*Sodium bicarbonate (or sodium hydrogen carbonate) is used as baking soda in cooking food, for making baking powders, as an antacid to cure indigestion and in soda acid fire extinguisher.
*Ammonium hydroxide is used to remove grease stains from clothes

== Monoprotic and polyprotic bases ==
Bases with only one ionizable hydroxide (OH−) ion per formula unit are called monoprotic since they can accept one proton (H+). Bases with more than one OH- per formula unit are polyprotic.

The number of ionizable hydroxide (OH−) ions present in one formula unit of a base is also called the acidity of the base. On the basis of acidity bases can be classified into three types: monoacidic, diacidic and triacidic.

=== Monoacidic bases ===

When one molecule of a base via complete ionization produces one hydroxide ion, the base is said to be a monoacidic or monoprotic base. Examples of monoacidic bases are:

Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, silver hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, etc.

=== Diacidic bases ===
When one molecule of base via complete ionization produces two hydroxide ions, the base is said to be diacidic or diprotic. Examples of diacidic bases are:

Barium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, iron(II) hydroxide, tin(II) hydroxide, lead(II) hydroxide, copper(II) hydroxide, etc.

=== Triacidic bases ===
When one molecule of base via complete ionization produces three hydroxide ions, the base is said to be triacidic or triprotic. Examples of triacidic bases are:

Aluminium hydroxide, ferrous hydroxide, Gold Trihydroxide,

==Etymology of the term==
The concept of base stems from an older alchemical notion of &quot;the matrix&quot;:

<text>The Second Battle of Fort Fisher was a successful assault by the Union Army, Navy and Marine Corps against Fort Fisher, south of Wilmington, North Carolina, near the end of the American Civil War in January 1865. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Gibraltar of the South&quot; and the last major coastal stronghold of the Confederacy, Fort Fisher had tremendous strategic value during the war, providing a port for blockade runners supplying the Army of Northern Virginia.

==Background==

Wilmington was the last major port open to the Confederacy on the Atlantic seacoast. Ships leaving Wilmington via the Cape Fear River and setting sail for the Bahamas, Bermuda or Nova Scotia to trade cotton and tobacco for needed supplies from the British were protected by the fort. Based on the design of the Malakoff redoubt in Sevastopol, Russian Empire, Fort Fisher was constructed mostly of earth and sand. This made it better able to absorb the pounding of heavy fire from Union ships than older fortifications constructed of mortar and bricks. Twenty-two guns faced the ocean, while twenty-five faced the land. The sea face guns were mounted on batteries with larger, batteries at the southern end of the fort. Underground passageways and bombproof rooms existed below the giant earthen mounds of the fort. The fortifications kept Union ships from attacking the port of Wilmington and the Cape Fear River.

On December 23, 1864, Union ships under Rear Admiral David D. Porter commenced a naval bombardment of the fort, to little effect. On December 25, Union troops under Major General Benjamin F. Butler began landing in preparation for a ground assault, but Butler withdrew them upon word of approaching Confederate reinforcements.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
The Union Army returned in January, this time under Major General Alfred Terry. Terry was chosen by Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to lead a provisional corps of 9,000 troops from the Army of the James. Rear Admiral David D. Porter returned with almost 60 vessels of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron to the North Carolina coast after the failed December attempt.

===Confederate===
Confederate Major General W.H.C. Whiting commanded the District of Cape Fear and pleaded with the department commander, General Braxton Bragg to send reinforcements. Bragg was unwilling to reduce his forces, which he felt were necessary to defend Wilmington. He finally sent reinforcements from Hagood&#x27;s brigade to Colonel William Lamb&#x27;s garrison bringing the total at Fort Fisher to 1,900. A division of 6,400 troops under Major General Robert Hoke was stationed on the peninsula north of the fort. Whiting personally arrived at the fort and told the commander: &quot;Lamb my boy, I have come to share your fate. You and your garrison are to be sacrificed.&quot;

==Battle==
Alfred Terry had previously commanded troops during the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor and understood the importance of coordinating with the Union Navy. He and Admiral Porter made well laid out plans for the joint attack. Terry would send one division of United States Colored Troops under Charles J. Paine to hold off Hoke&#x27;s division on the peninsula. Terry&#x27;s other division under Adelbert Ames, supported by an independent brigade under Colonel Joseph Carter Abbott, would move down the peninsula and attack the fort from the land face, striking the landward wall on the river side of the peninsula. Porter organized a landing force of 2,000 sailors and marines to land and attack the fort&#x27;s sea face, on the seaward end of the same wall.
On January 13, Terry landed his troops in between Hoke and Fort Fisher. Hoke was unwilling to risk opening the route to Wilmington and remained unengaged while the entire Union force landed safely ashore. The next day Terry moved south towards the fort to reconnoiter the fort and decided that an infantry assault would succeed.

On January 15, Porter&#x27;s gunboats opened fire on the sea face of the fort and by noon they succeeded in silencing all but four guns. William B. Cushing would later write, &quot;Such a hell of noise I never expect to hear again. Hundreds of shell[s] were in the air at once . . . all shrieking in a grand martial chorus that was a fitting accompaniment to the death dance of the hundreds about to fall.” During this bombardment Hoke sent about 1,000 troops from his line to Fort Fisher, however only about 400 were able to land and make it into the defense while the others were forced to turn back. Around this time the landing party of 1,600 sailors and 400 marines, led by Lieutenant Commander Kidder Breese, landed and moved against the point where the fort&#x27;s land and sea faces met, a feature known as the Northeast Bastion. The Union Army&#x27;s original plan was for the naval force, armed with revolvers and cutlasses, to attack in three waves with the marines providing covering fire, but instead, the assault went forward in a single unorganized mass. This attack led to a remark from J.A. Mowris, a surgeon in the 117th New York Infantry, stating, &quot;Not far in advance towered the frowning Fortress... and, though none saw, all knew, that above, in imperial majesty, sat the Angel of Death.&quot; General Whiting personally led the defense and routed the assault, with heavy casualties in the naval force.

The attack, however, drew Confederate attention away from the river gate, where Ames prepared to launch his attack. At 2:00 p.m. he sent forward his first brigade, under the command of Brevet Brigadier Newton Martin Curtis, as Ames waited with the brigades of Colonels Galusha Pennypacker and Louis Bell. An advance guard from Curtis&#x27;s brigade used axes to cut through the palisades and abatis. Curtis&#x27;s brigade took heavy casualties as it overran the outer works and stormed the first traverse. At this point Ames ordered Pennypacker&#x27;s brigade forward, which he accompanied into the fort. As Ames marched forward, Confederate snipers zeroed in on his party, and cut down a number of his aides from around him. Pennypacker&#x27;s men fought their way through the riverside gate, and Ames ordered a portion of his men to fortify a position within the interior of the fort. Meanwhile, the Confederates turned the cannons in Battery Buchanan at the southern tip of the peninsula and fired on the northern wall as it fell into Union hands. Ames observed that Curtis&#x27;s lead units had become stalled at the fourth traverse, and he ordered forward Bell&#x27;s brigade, but Bell was killed by sharpshooters before ever reaching the fort. Seeing the Union attackers crowd into the breach and interior, Whiting took the opportunity to personally lead a counterattack. Charging into the Union soldiers, Whiting received multiple demands to surrender, and when he refused he was shot down, severely wounded.

Porter&#x27;s gunboats helped maintain the Federal momentum. His gunners&#x27; aim proved to be deadly accurate and began clearing out the defenders as the Union troops approached the sea wall. Curtis&#x27;s troops gained the heavily contested fourth traverse. Lamb began gathering up every last soldier in the fort, including sick and wounded from the hospital, for a last-ditch counterattack. Just as he was about to order a charge, he fell severely wounded and was brought next to Whiting in the fort&#x27;s hospital. Ames made a suggestion for the Union troops to entrench in their current positions. Upon hearing this notion, a frenzied Curtis grabbed a spade and threw it over Confederate trenches and shouted, &quot;Dig Johnnies, for I&#x27;m coming for you.&quot; About an hour into the battle, Curtis fell wounded while going back to confer with Ames. Pennypacker also fell wounded before the battle ended.

The grueling battle lasted for hours, long after dark, as shells plunged in from the sea and Ames struggled with a division that became increasingly disorganized as his regimental leaders and all of his brigade commanders fell dead or wounded. Terry sent forward Abbott&#x27;s brigade to reinforce the attack, then joined Ames in the interior of the fortress. Meanwhile, in Fort Fisher&#x27;s hospital, Lamb turned over command to Major James Reilly, and Whiting sent one last plea to General Bragg to send reinforcements. Still believing the situation in Fort Fisher was under control and tired of Whiting&#x27;s demands, Bragg instead dispatched General Alfred H. Colquitt to relieve Whiting and assume command at Fort Fisher. At 9:30 p.m. Colquitt landed at the southern base of the fort just as Lamb, Whiting and the Confederate wounded were being evacuated to Battery Buchanan.

At this point, the Confederate hold on Fort Fisher was untenable. The seaward batteries had been silenced, almost all of the north wall had been captured, and Ames had fortified a bastion within the interior. Terry, however, had concluded to finish the battle that night. Ames, ordered to maintain the offensive, organized a flanking maneuver, sending some of his men to advance outside the land wall, and come up behind the Confederate defenders of the last traverse. Within a few minutes the Confederate defeat was unmistakable. Colquitt and his staff rushed back to their rowboats just moments before Abbott&#x27;s men seized the wharf. Major Reilly held up a white flag and walked into the Union lines to announce the fort would surrender. Just before 10:00 p.m. Terry rode to Battery Buchanan to receive the official surrender of the fort from Whiting. Bragg consistently denied reports that Fort Fisher had fallen until 1:00 a.m. on the 16th when he wired General Robert E. Lee, &quot;I am mortified at having to report the unexpected capture of Fort Fisher, with most of its garrison, at about 10 o&#x27;clock to-night. Particulars not known.&quot; By this point, several Confederates had escaped to the other side of the river and had reported the fall, or close to fall, of the fort. 

==Aftermath==

The loss of Fort Fisher compromised the safety and usefulness of Wilmington, the Confederacy&#x27;s last remaining sea port. The South was now cut off from global trade. Many of the military supplies which the Army of Northern Virginia depended upon came through Wilmington; there were no remaining seaports near Virginia that the Confederates could use practically. Potential European recognition of the Confederacy was likely already impossible, but now became entirely unrealistic; the fall of Fort Fisher was &quot;the final nail in the Confederate coffin.&quot; A month later, a Union army under General John M. Schofield would move up the Cape Fear River and capture Wilmington.

On January 16, Union celebrations were dampened when the fort&#x27;s magazine exploded, killing and wounding 200 Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners who were sleeping on the roof of the magazine chamber or nearby. U.S. Navy Ensign Alfred Stow Leighton died in the explosion while in charge of a squad trying to recover bodies from the fort parapet. Although several Union soldiers initially thought Confederate prisoners were responsible, an investigation opened by Terry concluded that unknown Union soldiers (possibly drunken Marines) had entered the magazine with torches and ignited the powder.

Lamb survived the battle but spent the next seven years on crutches. Whiting was taken prisoner and died while in Federal captivity. Pennypacker&#x27;s wounds were thought to have been fatal and Terry assured the young man he would receive a brevet promotion (where the person promoted would be authorized to wear the insignia of the new rank, but was paid the wages of his original rank) to brigadier general. Pennypacker did receive a brevet promotion as Terry had promised, but on February 18, 1865, he received a full promotion to brigadier general of volunteers at age 20. He remains the youngest person to have held the rank of general in the U.S. Army (apart from the Marquis de Lafayette). Newton Martin Curtis also received a full promotion to brigadier general, and both he and Pennypacker received the Medal of Honor for their part in the battle. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton made an unexpected visit to Fort Fisher where Terry presented him with the garrison&#x27;s flag.

==Medals of Honor==
During the Battle of Fort Fisher, fifty-one soldiers, sailors and marines received the Medal of Honor for their actions.

<text>Earthquakes are caused by movements within the Earth&#x27;s crust and uppermost mantle. They range from weak events detectable only by seismometers, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history. Below, earthquakes are listed by period, region or country, year, magnitude, cost, fatalities, and number of scientific studies.

== Deadliest earthquakes ==

The following is a summary list of earthquakes with over approximately 100,000 deaths. The 893 Ardabil earthquake probably relates to the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to misreading of the Arabic word for Dvin, &#x27;Dabil&#x27; as &#x27;Ardabil&#x27;. This is regarded as a &#x27;fake earthquake&#x27;.


===Deadliest earthquakes by year since 1929===

==Largest earthquakes by magnitude==


For those which occurred before the development and deployment of seismographs – starting around 1900 – magnitudes are estimated from historical reports of the extent and severity of damage.

===Pre-instrumental earthquakes===


=== Largest earthquake by magnitude each year since 1907 ===
===Largest earthquake by magnitude by country/territory===
* This list is a work in progress. Information is likely to be changed.
* The list refers to current country boundaries rather than those at the date of the earthquake.
* Please note, multiple countries could have the same earthquake listed, such as the 1906 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake being listed for both Ecuador and Colombia.
* Unless otherwise noted, magnitudes are reported on the Moment magnitude scale (Mw).

==Costliest earthquakes==
This is the top ten major earthquakes by the US dollar value of property (public and private) losses directly attributable to the earthquake.

==Most studied earthquakes==
The 50 most studied earthquakes according to the International Seismological Centre (ISC), based on a count of scientific papers (mostly in English) that discuss that earthquake. The &quot;Event #&quot; is linked to the ISC Event Bibliography for that event.

Modified from figure 2, &quot;The most studied events&quot;, at the ISC&#x27;s Overview of the ISC Event Bibliography.

<text>Adelaide Airport is an international, domestic and general aviation airport serving Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. Located approximately 6 km (3.7 mi) west of the Adelaide central business district, Adelaide Airport is the fifth-busiest airport in Australia measured by passengers movements, servicing more than 8.5 million passengers in FY24. It has been operated privately by Adelaide Airport Limited under a long-term lease from the federal government since 29 May 1998.

First established in 1955, a new dual international/domestic terminal was opened in 2005 which has received numerous awards, including being named the world&#x27;s second-best international airport (5–15 million passengers) in 2006. It was named Australia&#x27;s best capital city airport in 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2024, as well as being named Skytrax World Airport Awards&#x27;s best regional airport in the Australia-Pacific region in 2022 and 2024.

The facility covers a total area of 785 hectares (1,940 acres) of airport property.

==History==
An early &quot;Adelaide airport&quot; was an aerodrome constructed in 1921 on of land in Albert Park, now Hendon, which took over from the Northfield Aerodrome. The small facility allowed for a mail service between Adelaide and Sydney. To meet the substantial growth in aviation, Parafield Airport was developed in 1927. The demand on aviation outgrew Parafield and the current site of Adelaide Airport was selected at West Torrens (known as West Beach until 1991) in January 1946. An alternative site at Port Adelaide, including a seaplane facility, was considered inferior and too far from the central business district. Construction began and flights commenced in 1954, with Parafield Airport being turned into a private and military aviation facility.

An annexe to one of the large hangars at the airport served as a passenger terminal until the Commonwealth Government provided funds for the construction of a temporary building.
In May 1998, Adelaide Airport Limited purchased the long-term leases of Adelaide Airport and Parafield Airport from the Government of Australia. The consortium comprised Manchester Airport, Serco, UniSuper and Macquarie Bank. As at December 2023, the shareholders of Adelaide Airport Limited were UniSuper (51%), Hostplus (15%), IFM Investors (15%), Igneo Infrastructure Partners (15%) and Perron Group (4%).

In July 1998, the runway was extended by 570 metres to 3.1 kilometres. In October 2005 a dual-use facility replaced both the original domestic and international terminals. The old domestic terminal was closed shortly after the new terminal was opened to flights and was demolished not long after. A new control tower was built west of the current terminal with the old control tower maintained for additional operations.

In October 2006, the new terminal was named the Capital City Airport of the Year at the Australian Aviation Industry Awards in Cairns. In March 2007, Adelaide Airport was rated the world&#x27;s second-best airport in the 5–15 million passengers category at the Airports Council International (ACI) 2006 awards in Dubai.

Plans were announced for an expansion of the terminal in July 2007, including more aerobridges and demolition of the old International Terminal.

On 5 August 2008 Tiger Airways Australia confirmed that Adelaide Airport would become the airline&#x27;s second hub which would base two of the airline&#x27;s Airbus A320s by early 2009. On 29 October 2009 Tiger announced it would be housing its third A320 at Adelaide Airport from early 2010. Tiger Airways later shut down its operations from Adelaide only to recommence them in 2013.

In 2011 the airport encountered major problems during the eruption of Puyehue volcano in Chile. The ash cloud caused flights to be cancelled nationwide, with over 40,000 passengers stranded in Adelaide.

On 11 October 2022, it was discovered that at around 10am local time, security screening equipment had failed half an hour earlier, leading to the evacuation of the terminal and re-screening of approximately 2,000 passengers.

In 2023, Jetstar based two of their Airbus A321LR at Adelaide.

===International===

International services became regular from 1982 upon the construction of an international terminal, with airlines such as British Airways serving Adelaide Airport in its early years.

The original international terminal had only two aircraft bays and a single jetbridge, with limited space for passengers. Check-in desks were small and waiting space was limited. It was replaced in 2005, and demolished in 2018 to make way for expanded landside facilities and a future expansion of the main terminal.

On 18 December 2018, Singapore Airlines upgraded their Singapore to Adelaide flight from the Airbus A330-300 to the new Airbus A350-900 fitted with their dual-class regional configuration.

Fiji Airways also upgraded their new Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft on the Nadi to Adelaide route, but due to the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft, switched to the Boeing 737-800.

In late 2018 and early 2019, China Southern, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines increased their services to Adelaide Airport to accommodate the increase in demand.

The airport is also a heavy cargo destination for Volga-Dnepr Airlines, who require of runway for the Antonov cargo plane.

Over the financial year 2018–2019, Adelaide Airport experienced passenger growth of 7% internationally and 1.3% for domestic and regional passengers from 2017&#x27;s quarterly report; this added up to a new record number of passengers who passed through Adelaide Airport at 8,090,000 over the financial year. Adelaide Airport also experienced the greatest international growth out of any Australian port.

In July 2020, Emirates, China Southern and Cathay Pacific announced their suspension of services to Adelaide Airport due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emirates announced they would return to Adelaide on 28 October 2024.

In December 2021, Qantas launched a direct non-stop service from Adelaide to New Delhi, mainly as a stopover for flights to Sydney and Melbourne due to a shortage of Boeing 787 aircraft at the time. This was the first time Qantas had flown a non-stop international flight from Adelaide since the discontinuation of their Singapore to Adelaide route in 2013.

In October 2023, Adelaide Airport released its 2050 Network Vision, in which the airport hopes to have direct flight connection to 39 global cities, with some notable destinations including Los Angeles and Johannesburg, as well as the return of London among others. 
In order to achieve this the airport is planning a significant expansion of its current facilities to cater for more international flights.

On 28 October 2024, it was reported that Emirates had resumed their popular non-stop route between Dubai and Adelaide. Additionally, China Southern Airlines also resumed their direct route between Guangzhou and Adelaide. Both routes were initially launched in 2012 and 2016 respectively, but were ceased in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Present terminal building==
The airport was redeveloped at a cost of $260 million and opened 8 October 2005. The redevelopment was managed by builders Hansen Yuncken. Before the redevelopment, the old airport terminal was criticised for its limited capacity and lack of aerobridges.

Proposals were developed for an upgraded terminal of world standard. The final proposal, released in 1997, called for a large, unified terminal in which both domestic and international flights would use the same terminal. A combination of factors, the most notable of which was the collapse of Ansett Australia, then a duopoly domestic carrier with Qantas, and the resultant loss of funds for its share of the construction cost, saw the new terminal plans shelved until an agreement was reached in 2002. 

The new terminal was opened on 7 October 2005 by the Prime Minister John Howard and South Australian Premier Mike Rann. However, Adelaide Airport Limited announced soon afterwards that only international flights would use the new facility immediately due to problems with the fuel pumps and underground pipes. These problems related initially to the anti-rusting agent applied to the insides of the fuel pumps, then to construction debris in the pipes. Although international and regional (from December 2005) aircraft were refuelled via tankers, a lack of space and safety concerns prevented this action for domestic jet aircraft, which instead continued operations at the old terminal. The re-fueling system was cleared of all debris and the new terminal was used for all flights from 17 February 2006. The new airport terminal is approximately end to end and is capable of handling 27 aircraft, including an Airbus A380, simultaneously and processing 3,000 passengers per hour.

The current mixed use terminal includes several high-amenity airline lounges over two levels. Level one includes the Plaza Premium international lounge adjacent to the international security check-in, exclusively for international passengers. On level two, Virgin Australia and Rex Airlines operate lounges for domestic passengers. Qantas operate their signature &#x27;Qantas Club&#x27; lounge complex opposite gate 21 in the main terminal departure lounge. It is open to domestic and international business class qantas passengers and qantas club membership holders, as well as business class passengers of partnered Oneworld alliance member airlines. As of 13 June 2024, a multi-million dollar refurbishment of the lounge complex is underway and capacity is restricted. As announced by Qantas in 2022, the new lounge complex will emerge as the &#x27;Qantas Lounge Precinct&#x27;, with the addition of a separate &#x27;Qantas Business Lounge&#x27;, along with the fully refurbished &#x27;Qantas Club&#x27; and &#x27;Qantas Chairmans Lounge&#x27; which will open in stages from late 2024. The &#x27;Qantas Business Lounge&#x27; will welcome its first passengers in mid-2025. The terminal check-in hall provides 42 common user check-in desks and 34 shop fronts. Free wireless Internet is also provided throughout the terminal by Internode Systems, a first for an Australian airport.

==Vickers Vimy museum==

In 1919, the Australian government offered £10,000 for the first All-Australian crew to fly an aeroplane from England to Australia. Keith Macpherson Smith, Ross Macpherson Smith and mechanics Jim Bennett and Wally Shiers completed the journey from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome to Darwin via Singapore and Batavia on 10 December 1919. Their Vickers Vimy aircraft, affectionately known as &quot;God &#x27;Elp All Of Us&quot;, is preserved in a purpose-built climate-controlled museum inside the grounds of the airport at . Due to relocation of the terminal buildings, the museum is now situated inside the long-term car park. In 2019, the state and federal government committed $2 million each towards a new preservation facility inside the airport&#x27;s $165 million terminal expansion.

==Recent developments==
In February 2011, a A$100 million building program was launched as part of a five-year master plan, including a new road network within the airport, a multi-storey car park, increasing short-term parking spaces from 800 to 1,650 (completed August 2012); a new plaza frontage for the passenger terminal (completed March 2013); a walkway bridge connecting new car park and existing terminal building (completed March 2013); terminal concourse extension; three new aerobridges; terminal commercial projects and passenger facilities; relocation of regional carrier Rex.

In July 2013, Adelaide Airport became the first Australian airport and second airport worldwide to have Google Street View technology, allowing passengers to explore the arrival and departure sections of the airport before travel.

A new control tower, at high, more than twice the height of the old tower built in 1983 and costing , was completed and commissioned in August 2013.

In January 2015, the &quot;Adelaide Airport Master Plan 2014&quot; was approved by the Commonwealth Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development.

In September 2016, a relocation and major upgrade was completed for the base of the central service region of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The base houses many Pilatus PC-12 and one Pilatus PC-24, maintenance hangars and ambulance bays.

The Atura Hotel ( tall, nine levels) was completed in September 2018.

In late 2018 and early 2019, Adelaide Airport commenced a $165 million terminal expansion project, increasing the length of the terminal, adding more duty-free and shopping outlets, and increasing international capacity. The upgrades are set to be completed by 2021. The old international terminal was also demolished in 2019, after lying empty for many years.

In early 2020, Adelaide Airport opened a newly updated concourse which was finished in December 2019, New Shops include Penfolds Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen, Precinct Adelaide Kitchen, Soul Origin, Boost Juice, Lego Kaboom and Airport Pharmacy. In October 2023 it was announced that the Penfolds Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen would close and be replaced with the ADL Grounds Bar.

===Lucerne to cool runways===
A world-first project that lowers runway temperatures by growing commercial crops irrigated by recycled water was trialled at Adelaide Airport, with the first trial completed in 2019. By planting of various crops and testing the effects of each on runway temperature, SA Water scientists found that lucerne was most successful, leading to a reduction of an average 3 °C in average ambient air temperatures on warm days, in and around the irrigation areas. Not only was the lucerne the best performer compared with tall fescue, couch grass and kikuyu, but it can also be cut into hay and sold as stock feed. The plant growth habit of lucerne also lends itself to deter birds, with research suggesting &quot;if you have a nice thick crop of lucerne over the top of the soil [the birds] can&#x27;t actually get to the soil and the movement of the crop in the wind also spooks them.&quot; Preliminary trial results suggest that lucerne treatments saw no increase in bird species. The Airport is creating a business case to extend the project to cover of airport land.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

Qantas formerly operated dedicated &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; services over Antarctica from Adelaide. These flights, which originally used a Boeing 747-400, then a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, departed Adelaide from the international/domestic terminal, and provided a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights were about thirteen hours in total.
