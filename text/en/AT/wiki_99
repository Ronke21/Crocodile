<text>The Supremes were an American girl group formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959 as the Primettes. A premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown&#x27;s acts and the most successful American vocal band, with 12 number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. Their breakthrough is considered to have made it possible for future African-American R&amp;B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the Supremes as the 16th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time.

Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, the original members, were all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit. Forming as the Primettes, they were the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the group in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson continued as a trio.

During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and Holland–Dozier–Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. In 1970, Ross left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Jean Terrell, and the group&#x27;s name was reverted to the Supremes. During the mid-1970s, the lineup continued to change with Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene joining until the group, 18 years after its formation, disbanded in 1977.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

In Detroit in 1958, Florence Ballard, a junior high school student living in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, met Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who were two members of a Detroit singing group known as the Primes. Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams&#x27; girlfriend Betty McGlown, so Milton Jenkins, the Primes&#x27;s manager, decided to create a sister group to be called the Primettes. Ballard recruited her best friend Mary Wilson, and then Paul Williams recruited Diana Ross. Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs of artists such as Ray Charles and the Drifters at sock hops, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area. Receiving additional guidance from group friend and established songwriter Jesse Greer, the quartet quickly earned a local fan following. The group crafted an age-appropriate style that was inspired by the collegiate dress of popular doo-wop group Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers. For the most part, Ballard, Ross and Wilson performed equal leads on songs. Within a few months, guitarist Marvin Tarplin was added to the Primettes&#x27; lineup—a move that helped distinguish the group from Detroit&#x27;s many other aspiring acts by allowing them to sing live instead of lip-synching.

After winning the Windsor–Detroit International Freedom Festival on July 4, 1960, the Primettes&#x27; sights were set on making a record. In hopes of getting the group signed to the local upstart Motown label, in 1960 Ross asked an old neighbor, Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, to help the group land an audition for Motown executive Berry Gordy, who had already proven himself a capable songwriter. Robinson liked &quot;the girls&quot; (as they were then known around Motown) and agreed to help, but he liked their guitarist even more; with the Primettes&#x27; permission he hired Tarplin, who became the guitarist for the Miracles. Robinson arranged for the Primettes to audition &quot;a cappella&quot; for Gordy—but Gordy, feeling they were too young and inexperienced to be recording artists, encouraged them to return when they had graduated from high school. Undaunted, later that year the Primettes recorded a single for Lu Pine Records, a label created just for them, titled &quot;Tears of Sorrow&quot;, which was backed with &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;. The single failed to find an audience, however. Shortly thereafter, McGlown became engaged and left the group. Barbara Martin was McGlown&#x27;s prompt replacement.

Determined to leave an impression on Gordy and join the stable of rising Motown stars, the Primettes frequented his Hitsville U.S.A. recording studio. Eventually, they convinced Gordy to allow them to contribute hand claps and background vocals for the songs of other Motown artists including Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells. In January 1961, Gordy finally relented and agreed to sign them to his label – but under the condition that they change the name of their group. The Primes had by this time combined with Otis Williams &amp; the Distants and would soon sign to Motown as the Temptations. Gordy gave Ballard a list of names to choose from that included suggestions such as &quot;the Darleens&quot;, &quot;the Sweet Ps&quot;, &quot;the Melodees&quot;, &quot;the Royaltones&quot; and &quot;the Jewelettes&quot;. Ballard chose another suggestion, &quot;the Supremes&quot;. In the spring of 1962, Martin left the group to start a family. Thus, the newly named Supremes continued as a trio.

Between 1961 and 1963, the Supremes released six singles, starting with &quot;I Want a Guy&quot; and &quot;Buttered Popcorn&quot; on Motown subsidiary label Tamla. However, none of those first six singles charted in the Top 40 positions of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Jokingly referred to as the &quot;no-hit Supremes&quot; around Motown&#x27;s Hitsville U.S.A. offices, the group attempted to compensate for their lack of hits by taking on any work available at the studio, including providing hand claps and singing backup for Motown artists such as Marvin Gaye and the Temptations. During these years, all three members took turns singing lead: Wilson favored soft ballads, Ballard favored soulful, hard-driving songs, and Ross favored mainstream pop songs. Most of their early material was written and produced by Berry Gordy or Smokey Robinson. In December 1963, the single &quot;When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot; peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Lovelight&quot; was the first of many Supremes songs written by the Motown songwriting and production team known as Holland–Dozier–Holland. In late 1963, Berry Gordy chose Diane Ross — who began going by &quot;Diana&quot; in 1965—as the official lead singer of the group. Ballard and Wilson were periodically given solos on Supremes albums, and Ballard continued to sing her solo number, &quot;People&quot;, in concert for the next two years.

In the spring of 1964, the Supremes recorded the single &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;. The song was originally intended by Holland-Dozier-Holland for the Marvelettes, who rejected it. Although the Supremes disliked the song, the producers coerced them into recording it. In August 1964, while the Supremes toured as part of Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Caravan of Stars&quot;, &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; reached number one on the US pop charts, much to the surprise and delight of the group. It was also their first song to appear on the UK singles chart, where it reached number three.

&quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; was followed by four consecutive US number-one hits: &quot;Baby Love&quot; (which was also a number-one hit in the UK), &quot;Come See About Me&quot;, &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;Back in My Arms Again&quot;. &quot;Baby Love&quot; was nominated for the 1965 Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song.

In January 1965, each group member received a check for $100,000 in earnings from the previous year. They all used part of this money to purchase a new home for their families together on the same street, allowing them to leave the projects.

=== Impact ===

The Supremes deliberately embraced a more glamorous image than previous black performers. Much of this was accomplished at the behest of Motown chief Berry Gordy and Maxine Powell, who ran Motown&#x27;s in-house finishing school and Artist Development department. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Ross sang in a thin, calm voice, and her vocal styling was matched by having all three women embellish their femininity instead of imitating the qualities of male groups. Eschewing plain appearances and basic dance routines, the Supremes appeared onstage in detailed make-up and high-fashion gowns and wigs, and performed graceful choreography created by Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins. Powell told the group to &quot;be prepared to perform before kings and queens.&quot; Gordy wanted the Supremes, like all of his performers, to be equally appealing to black and white audiences.

Publications such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; commented on the Supremes&#x27; polished presentation. In a May 1965 profile of rock music, &quot;Time&quot; called the Supremes &quot;the reigning female rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group&quot; and said that Ross &quot;is greatly envied for the torchy, come-hither purr in her voice.&quot; Arnold S. Hirsch of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; said about the Supremes: &quot;they don&#x27;t scream or wail incoherently. An adult can understand nine out of every 10 words they sing. And, most astounding, melody can be clearly detected in every song.&quot; &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; commented that the Supremes&#x27; hit singles &quot;sounded modern, upwardly mobile, and stylishly sensual in a way that appealed equally to adults and teens of all persuasions.&quot;

By 1965, the Supremes were international stars. They toured the world, becoming almost as popular abroad as they were in the US. Almost immediately after their initial number-one hits, they recorded songs for motion picture soundtracks, appeared in the 1965 film &quot;Beach Ball&quot;, and endorsed dozens of products, at one point having their own brand of bread. By the end of 1966, their number-one hits included &quot;I Hear a Symphony&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; and &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;. That year the group also released &quot;The Supremes A&#x27; Go-Go&quot;, which on October 22 became the first album by an all-female group to reach number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, knocking the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; out of the top spot.
Because the Supremes were popular with white audiences as well as with black ones, Gordy had the group perform at renowned supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes became one of the first black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black rock-and-roll musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes&#x27; success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross&#x27;s pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock-and-roll songs underpinned by R&amp;B stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;The Della Reese Show&quot;, and, most notably, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, on which they made 17 appearances. In 2003, Fred Bronson wrote that in 1959, when the Supremes formed as the Primettes, &quot;no one could have predicted they would become the most successful American singing group of all time.&quot;

=== Changes ===
Problems within the group and within Motown Records&#x27; stable of performers led to tension among the members of the Supremes. Many of the other Motown performers felt that Berry Gordy was lavishing too much attention upon the group and upon Ross, in particular. In early 1967, the name of the act was officially changed briefly to &quot;the Supremes with Diana Ross&quot; before changing again to &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot; by mid-summer. The Miracles had become &quot;Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles&quot; two years prior. The fall of 1967 saw Martha &amp; the Vandellas become &quot;Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas&quot;. Having learned that Ross would receive top billing, David Ruffin lobbied, unsuccessfully, to have the Temptations renamed as &quot;David Ruffin &amp; the Temptations&quot;, although Gordy maintained that because they would be providing two acts, a lead singer and a group, Motown could demand more money for live bookings.

The Supremes&#x27; name change fueled already present rumors of a solo career for Ross and contributed to the professional and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with Barbara Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years.

As Ross became the focal point of the Supremes, Ballard suffered from depression and began to drink excessively, gaining weight until she could no longer comfortably wear many of her stage outfits. During this turbulent period, Ballard relied heavily upon the advice of group mate Mary Wilson, with whom she had maintained a close friendship. Wilson, while outwardly demure and neutral in hopes of keeping the group stable, privately advised Ballard that Ross and Gordy were eager to oust Ballard.

By 1967, Ballard would not show up for recording dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow (a member of the Motown backup group The Andantes). Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once it was decided to take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle &amp; the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard&#x27;s replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.

Birdsong first appeared with the Supremes in Ballard&#x27;s place at a benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group&#x27;s lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy was able to buy out Birdsong&#x27;s contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.

On June 29, 1967, the group returned to the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas as &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;. The first two days of the Flamingo engagement went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.

Ballard&#x27;s release from Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she received a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, and was forced to formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard&#x27;s two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7 million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976, from an cardiac arrest caused by a coronary thrombosis at the age of 32.

=== Ross&#x27;s departure ===
Holland–Dozier–Holland left Motown in early 1968 after a dispute with the label over royalties and profit sharing. From &quot;Reflections&quot; in 1967 to &quot;The Weight&quot; in 1969, only six out of the eleven released singles reached the Top 20; 1968&#x27;s &quot;Love Child&quot; made it to number one. Due to the tension within the group and stringent touring schedules, neither Mary Wilson nor Cindy Birdsong appear on many of these singles; they were replaced on these recordings by session singers such as the Andantes. The changes within the group and their decreasing sales were signs of changes within the music industry. The gospel-based soul of female performers such as Aretha Franklin had eclipsed the Supremes&#x27; pop-based sound, which had by now evolved to include more middle-of-the-road material. In a cultural climate now influenced more than ever by countercultural movements such as the Black Panther Party, the Supremes found themselves attacked for not being &quot;black enough&quot;, and lost ground in the black music market.

In mid-1968, Motown initiated a number of high-profile collaborations for the Supremes with their old colleagues, the Temptations. Besides the fact that both groups had come up together, the pairings made financial sense: the Supremes had a mostly white fanbase, while the Temptations a mostly black fanbase. By 1969, the label began plans for a Diana Ross solo career. A number of candidates—most notably Syreeta Wright—were considered to replace Ross. After seeing 24-year-old Jean Terrell perform with her brother Ernie in Florida, Berry Gordy decided on Ross&#x27; replacement. Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night. At the same time, Ross began to make her first solo recordings. On November 2, 1969, Ross&#x27;s solo career was first reported by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

&quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; was recorded with the intent of releasing it as the first solo single for Diana Ross. Desiring a final Supremes number-one record, Gordy instead had the song released as a Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes single, despite the fact that neither Wilson nor Birdsong sang on the record. &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; hit number one on the American pop charts, becoming not only the Supremes&#x27; 12th and final number-one hit, but also the final number-one hit of the 1960s. This single also would mark the Supremes&#x27; final television appearance together with Ross, performing on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on December 21, 1969.

=== The Supremes in the 1970s ===

Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes gave their final performance on January 14, 1970, at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. A live recording of the performance was released later that year in a double-LP box set titled &quot;Farewell&quot;. At the final performance, the replacement for Diana Ross, Jean Terrell, was introduced. According to Mary Wilson, after this performance, Berry Gordy wanted to replace Terrell with Syreeta Wright. Wilson refused, leading to Gordy stating that he was washing his hands of the group thereafter. After the Frontier Hotel performance, Ross officially began her career as a solo performer. Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong continued working with Jean Terrell on the first post-Ross Supremes album, &quot;Right On&quot;.

The Terrell-led Supremes—now rebranded as &quot;the Supremes;&quot; known unofficially at first as &quot;the New Supremes&quot;, and in later years informally called &quot;The &#x27;70s Supremes&quot;—scored hits including &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot; (US number 10, UK number 6), &quot;Stoned Love&quot; (US number 7, UK number 3) and &quot;Nathan Jones&quot; (US number 16, UK number 5), all of which were produced by Frank Wilson. These three singles were also R&amp;B Top Ten hits, with &quot;Stoned Love&quot; becoming their last No.1 R&amp;B hit in December 1970. Songwriting/production team Nickolas Ashford &amp; Valerie Simpson produced another Top 20 hit for the group, a Supremes/Four Tops duet version of Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;.

In 1972, the Supremes had their last Top 20 hit single release, &quot;Floy Joy&quot;, written and produced by Smokey Robinson, followed by the final US Top 40 hit for the Jean Terrell-led version of the group, &quot;Automatically Sunshine&quot; (US number 37, UK number 10). &quot;Automatically Sunshine&quot; later became the group&#x27;s final top 10 single in the UK. On both &quot;Floy Joy&quot; and &quot;Sunshine&quot; Terrell shared lead with Mary Wilson. Motown, by then moving from Detroit to Los Angeles to break into motion pictures, put only limited effort into promoting the Supremes&#x27; new material, and their popularity and sales began to wane. Cindy Birdsong left the group in April 1972, after recording the &quot;Floy Joy&quot; album, to start a family; her replacement was Lynda Laurence, a former member of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s backup group, Third Generation (a predecessor to Wonderlove). Jimmy Webb was hired to produce the group&#x27;s next LP, &quot;The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb&quot;, but the album and its only single &quot;I Guess I&#x27;ll Miss the Man&quot; failed to make an impact on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart, with the single peaking at number 85 on November 24, 1972.

In early 1973, the Stevie Wonder-produced &quot;Bad Weather&quot; peaked at number 87 on the US pop charts and number 37 in the UK. Laurence left to start a family, so Cindy Birdsong returned to the group.

Dismayed by this poor-performing record and the lack of promotional support from Motown, Jean Terrell left the group and was replaced by Scherrie Payne, the sister of Invictus Records recording artist Freda Payne. The group&#x27;s strained relationship with Motown continued; Birdsong told journalist Peter McDonald in 1974 that &#x27;we&#x27;ve had problems with Motown... at this point if a better opportunity with another company comes along we&#x27;ll seriously consider it.&#x27;

Between the 1973 departures of Laurence and Terrell and the first Supremes single with Scherrie Payne, &quot;He&#x27;s My Man&quot;, a disco single on which Payne and Wilson shared lead vocal, Motown was slow in producing contracts for Payne and the returning Birdsong. Before the release of the album in 1975, the Supremes remained a popular live act, and continued touring overseas, particularly in the UK and Japan. The group&#x27;s new recordings were not as successful as their earlier releases, although &quot;He&#x27;s My Man&quot; from the album &quot;The Supremes&quot; was a popular disco hit in 1975. In 1976, Birdsong left again and was replaced by Susaye Greene, another former member of Wonderlove.

This final version of the Supremes released two albums, both of which reunited the Supremes with Holland-Dozier-Holland: &quot;High Energy&quot;, which includes Birdsong on all of the tracks, and &quot;Mary, Scherrie &amp; Susaye&quot;. In 1976, the Supremes released &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking&quot;, their final Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On June 12, 1977, the Supremes performed their farewell concert at the Drury Lane Theater in London as Wilson made her exit for a solo career, with Payne and Greene selecting Joyce Vincent to round out the trio as a new third member. Instead, Motown decided that without any original members, the Supremes would be disbanded.

== Legacy ==

=== Works inspired by the Supremes ===
Several fictional works have been published and produced that are based in part on the career of the group. The 1976 film &quot;Sparkle&quot; features the story of a Supremes-like singing trio called &quot;Sister &amp; the Sisters&quot; from Harlem, New York. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Curtis Mayfield, and the soundtrack album by Aretha Franklin was a commercial success. A remake of &quot;Sparkle&quot; was in development in the early 2000s with R&amp;B singer Aaliyah as the lead, but the project was shelved when Aaliyah died in 2001. The &quot;Sparkle&quot; remake was eventually released in August 2012 and starred Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston, in her final film role.

On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; opened at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based on the history of the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the characters in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes&#x27; and Motown&#x27;s music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R&amp;B/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.

=== Awards and followers ===
The Supremes were twice nominated for a Grammy Award—for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Recording (&quot;Baby Love&quot;, 1965) and Best Contemporary Rock &amp; Roll Group Vocal Performance (&quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot;, 1966)—but never won an award in competition. Three of their songs were added to the Grammy Hall of Fame: &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; and &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; (both 1999) and &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; (2001). The group (Ross, Wilson and Ballard) was named as one of eight recipients to receive a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023.

&quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Ross-Wilson-Ballard lineup was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994, and entered into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the group at number 97 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. The Supremes are notable for the influences they have had on black girl groups who have succeeded them in popular music, such as The Three Degrees, The Emotions, The Pointer Sisters, En Vogue, TLC, Destiny&#x27;s Child and Cleopatra. &quot;The Beatles were there,&quot; said Madonna of her childhood, &quot;but I was more eager about The Supremes. I was really into girl groups.&quot;

=== Reunions ===
Fan interest made the idea of a Supremes reunion tour a very profitable one during the 1980s. In 1982, around the time that Motown reunited all of the Temptations, it was rumored that Motown would reunite the Supremes. The 1974 line-up of the Supremes (Wilson, Birdsong and Payne) was considered for this reunion, which was to include new recordings and a tour. Under advisement from Berry Gordy, Wilson declined to reunite, and the idea was scrapped. Ross briefly reunited with Wilson and Birdsong to perform &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot; on the &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot; television special, taped on March 25, 1983, and broadcast on NBC on May 16, 1983.

In 2000, plans were made for Ross to join Wilson and Birdsong for a planned &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes: Return to Love&quot; reunion tour. However, Wilson passed on the idea, because while the promoters offered Ross $15 million to perform, Wilson was offered $4 million and Birdsong less than $1 million. Ross herself offered to double the amounts both Wilson and Birdsong had originally been offered, but while Birdsong accepted, Wilson remained adamant, and as a result the deal fell through with both former Supremes. Eventually, the &quot;Return to Love&quot; tour went on as scheduled, but with Payne and Laurence joining Ross, although none of the three had ever been in the group at the same time and neither Payne nor Laurence had sung on any of the original hit recordings that they were now singing live. Susaye Greene was also considered for this tour, but refused to audition for it. The music critics cried foul and many fans were disappointed by both this and the shows&#x27; high ticket prices. Though the tour did well in larger markets including near capacity at the opening night in Philadelphia and a sellout at Madison Square Garden in New York, it under performed in smaller/medium markets. The tour was canceled after playing only half of the dates on itinerary.

With the death of Florence Ballard in 1976 and the death of Mary Wilson on February 8, 2021, there is no longer any possible reunion of the original classic lineup.

=== Post-Supremes groups ===
In 1986, Jean Terrell, Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence began to perform as the Former Ladies of the Supremes, or FLOS. When Terrell quit in 1992, Sundray Tucker, Laurence&#x27;s sister, stepped in for a short time, but was replaced by Freddi Poole in 1996. More recently in September 2009, Poole was replaced by Joyce Vincent, formerly of Tony Orlando and Dawn. In 2017, Laurence left and was replaced by Greene.

In 1977, last original and founding member Mary Wilson decided to disband The Supremes and forge a solo career. Wilson hired Kaaren Ragland, Karen Jackson, and Debbie Sharpe, to perform as background singers during concert tours in the United Kingdom, Europe, South East Asia, and Australia. They performed with Wilson from 1978 through the mid-1980s, aiding her in fulfilling contractual obligations related to The Supremes and avoiding potential legal action from Motown, as Wilson detailed in her 1990 book.

In 1989, Kaaren Ragland founded a group known as The Sounds of the Supremes. Ragland asserts her affiliation with the Supremes based on her performances alongside Mary Wilson. However, she was never signed by Motown, her performances with Wilson occurred after the Supremes&#x27; disbandment in 1977, and she is not recognized as an official member of the Supremes.

In 1996, Mary Wilson sued former group mates Kaaren Ragland, Hollis Paysuer, Scherrie Payne, Lynda Laurence, and their managers for trademark infringement of the Supremes name. In 1999, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Wilson, stating that Motown owns the name and had allowed Former Ladies of the Supremes and Sounds of the Supremes to use the name.

<text>St Ives is a medieval market town and civil parish in the Huntingdonshire district in Cambridgeshire, England, east of Huntingdon and north-west of Cambridge. St Ives is historically in the county of Huntingdonshire.

==History==
The township was originally known as Slepe in Anglo Saxon England. In 1001–1002, a peasant is recorded as uncovering the remains of Ivo of Ramsey, a Cornish Celtic Christian Bishop and hermit while ploughing a field. The discovery led Eadnoth the Younger, an important monk and prelate to found Ramsey Abbey. Slepe was listed in the Hundred of Hurstingstone in Huntingdonshire in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there was one manor and 64 households, 29. 5 ploughlands, of meadows and of woodland.

The importance of Ramsey Abbey grew through the Middle Ages. In the order of precedence for abbots in Parliament, Ramsey was third after Glastonbury and St Alban&#x27;s. Its influence benefited the area as Slepe became St Ives and was granted a charter to become a market town, hosting one of the biggest in the country. The market town still remains an important market on the edge of The Fens to this day.

As St Ives was founded on the banks of the wide River Great Ouse between Huntingdon and Ely, it had become an important entrepôt for trade in East Anglia. The size and prosperity of the medieval town can be still seen in its street plan. In the early 15th century, St Ives Bridge was constructed across the Great Ouse replacing an earlier crossing at this point. The six-arch stone bridge was one of only four town bridges in England to have a chapel. In the Early Medieval period, this had been a strategic location on the Great Ouse because it was the last natural crossing point or ford on the river, from the sea. A flint reef in the riverbed created a ford; it was reused as the foundations for the stone bridge. Throughout the medieval period, it was a source of income for the town as tolls had to be paid by all those wanting to cross, this especially applied to drovers bringing their livestock to market.

From the 17th to the mid 19th century, St Ives remained a hub for trade and navigation in this part of East Anglia. There were inns and bawdy houses to cater for the merchants, mariners and drovers who did business in the town. Goods were brought into the town on barges and livestock rested on the last fattening grounds before being sent to London&#x27;s Smithfield Market. However, with the arrival of Cambridge and St Ives branch line in the 1840s and improvements to the local road networks, commercial traffic on the River Great Ouse went into steady decline.

The river Great Ouse at St Ives flooded in 1947, and some parts suffered seriously again at Easter 1998 and in January 2003. Extensive flood protection works were carried out on both sides of the river in 2006-07 at a cost of nearly £9 million. of brick-clad steel-piling was put into place to protect the town, most noticeably at the Waits, where a plaza has also been created. A further on the other side of the river protects Hemingford Grey, reducing the yearly risk of flooding from 10% to 1%. Building on the flood plain at St Ives is now discouraged.

Original historical documents relating to St Ives, including the original parish church registers, local government records, maps and photographs, are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Huntingdon.

==Governance==

As a civil parish, St Ives has a town council, based at St Ives Town Hall, consisting of seventeen councillors including a Town Mayor and a deputy Town Mayor. The second tier of local government is Huntingdonshire District Council, a non-metropolitan district of Cambridgeshire. St Ives has three district wards for the district council; &quot;St Ives East&quot;, &quot;St Ives South&quot;, and &quot;St Ives West&quot;. &quot;St Ives East&quot; and &quot;St Ives South&quot; are both represented by two district councillors, and &quot;St Ives West&quot; is represented on the district council by one councillor. For St Ives the highest tier of local government is Cambridgeshire County Council. St Ives is part of the electoral division of &quot;St Ives&quot; and is represented on the county council by two councillors.

St Ives was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, St Ives became a part of the county of Cambridgeshire.

At Westminster St Ives is in the parliamentary constituency of Huntingdon, and since 2024 has been represented in the House of Commons by Ben Obese-Jecty (Conservative).

==Geography==

St Ives was the subject of town planning at a very early date, giving it a spacious town centre. Portions of the open space between Merryland and Crown Street were lost to market stalls that turned into permanent buildings. Some of the shops in the town centre are still in the same layout as in medieval times, one rod in width, the standard length for floor and roof joists. The lanes along the north side of town are believed to follow the layout of the narrow medieval fields, and are slightly S-shaped because of the way ploughs turned at each end. Similar field boundaries can be seen in Warners Park.

In the period 1801 to 1901 the population of St Ives was recorded every ten years by the UK census. During this time the population was in the range of 2,099 (the lowest was in 1801) and 3,572 (the highest was in 1851).

From 1901, a census was taken every ten years with the exception of 1941 (due to the Second World War).

In 2011, the parish covered an area of and the population density of St Ives in 2011 was .

==Economy==
The Monday market takes over the town centre, and is larger in scale on Bank Holidays in May and August. There is a Friday market, and a Farmers&#x27; Market on the first and third Saturday every month. The Michaelmas Fair takes over for three days from the second Monday in October, and there is a carnival which is the biggest public gathering in Huntingdonshire. The town has a mixture of shops, bars, coffee lounges, a department store and other amenities.

==Public houses==
As an important market town, St Ives always needed large numbers of public houses, many of which were bawdy houses: 64 in 1838 (1 for every 55 inhabitants), 60 in 1861, 48 in 1865 and 45 in 1899, although only five of these made the owners a living. As livestock sales diminished, however, so did the need for large numbers of pubs, falling to a low point of 16 in 1962. In that year the Seven Wives on Ramsey Road was opened and, with some openings and closings since, there are 17 today. The oldest name is the Dolphin; in use on the same site for over 300 years, its current usage is for a hotel built in 1985, which had been taken over a number of times, most recently by Best Western. Next oldest is the White Hart, which is pre-1720. Nelson&#x27;s Head and Golden Lion are at least as old but have not kept the same name: they used to be called the Three Tuns and the Red Lion respectively. There has been a pub on the site of the Robin Hood from a similar date; in fact it was originally two separate pubs: the Angel and the Swan. A pub under that name has now been opened by Wetherspoons a few doors up on a site that was previously used a retail unit. The claim of the Royal Oak to date from 1502 cannot be proven since, while a portion at the back is 17th-century (making it physically the oldest portion of any pub in St Ives), the pub name is more recent. The reference is to Charles II&#x27;s famous escape from Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads, and Charles was restored to the throne in 1660.

The Golden Lion was a 19th-century coaching inn. &quot;The Official Guide to the Great Eastern Railway&quot; referred to it in 1893 as one of two &quot;leading hotels&quot; in St Ives and there are a number of ghost stories associated with the pub.

==Landmarks==

===St Ives Bridge===

St Ives Bridge is most unusual in incorporating a chapel, the most striking of only four examples in England. Also unusual are its two southern arches which are a different shape from the rest of the bridge, being rounded instead of slightly gothic. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537, the chapel was given to the prior to live in. The lords of the manor of St Ives changed hands several times, as did the chapel. During this period, it was in turn - a private house, a doctors surgery and a pub, called Little Hell. The pub had a reputation for rowdy behaviour, and it is believed the landlord kept pigs in the basement. The additional two storeys added in the seventeenth century were removed in 1930, due to damage being caused to the foundations. 
The chapel features colourfully in the historical novel &#x27;Not Just a Whore&#x27;, by local St Ives resident K M Warwick, where it is described as a fictitious &quot;Bawdy House&quot; (brothel). The bridge was partially rebuilt after Oliver Cromwell knocked down two arches during the English Civil War to prevent King Charles I&#x27;s troops approaching London from the Royalist base in Lincolnshire. During the war and for some period afterwards, the gap was covered by a drawbridge. The town square contains a statue of Oliver Cromwell erected in 1901. It is one of four statues of Cromwell on public display in Britain, the others being in Parliament Square, outside Wythenshawe Hall and in Warrington.

===Holt Island===
The eastern or town end of Holt Island is a nature reserve, and the western end, opposite the parish church, is a facility for the Sea Scouts. The scout portion contains what was, before the opening of the Leisure Centre, the town&#x27;s outdoor town swimming pool. The pool was dug in 1913 and closed to the public in 1949. It is now used by the scouts for canoeing and abseiling. In November 1995, the island was the focus of a significant lawsuit and a break-away Scouting Association was prevented from using and developing a claim to it.

==Culture==
The Norris Museum was founded by Herbert Norris, who left his lifetime&#x27;s collection of Huntingdonshire relics to the people of St Ives when he died in 1931. The Norris Museum holds a collection on local history, including a number of books written by its former curator, Bob Burn-Murdoch. 
The museum was reopened in August 2017, following a £1.5m refurbishment and expansion made possible by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant. Since 2020 its director has been Claire Hardy, and it is managed by the Norris Management Trust Group, made up of members of St Ives Town Council and the Friends of the Norris Museum.

St Ives Corn Exchange is a Grade II listed building, first opened in 1864, built and paid for by local businessmen. Renovation work started in late 2009 and the restored building was formally re-opened on 24 June 2010.

Each year the town hosts a free 2-day carnival and music festival which was launched in 1999, as part of the committee set up for the millennium.

===Sport===

There are 2 leisure facilities, the indoor centre is adjacent to the Burgess conference and Events Hall and an outdoor centre in the west of the town. The original swimming pool, fed by the river, is in the middle of Holt Island and is now used for canoeing practice and other activities. St Ives also has a Rugby club on Somersham Road, and a non-league football club, St Ives Town F.C., which plays at Westwood Road. St Ives Rowing Club was formed in 1865, was once captained by John Goldie and has had a number of members who have competed at Olympic and Commonwealth championships. There is a swimming club and an 18-hole championship golf course.

==Education==
St Ives has a main secondary school, St Ivo Academy and four primary schools: Eastfield, Thorndown, Westfield and Wheatfields.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Star Radio and HCR FM a community based radio station that broadcast across the district of Huntingdonshire. 

The Hunts Post is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper. 

==Transport==

===Guided busway===

The major section of the world&#x27;s longest guided busway, using all new construction techniques and technology, connects St Ives directly to Cambridge Science Park on the outskirts of Cambridge along the route of a disused railway line. The same buses continue into the centre of Cambridge along regular roads in one direction and continue to Huntingdon in the other direction. A shorter section of the same busway system operates from the railway station on the far side of Cambridge to Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital and Trumpington. The scheme, budgeted at £116.2 million, opened in summer 2011. Construction of the busway was beset with problems, causing delays; for example, cracks appeared in the structure allowing weeds to grow through. Contractors BAM Nuttall were fined a significant amount of money for each day that the busway completion date was not met.

The St Ives Park &amp; Ride on Meadow Lane is part of the scheme and was due to open at the same time. A &quot;Green Update&quot; newsletter came out in Winter 2007 with news on conservation work including protection of the Great Crested Newt.

===Road===
St Ives is just off the A1307 (former A14) road on what was a particularly congested section of the route from the UK&#x27;s second city, Birmingham, to the port of Felixstowe and thence to the mainland of Europe Before the opening of the new bypass, this section of road also linked the northern end of the M11 (Cambridge and region) to the A1 and the whole of the North of England and Scotland. The new A14 bypass for St Ives and Huntingdon opened in December 2019, leaving the existing alignment near Swavesey and passing to the south of both market towns. A northern bypass has been under discussion for even longer but is not anticipated any time soon.

===Rail and conventional bus===
Bus services are provided by Stagecoach in Huntingdonshire and Go Whippet, the former also having its depot near the town. Services to Cambridge and Huntingdon are frequent during the day, though less frequent in the evenings. There are also buses to Somersham, Ramsey and Cambourne.

Between 1847 and 1970 the town was served by St Ives railway station on the Cambridge and Huntingdon railway. The line from Cambridge and the station almost survived the 1963 to 1973 Beeching Axe, but were lost to passenger service in the final stages of the process. Some sections continued to be used for freight until 1993. A campaign to reopen the passenger rail service only ended with the ripping-up of disused track shortly before construction of the Guided Busway. Huntingdon, away, has the nearest railway station. Buses using the Busway system provide direct links to both Huntingdon and Cambridge stations.

==Religious sites==

There are ten places of worship, including the ancient parish church. Many other Christian denominations are also represented, and the town also has a mosque and an Islamic Community Centre.

All Saints Church (Church of England) on Church Street has been in the town since AD970 and is one of only two Grade I listed buildings in the town, the other being The Bridge. Originally the parish church of the settlement of Slepe, before St Ives came into existence, it now enjoys a tranquil location at the end of Church Street, situated to the west of the town centre. All Saints, as it stands today, dates largely from the rebuilding of the late 15th century. It was extensively reordered in the late 19th century by Sir Ninian Comper.

The church which dominates the town&#x27;s market place, is The Free Church (United Reformed Church). This was built in 1864, but was modernised in 1980, moving the worship area upstairs. The Church of the Sacred Heart (Roman Catholic) on Needingworth Road, was originally built by Augustus Pugin in Cambridge, but was dismantled in 1902 and transported by barge to St Ives. The hall at the back was added in about 2001. The current Methodist Church on The Waits opened in 1905. Crossways Church (Assembly of God) meet at Crossways Christian Centre on Ramsey Road. St Ives Christian Fellowship (Partnership) meet at Thorndown Junior School on Hill Rise. The Bridge Church (New Frontiers) meet in a newly renovated former industrial building on the corner of Burrel Road and Marley Road. St Ives Evangelical Christian Church (Evangelical) meet at the Burleigh Hill Community Centre, off Constable Road.

==Cultural references==
The town name is featured in the anonymous nursery rhyme/riddle &quot;As I was going to St Ives&quot;. While sometimes claimed to be St Ives, Cornwall, the man with seven wives, each with seven sacks containing seven cats etc. may have been on his way to (or coming from) the Great Fair at St Ives. On Ramsey Road there is a public house called The Seven Wives, though this is a modern pub with no connection to the ancient rhyme other than the name.

The term tawdry is a St Ives-derived word (vying with the rival Ely claim), basically meaning something that is &#x27;cheap and cheerful&#x27;, and was evolved directly from the Saint Audrey&#x27;s Lane cloth market held during the mediaeval and later ages. Made from discarded inferior wool and/or other felt fibres, it was a popular source of cheap material bought by the locals, and those further afield, who flocked to the market in their droves to buy cheap supplies for their own domestic clothing.

Victorian philosopher Thomas Carlyle contrasted the workhouse in St Ives with the ruins of Bury St Edmunds Abbey in &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843).

The famous war poet Rupert Brooke lived for a time at Grantchester. In his famous poem &quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester&quot; he heaped praise on his own village, but not on the shire town of Cambridge itself, or on the other villages around. Of St Ives he wrote:

<doc id="147593" wikidata="Q5211916" url="?curid=147593" title="Damaging quotation">
<text>A damaging quotation is a &quot;short utterance&quot; by a public figure used by opponents as a discrediting tactic. These quotations may be inserted or alluded to in negative political ads to discredit the character or intellectual ability of the originator. More typically, however, they are used in political arguments by both politicians and political pundits often in ways which are fallacious. These quotations are compiled into books or posted on the internet and are repeated in other contexts such as in talk radio or in the United States by stand-up comedians in late-night television monologues. The publication of these quotations is justified as a necessary part of maintaining an informed citizenry. In cases where the quotation in question is taken widely out of context it can be difficult for a candidate to find recourse, even though it is very easy to check the accuracy and the context of a quotation by using internet resources (such as search engines); in popular jargon, the quotation (especially if humorous) can grow into a meme.

== Categories ==
There are various common categories of quotations: malapropisms or grammatical errors, exaggerations about past achievements, lack of conviction, consorting with the enemy, moral turpitude, indifference towards victims of crime, racist or discriminatory, etc. 

In the case of malapropisms, it is a rhetorical fallacy (called argument ad hominem) to conclude that the entire argument of whoever made the utterance is incorrect. Yet it has become common in partisan argument in the United States. For instance: former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, during an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN (March 9, 1999) stated, &quot;During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country&#x27;s economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.&quot; This has frequently been distorted by opponents to say that Gore claimed, &quot;I invented the Internet.&quot; Partisans have so often used this distorted quotation to discredit him that Internet pioneer Vint Cerf (and others who participated in &quot;actually&quot; inventing the Internet) have made a point of noting Gore&#x27;s support and the error of the discreditors.

With the availability of inexpensive computers and the widespread use of the Internet, it has become easy for anyone to accumulate and distribute these quotation lists. Like the &quot;Yogiisms&quot; of baseball great Yogi Berra, or the Colemanballs collected by &quot;Private Eye&quot;, a damaging quotation purports to give insight into the thinking of the speaker, frequently a politician or of the politicians or political groups that used it as means of attack. As such they belong to the colorful history of political satire.

<text>Juan Carazo Serrano (born October 10, 1964) is a former boxer from Caguas, Puerto Rico.

Carazo was considered to be a boxing reincarnation of Wilfred Benítez or Wilfredo Gómez by many of his fans, and he won his first five professional bouts by knockout in 1984. By his sixth bout, however, he had to rise off the canvas against Julio Guerrero of the Dominican Republic before winning on an eight-round unanimous decision.

In 1985, Carazo started to campaign in Curaçao, where he won a few fights. Then, he had another fight in Puerto Rico, this time at Mario Morales Coliseum, and the fight was telecasted all across the island. In it, his opponent, named Tom Elston, wore long pants, showed his tongue at the camera and tried to bite Carazo. Carazo nevertheless won by a knockout in six.

Carazo had a fight scheduled on Telemundo Puerto Rico in 1987 against a foreign opponent, in an undercard where Wilfredo Vazquez was supposed to face another opponent. Both of their opponents had visa trouble and at the last minute, the card&#x27;s promoters decided that in order to save the card, they&#x27;d put Carazo, a Jr. Bantamweight, and Vazquez, a Bantamweight, against each other. Carazo suffered his first loss, by a knockout in the first round.

Carazo came back to beat former flyweight world champion Santos Laciar by a decision in 12 at Caguas in 1988, and was given a chance to challenge the late Gilberto Roman for the WBC world Jr. Bantamweight title in 1989, in Inglewood, California. He was dropped in round four, but seconds after getting off, he dropped Roman near the ring&#x27;s ropes. He was one second away from becoming a world champion, but Roman recovered, got up at the count of nine and proceeded to win by a unanimous 12-round decision.

On September 9 of that same year, a second world title opportunity came, when he faced the WBO world champion, the also late José Ruíz Matos in San Juan. This time, he was knocked out in the first round, and, for all purposes, his boxing career was over after this.

Carazo then went to Chile in 1992, losing a decision to Chilean fighter Bernardo Mendoza. He and his team stayed in Chile longer to protest the decision, and during their time there, they went to the house of a former South American champion and took monetary help and toys for him and his family.

Carazo decided to retire after that, but in 1996, he tried a comeback in Ponce, Puerto Rico, losing by a knockout in five rounds to an unknown boxer, Angel Castellar, who was 2-5-2 coming into the fight.

Carazo also lost to former world champion Jose Quirino, to Junior Jones by a close, ten round majority decision, and to Rafael del Valle.

Carazo had a record of 25 wins and 9 losses, with 19 wins by knockout.

Carazo is a member of the Caguas sports hall of fame.

==After boxing==
Carazo, who is an expert in geometry and trigonometry, took an electronics test and passed with a perfect score. He then joined a computer factory; and now works as a repairman for the Claro network in Puerto Rico.

==Personal life==
Carazo is married to Ana Maria Carrion since 1983; the couple has two daughters and two grandsons.

<doc id="147599" wikidata="Q1570297" url="?curid=147599" title="The Vandals">
<text>The Vandals are an American punk rock band, established in 1980 in Orange County, California. They have released ten full-length studio albums, three live albums, three live DVDs and have toured the world extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are well known for their use of humor, preferring to use their music as a vehicle for comedy and sarcasm rather than as a platform for more serious issues. Kung Fu Records, founded in 1996 by Escalante and Fitzgerald has signed and launched many punk rock bands.

The band&#x27;s lineup fluctuated significantly over their first nine years, though founding members Steven Ronald Jensen, guitarist Jan Nils Ackermann, and first consistent drummer Joe Escalante remained regular fixtures. Of the early members, only Escalante has remained through all subsequent incarnations of the band. The current lineup of Escalante, Dave Quackenbush, Warren Fitzgerald, and Josh Freese has remained intact since 1990 and is generally considered far removed from the band&#x27;s early 1980s incarnation. Since 2002 Escalante has released all of the band&#x27;s albums through his Kung Fu Records label, with Fitzgerald generally producing.

==History==

===Early years (1980–1984)===
The Vandals formed in 1980 in Huntington Beach, California, by guitarist Jan Nils Ackermann. Soon vocalist Steven Ronald &quot;Stevo&quot; Jensen (1959 – August 21, 2005) was found and he and Ackermann practiced and performed with a rotating cast of other members before a permanent lineup coalesced to include bassist Steve &quot;Human&quot; Pfauter and drummer Joe Escalante. Other early members included Steve Gonzalez on bass and Vince Mesa on drums.

The band quickly built a reputation in the Los Angeles and Orange County punk rock community. The Vandals distinguished themselves in their scene by sticking to humorous subject matter rather than the typical social and political topics addressed by most punk bands of the time.

In 1982 the group became the second band to sign with Epitaph Records, the Los Angeles label run by Bad Religion&#x27;s Brett Gurewitz, who released their first EP, &quot;Peace thru Vandalism&quot;. The record contained several songs that would become fan favorites and remained in the band&#x27;s live set well into the 1990s, including &quot;Urban Struggle,&quot; which became a local hit after receiving airplay on KROQ-FM&#x27;s &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; program.

Most of the record&#x27;s subject material was drawn directly from the band&#x27;s own experiences in their local punk rock scene. &quot;The Legend of Pat Brown&quot; told tales of a substance-abusing friend of the band who was notorious for causing mayhem, while &quot;Pirate&#x27;s Life&quot; dealt with the experience of riding Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; ride while taking LSD. The aforementioned &quot;Urban Struggle&quot; dealt with the constant fights that would occur between the punk rock fans who congregated at a Costa Mesa club called the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest and the country music fans who gathered at nearby Zubie&#x27;s. &quot;Anarchy Burger (Hold the Government)&quot; approached the philosophy of anarchism, advocated by many early punk bands, from a humorous perspective and became one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs throughout their career.

In 1984 the band appeared in the film &quot;Suburbia&quot; by invitation of director Penelope Spheeris, who had also directed the influential &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;. They also played a benefit concert for the Cypress College Young Republicans, along with the Circle Jerks, the Dickies and D.I., an action which prompted derision from the predominantly leftist and anarchist punk community. It would not be the last time the band&#x27;s actions would draw criticism, with their music generally maintaining an apolitical position.

When Pfauter left the band in 1984, Eric VonArab (Love Canal) filled in on bass while the band was writing and rehearsing for their first album until Brent Turner was brought in to play bass on the recording of that album, &quot;When in Rome Do as the Vandals&quot;. By the time of its release in 1985 on National Trust Records Chalmer Lumary had joined as the band&#x27;s full-time bassist. The album explored different musical styles and contained several songs that would become fan favorites. &quot;Ladykiller&quot; incorporated scratching and dance beats, while &quot;Mohawk Town&quot; explored a mixture of punk rock and country music. Personality clashes between members led to Stevo&#x27;s departure from the band shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Dave Quackenbush of the band Falling Idols, who has remained the Vandals&#x27; vocalist. In 1987 the band appeared in another Penelope Spheeris film, &quot;Dudes&quot;.

===Quackenbush, Fitzgerald, and Freese join (1984–1989)===
By 1989 Lumary had left the band and Robbie Allen joined them in the studio to play bass on the album &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot;. The album was something of a departure from the punk rock formula of their previous releases, fusing country and western styles with their humorous brand of punk into a sound the band called &quot;cow punk,&quot; somewhat mocking the resurgence in popularity of country music in their native Huntington Beach. The joking style confused many of their fans and the album would remain in obscurity until its 1999 re-release as &quot;The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes&quot;. By the time of the album&#x27;s release the band had recruited new drummer Doug MacKinnon and Escalante had moved to bass, a position he would remain in for the rest of the band&#x27;s career.

Following the release of &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot; the band went through several lineup changes, as drummer MacKinnon and founding-guitarist Ackermann both left the group.

With Escalante asserting control over the band, Stevo, Ackermann, Lumary, and T.S.O.L. drummer Todd Barnes played a show billed as the Vandals, later as S.N.I.V. (Stevo&#x27;s New and Improved Vandals). Escalante has stated that the older members relinquished control of the band&#x27;s name and rights to him in exchange for permission to play the show, but the others deny this claim and point out that Escalante served an injunction against them during the performance preventing them from further use of the name and music.

The departure of Ackermann and MacKinnon left Escalante and Quackenbush searching for a new guitarist and drummer. The Vandals had previously played shows with a band called Doggy Style and had been intrigued by the wacky antics of their guitarist Warren Fitzgerald, and they soon recruited him as their new permanent guitarist. Also around this time Escalante and Quackenbush made many visits to Disneyland, where they witnessed Josh Freese playing electronic drums in the children&#x27;s cover band Polo on the Tomorrowland Terrace stage. They persuaded him to join, solidifying the Vandals lineup of Quackenbush, Fitzgerald, Escalante, and Freese which would remain constant throughout the rest of their career (with occasional substitutes filling in for Freese).

===Role in &#x27;90s punk revival (1990–2000) ===
In 1990 the new lineup recorded &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;, an album which established their presence amongst an emerging new crop of California punk rock bands including Green Day, NOFX, the Offspring, Rancid, Pennywise, and Sublime. It spawned their first music video, for the song &quot;Pizza Tran,&quot; which received airplay on local punk and rock television shows.

In 1992 Escalante graduated from law school and became a television executive at CBS, using money from his job to finance the band and his television connections to allow them to play on late-night rock shows. At a New Year&#x27;s Eve party at which Escalante was unable to play, actor Keanu Reeves filled in for him on bass. Fitzgerald and Freese, meanwhile, moved towards careers as professional musicians. Freese became a sought-after studio drummer, while Fitzgerald began a three-year stint as guitarist for Oingo Boingo.

In 1992, Freese and Fitzgerald formed Xtra Large with vocalist Darren McNamee and Big Drill Car bassist Bob Thomson. Xtra Large released one album on Giant Records, titled &quot;Now I Eat Them&quot;.

In 1994 the band released &quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies&quot;, a live album and video which featured mostly performances of songs from &quot;Peace thru Vandalism&quot; and &quot;When in Rome&quot;. From this point on the band would play fewer and fewer of these older songs in their live sets, concentrating instead on newer material.

By 1995 punk rock had gained nationwide mainstream popularity, and the Vandals signed to Offspring singer Dexter Holland&#x27;s new label Nitro Records. They released the album &quot;Live Fast, Diarrhea&quot; to positive reception and supported it with tours throughout the United States and Europe, including a spot opening for fellow Orange County rockers No Doubt. The album and band garnered increased attention thanks to an episode of the popular television show &quot;The X-Files&quot; in which actor Giovanni Ribisi played a character who wears Vandals T-shirts and listens to their music.

1996 saw the release of &quot;The Quickening&quot;, a slightly more nihilistic and aggressive album that was supported by a music video for &quot;It&#x27;s a Fact.&quot; That year Escalante and Fitzgerald also founded the record label Kung Fu Records, initially created in order to release an album by the Riverside band Assorted Jelly Beans. The label also released the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Glory Daze&quot;, which featured music from both the Vandals and Assorted Jellybeans and a theme written by Fitzgerald. At the end of the year the band also released a Christmas album, &quot;Oi to the World!&quot;, on Kung Fu. Although it remained the band&#x27;s most obscure release for several years, the title track became somewhat famous when it was covered by No Doubt in 1997. Their version was produced by Fitzgerald and made into a music video. Other than &quot;Oi to the World!,&quot; songs from the album are generally not part of the Vandals&#x27; live setlist, except for their annual &quot;Winter Formal&quot; concert at which they generally perform the album in its entirety. &quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies&quot; was also re-released by Kung Fu in 1997 with bonus tracks.

In 1998 the band released &quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good&quot;, their most popular album yet which focused more on lighthearted humor with songs such as &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got an Ape Drape.&quot; The band continued to tour, including stints on the Vans Warped Tour. In 1999 they re-released most of &quot;Slippery When Ill&quot; as &quot;The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes&quot; on Kung Fu. The members also starred in the Kung Fu-produced internet television series &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot;, later released on DVD.

2000 saw a trio of releases from the band, beginning with a 10-year anniversary edition of &quot;Fear of a Punk Planet&quot; that was released by Kung Fu. This was followed by &quot;Look What I Almost Stepped In...&quot;, their final album under their contract with Nitro. Because of other musical commitments Freese was unavailable to play on the album, so substitute Brooks Wackerman filled in as drummer for the album&#x27;s recording and some accompanying tours. At the end of the year Kung Fu re-released &quot;Oi to the World!&quot;, making it much more widely available than it had been in previous years. Escalante also launched the Kung Fu imprint Kung Fu Films in 2000 with the release of the film &quot;That Darn Punk&quot;, in which he starred and the other band members also appeared. The Vandals also contributed new songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

===Kung Fu Records years (2000–present)===
By the end of 2000 the Vandals had fulfilled their contractual obligations to Nitro Records, and moved their operations fully to Kung Fu. The Kung Fu label had grown since its founding in 1996 and was well-positioned to provide the recording, marketing, and touring support the band&#x27;s popularity now necessitated, including marketing and touring opportunities in Japan. With Escalante acting as president of the label the band&#x27;s operations could also run more smoothly. In 2001 the band performed on the entire run of the Vans Warped Tour.

The band&#x27;s first new album for Kung Fu was &quot;Internet Dating Superstuds&quot;, released in 2002. They held an online contest in which the winners were each awarded a &quot;date&quot; with one of the band members. These &quot;dates&quot; were filmed and included on the CD-ROM portion of the album, which used an internet theme in its artwork. They once again performed on the Warped Tour, and would play select dates on subsequent Warped Tours over the next three years. The &quot;Sweatin&#x27; to the Oldies&quot; video was also re-released on DVD that year by Kung Fu.

In July 2003 the Vandals filmed a live concert album and DVD at the House of Blues in Anaheim as part of Kung Fu&#x27;s &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; series. It was released the following year and featured mostly songs written from 1995 to 2002. 2003 also saw the release of &quot;Hollywood Potato Chip&quot;, which strayed a bit from the pop-punk formula of their 1990s work.

In December 2004 the band traveled to Iraq and played several shows for US troops in the area, with drummer Byron McMackin of Pennywise filling in for Freese. Some fans and contemporaries in the punk community criticized this decision, claiming that it implied the band supported the US-led war in Iraq. The band members defended their actions by pointing out that their music is deliberately apolitical and that whatever their individual political views might be, they were eager to show support for the troops. This was followed by a tour of Europe, on which some dates were cancelled due to protests and picketing by groups who felt the band&#x27;s actions constituted a pro-war stance.

In 2005 the &quot;Shingo Japanese Remix Album&quot; was released, composed of versions of the band&#x27;s songs remixed by Japanese DJ Shingo Asari. That August the band played a benefit show for the legendary New York rock club CBGB. In the same month, original singer Stevo died of a drug overdose.

In April 2006 the Vandals once again returned to the Middle East with McMackin to perform for US troops, this time in Afghanistan. They continue to tour when the members&#x27; schedules permit, as they also have other music-related obligations outside the band. Freese continues to act as a studio drummer for a multitude of recording artists. Fitzgerald writes and produces songs and albums for other artists as well as movie scores, and occasionally acts, having starred in the Kung Fu film &quot;Cake Boy&quot;. Escalante continues to own and operate Kung Fu Records and Kung Fu Films, signing bands and making films such as the &quot;Show Must Go Off!&quot; series and &quot;Cake Boy&quot;. He retired from legal practice in 2005 and hosted the call-in radio show Barely Legal Radio on Indie 103.1 FM, where he dispensed entertainment and legal advice to aspiring musicians. In May 2006 he became the station&#x27;s drive-time morning show host, replacing former Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer Dicky Barrett. In 2007 the Vandals played the first four dates of the Warped Tour.

In August 2008 the Vandals played nine dates of the 2008 Warped Tour with Sum 41 drummer Steve Jocz filling in for Josh Freese, who was touring with Nine Inch Nails. On August 12 the band released &quot;BBC Sessions and Other Polished Turds&quot;, a collection of rare songs and b-sides, exclusively as a digital release.

In January 2015, the band recorded a version from the song &quot;I&#x27;m An Individual&quot;, originally recorded by the Australian footballer Mark &quot;Jacko&quot; Jackson, for the Australian Soundwave 2015 Compilation, launched in February of that year.

In July 2020 the band released a new rarities album named &quot;Curse of the Unripe Pumpkin&quot;.

==Original band&#x27;s reformation==
In 1989, the original Vandals reformed with original singer Stevo, Jan Nils Ackermann on guitar, Chalmer Lumary on bass and with Todd Barnes on drums, playing a show. Legal matters ensued, preventing further performances. Then, In 2008, the original Vandals reunited once more under the new moniker of &quot;Anarchy Taco&quot; as to prevent further legal action and restrictive measures on the group&#x27;s original members. 

Similar to the 1989 reunion, Anarchy Taco was put together by the band&#x27;s founder, Jan Nils Ackermann. The band collects alumni Steve &quot;Human&quot; Pfauter and Chalmer Lumary from the group&#x27;s original records, as well as vocalist Worm, and drummer James. The group&#x27;s setlist usually encompasses the material recorded by the band from 1982–1984.

==Lawsuit between members==
A CD re-release combining &quot;Peace thru Vandalism&quot; and &quot;When in Rome Do as the Vandals&quot; had also been in print since 1989 through Time Bomb Recordings with the credit &quot;all songs written by Joe Escalante.&quot; The former members asserted that most of these songs had been written before Escalante joined the group, that he had misappropriated their intellectual property, and that he had not paid them royalties due from the licensing of these songs. Lawsuits ensued, resulting in an undisclosed settlement which allowed Escalante to continue licensing the band&#x27;s back catalogue. A subsequent licensing of the song &quot;Urban Struggle&quot; for the movie &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; credited the group as a whole.

<text>Cuxhaven is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Stade, Rotenburg, Osterholz and Wesermarsch, the city of Bremerhaven and the North Sea.

== History ==
The district was established in 1977 by merging the former districts of Land Hadeln and Wesermünde. The town of Cuxhaven lost its status as a district-free town and became the capital of the new district.

== Geography ==
The district is often nicknamed Cuxland. It is located on the coast of the North Sea and is enclosed by the river mouths of Elbe and Weser. The coasts are part of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park.

== Coat of arms ==
The arms display Saint Nicholas, who is the patron saint of fishermen. The coast of the North Sea is symbolised at the bottom of the arms.

<text>Margam Abbey () was a Cistercian monastery, located in the village of Margam, a suburb of modern Port Talbot in Wales.

==History==

The abbey was founded in 1147 as a daughter house of Clairvaux by Robert, Earl of Gloucester, and was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Early Christian crosses found in the close vicinity and conserved in the nearby Margam Stones Museum suggest the existence of an earlier Celtic monastic community. The founding abbot was William of Clairvaux. The third abbot, Conan, enjoyed the praise of Giraldus Cambrensis, whom he appears to have entertained prior to his official visit with Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, to preach the Crusade in 1188. Conan (or Cunan) contributed to Patristic literature, as he is credited with the &quot;capitula&quot; or chapter-headings prefixing each section of St. Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Sermons on the Song of Songs&quot;, one of the works for which that author was titled a Doctor of the Church.

The &quot;Annales de Margan&quot; are a contemporary chronicle in Latin, beginning with the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and ending with Henry III&#x27;s quarrel with Hubert de Burgh in the year 1232. The chief source for the earlier portion was likely William of Malmesbury&#x27;s history. The text gives accounts of the purported discovery of the bones of King Arthur, and of the alleged murder of Prince Arthur by King John.

Sir John Buchanan-Jardine (third baronet Buchanan-Jardine) recounts a tradition that Margam Abbey kept a pack of hunting hounds donated to them by a continental Abbey (which he takes to be the Abbey of Saint-Hubert).

The abbey was dissolved by King Henry VIII of England in 1536 and sold to Sir Rice Mansel. Significant holdings of the monastery library appear to have survived this event, including the manuscript of the annals. At this time, only 12 monks were living in the monastery. From the Mansel family the abbey eventually passed to their descendants in the female line, the Talbot family. In the 19th century, C R M Talbot constructed a mansion at Margam Castle which overlooks the abbey ruins. The nave of the abbey continued in use as the parish church, as it does to this day. It is Anglo-Catholic in its churchmanship.

==Today==

Margam Abbey now consists of the intact nave and surrounding ruins. Those ruins not belonging to the church are now owned by the County Council. These remains, including the twelve-sided chapter house, dating from the 13th century, stand within 840 acre (3.4 km2) Margam Country Park, close to Margam Castle. The Abbey church of St Mary, the ruined Chapter House and the Abbey undercroft are all Grade I listed buildings.

On a hill overlooking the abbey stand the ruins of an outlying monastery building, Capel Mair ar y Bryn (&quot;the chapel of St Mary on the hill&quot;). The purpose of this building is thought to have been to allow members of the monastic community who were engaged in the keeping of flocks to fulfil their devotional obligations without having to return to the main church.

== Tree of the Year 2020 ==

In 2020, a beech tree located in the ruins of Margam Abbey was voted Tree of the Year in Wales.

The &#x27;Chapter House Tree&#x27; won an online vote conducted by the Welsh Woodland Trust, beating other trees such as the Monmouth Catalpa Tree and the Chirk Castle Sweet Chestnut. It was awarded £1000 as a prize, and received 1118 votes.

<text>Paul Simon is the second solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. It was released in January 1972, nearly two years after he split up with longtime musical partner Art Garfunkel. His first solo album, recorded in England in 1965, remained unreleased in the U.S. (except for a brief period in 1969) until 1981, when it appeared in the 5-LP &quot;Collected Works&quot; boxed set. Originally released on Columbia Records, &quot;Paul Simon&quot; was later issued under the Warner Bros. label and has since returned to Columbia through Sony. The album topped the charts in the United Kingdom, Japan and Norway and reached No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Albums. It was certified platinum in 1986.

==History and composition==

After Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s acrimonious breakup, Paul Simon taught songwriting classes at New York University during the summer of 1971. Among his students were two of the Roche sisters, Maggie and Terre, and singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester, who recalls that Simon was nervous, listened to the students&#x27; songs and offered suggestions and criticism, often dissecting the lyrics and drawing comparisons with his own work while offering insights into his own creative process and sources of inspiration.

In a 1972 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Paul Simon stated that one of his primary goals during the recording of the album was to move beyond the musical style he had become associated with during the 1960s. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to sing &#x27;Scarborough Fair&#x27; again&quot;, he told Jon Landau. As a result, the album is characterized by a more understated production compared to his past records with Art Garfunkel, with Simon&#x27;s guitar and vocals taking center stage. It also incorporates a wide variety of musical genres, including Latin music, jazz, blues, and reggae, showcasing an eclecticism that foreshadows his later exploration of world music on his acclaimed 1986 &quot;Graceland&quot; album.

This stylistic diversity resulted in contributions from several notable guest musicians, including violinist Stéphane Grappelli (featured on &quot;Hobo&#x27;s Blues&quot;, for which he is credited as a co-writer), jazz bassist Ron Carter (on &quot;Run That Body Down&quot;) and percussionist Airto Moreira (on &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot;, where he plays the cuica). The album was recorded in a variety of locations, such as San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Paris and Kingston, Jamaica. The latter was where the recording of &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot;, considered one of the first songs by a non-Jamaican musician to feature elements of reggae music, took place. Released as a single, it became the album&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in March 1972. 

The lyrics throughout the album are also marked by variety, with Paul Simon&#x27;s songwriting shifting between lighthearted and solemn moods, blending humor and biting irony with melancholy and uncertainty. On one hand, songs like &quot;Duncan&quot;, whose protagonist leaves his life in the rural Canadian Maritime Provinces in search of what Rob Sheffield describes as &quot;a romantic Dylan/Kerouac adventure&quot;; &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard&quot;, set in the multicultural New York City neighborhood of Corona, Queens; and &quot;Papa Hobo&quot;, featuring a down-on-his-luck homeless man from Detroit, each contribute a unique character to the album&#x27;s diverse cast, allowing Simon to explore themes such as youth and self-discovery, the political and social turbulence of the late 1960s and the counterculture that emerged in response, and the daily lives and struggles of disenfranchised groups within American society. On the other hand, heartbreak and bitterness over the collapse of a relationship emerge as significant themes as well, with several songs referencing, either directly (&quot;Run That Body Down,&quot; in which &quot;Paul&quot; and &quot;Peg&quot; are mentioned by name) or indirectly (&quot;Congratulations&quot;), Simon&#x27;s troubled marriage to Peggy Harper, which ultimately ended in divorce in 1975.

==Release and reception==

Released on January 24, 1972, the album arrived at a time when, following the dissolution of the duo that made him famous, Paul Simon was considered to be at a disadvantage, with many seeing him as the underdog. This sentiment was echoed by Columbia Records president Clive Davis, who told Simon, &quot;[Simon &amp; Garfunkel] is a household word. No matter however successful you&#x27;ll be, you&#x27;ll never be as successful as S&amp;G&quot;, to which Simon responded, &quot;Yeah, like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis&quot;. Despite these doubts, the album became a major commercial success against all odds, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard 200 on April 1st, 1972, and eventually earning a Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In a 1972 review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau stated, &quot;this is the only thing in the universe to make me positively happy in the first two weeks of February 1972.&quot; That same year, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jon Landau described it as Simon&#x27;s &quot;least detached, most personal and painful piece of work thus far — this from a lyricist who has never shied away from pain as subject or theme.&quot; In a 2022 article written on the occasion of the album&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, Rob Sheffield called it &quot;the funniest, nastiest, leanest, meanest, and possibly weirdest masterpiece of his great career&quot;, adding that, &quot;for some fans, including this one, it’s the best album he’s ever made, with or without the other guy&quot;.

Critical praise for the album was widespread, though some reviewers were less enthusiastic. Noel Coppage, writing in &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, called it &quot;undistinguished&quot; and added, &quot;I gather...this album is merely Simon&#x27;s way of keeping his hand in while Garfunkel makes movies...I&#x27;m now wondering if Garfunkel&#x27;s arranging work doesn&#x27;t include sending Simon back to rewrite some of his songs before recording them.&quot; Despite Coppage&#x27;s critical panning, other &quot;Stereo Review&quot; critics went on to award the album one of its &quot;Record of the Year&quot; honors.

The album was ranked number 268 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 425 in the 2020 update. It was ranked number 984 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd. edition, 2000).

<doc id="147606" wikidata="Q1973162" url="?curid=147606" title="Neath Abbey">
<text>Neath Abbey () was a Cistercian monastery, located near the present-day town of Neath in South Wales, UK. It was once the largest abbey in Wales. Substantial ruins can still be seen, and are in the care of Cadw. Tudor historian John Leland called Neath Abbey &quot;the fairest abbey of all Wales.&quot;

== History ==

Neath Abbey was established in 1129 AD when Richard I de Grenville (d.post 1142), one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, gave of his estate in Glamorgan, Wales, to Savigniac monks from western Normandy. The first monks arrived in 1130. Following the merging of the Savigniac order into the Cistercian order in 1147, Neath Abbey also became a Cistercian house. The abbey was ravaged by the Welsh uprisings of the 13th century. During the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII of England the last abbot, Lleision ap Thomas, managed to buy time through payment of a large fine in 1536, but the abbey was dissolved in 1539. In letters to the Cistercian General Chapter, Lleision served as a spokesman for the Welsh abbeys.

At this time, the abbey was turned into a large estate, initially granted to Richard Williams, although by 1600 it was owned by Sir John Herbert, and had a substantial Tudor mansion occupying a part of the cloisters. The mansion itself was only habitable for 100 years or so, before being abandoned as the site became a scene of industry.
==Industrial use==
By 1730, some of the buildings were being used for copper smelting, and the rest were abandoned. In the late 18th century, an iron foundry was opened near the abbey ruins by a company owned by the Price, Fox and Tregelles families. The ruined walls of both the Abbey and later mansion were gradually engulfed in quantities of industrial waste. The ownership of the site passed to the Rice family, Barons Dynevor, and it was in the 1920s, under Walter FitzUryan Rice, 7th Baron Dynevor that a local group of amateur archaeologists began the process of uncovering the medieval ruins.

==Archaeology==

The archaeology of the abbey was eventually excavated between 1924 and 1935. The Neath Antiquarian Society was the driving force in this early archaeology, in which 7,000 tons of slag and other industrial waste were removed by hand, to uncover the abbey ruins. In 1944 the ownership passed to the Ministry of Works, who undertook further stabilization of the walls. In 2014 Cadw, the successor body charged with the site&#x27;s care, began a substantial project to further protect and stabilize parts of the ruins. The site is open to the public with some interpretation display boards on site.

==Gatehouse==
North of the abbey ruins are the remains of the gatehouse which would have controlled access into the abbey precinct. It now stands on New Road alongside the playground of Abbey Primary School. It was originally built around 1130, but the most prominent surviving features, two pointed windows that face onto the road, date from the 13th or 14th century.

== Commercial use ==
A motorcycle speedway track was constructed in 1962 and the Neath Welsh Dragons rode for one year adjacent to the Abbey. The west side of the Abbey was so close to the banking that the Abbey ruins looked as though it formed part of the track.

The area adjacent to the ruins is used by a car retailer and a number of smaller businesses and workshops.

The site has been used to film several episodes of television series Doctor Who. The Time Lord (played by Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) have filmed several times at the site, which was transformed into a complete structure.

The site was also used for shots during the filming of the BBC television series Merlin, for example the castle of the ancient kings where Arthur rediscovered the round table in Series 3 episode 13

<doc id="147608" wikidata="Q3404780" url="?curid=147608" title="Bardic name">
<text>A bardic name (, ) is a pseudonym used in Wales, Cornwall, or Brittany by poets and other artists, especially those involved in the eisteddfod movement.

The Welsh term bardd (&#x27;poet&#x27;) originally referred to the Welsh poets of the Middle Ages, who might be itinerant or attached to a noble household. Some of these medieval poets were known by a pseudonym, for example Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr (&#x27;Cynddelw the Master Poet&#x27;), fl. 1155–1200 and Iolo Goch (&#x27;Iolo the Red&#x27;), c. 1320 – c. 1398. The practice seems to have very ancient antecedents, as in the names of the presumably 6th century poets Talhaearn Tad Awen, Blwchfardd and Culfardd, mentioned by the Welsh historian Nennius alongside Taliesin and Aneirin, the last referred to as &quot;Aneurin Gwenithwawd&quot; (&#x27;Aneurin of the Corn Poetry&#x27;).

The revival of bardic names became something of a conceit following the reinvention of medieval tradition by Iolo Morganwg in the 18th century. The usage has also extended to Breton and Cornish poetry. In Cornwall, some of the pioneers of the Cornish language movement are referred to by their bardic names, e.g., &quot;Mordon&quot; for Robert Morton Nance, and &quot;Talek&quot; for E. G. Retallack Hooper.

Many surnames in Wales derive from patronymics rather than, for instance, places of origin. Many people therefore share a limited number of surnames, and many people can share even the full name, so it was common practice to add a nickname to distinguish between people with similar names. For some people, this might be a reference to their occupation within the village, but for those with a literary reputation, whose name would be known across the land, it was common practice to take, or be awarded, a sobriquet.

For example, John Jones (Talhaiarn) took his bardic name from his place of origin, to distinguish him from contemporaries with the name John Jones. The minister Joseph Harris (Gomer) selected his bardic name from the Bible. Others, such as Hedd Wyn, used poetic inventions.

The name could be a pen name but it could also be an accolade. A bardic name, in the context of the eisteddfod, is a particular accolade, as it is adopted when inducted into the Orders of distinguished bards and writers.

The sobriquet could be:
* added to the surname, as in William Williams &quot;Pantycelyn&quot; – as a suffixed accolade.
* placed instead of the original surname, as in: William &quot;Pantycelyn&quot; – to preserve a distinction between the literary persona and the private persona. Although it is not an exact parallel, one writer had a personal life as the &quot;Lady Mallowan&quot; but continued to write murder-mysteries as (Dame) Agatha Christie and wrote non-fiction as Agatha Christie Mallowan.
* stand alone, as in: Pantycelyn – in the same way that the literary name of John le Carré is widely recognised without further elaboration, possibly better known than the writer&#x27;s real name of David &quot;Cornwell&quot;.

<doc id="147609" wikidata="Q184698" url="?curid=147609" title="Tithe barns in Europe">
<text>A tithe barn was a type of barn used in much of northern Europe in the Middle Ages for storing rents and tithes. Farmers were required to give one-tenth of their produce to the established church. Tithe barns were usually associated with the village church or rectory, and independent farmers took their tithes there. The village priests did not have to pay tithes—the purpose of the tithe being their support. Some operated their own farms anyway. The former church property has sometimes been converted to village greens.

Many were monastic barns, originally used by the monastery itself or by a monastic grange. The word &#x27;grange&#x27; is (indirectly) derived from Latin (&#x27;granary&#x27;). Identical barns were found on royal domains and country estates.

The medieval aisled barn was developed in the 12th and 13th centuries, following the examples of royal halls, hospitals and market halls. Its predecessors included Roman horrea and Neolithic long houses.

According to English Heritage, &quot;exactly how barns in general were used in the Middle Ages is less well understood than might be expected, and the subject abounds with myths (for example, not one of England&#x27;s surviving architecturally impressive barns was a tithe barn, although such barns existed)&quot;.

==Examples==
===England===
====Medieval====
There are surviving examples of medieval barns in England, some of them known as &quot;tithe barns&quot;. English Heritage established criteria to determine if barns were used as tithe barns. The total number of surviving medieval barns (dated up to 1550) in Britain may be estimated about 200.

<doc id="147610" wikidata="Q201706" url="?curid=147610" title="Gepids">
<text>The Gepids (; ) were an East Germanic tribe who lived in the area of modern Romania, Hungary, and Serbia, roughly between the Tisza, Sava, and Carpathian Mountains. They were said to share the religion and language of the Goths and Vandals.

They are first mentioned by Roman sources in the third century. In the fourth century, they were among the peoples incorporated into the Hunnic Empire, within which they formed an important part. After the death of Attila, the Gepids under their leader Ardaric, led an alliance of other peoples who had been in the empire, and defeated the sons of Attila and their remaining allies at the Battle of Nedao in 454. The Gepids and their allies subsequently founded kingdoms on the Middle Danube, bordering on the Roman Empire. The Gepid Kingdom was one of the most important and long-lasting of these, centered on Sirmium, and sometimes referred to as Gepidia. It covered a large part of the former Roman province of Dacia, north of the Danube, and compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms it remained relatively uninvolved with Rome.

The Gepids were defeated by the Lombards and Avars a century later in 567, when Constantinople gave no support to them. Some Gepids joined the Lombards in their subsequent conquest of Italy, some moved into Roman territory, and other Gepids still lived in the area of the old kingdom after it was conquered by the Avars.

Few archaeological sites remain that can be attributed to them with certainty. After their settlement of the Carpathian Basin, their population was mostly centred on the Someș and Körös rivers, but they did not intermingle with other nations.

==Name==

The most common Latin spellings of the Gepid name in plural used a &quot;p&quot;, but varied concerning the vowels: Gepidae, Gipidae, Gipedae, Gipides. Similarly, Procopius writing in Greek uses a stem γηπαιδ- which should be transliterated as Giped-. Despite this, the Gepids have been equated with the people mentioned in the Old English &quot;Widsith&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as &quot;&quot; or . These names are considered etymologically equivalent Old English forms of Gepidae that could not have arisen through borrowing from attested Latin forms.

Although Walter Goffart has objected that &quot;no serious arguments substantiating the identification seem to me to have been set out&quot;, linguists interpret the &quot;p&quot; in Latin and Greek as an insulting Gothic nickname for the Gepids. In addition to the Old English words, placename evidence in Italy, and a single medieval Latin genitive plural form &quot;Gebodorum&quot; are taken to indicate that the &quot;p&quot; was really a fricative sound similar to a &quot;b&quot;. Many linguists therefore reconstruct the original Germanic form as *&quot;Gíbidoz&quot;, based on the Germanic verb &quot;to give&quot;, as still found in English (German &quot;geben&quot;, Dutch &quot;geven&quot;), apparently indicating that they named themselves gifted or rewarded or generous.

The modern idea that the recorded name of the Gepids was an insult comes from Jordanes in the sixth century, who reported in his Gothic origins story the &quot;Getica&quot;, that the name of the Gepids came from &quot;gepanta&quot;, an insult in Gothic meaning &quot;sluggish, stolid&quot; (&quot;pigra&quot;), because the Gepids had lagged behind their Gothic kin when they migrated more than a thousand years earlier.

In contrast, Isidore of Seville in his etymologies, interpreted the second part of the Gepid name as &quot;feet&quot; (Latin &quot;pedes&quot;) and explained that the Gepids were known for going into battle on foot (&quot;pedestri&quot;), rather than mounted. The much later (12th century) Byzantine &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; interprets the name using the Greek word for children, making the Gepids &quot;Gētípaides&quot; (Γητίπαιδες) meaning &quot;children of the Goths (equated to Getae)&quot;. All three of these texts follow a tradition of seeing the Gepids as &quot;offshoots or close relatives of the Goths&quot;.

&quot;Tabula Peutingeriana,&quot; a 4th century map shows the &quot;Piti&quot; people living next of Porolissum. Whether or not this is a distortion of Gepid is disputed by historians.

==Language==
There is little direct evidence for the original language of the Gepids, but they were clearly Gothic in culture during the period when the Romans reported upon them. Most likely, the Gepids used the same language as the Goths, but in a different dialect. They had strained political relations with related peoples: Goths and Vandals. The Byzantine chronicler of the 6th century, Procopius, in his &quot;Wars of Justinian&quot;, placed the Gepids among the &quot;Gothic peoples&quot; along with the Vandals, Visigoths and Goths proper, &quot;having the same language, white bodies, blond hair and Arian form of Christianity&quot;.

== History ==

===Legendary===

All information of the Gepids&#x27; origins came from &quot;malicious and convoluted Gothic legends&quot;, recorded in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;Getica&quot; after 550. According to Jordanes&#x27;s narration the northern island of &quot;Scandza&quot;, which is associated with Sweden by modern scholars, was the original homeland of the ancestors of the Goths and Gepids. They left Scandza together in three boats under the leadership of Berig, the legendary Gothic king. Jordanes specified that the Gepids&#x27; ancestors traveled in the last of the three ships, for which their fellows mocked them as &quot;gepanta&quot;, or &quot;slow and stolid.&quot; The Goths and Gepids then settled along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea on an island at the mouth of the Vistula river, called &quot;Gepedoius&quot;, or the Gepids&#x27; fruitful meadows, by Jordanes. Modern historians debate whether the part of Jordanes&#x27;s work which described the migration from Scandza was written at least partially on the basis of Gothic oral history or whether it was an &quot;ahistorical fabrication.&quot; Jordanes&#x27;s passage in his &quot;Getica&quot; reads:

According to Jordanes, the Gepids decided to leave &quot;Gepedoius&quot; during the reign of a king named Fastida. He claims the Gepids moved to the south long after the Goths had already moved, and defeated the Burgundians and other races, provoking the Goths in the process. Fastida demanded land from Ostrogotha, King of the Visigoths, because the Gepids&#x27; territory was &quot;hemmed in by rugged mountains and dense forests&quot;. Ostrogotha refused Fastida&#x27;s demand and the Gepids joined battle with the Goths &quot;at the town of Galtis, near which the river Auha flows&quot;. They fought until darkness fell, when Fastida and his Gepids withdrew from the battlefield and returned to their land. Whether they still lived around the Vistula or had already conquered Galicia is debated by historians.

=== Before the arrival of the Huns ===
The Gepids were the &quot;most shadowy of all the major Germanic peoples of the migration period&quot;, according to historian Malcolm Todd. Neither Tacitus nor Ptolemy mentioned them in their detailed lists of the &quot;barbarians&quot; in the first and second centuries AD. They first appear only in the late , and by this time they are already living in or near the area where they remained for the rest of their known history.

According to a common interpretation of the unreliable &quot;Augustan History&quot; of Emperor Claudius Gothicus (VI.2), Gepids were among the &quot;Scythian&quot; peoples conquered by the emperor when he earned his title &quot;Gothicus&quot;: &quot;&quot;peuci trutungi austorgoti uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli&quot;. These words are traditionally edited by modern editors to include well-known peoples &quot;Peuci, Grutungi, Austrogoti, Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, Celtae etiam et Eruli&quot;&quot;. The same source also says that Emperor Probus, who ruled between 276 and 282, settled Gepid, Vandals, and Greuthungi prisoners of war in the Roman Empire in the Balkans.

In the 11th panegyric to emperor Maximian given in Trier in 291, which is also the first time the Tervingi and Taifali were mentioned, the passage described a battle outside the empire where the Gepids were on the side of the Vandals, attacked by Taifali and a &quot;part&quot; of the Goths. The other part of the Goths had defeated the Burgundians who were supported by Tervingi and Alemanni. They were however &quot;remote enough from the imperial frontier for them not to appear in the Verona list or in the histories of Ammianus or Orosius&quot;.

Modern historians who write of the Gepids&#x27; early history sometimes apply a &quot;mixed argumentation&quot;, combining Jordanes&#x27; narration with results of archaeological research. Historian István Bóna says that the battle mentioned in the panegyric was about 290 in the former province of Dacia, equating it to the battle mentioned by Jordanes, involving Fastida. Archaeologist Kurdt Horedt however also equates it to the battle involving Fastida and proposed that the battle took place east of the Carpathian Mountains after 248 and before the withdrawal of the Romans from the province of Dacia in the early 270s. Walter Pohl only says that the battle must have happened between 248 and 291, and could have been inside or outside the curve of the Carpathians, though he feels it is obvious that it must in the region of the formerly Roman province of Dacia in Transylvania.

The Gepids&#x27; history in the is unknown, because no written source mentioned them during this period. The silence of the Roman sources suggests that their homeland did not border on the Roman Empire. On the basis of Jordanes&#x27; reference to the &quot;rugged mountains&quot; of the Gepids&#x27; land, historians locate it near the Carpathians, along the upper courses of either the Tisza or the Dniester rivers, in the late . The exact date of the Gepids&#x27; settlement in the Carpathian Basin cannot exactly be determined. Archaeologist István Bóna says they were present in the northeastern region already in the 260s. According to Coriolan H. Opreanu, they seem to have arrived around 300. Archaeologists Eszter Istvánovits and Valéria Kulcsár write that no archaeological evidence substantiates the Gepids&#x27; presence before around 350.

Graves from the which yielded swords, lances and shields with iron boss were unearthed in cemeteries between the rivers Tisza and Körös (in present-day north-eastern Hungary and north-western Romania). Many scholars (including Kurdt Horedt, István Bóna and Coriolan H. Opreanu) attribute those graves to Gepid warriors. Graves of women from the same cemeteries produced artefacts—including bronze and silver clasps, bone combs, and fibulae—which are similar to objects found in the cemeteries of the nearby &quot;Sântana de Mureș-Chernyakhov culture&quot;. István Bóna writes that the spread of these cemeteries shows that the Gepids subjugated the Germanic Victohali, who had previously inhabited the same region, before expanding towards the Mureș River in the middle of the .

=== Within the Hunnic Empire ===

A large group of diverse peoples from the region of the Middle Danube crossed the river Rhine and invaded the Roman Empire in 405 or 406. Although most contemporaneous sources only listed the Vandals, Alans and Sueves among the invaders, according to St. Jerome, who lived in Bethlehem around that time, Gepids also participated in the invasion. According to a scholarly theory, the westward migration of the Huns forced the tribes to flee from the Carpathian Basin and seek refuge in the Roman Empire. Whatever the exact sequence of events, the Middle Danube region was subsequently dominated by peoples from the east, associated with Goths and Huns.

Jordanes reported that Thorismund, King of the Ostrogoths, who was subjected to the Huns, &quot;won a great victory over&quot; the Gepids, but fell in the battle. Jordanes&#x27; report suggests that the Gepids were forced to accept the overlordship of the Ostrogoths, within the emerging Hunnic Empire. A treasure of gold jewels, which was found at Șimleu Silvaniei, was hidden in the first decades of the , most probably in connection with the struggles ending with the Gepids&#x27; subjection to the Huns, according to István Bóna.

The Gepid warriors fought on the side of the Huns during the next decades. According to Jordanes, Attila the Hun prized Ardaric, King of the Gepids, and Valamir, King of the Ostrogoths, &quot;above all the other chieftains&quot;, who were subjected to the Huns, in the 440s, according to Jordanes. Goffart, sceptical of Jordanes, has suggested that &quot;scattered evidence&quot;, including descriptions of Attila himself as a Gepid, suggests that Ardaric and the Gepids may have been more important than the Ostrogoths under Attila.

The Gepids&#x27; participation in the Huns&#x27; campaigns against the Roman Empire brought them much booty, contributing to the development of a rich Gepid aristocracy. Especially, the isolated graves of fifth-century aristocratic women evidence the Gepid leaders&#x27; wealth: they wore heavy silver fibulas on their shoulders, bead necklaces, silver bracelets, large gold earrings, and silver clasps on their clothes and belts. A &quot;countless host&quot; under the command of Ardaric formed the right wing of the army of Attila the Hun in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451. On the eve of the main encounter between allied hordes, the Gepids and Franks met each other, the latter fighting for the Romans and the former for the Huns, and seem to have fought one another to a standstill with 15,000 dead.

Attila the Hun died unexpectedly in 453. Conflicts among his sons developed into a civil war, enabling the subject peoples to rise up in rebellion. According to Jordanes, the Gepid king, Ardaric, who &quot;became enraged because so many nations were being treated like slaves of the basest condition&quot;, was the first to take up arms against the Huns. The decisive battle was fought at the (unidentified) Nedao River in Pannonia in 454 or 455. In the battle, the united army of Gepids, Rugii, Sarmatians and Suebi routed the Huns and their allies, including the Ostrogoths. It was the Gepids who took the lead among the old allies of Attila, and establishing one of the largest and most independent new kingdoms, thus acquiring the &quot;capital of esteem that sustained their kingdom for more than a century&quot;.

=== Kingdom of the Gepids ===

After the Battle of Nedao, the Hunnic Empire disintegrated and the Gepids became the dominant power in the eastern regions of the Carpathian Basin. According to Jordanes, the Gepids &quot;by their own might won for themselves the territory of the Huns and ruled as victors over the extent of all Dacia, demanding of the Roman Empire nothing more than peace and an annual gift&quot; after their victory. Emperor Marcian confirmed their status as the allies of the empire and granted them an annual subsidy of 100 pounds of gold. The late-5th-century treasures excavated at Apahida and Someșeni show that the Gepid rulers accumulated great wealth in the second half of the century.

The Gepids joined a coalition formed by the Suebi, Sciri, Sarmatians and other peoples formed against the Ostrogoths who had settled in Pannonia. However, the Ostrogoths routed the united forces of their enemies in the Battle of Bolia in 469. After the Ostrogoths left Pannonia in 473, the Gepids captured Sirmium (now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia), a strategically important town on the road between Italy and Constantinople.

In 489, , King of the Gepids, tried to hinder the Ostrogoths from crossing the river Vuka during Theodoric the Great&#x27;s campaign against Italy, but the Ostrogoths routed Thraustila&#x27;s army. The Gepids also lost Sirmium to the Ostrogoths, according to Walter Pohl. In short, according to Walter Goffart, Thraustila&#x27;s son, Thrasaric, &quot;regained control of Sirmium but possibly under Ostrogothic underlordship&quot;. Theodoric the Great dispatched one &quot;comes&quot; Pitzia to launch a campaign against the Gepids who either tried to capture Sirmium or wanted to get rid of Theodoric&#x27;s suzerainty in 504. Comes Pitzia expelled the Gepid troops from Sirmium without much resistance. For some time the Gepids relinquished from the city and built good relationship with the Ostrogoths under King Elemund. This safety attracted part of the Heruls to take refuge in Gepidia from the neighborhood of the aggressive Langobards. Wacho married Elemund&#x27;s daughter in return.

In an attempt to take advantage of the death of Theodoric the Great in 526, the Gepids invaded the region of Sirmium in 528 or 530, but Vitiges defeated them.

The Gepids reached the zenith of their power after 537, settling in the rich area around Singidunum (today&#x27;s Belgrade). For a short time, the city of Sirmium (present-day Sremska Mitrovica) was the center of the Gepid State and the king Cunimund minted golden coins in it. Justinian I, angered by their expansion, made an alliance with the Lombards, who, under King Alboin, dealt a disastrous defeat on the Gepids in 552. After the Battle of Asfeld, Alboin had a drinking cup made from the skull of Cunimund.

In 539, most of the Byzantine army was in Persia, so the Gepids and Heruls plundered Moesia, killing &quot;magister militum&quot; Calluc, while the Frankish king Theudebert I raided Northern Italy. According to Jordanes, the clashes were the bloodiest since Attila, and the Romans were obliged to pay heavy taxes and recognize new Gepid occupation zones. Thurisind, new king of Gepidia attempted to expel the Lombards from Pannonia, and both peoples asked for help from the Byzantines. Justinian I sent his army against the Gepids, however it was routed on the way by the Herulians and the sides signed a two-year truce. Revenging what he felt as a betrayal, Thurisind made an alliance with the Kutrigurs who devastated Moesia before end of the armistice. The Langobard and Roman army joined together and defeated the Gepids in 551. In the battle, Audoin&#x27;s son, Alboin killed Thurisind&#x27;s son, Turismod.

=== Fall and last records ===

The Gepids were finally overrun by the Avars in the 567 Lombard-Gepid war. Many Gepids followed Alboin to Italy in 568 according to Paulus Diaconus, but many remained in the area of their old kingdom.
In 630, Theophylact Simocatta reported that the Byzantine Army entered the territory of the Avars and attacked a Gepid feast, capturing 30,000 Gepids (they met no Avars).

Recent excavation by the Tisza River at Szolnok brought up a Gepid nobleman from an Avar period grave who was also wearing Turkic-Avar pieces next to the traditional Germanic clothes in which he was buried.

In the eighth century, Paul the Deacon lists Gepid, Bulgarian, Sarmatian, Pannonian, Suabian and Norican villages in Italy but we do not know if Paul means in his own day or is simply lifting the phrase from an older source.

== Archaeological sites ==

Numerous archaeological sites have been attributed to the Gepids. The first scientific excavations of such an attributed Gepid site were done by István Kovács at Band in 1906 and 1907. However, attributing a precise ethnicity to archaeological findings from this period is a difficult and disputable method.

The analysis of the burial sites show that high-status burials with valuable goods are initially clustered in northwestern Transylvania (dated to the mid- and late fifth century), then in the sixth-century cemeteries primarily appear in the Hungarian Plain. The upper class of the Gepid society had access to Thuringian brooches, amber beads, or Scandinavian belt buckles, in particular visible in the female burials, pointing at close relations with Scandinavia, Thuringia, Crimea, and the Baltic coast.

In Vlaha, Cluj County, Romania, a necropolis was discovered in August 2004 with over two hundred tombs dated to the sixth century AD. Eighty-five percent of the discovered tombs were robbed in the same period. The remaining artifacts are ceramics, bronze articles and an armory. Also in Romania, at Miercurea Sibiului, there is another necropolis with rich artifacts. Other necropolises in Romania are:
* Morești, Mureș County
* Noșlac, Alba County
* Brateiu, Sibiu County
* Șeica Mică, Sibiu County
* Timișoara Freidorf site 
* Apahida necropolis
* Turda: the richest Germanic tomb found in Romania is here. The &quot;Franziska&quot; tomb was found in a Roman site and dated to the fifth century AD.

Gepid treasures were also found at Someșeni and Șimleu Silvaniei.

==Genetic research==

A study done in 2022 found that from a matrilinear point of view the main mitochondrial ancestry belongs to North-western European group, in line with historical data. In particular it shows similarities with data taken from Wielbark culture and Langobards. Only one Asian lineage was found, indicating the Gepids did not mix with Asian populations in a significant manner on the matrilinear side. The samples were collected from 3 different sites located in Carei-Babold, Șardu, and Vlaha.

<text>Melvin M. Ragin (December 8, 1950 – October 24, 2018), known professionally as Wah Wah Watson, was an American guitarist who was a member of the Funk Brothers, the studio band for Motown Records. He also worked extensively as a session musician in a variety of genres from jazz and pop to R&amp;B.

==Career==
Ragin was a native of Richmond, Virginia. His father, Robert Ragin, was a minister, and his mother, Cora (Brown) Ragin was an evangelist. She bought him his first guitar when he was 15. 

He moved to Detroit in the 1960s and eventually became a member of the Motown Records studio band the Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists like The Temptations (his guitar work on &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; is particularly notable), the Jackson 5, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, and the Supremes. He played on numerous sessions in the 1970s and 1980s for many top soul, funk and disco acts, including Herbie Hancock; he both recorded and composed songs with the Pointer Sisters. His nickname stemmed from &quot;wonderfully textured sounds&quot; he conjured using a wah-wah pedal to alter the sound of his electric guitar; he bought his first pedal after hearing Motown studio guitarist Dennis Coffey use one. 

When Motown relocated to Los Angeles, so did Ragin. In 1976, Watson released his first solo album, &quot;Elementary&quot;, on Columbia Records. The album was co-produced by Watson and David Rubinson.

In 1994, Watson appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In the 2000s, Watson appeared on the albums Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Now&quot; (2001), &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (2000) by Angie Stone, the soundtrack to the film &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000), &quot;Damita Jo&quot; (2004) by Janet Jackson, Alicia Keys&#x27; &quot;Unplugged&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Element of Freedom&quot; (2009).

==Death==
Watson died on October 24, 2018, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica. He was 67. He was survived by two sisters, two brothers, and his wife, Itsuko Aono. In a statement, Aono said, &quot;Wherever he is, he’s groovin’.”

<text>Stade is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It has its seat in Stade and is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region.

==History==

The district of Stade was established in 1932 by merging three smaller precursor districts.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
The district is situated at the southern banks of the Elbe river, between the city of Hamburg and the river&#x27;s mouth. The western border of the district is the Oste, a narrow tributary of the Elbe. The land between the Oste and the town of Stade is traditionally called Kehdingen. The area to the east of Stade is known as the Altes Land (literally &quot;Old Land&quot;). It is characterised by thousands of fruit trees.

=== Bordering districts ===
It is surrounded by (from the north and clockwise) the Schleswig-Holstein districts Dithmarschen, Steinburg and Pinneberg (all on the other side of the Elbe river), the city-state of Hamburg as well as the Lower Saxony districts Harburg, Rotenburg and Cuxhaven.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms displays:
* a castle, symbolising Stade as the former seat of the Counts of Stade
* the key from the arms of the Archbishopric of Bremen, to which the area once belonged
* a white horse, representing Hanover and Lower Saxony

<text>Samādhi (Pali and ), in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and yogic schools, is a state of meditative consciousness. In many Indian religious traditions, the cultivation of Samādhi through various meditation methods is essential for the attainment of spiritual liberation (known variously as nirvana, moksha).

In Buddhism, it is the last of the eight elements of the Noble Eightfold Path. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, it is the eighth and final limb identified in the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; of Patanjali. In Jain meditation, samadhi is considered one of the last stages of the practice just prior to liberation.

In the oldest Buddhist sutras, on which several contemporary western Theravada teachers rely, it refers to the development of an investigative and luminous mind that is equanimous and mindful. In the yogic traditions and the Buddhist commentarial tradition, on which the Burmese Vipassana movement and the Thai Forest tradition rely, it is interpreted as a meditative absorption or trance attained by the practice of &quot;dhyāna&quot;.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Samadhi&quot; may refer to a broad range of states. A common understanding regards &quot;samadhi&quot; as meditative absorption:
* Sarbacker: &quot;samādhi&quot; is meditative absorption or contemplation.
* Diener, Erhard &amp; Fischer-Schreiber: &quot;samādhi&quot; is a non-dualistic state of consciousness in which the consciousness of the experiencing subject becomes one with the observing object.
* Shivananda: &quot;When the mind is completely absorbed in one object of meditation, it is termed Samadhi.&quot;

In a Buddhist context, a more nuanced understanding sees &quot;samadhi&quot; as a state of intensified awareness and investigation of bodily and mental objects or experiences:
* Dogen: &quot;The Buddha says: &#x27;When you monks unify your minds, the mind is in samadhi. Since the mind is in samadhi, you know the characteristics of the creation and destruction of the various phenomena in the world [...] When you gain samadhi, the mind is not scattered, just as those who protect themselves from floods guard the levee.
* Richard Shankman: &quot;The term &quot;samadhi&quot; basically means &#x27;undistractedness. It may be viewed as &quot;an exclusive focus on a single object,&quot; but also as &quot;a broader state of awareness in which the mind remains steady and unmoving, yet aware of a wide range of phenomena around the meditation object.&quot; According to Shankman, the related term &quot;cittas&#x27;ekaggata&quot; may be rendered as &quot;one-pointedness,&quot; fixated on a single object, but also as &quot;unification of mind,&quot; in which mind becomes very still but does not merge with the object of attention, and is thus able to observe and gain insight into the changing flow of experience.
* Dan Lusthaus: &quot;&quot;Samadhi&quot; provides the methodology and context within which experience is to be examined [...] &quot;Samadhi&quot;, by training, focusing/collecting, cleansing and calming the mind [...] facilitates things being finally known (&quot;janatti&quot;) and seen (&quot;passati&quot;) just as they are (&quot;tathata&quot;).
* Keren Arbel: &quot;&quot;Samadhi&quot; is depicted [in the Buddhist sutras] as a broad field of awareness, knowing but non-discursive [...] a stable, discerning and focused mind.&quot;
* Tilmann Vetter argues that the second, third and fourth &quot;dhyana&quot; in Buddhism, &quot;samma-samadhi&quot;, &quot;right samadhi,&quot; build on a &quot;spontaneous awareness&quot; (sati) and equanimity which is perfected in the fourth &quot;dhyana&quot;.

In Hinduism, &quot;samadhi&quot; is also interpreted as the identification with the Absolute:
* Paramahansa Yogananda: A soundless state of breathlessness. A blissful super consciousness state in which a yogi perceives the identity of the individualized Soul and Cosmic Spirit. 

== Etymology ==

=== Sanskrit ===
Various interpretations for the term&#x27;s etymology are possible, either with the root &quot;sam&quot; (&quot;to bring together&quot;) or &quot;sama&quot; ( &quot;the same, equalized, the convergence of two distinct things&quot;). According to Dan Lusthaus, &quot;samadhi&quot; refers to either bringing to consciousness the &quot;samskaras&quot; (&quot;buried latencies&quot;), or meditative concentration on a meditation object:
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;to bring together&quot;; &quot;adhi&quot;, &quot;to place on, put, to impregnate, to give, to receive&quot;: the bringing together of cognitive conditions,&quot; &quot;bringing the buried latencies or &quot;samskaras&quot; into full view,&quot; so &quot;the obscure and hidden become clear objects of cognition,&quot; &quot;the womb through which insight is born.&quot;
* &quot;sama&quot;, &quot;the same, equalized, the convergence of two distinct things based on some commonality&quot;; &quot;adhi&quot;, &quot;higher, better, most skilfully achieved&quot;: &quot;the skillful unification of mind and object,&quot; &quot;the mental equanimity conducive to and derived from attention perfectly focused on its object.&quot; &quot;[S]ometimes treated as synonymous with &quot;ekacitta&quot;, &#x27;one-focused mind,&#x27; i.e. mind (&quot;citta&quot;) completely focused on and at one (&quot;eka&quot;) with its object.&quot;

Etymologies for &quot;sam&quot;-&quot;ā&quot;-&quot;dhā&quot; include:
* &quot;sam-ā-dhā&quot;’: &quot;&#x27;to collect&#x27; or &#x27;to bring together&#x27;, thus suggesting the concentration or unification of the mind&quot;; generally translated [in Buddhism] as &quot;concentration.&quot;
* &quot;sam&quot;-&quot;ā&quot;-&quot;dhā&quot;: &quot;to hold together, to concentrate upon.&quot;
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;completely&quot;; &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;the return towards the subject&quot;; &quot;dha&quot;, &quot;maintaining together: &quot;to assemble completely&quot;; &quot;the tension borne between two poles of existence (object and thought) is reduced to zero.&quot;
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;together&quot; or &quot;integrated&quot;; &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;; &quot;dhā&quot;, &quot;to get, to hold&quot;: to acquire integration or wholeness, or truth (&quot;samāpatti&quot;);
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;together&quot;; &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;toward&quot;; stem of &quot;dadhati&quot;, &quot;puts, places&quot;: a putting or joining;

Particular Hindu/yoga interpretations include:
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;complete&quot;; &quot;dhi&quot;, &quot;consciousness&quot;: &quot;all distinctions between the person who is the subjective meditator, the act of meditation and the object of meditation merge into oneness&quot; (Stephen Sturgess);
* &quot;sam&quot;, &quot;with&quot;; &quot;ādhi&quot;, &quot;Lord&quot;: Union with the Lord (Stephen Sturgess);
* &quot;sama&quot;, &quot;equanimous&quot;; &quot;dhi&quot;, &quot;buddhi or the intellect&quot;: equanimous intellect, non-discriminating intellect (Sadhguru);
* &quot;sama&quot;, &quot;balance&quot;; &quot;ādi&quot;, &quot;original&quot;: &quot; a state that is equal to the original state, which is the state that prevailed before we came into existence&quot;; &quot;original balance&quot; (Kamlesh D. Patel.

=== Chinese ===
Common Chinese terms for &quot;samādhi&quot; include the transliterations &quot;sanmei&quot; (三昧) and &quot;sanmodi&quot; (三摩地 or 三摩提), as well as the translation of the term literally as &quot;ding&quot; (定 &quot;stability&quot;). Kumarajiva&#x27;s translations typically use &quot;sanmei&quot; (三昧), while the translations of Xuanzang tend to use &quot;ding&quot; (定 &quot;stability&quot;). The Chinese Buddhist canon includes these, as well as other translations and transliterations of the term.

=== &quot;Samma-samādhi&quot; and &quot;dhyāna&quot; (jhāna) ===

&quot;Samma-samadhi&quot;, &quot;right &quot;samadhi&quot;,&quot; is the last of the eight elements of the Noble Eightfold Path. When &quot;samadhi&quot; is developed, things are understood as they really are.

&quot;Samma-samadhi&quot; is explicated as &quot;dhyana&quot; (&quot;jhāna&quot;, ), which is traditionally interpreted as one-pointed concentration. Yet, in the stock formula of &quot;dhyāna&quot; &quot;samādhi&quot; is only mentioned in the second &quot;dhyana&quot;, to give way to a state of equanimity and mindfulness, in which one keeps access to the senses in a mindful way, avoiding primary responses to the sense-impressions.

The origins of the practice of &quot;dhyāna&quot; are a matter of dispute. According to Crangle, the development of meditative practices in ancient India was a complex interplay between Vedic and non-Vedic traditions. According to Bronkhorst, the four &quot;rūpa jhāna&quot; may be an original contribution of the Buddha to the religious landscape of India, which formed an alternative to the painful ascetic practices of the Jains, while the &quot;arūpa jhāna&quot; were incorporated from non-Buddhist ascetic traditions. Alexander Wynne argues that dhyāna was incorporated from Brahmanical practices, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. These practices were paired to mindfulness and insight, and given a new interpretation. Kalupahana also argues that the Buddha &quot;reverted to the meditational practices&quot; he had learned from Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta.

===The &quot;rupa jhānas&quot;===

===The &quot;arupas&quot;===
Appended to the &quot;jhana&quot;-scheme are four meditative states, referred to in the early texts as &quot;arupas&quot; or as &quot;āyatana&quot;. They are sometimes mentioned in sequence after the first four &quot;jhānas&quot; and thus came to be treated by later exegetes as jhānas. The immaterial are related to, or derived from, yogic meditation, and aim more specific at concentration, while the &quot;jhanas&quot; proper are related to the cultivation of the mind. The state of complete dwelling in emptiness is reached when the eighth &quot;jhāna&quot; is transcended. The four &quot;arupas&quot; are:
* &quot;fifth jhāna:&quot; infinite space (Pali &quot;ākāsānañcāyatana&quot;, Skt. &quot;ākāśānantyāyatana&quot;),
* &quot;sixth jhāna:&quot; infinite consciousness (Pali &quot;viññāṇañcāyatana&quot;, Skt. &quot;vijñānānantyāyatana&quot;),
* &quot;seventh jhāna:&quot; infinite nothingness (Pali &quot;ākiñcaññāyatana&quot;, Skt. &quot;ākiṃcanyāyatana&quot;),
* &quot;eighth jhāna:&quot; neither perception nor non-perception (Pali &quot;nevasaññānāsaññāyatana&quot;, Skt. &quot;naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana&quot;).

Although the &quot;Dimension of Nothingness&quot; and the &quot;Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&quot; are included in the list of nine jhanas attributed to the Buddha, they are not included in the Noble Eightfold Path. Noble Path number eight is &quot;Samma Samadhi&quot; (Right Concentration), and only the first four Jhanas are considered &quot;Right Concentration&quot;. When all the jhanas are mentioned, the emphasis is on the &quot;Cessation of Feelings and Perceptions&quot; rather than stopping short at the &quot;Dimension of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&quot;.

=== Theravāda ===

====Samadhi as concentration====
According to Gunaratana, the term &#x27;&quot;samādhi&quot;&#x27; derives from the roots &quot;&#x27;sam-ā-dhā&quot;&#x27;, which means &#x27;to collect&#x27; or &#x27;bring together&#x27;, and thus it is generally translated as &quot;concentration.&quot; In the early Buddhist texts, &quot;samādhi&quot; is also associated with the term &quot;samatha&quot; (calm abiding). In the commentarial tradition, &quot;samādhi&quot; is defined as &quot;ekaggata&quot;, one-pointedness of mind (&quot;Cittass&#x27;ekaggatā&quot;).

Buddhagosa defines &quot;samādhi&quot; as &quot;the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object [...] the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object, undistracted and unscattered&quot;. According to Buddhaghosa, the Theravada Pali texts mention four attainments of &quot;samādhi&quot;:
# Momentary concentration (&quot;khanikasamādhi&quot;): a mental stabilization which arises during &quot;samatha&quot; meditation.
# Preliminary concentration (&quot;parikammasamādhi&quot;): arises out of the meditator&#x27;s initial attempts to focus on a meditation object.
# Access concentration (&quot;upacārasamādhi&quot;): arises when the five hindrances are dispelled, when &quot;jhāna&quot; is present, and with the appearance the &#x27;counterpart sign&#x27; (&quot;patibhaganimitta&quot;).
# Absorption concentration (&quot;appanasamādhi&quot;): the total immersion of the mind on its meditation of object and stabilization of all four &quot;jhāna&quot;s.

According to Buddhaghosa, in his influential standard-work Visuddhimagga, &quot;samādhi&quot; is the &quot;proximate cause&quot; to the obtainment of wisdom. The Visuddhimagga describes 40 different objects for meditation, which are mentioned throughout the Pali canon, but explicitly enumerated in the Visuddhimagga, such as mindfulness of breathing (&quot;ānāpānasati&quot;) and loving kindness (&quot;mettā&quot;).

====Criticism====
While the Theravada-tradition interprets &quot;dhyana&quot; as one-pointed concentration, this interpretation has become a matter of debate. According to Richard Gombrich, the sequence of the four &quot;rupa-jhanas&quot; describes two different cognitive states: &quot;I know this is controversial, but it seems to me that the third and fourth jhanas are thus quite unlike the second.&quot;

Alexander Wynne states that the &quot;dhyana&quot;-scheme is poorly understood. According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as &quot;sati&quot;, &quot;sampajāno&quot;, and &quot;upekkhā&quot;, are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states, whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects.

Several western teachers (Thanissaro Bhikkhu, Leigh Brazington, Richard Shankman) make a distinction between &#x27;sutta-oriented&#x27; &quot;jhana&quot; and ″&quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;-oriented&#x27; &quot;jhāna&quot;. Thanissaro Bhikkhu has repeatedly argued that the Pali Canon and the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; give different descriptions of the jhanas, regarding the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;-description to be incorrect. Keren Arbel has conducted extensive research on the &quot;jhānas&quot; and the contemporary criticisms of the commentarial interpretation. Based on this research, and her own experience as a senior meditation-teacher, she gives a reconstructed account of the original meaning of the &quot;dhyanas&quot;. She argues that the four jhānas are the outcome of both calming the mind and developing insight into the nature of experience and cannot not be seen in the suttas as two distinct and separated meditation techniques, but as integral dimensions of a single process that
leads to awakening. She concludes that &quot;the fourth jhāna is the optimal experiential event for the utter de-conditioning of unwholesome tendencies of mind and for the transformation of deep epistemological structures. This is because one embodies and actualizes an awakened awareness of experience.&quot;

=== Mahāyāna ===
==== Indian Mahāyāna ====
The earliest extant Indian Mahāyāna texts emphasize ascetic practices, forest-dwelling, and states of meditative oneness, i.e. &quot;samādhi&quot;. These practices seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahāyāna, also because they &quot;may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration&quot;.

Indian Mahāyāna traditions refer to numerous forms of &quot;samādhi&quot;, for example, Section 21 of the &quot;Mahavyutpatti&quot; records 118 distinct forms of &quot;samādhi&quot; and the Samadhiraja Sutra has as its main theme a &quot;samādhi&quot; called &#x27;the &quot;samādhi&quot; that is manifested as the sameness of the essential nature of all &quot;dharma&quot;s&#x27; (&quot;sarva-dharma-svabhavā-samatā-vipañcita-samādhi&quot;).

==== &quot;Vimokṣamukha&quot; ====
Buddhist Pali texts describe three kinds of &quot;samādhi&quot; which the commentarial tradition identify as the &#x27;gates of liberation&#x27; (&quot;vimokṣamukha&quot;):
# Signlessness-samadhi ( &quot;ānimitta-samādhi&quot;) ( &quot;animitto samādhi&quot;) or marklessness-concentration ( &quot;alakṣaṇa-samādhi&quot;)
# Aimlessness-samadhi ( &quot;apraṇihita-samādhi&quot;) ( &quot;appaṇihito samādhi&quot;)
# Emptiness-samadhi ( &quot;śūnyatā-samādhi&quot;) ( &quot;suññato samādhi&quot;)

According to Polak, these are alternative descriptions of the four dhyanas, describing the cognitive aspects instead of the bodily aspects. According to Polak, in the final stages of dhyana no ideation of experience takes place, and no signs are grasped (&quot;animitta samādhi&quot;), which means that the concentrated attention cannot be directed (&quot;appaṇihita samādhi&quot;) towards those signs, and only the perception of the six senses remains, without a notion of &quot;self&quot; (&quot;suññata samādhi&quot;).

In the Chinese Buddhist tradition these are called the &#x27;three doors of liberation&#x27; (, ): These three are not always cited in the same order. Nagarjuna, a Madhyamaka Buddhist scholar, in his &quot;Maha-prajnaparamita-sastra&quot;, listed &quot;apraṇihita&quot; before &quot;ānimitta&quot; in his first explanation on these &quot;three &quot;samādhi&quot;&quot;, but in later listings and explanations in the same work reverted to the more common order. Others, such as Thích Nhất Hạnh, a Thien Buddhist teacher, list &quot;apraṇihita&quot; as the third after &quot;śūnyatā&quot; and &quot;ānimitta&quot;. Nagarjuna lists these three kinds of &quot;samādhi&quot; among the qualities of the &quot;bodhisattva&quot;.

===== Signlessness samadhi=====
According to Nagarjuna, signlessness-samadhi is the &quot;samādhi&quot; in which one recognises all dharmas are free of signs (&quot;ānimitta&quot;). According to Thích Nhất Hạnh, &quot;signs&quot; refer to appearances or form, likening signlessness samadhi to not being fooled by appearances, such as the dichotomy of being and non-being.

===== Aimlessness-samadhi=====
&#x27;Aimlessness&#x27;, also translated as &#x27;uncommittedness&#x27; or &#x27;wishlessness&#x27; (Chinese , , or , ), literally means &#x27;placing nothing in front&#x27;. According to Dan Lusthaus, aimlessness-samadhi is characterised by a lack of aims or plans for the future and no desire for the objects of perception. According to Nagarjuna, aimlessness-samadhi is the &quot;samādhi&quot; in which one does not search for any kind of existence (&quot;bhāva&quot;), letting go of aims or wishes (&quot;praṇidhāna&quot;) regarding conditioned phenomena and not producing the three poisons (namely, passion, aggression, and ignorance) towards them in the future.

===== Emptiness-samadhi =====
According to Nagarjuna, emptiness-samadhi is the &quot;samādhi&quot; in which one recognises that the true natures of all dharmas are absolutely empty (&quot;atyantaśūnya&quot;), and that the five aggregates are not the self (&quot;anātman&quot;), do not belong to the self (&quot;anātmya&quot;), and are empty (&quot;śūnya&quot;) without self-nature.

==== Zen ====

Indian &quot;dhyāna&quot; was translated as &quot;chán&quot; in Chinese, and &quot;zen&quot; in Japanese. Ideologically the Zen-tradition emphasizes prajñā and sudden insight, but in the actual practice prajñā and samādhi, or sudden insight and gradual cultivation, are paired to each other. Especially some lineages in the Rinzai school of Zen stress sudden insight, while the Sōtō school of Zen lays more emphasis on shikantaza, training awareness of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Historically, many traditional Japanese arts were developed or refined to attain &quot;samādhi&quot;, including incense appreciation (香道, &quot;kodō&quot;), flower arranging (華道, &quot;kadō&quot;), the tea ceremony (茶道, &quot;sadō&quot;), calligraphy (書道, &quot;shodō&quot;), and martial arts such as archery (弓道, &quot;kyūdō&quot;). The Japanese character 道 means &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the path&quot; and indicates that disciplined practice in the art is a path to &quot;samādhi&quot;.

== Hinduism ==

=== Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sūtras ===

&quot;Samādhi&quot; is the eighth limb of the Yoga Sūtras, following the sixth and seventh limbs of &quot;dhāraṇā&quot; and &quot;dhyāna&quot; respectively.

==== &quot;Samyama&quot; ====

According to Taimni, &quot;dhāraṇā&quot;, &quot;dhyāna&quot;, and &quot;samādhi&quot; form a graded series:
# Dhāraṇā ― In &quot;dhāraṇā&quot;, the mind learns to focus on a single object of thought. The object of focus is called a &quot;pratyaya&quot;. In &quot;dhāraṇā&quot;, the yogi learns to prevent other thoughts from intruding on focusing awareness on the &quot;pratyaya&quot;.
# Dhyāna ― Over time and with practice, the yogin learns to sustain awareness of only the &quot;pratyaya&quot;, transforming &quot;dhāraṇā&quot; into &quot;dhyāna&quot;. In &quot;dhyāna&quot;, the yogin realizes the triplicity of perceiver (the yogin), perceived (the &quot;pratyaya&quot;), and the act of perceiving. The key distinction of &quot;dhyāna&quot; is the gradual minimization of the perceiver, leading to the fusion of the observer with the observed (the &quot;pratyaya&quot;).
# Samādhi ― When the yogin sustains focus on the &quot;pratyaya&quot; and minimizes self-consciousness&quot;, dhyāna&quot; transforms into samādhi, where the yogin fuses with the &quot;pratyaya&quot;. Patanjali compares this to a transparent jewel on a coloured surface: the jewel takes on the colour of the surface. Similarly, in &quot;samādhi&quot;, the consciousness of the yogin fuses with the object of thought, the &quot;pratyaya&quot;. The &quot;pratyaya&quot; is like the coloured surface, and the yogin&#x27;s consciousness is like the transparent jewel.

==== &quot;Samādhi&quot; in the Yoga Sūtras ====
Samādhi is oneness with the object of meditation. There is no distinction between act of meditation and the object of meditation. Samādhi is of two kinds, with and without support of an object of meditation:

* Samprajñata samādhi (also called &quot;savikalpa samādhi&quot; and &quot;sabija samādhi&quot;,) refers to &quot;samādhi&quot; with the support of an object of meditation. In Sutra 1:17 Patanjali tells us that &quot;samprajnata samādhi&quot; comprises four stages: &quot;complete high consciousness (samprajnata samādhi) is that which is accompanied by vitarka (deliberation), vicara (reflection), &quot;ānanda&quot; (ecstasy), and &quot;asmitā&quot; (a sense of &#x27;I&#x27;-ness)&quot;.

:The first two, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of &quot;samāpatti&quot;:
:* &quot;Savitarka&quot;, &quot;deliberative&quot;: The mind, &quot;citta&quot;, is concentrated upon a gross object of meditation, an object with a manifest appearance that is perceptible to our senses, such as a flame of a lamp, the tip of the nose, or the image of a deity. Conceptualization (&quot;vikalpa&quot;) still takes place, in the form of perception, the word and the knowledge of the object of meditation. When deliberation ends, this is called &quot;nirvitarka samāpatti&quot;, where the mind transcends cognitive perception and consciousness directly encounters true reality.
:* &quot;Savichara&quot;, &quot;reflective&quot;: the mind, &quot;citta&quot;, is concentrated upon a subtle object of meditation, which is not perceptible to the senses, but arrived at through inference, such as the senses, the process of cognition, the mind, the I-am-ness, the &quot;chakra&quot;s, the inner-breath (&quot;prana&quot;), the &quot;nadi&quot;s, the intellect (&quot;buddhi&quot;). Baba Hari Dass noted that in &quot;savichāra samādhi&quot; mind principally reflects the subtle objects of the senses (tanmātra) and their characteristics of space (&quot;deśha&quot;) and time (&quot;kāla&quot;), as well as their causation (&quot;nimitta&quot;) via the sense of &quot;I-am-ness&quot;. The stilling of reflection is called &quot;nirvichara samāpatti&quot;.

:The last two associations, &quot;sānanda samādhi&quot; and &quot;sāsmitā&quot;, are respectively a state of meditation, and an object of &quot;savichara samādhi&quot;:
:* &quot;Ānanda&quot;, &quot;with bliss&quot;: also known as &quot;supreme bliss&quot;, or &quot;with ecstasy&quot;, this state emphasizes the still subtler state of bliss in meditation; &quot;ānanda&quot; is free from vitarka and vicara.
:* &quot;Āsmitā&quot;, &quot;with egoity&quot;: the citta is concentrated upon the sense or feeling of &quot;I-am-ness&quot;.

*Asamprajñata samādhi (also called &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; and &quot;nirbija samādhi&quot;) refers to &quot;samādhi&quot; without the support of an object of meditation, which leads to knowledge of &quot;purusha&quot; or consciousness, the subtlest element.

==== &quot;Samprajñata samādhi&quot; ====
According to Paramahansa Yogananda, in this state one lets go of the ego and becomes aware of Spirit beyond creation. The soul is then able to absorb the fire of Spirit-Wisdom that &quot;roasts&quot; or destroys the seeds of body-bound inclinations. The soul as the meditator, its state of meditation, and the Spirit as the object of meditation all become one. The separate wave of the soul meditating in the ocean of Spirit becomes merged with the Spirit. The soul does not lose its identity, but only expands into Spirit. In savikalpa samādhi the mind is conscious only of the Spirit within; it is not conscious of the exterior world. The body is in a trancelike state, but the consciousness is fully perceptive of its blissful experience within.

Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell, founder of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, has compared the experience of seeing the earth from space, also known as the overview effect, to &quot;savikalpa samādhi&quot;.

===== &quot;Ānanda&quot; and &quot;asmitā&quot; =====
According to Ian Whicher, the status of &quot;ānanda&quot; and &quot;āsmitā&quot; in Patanjali&#x27;s system is a matter of dispute. According to Maehle, the first two constituents, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of &quot;samāpatti&quot;. According to Feuerstein:
Ian Whicher disagrees with Feuerstein, seeing &quot;ānanda&quot; and &quot;asmitā&quot; as later stages of &quot;nirvicara-samāpatti&quot;. Whicher refers to Vācaspati Miśra (900–980 CE), the founder of the Bhāmatī Advaita Vedanta who proposes eight types of &quot;samāpatti&quot;:
* &quot;Savitarka-samāpatti&quot; and &quot;nirvitarka-samāpatti&quot;, both with gross objects as objects of support;
* &quot;Savicāra-samāpatti&quot; and &quot;nirvicāra-samāpatti&quot;, both with subtle objects as objects of support;
* &quot;Sānanda-samāpatti&quot; and &quot;nirānanda-samāpatti&quot;, both with the sense organs as objects of support
* &quot;Sāsmitā-samāpatti&quot; and &quot;nirasmitā-samāpatti&quot;, both with the sense of &quot;I-am-ness&quot; as support.

Vijnana Bikshu (c. 1550–1600) proposes a six-stage model, explicitly rejecting Vacaspati Misra&#x27;s model. Vijnana Bikshu regards joy (&quot;ānanda&quot;) as a state that arises when the mind passes beyond the &quot;vicara&quot; stage. Whicher agrees that &quot;ānanda&quot; is not a separate stage of &quot;samādhi&quot;. According to Whicher, Patanjali&#x27;s own view seems to be that &quot;nirvicara-samādhi&quot; is the highest form of cognitive ecstasy.

According to Sarasvati Buhrman, &quot;Babaji once explained that when people feel blissful sensations during sādhanā, on a gross level the breath is equal in both nostrils, and on the subtle level pranic flow in &quot;ida&quot; and &quot;pingala&quot; nadis is balanced. This is called the sushumna breath because the residual prana of the sushuma, the kundalini, flows in sushumna nadi, causing sattva guna to dominate. &quot;It creates a feeling of peace. That peace is ānanda&quot;. In &quot;sānanda samādhi&quot; the experience of that ānanda, that sattvic flow, is untainted by any other vrittis, or thoughts, save the awareness of the pleasure of receiving that bliss&quot;.

==== &quot;Asamprajñata samādhi&quot; ====
According to Maehle, &quot;asamprajñata samādhi&quot; (also called &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; and &quot;nirbija samādhi&quot;) leads to knowledge of &quot;purusha&quot; or consciousness, the subtlest element. Heinrich Zimmer distinguishes &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; from other states as follows:
Swami Sivananda describes &quot;nirbija samādhi&quot; (lit. &quot;samādhi&quot; without seeds) as follows:
=== &quot;Sahaja samadhi&quot; ===
Ramana Maharshi distinguished between &quot;kevala nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and &quot;sahaja nirvikalpa samādhi&quot;:
&quot;Kevala nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; is temporary, whereas &quot;sahaja nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; is a continuous state throughout daily activity. This state seems inherently more complex than &quot;sāmadhi&quot;, since it involves several aspects of life, namely external activity, internal quietude, and the relation between them. It also seems to be a more advanced state, since it comes after the mastering of &quot;samādhi&quot;.

&quot;Sahaja&quot; is one of the four keywords of the Nath sampradaya along with Svecchachara, Sama, and Samarasa. &quot;Sahaja&quot; meditation and worship was prevalent in Tantric traditions common to Hinduism and Buddhism in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries.

=== &quot;Nirvikalpaka yoga&quot; ===
&quot;Nirvikalpaka yoga&quot; is a term in the philosophical system of Shaivism, in which, through &quot;samādhi&quot;, there is a complete identification of the &quot;I&quot; and Shiva, in which the very concepts of name and form disappear and Shiva alone is experienced as the real Self. In that system, this experience occurs when there is complete cessation of all thought-constructs.

=== &quot;Bhāva samādhi&quot; ===
&quot;Bhāva samādhi&quot; is a state of ecstatic consciousness that can sometimes be a seemingly spontaneous experience, but is recognized generally to be the culmination of long periods of devotional practices. It is believed by some groups to be evoked through the presence of &quot;higher beings&quot;. &quot;Bhāva samādhi&quot; has been experienced by notable figures in Indian spiritual history, including Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and some of his disciples, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his chief disciple Nityananda, Mirabai and numerous saints in the &quot;bhakti&quot; tradition.

=== &quot;Mahāsamādhi&quot; ===
In Hindu or Yogic traditions, &quot;mahāsamādhi&quot;, the &quot;great&quot; and final &quot;samādhi&quot;, is the act of consciously and intentionally leaving one&#x27;s body at the moment of death. According to this belief, a realized and liberated (Jivanmukta) yogi or yogini who has attained the state of &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; can consciously exit from their body and attain liberation at the moment of death while in a deep, conscious meditative state.

Some individuals have, according to their followers, declared the day and time of their &quot;mahāsamādhi&quot; beforehand. These include Lahiri Mahasaya whose death on September 26, 1895, was of this nature, according to Paramahansa Yogananda. Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s own death on March 7, 1952, was described by his followers as entering &quot;mahāsamādhi&quot;. Daya Mata, one of Yogananda&#x27;s direct disciples, said that Yogananda on the previous evening had asked her &quot;Do you realize that it is just a matter of hours and I will be gone from this earth?&quot;

=== Samadhi in the Bhagavad Gita ===
The Bhagavad Gita describes samadhi as the ultimate state of spiritual realization, marked by profound steadiness of mind and deep absorption in the true self. This state emerges when one transcends attachments to worldly pleasures and power (verse 2.44) and achieves a resolute, unwavering intellect fixed in spiritual truth, free from confusion (verse 2.53).

=== Buddhist influences ===
Patanjali&#x27;s description of &quot;samādhi&quot; resembles the Buddhist &quot;jhānas&quot;. According to Jianxin Li, &quot;samprajñata samādhi&quot; may be compared to the &quot;rūpa jhāna&quot;s of Buddhism. This interpretation may conflict with Gombrich and Wynne, according to whom the first and second &quot;jhāna&quot; represent concentration, whereas the third and fourth &quot;jhāna&quot; combine concentration with mindfulness. According to Eddie Crangle, the first &quot;jhāna&quot; resembles Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;samprajñata samādhi&quot;, which both share the application of &quot;vitarka&quot; and &quot;vicara&quot;.

According to David Gordon White, the language of the &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot; is often closer to &quot;Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, the Sanskrit of the early Mahāyana Buddhist scriptures, than to the classical Sanskrit of other Hindu scriptures&quot;. According to Karel Werner:
Robert Thurman writes that Patañjali was influenced by the success of the Buddhist monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox. However, the Yoga Sutra, especially the fourth segment of Kaivalya Pada, contains several polemical verses critical of Buddhism, particularly the Vijñānavāda school of Vasubandhu.

While Patañjali was influenced by Buddhism, and incorporated Buddhist thought and terminology, the term &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; is unusual in a Buddhist context, though some authors have equated &quot;nirvikalpa samādhi&quot; with the formless jhānas and/or &quot;nirodha samāpatti&quot;.

A similar term, &#x27;, is found in the Buddhist Yogacara tradition, and is translated by Edward Conze as &quot;undifferentiated cognition&quot;. Conze notes that, in Yogacara, only the actual experience of &#x27; can prove the reports given of it in scriptures. He describes the term as used in the Yogacara context as follows:
 A different sense in Buddhist usage occurs in the Sanskrit expression &#x27; (Pali: &#x27;) that means &quot;makes free from uncertainty (or false discrimination)&quot; i.e. &quot;distinguishes, considers carefully&quot;.

== Sikhism ==
In Sikhism the word is used to refer to an action that one uses to remember and fix one&#x27;s mind and soul on Waheguru. The Sri Guru Granth Sahib informs:
* &quot;Remember in meditation the Almighty Lord, every moment and every instant; meditate on God in the celestial peace of Samādhi.&quot; (p. 508)
* &quot;I am attached to God in celestial Samādhi.&quot; (p. 865)
* &quot;The most worthy Samādhi is to keep the consciousness stable and focused on Him.&quot; (p. 932)

The term &quot;Samadhi&quot; refers to a state of mind rather than a physical position of the body. The Scriptures explain:
* &quot;I am absorbed in celestial Samādhi, lovingly attached to the Lord forever. I live by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord&quot; (p. 1232)
* &quot;Night and day, they ravish and enjoy the Lord within their hearts; they are intuitively absorbed in Samadhi. ||2||&quot; (p. 1259)

The Sikh Gurus inform their followers:
* &quot;Some remain absorbed in Samādhi, their minds fixed lovingly on the One Lord; they reflect only on the Word of the Shabad.&quot; (p. 503)

<doc id="147614" wikidata="Q4991503" url="?curid=147614" title="Kyuss">
<text>Kyuss ( ) was an American stoner rock band formed in Palm Desert, California, in 1987, and considered one of the pioneers of the genre. After disbanding in 1995, a number of band members have gone on to form or play in several notable bands including Queens of the Stone Age, Screaming Trees, Fu Manchu, Dwarves, Eagles of Death Metal, Mondo Generator, Hermano, Unida, Slo Burn and Them Crooked Vultures.

In November 2010, three former members of the band (minus Homme, who declined to participate) reunited under the adapted moniker &quot;Kyuss Lives!&quot; for a world tour with plans to record a new album. A federal lawsuit subsequently filed by Homme resulted in Oliveri leaving the band in March 2012. Five months later, a court ruled that Garcia and Bjork were not allowed to release audio recordings under the Kyuss Lives! moniker. As a result, they changed their name to Vista Chino.

==History==

===As Katzenjammer and Sons of Kyuss (1987–1991)===
The band formed in 1987 jamming under the name Katzenjammer (German slangword for &quot;Hangover&quot; [&quot;archaic&quot;], literally &quot;moaning of a cat&quot;) before eventually deciding upon Sons of Kyuss. Brant Bjork selected the name from the undead monster found in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. In 1989 the band recorded their eponymous debut EP, &quot;Sons of Kyuss&quot;, which was their only release to feature Chris Cockrell on bass. After self-releasing the EP in 1990, the band recruited Nick Oliveri – who had previously played second guitar in Katzenjammer – to replace Cockrell on bass, and shortened their name to Kyuss.

===As Kyuss (1991–1995)===

Kyuss&#x27; first line-up consisted of vocalist John Garcia, guitarist Josh Homme, bassist Nick Oliveri and drummer Brant Bjork. The band gradually built a local following in Palm Desert, California and frequently performed at parties in and around the isolated towns of Southern California&#x27;s desert areas. These impromptu and predominantly outdoor shows, referred to locally as &quot;generator parties&quot;, consisted of small crowds of people, beer drinking, and the use of gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for the equipment. Homme commented that playing in the desert &quot;was the shaping factor for the band&quot; noting that &quot;there&#x27;s no clubs here, so you can only play for free. If people don&#x27;t like you, they&#x27;ll tell you. You can&#x27;t suck.&quot;

The band then signed with independent record label Dali, a subsidiary of the Elektra Records-distributed Chameleon Records, who released their debut album, &quot;Wretch&quot;, in September 1991. Several songs on the album were re-recorded versions of those that appeared on the &quot;Sons of Kyuss&quot; EP. Album sales were sluggish, though the band was quickly making a name for itself as a live act. Guitarist Josh Homme soon gained a reputation for his unique downtuned, psychedelic style of guitar playing, and his convention of playing electric guitars through bass guitar amplifiers to create a bass-heavy sound.

In 1992, the band, along with new producer Chris Goss, began work on their next album, &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot;. Goss understood the band, and was able to accurately capture their live sound in the studio. Released in June that year, the album was critically hailed and is today widely regarded as a pioneering stoner rock record. By the end of 1993, they were invited to open nine dates for Metallica touring Australia. Comparisons to stoner rock godfathers Black Sabbath became common, though Homme claimed to have little knowledge of the band at the time but Bjork asserted he and Oliveri were hugely influenced by the British group. Oliveri left the band following completion of the album and Scott Reeder, who had been approached about joining Kyuss five to six months earlier during a West Coast tour with The Obsessed, made his debut at the release party for &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot;.

In 1993, Kyuss were moved from Dali to the main Chameleon label, and recorded their third album, &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley.&quot; Once again produced by Chris Goss, it demonstrated a much more psychedelic and mature sound. However, personal problems emerged and drummer Brant Bjork left the band following completion of the recording sessions. Bjork cited his extreme distaste for touring, particularly band relationship problems that develop during long periods on the road. He was replaced by Alfredo Hernández, who had previously played with Reeder in the band Across the River during the mid-80s. The album was initially scheduled to be released in January 1994, but Chameleon went under in November 1993. Elektra opted to pick up the band&#x27;s contract from Chameleon, and issued the album in June 1994 to critical acclaim. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot;, reached number 78 on the UK Singles Chart.

In July 1995, Kyuss released their fourth and final album, &quot;...And the Circus Leaves Town.&quot; The band&#x27;s only album recorded for a major label, it featured a simpler sound, in contrast to the instrumentally based &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot;. &quot;One Inch Man&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s only single in June 1995, and a music video was also made for the song. The album was not as successful commercially as &quot;Sky Valley&quot;, receiving mixed reviews. Kyuss broke up during the late summer of 1995.

After the band&#x27;s breakup in 1995, there had been frequent and persistent speculation among fans regarding the possibility of a Kyuss reunion. When asked in late 2004 about whether the band would ever re-unite, Homme replied that this was unlikely to happen in the near future. However, on December 20, 2005, Garcia made a guest appearance onstage with Queens of the Stone Age during their encore at the Wiltern LG in Los Angeles. They performed three Kyuss songs together: &quot;Thumb&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop&quot;. The band has reportedly received numerous offers to reform, all of which have been turned down:

Scott Reeder also commented on a possible Kyuss reunion in early 2008, saying &quot;I think everyone but Josh would do it in a heartbeat&quot;. Reeder also noted that he would &quot;do it for free beer again&quot;.

===Post-breakup (1996–present)===
Shortly after the breakup, Homme toured as the rhythm guitarist with Screaming Trees and began work on ongoing The Desert Sessions recording series. In December 1997, a transitional split EP was released, featuring three songs by Kyuss (the Black Sabbath cover &quot;Into the Void,&quot; &quot;Fatso Forgotso&quot;, and &quot;Flip the Phase&quot;) and three songs by Queens of the Stone Age (&quot;If Only Everything&quot;, &quot;Born to Hula&quot; and &quot;Spiders &amp; Vinegaroons&quot;). Homme and Hernandez formed Queens of the Stone Age in 1998, and recruited Oliveri as bassist after completion of their debut album.

Hernandez later played with Yawning Man, Ché and Orquesta del Desierto, while Oliveri formed the band Mondo Generator, named after the only Kyuss song credited solely (words and music) to him. Drummer Brant Bjork went on to form the band Brant Bjork and the Bros, recorded and performed with Fu Manchu and Mondo Generator, and has recorded several solo albums.

John Garcia went on to form Slo Burn, although the band was short-lived and released only one EP, &quot;Amusing the Amazing&quot;, before disbanding in September 1997. He was also briefly associated with the band Karma to Burn. In 1998, he began working with the band Unida, recording one EP, one LP and an unreleased album. At the same time he started working with the band Hermano, having released three LP&#x27;s and one live album to date. Garcia had more recently been working on a solo album.

In 1997, Homme, Bjork, and Oliveri recorded three songs together (&quot;13th Floor&quot;, &quot;Simple Exploding Man&quot;, &amp; &quot;Cocaine Rodeo&quot;) for Mondo Generator&#x27;s debut album &quot;Cocaine Rodeo&quot;, released in 2000. Also featuring Garcia and Chris Goss on one track, the songs are regarded by many fans as the true final Kyuss recordings.

In 2000, a compilation album, &quot;Muchas Gracias: The Best of Kyuss&quot;, was released. The album is a collection of the band&#x27;s singles, as well as B-sides and live material.

Although Kyuss left behind some &quot;rarities&quot;, many of them were released on &quot;Muchas Gracias&quot;, and further releases from the band appear unlikely. Singer John Garcia told &quot;Billboard&quot; in a 2005 interview:

In 2010, a European &quot;John Garcia plays Kyuss&quot; tour was announced. In June 2010, former Kyuss members Nick Oliveri and Brant Bjork joined Garcia onstage to perform &quot;Green Machine&quot; and &quot;Gardenia&quot; during a headlining appearance by &quot;Garcia Plays Kyuss&quot; at Hellfest in Clisson, France, and they also appeared onstage with Garcia in other concerts on the tour.

In November 2010, Garcia, Oliveri and Bjork announced plans to tour under the moniker &quot;Kyuss Lives!&quot; with guitarist Bruno Fevery. In reference to the new band name, Garcia stated that &quot;there is never going to be a Kyuss without Josh Homme&quot; and that &quot;hopefully in the future him and I can get together and do some writing.&quot; The band went on to tour Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. The band then announced plans to record a new studio album for a summer 2012 release in addition to a live album.

However, in March 2012, it was revealed that Josh Homme, after persuading bassist Scott Reeder to support him, had filed a federal lawsuit against John Garcia and Brant Bjork alleging &quot;trademark infringement and consumer fraud&quot; over the use of the Kyuss name despite the fact Brant Bjork had originally created the name. Nick Oliveri left the project later that month after it was revealed that Garcia and Bjork had tried to take control of the Kyuss trademark.

In August 2012, the courts ruled that Garcia and Bjork could not release any recordings, studio or live, under the Kyuss Lives! moniker. While they were allowed to continue using the moniker for live shows (as long as, unlike the band&#x27;s current logo, Lives! is written in the same size and next to the word Kyuss to avoid confusion), the judge stated that they may face issues in the future and that &quot;it may be in Defendants&#x27; best interest to begin re-branding under a new name&quot;. On November 29, 2012, it was announced that Kyuss Lives! had changed their name to Vista Chino.

In July 2020, Homme stated that he was open to the possibility of participating in a Kyuss reunion. &quot;There have been times I thought it cannot end that way, and the only real way to end it correctly now would be to play.&quot; In 2021, Bjork stated he had reached out to Homme in regards to his comments, however, the probability of a reunion has been put into question due to a lack of communication from Homme.

<doc id="147615" wikidata="Q503126" url="?curid=147615" title="Raphael Holinshed">
<text>Raphael Holinshed (; before 24 April 1582) was an English chronicler, who was most famous for his work on &quot;The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande&quot;, commonly known as &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;. It was the &quot;first complete printed history of England composed as a continuous narrative&quot;. The &quot;Holinshed Chronicles&quot; was a major influence on many Renaissance writers, such as Shakespeare, Spenser, Daniel and Marlowe.

==Biography==
Little is known about Holinshed&#x27;s life and for the most part his early years are primarily a matter of speculation. Holinshed was most likely born to Ralph Holinshed of Cophurst in Sutton Downes, Cheshire. The date of his birth is unknown. Holinshed is assumed to have received an education from student records from Christ&#x27;s College in Cambridge, which show a student under the name Holinshed attending the college from 1544 to 1545. In his later years, he lived in London where he worked as a translator for the printer Reginald Wolfe. Wolfe gave him the project of compiling a world history from the Flood to the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Holinshed was only one contributor to this work; others involved in its production included George Bishop, John Hunne and Lucus Harrison.

Vernon Snow, an author who writes an introduction to &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; in the later edition, remarks that Holinshed was an experienced Cambridge-educated translator. As far as anyone knows, no other known works by Holinshed are available. A few months after the &quot;Chronicles&quot; had been licensed, Holinshed retired to the countryside near Warwick where he died around 1580. His will was proven on 24 April 1582, leaving his belongings and estate to a Mr. Burdet, whom he referred to as his master. &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; was published soon after his death.

==&quot;Holinshed&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Chronicles&quot;==

The idea for &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; was born from Reginald Wolfe. A London printer, Wolfe was one of the original members of the Royal Stationers&#x27; Company. In 1548, Wolfe conceived the idea of creating a &quot;Universal Cosmography of the whole world, and there with also certain particular histories of every known nation&quot;. He wanted the work to be printed in English and he wanted maps and illustrations in the book as well. Wolfe acquired many of John Leland&#x27;s works and with these he constructed chronologies and drew maps that were up to date. This took over 24 years of his life; however, when Wolfe realised he could not complete this project on his own, he hired Raphael Holinshed and William Harrison to assist him.
Wolfe died with the work still uncompleted in 1573, and the project, changed to a work about Britain (England and Scotland) and Ireland, was run by a consortium of three members of the London stationers. They kept Raphael Holinshed, who employed William Harrison, Richard Stanyhurst, Edmund Campion and John Hooker. In 1577, the work was published in two volumes after some censorship by the Privy Council of some of Stanyhurst&#x27;s contribution on Ireland.

A second edition was issued in 1587 (which also included many woodcut illustrations to go along with the chronicles), but it contained some passages that were considered offensive to the Queen and her ministers. The pages in question were removed by order of the Privy Council. The missing passages were separately published in 1723, and a complete reprint appeared in 1807. &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; was an &quot;extremely popular work when it was first published,&quot; but &quot;by the seventeenth century it was already considered outdated and inaccurate&quot;, losing its popularity and credibility.

William Shakespeare used the revised second edition of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; (published in 1587) as the source for most of his historical plays, such as &quot;Richard III&quot;, the plot of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and portions of &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. According to Alison Taufer, &quot;We care about the &quot;Holinshed Chronicles&quot; because Shakespeare read them&quot;. It is because of Shakespeare&#x27;s writing that the public was educated on many important points in history. While dramatised, the innate messages behind the history are portrayed through the history plays.
* King Lear – &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; goes into depth about Welsh king Llŷr from the 8th century BCE, which accurately describes the plot of &quot;King Lear&quot;. The king&#x27;s madness is Shakespeare&#x27;s own creation; the rest of the play follows &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; closely, such as the emphasis on Cordelia&#x27;s love for her father. The added dramatics, however, are what make the play an effective popular piece of culture.
* Macbeth – &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; retells the story of Duncan of Scotland and his reign. It is now believed that King Duncan is based on a legend rather than an actual king. Holinshed&#x27;s Duncan is characterized as a weak king with a &quot;soft and gentle nature&quot;, while Macbeth is a cruel leader. Shakespeare, in contrast, gives Lady Macbeth a larger role in his play and included her sleepwalking habits and suicidal thoughts into his characterisation.

=== Marlowe ===
* Edward II – Like Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe was greatly inspired by the &quot;Chronicles&quot;, particularly in &quot;Edward II&quot;. Details he borrows from the story include class issues and inheritance and details of Edward II&#x27;s brutal murder at Berkeley Castle.

<text>William Harrison (18 April 1534 – 24 April 1593) was an English clergyman, whose &quot;Description of England&quot; was produced as part of the publishing venture of a group of London stationers who produced Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; (1577 and 1587). His contribution to Holinshed&#x27;s work drew heavily on the earlier work of John Leland.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Harrison was born in London, in the parish of St. Thomas the Apostle, to John and Anne Harrison. As a boy, Harrison attended St Paul&#x27;s School and the Westminster School of Alexander Nowell. Raised in Protestant circles, Harrison entered Christ Church, Oxford and in 1560 was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s degree. During the reign of Queen Mary I of England, Christ Church became a centre of Catholic support, and Harrison converted to Catholicism. Harrison claimed that he returned to Protestant belief before Mary&#x27;s death in 1558 after hearing the words of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, three Protestant martyrs burned at the stake in Oxford.

===Adulthood===
On 15 February 1559, prior to the award of his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Oxford, Harrison was instituted as the rector of Radwinter in Essex, by the appointment of Lord Cobham, who owned the right, and to whom he was also household chaplain. The living brought with it an income of £40 a year. Despite being well known to posterity for his description of England, at this time he had only travelled within a small compass in the south of England.

Harrison married Marion Isebrand, the daughter of Flemish immigrants. Continuing his theological studies at Cambridge, Harrison took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1571. In the same year he was instituted vicar of Wimbish in Essex. Harrison also held positions at another two London parishes. Near the end of his life, Harrison received an appointment as a canon at St. George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor. Harrison was buried at Windsor following his death in 1593.

==Works==
Harrison is best known for his &quot;Description of England&quot;, first published in 1577 as part of &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, and reissued in revised form in 1587. This work enumerated England&#x27;s geographic, economic, social, religious and political features and represents an important source for historians interested in life in Elizabethan England. He gathered his facts from books, letters, maps, the notes of John Leland, and conversations with antiquaries and local historians like his friends John Stow and William Camden. He also used his own observation, experience and wit, and wrote in a conversational tone without pedantry, which has made the work a classic. The result is a compendium of Elizabethan England during the youth of William Shakespeare. &quot;No work of the time contains so vivid and picturesque a sketch,&quot; was the assessment of &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot;.

Harrison also wrote a number of unpublished manuscripts, including &quot;The Great English Chronologie&quot;. This work traced fortunes of the Christian church in history, stretching from creation to his own time. In the &quot;Chronologie&quot;, Harrison revealed his sympathy with the Calvinist perspective of those seeking to reform the Church of England. At the same time, Harrison also indicated his distrust of the political intentions of England&#x27;s Puritans and his ultimate loyalty to England&#x27;s ecclesiastical authorities.

<doc id="147618" wikidata="Q60811" url="?curid=147618" title="Ernst Zündel">
<text>Ernst Christof Friedrich Zündel (; 24 April 1939 – 5 August 2017) was a German neo-Nazi publisher and pamphleteer of Holocaust denial literature. He was jailed several times: in Canada for publishing literature &quot;likely to incite hatred against an identifiable group&quot;, and on charges of being a threat to national security; in the United States, for overstaying his visa; and in Germany for charges of &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot;. He lived in Canada from 1958 to 2000.

In 1977, Zündel founded a small press publishing house called Samisdat Publishers, which issued such neo-Nazi pamphlets as his co-authored &quot;The Hitler We Loved and Why&quot; and Richard Verrall&#x27;s &quot;Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth At Last&quot;, which were both significant documents to the Holocaust denial movement.

On 5 February 2003, Ernst Zündel was detained by local police in the U.S. and deported to Canada, where he was detained for two years on a security certificate for being a foreign national considered a threat to national security pending a court decision on the validity of the certificate. Once the certificate was upheld, he was deported to Germany and tried in the state court of Mannheim on outstanding charges of incitement of Holocaust denial dating from the early 1990s. On February 15, 2007, he was convicted and sentenced to the maximum term of five years in prison. All these imprisonments and prosecutions were for inciting hatred against an identifiable group. He was released on March 1, 2010.

==Background==
Zündel was born in Calmbach (now part of Bad Wildbad) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, in 1939 and was raised mostly by his mother, Gertrude. His father, Fritz, a lumberjack, was drafted into the German Army shortly after Ernst&#x27;s birth and served as a medic on the Eastern Front. His father was captured and incarcerated as a prisoner of war and did not return home until 1947, by which time he had become an alcoholic. Ernst was the fourth in a family of six children consisting of a brother, who later became a lawyer in the United States, and four sisters.

He studied graphic art at trade school, graduating in 1957 and emigrated to Canada in 1958, when he was 19, to avoid conscription by the German military. In 1960, he married French-Canadian Janick Larouche, whom he met in a language class in Toronto, and with whom he had sons Pierre and Hans. The couple moved to Montreal in 1961, where Zündel would eventually come under the tutelage of Canadian fascist politician Adrien Arcand.

Professionally, Zündel worked as a graphic artist, photographer, photo retoucher, and printer. He got his first job in the art department at Simpson-Sears in Toronto before opening his own art studio in Montreal. In 1969, he moved back to Toronto, where he founded Great Ideas Advertising, a commercial art studio. On several occasions in the 1960s he was commissioned to illustrate covers for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. His controversial views were not well known in the 1960s and 1970s, since he published his opinions under the pseudonym Christof Friedrich. At the time, he was also an organizer among immigrants for the Ralliement des créditistes, Quebec&#x27;s Social Credit party. In 1968, he joined the Liberal Party of Canada and ran in that year&#x27;s Liberal leadership convention under the anglicized name Ernest Zundel as a self-described &quot;nuisance candidate&quot;, running on an &quot;immigrant rights&quot; platform. He used his candidacy to campaign against anti-German attitudes. He dropped out of the contest prior to the election, but not before delivering his campaign speech to the convention. 

Under his Friedrich pseudonym, he wrote a preface to Savitri Devi&#x27;s Nazi-Esoteric book &quot;The Lightning and the Sun&quot;. 

Zündel gained prominence during the 1970s as spokesman for Concerned Parents of German Descent, a group that claimed German-Canadians and their children were the target of discrimination due to anti-German stereotyping in the media. In the late 1970s, Zündel, as the group&#x27;s spokesman, issued press releases protesting the NBC &quot;Holocaust&quot; miniseries for its depiction of Germans. In the late 1970s, reporter Mark Bonokoski unmasked Zündel and ended his career as a credible media spokesperson by revealing that he was publishing neo-Nazi and antisemitic pamphlets such as &quot;The Hitler We Loved and Why&quot; under the pseudonym Christof Friedrich.

In 1994, Zündel campaigned in Canada to ban the movie &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; as &quot;hate speech&quot; and celebrated the movie being banned in Malaysia and effectively banned in Lebanon and Jordan.

On 8 May 1995, his Toronto residence was the target of an arson attack, resulting in $400,000 in damage. A group calling itself the &quot;Jewish Armed Resistance Movement&quot; claimed responsibility for the arson attack; according to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, the group had ties to extremist organizations, including the Jewish Defense League and Kahane Chai. The leader of the Toronto wing of the Jewish Defense League, Meir Weinstein (known then as Meir Halevi), denied involvement in the attack; however, five days later, Weinstein and American JDL leader Irv Rubin were caught trying to break into the Zündel property, where they were apprehended by police. No charges were ever filed in the incident. Weeks after the fire, Zündel was targeted with a parcel bomb that was detonated by the Toronto Police bomb squad. The investigation into the parcel bomb attack led to charges being laid against David Barbarash, an animal rights activist based in British Columbia, but they were eventually stayed.

== Holocaust denial ==

His publishing company, Samisdat Publishers, disseminated neo-Nazi literature, including Zündel&#x27;s &quot;The Hitler We Loved and Why&quot;, Richard Verrall&#x27;s &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;, and works by Malcolm Ross.

By the early 1980s, Samisdat Publishers had grown into a worldwide distributor of Nazi and neo-Nazi posters, audiotapes, and memorabilia, as well as pamphlets and books devoted to Holocaust denial and what he claimed were Allied and Israeli war crimes. He purportedly had a mailing list of 29,000 in the United States alone. Advertisement space for Samisdat Publishers was purchased in well-known reputable American magazines and even comic books. West Germany became another large market, in violation of West German &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; (incitement of the masses) laws preventing Holocaust denial and dissemination of Nazi and neo-Nazi material, with Samisdat going so far as to send mass mailings to every member of the West German Bundestag (parliament).

In December 1980, the West German Federal Ministry of Finance told the Bundestag that between January 1978 and December 1979, &quot;200 shipments of right-wing content, including books, periodicals, symbols, decorations, films, cassettes, and records&quot; had been intercepted entering West Germany; these shipments &quot;came overwhelmingly from Canada.&quot; On 23 April 1981, the West German government sent a letter to the Canadian Jewish Congress, confirming that the source of the material was Samisdat Publishers.

From 1981 to 1982, Zündel had his mailing privileges suspended by the Canadian government on the grounds that he had been using the mail to send hate propaganda, a criminal offence in Canada. Zündel then began shipping from a post office box in Niagara Falls, New York, until the ban on his mailing in Canada was lifted in January 1983.

== Holocaust denial trials in the 1980s ==

In 1983, Sabina Citron, a Holocaust survivor and founder of the Canadian Holocaust Remembrance Association, filed a private complaint against Zündel before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. In 1984, the Ontario government joined the criminal proceedings against Zündel based on Citron&#x27;s complaint. Zündel was charged under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news by publishing &quot;Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth At Last&quot;.

Zündel underwent two criminal trials in 1985 and 1988. The charge against Zündel alleged that he &quot;did publish a statement or tale, namely, &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot; that he knows is false and that is likely to cause mischief to the public interest in social and racial tolerance, contrary to the Criminal Code&quot;. After a much publicized trial in 1985, Zündel was found guilty. One of the prosecution witnesses, Auschwitz survivor Arnold Friedman, a Holocaust educator in Toronto, testified that &quot;prisoners marched off to the ovens never returned&quot; to which Zündel&#x27;s lawyer, Doug Christie, replied &quot;if those who disappeared might not have been led out a nearby gate&quot;. 

His conviction was later overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. Zündel was originally found guilty by two juries but was finally acquitted upon appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada which held in 1992 that section 181 (formerly known as section 177) was a violation of the guarantee of freedom of expression under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The 1988 trial relied on testimony from Holocaust deniers David Irving and Fred A. Leuchter, a self-taught execution technician. Leuchter&#x27;s testimony as an expert witness was accepted by the court, but his accompanying Leuchter report was excluded, based on his lack of engineering credentials. In 1985, key expert testimony against Zündel&#x27;s Holocaust denial was provided at great lengths by Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, who refused to testify at Zündel&#x27;s 1988 trial. Zündel was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an Ontario court; however, in 1992 in &quot;R v Zundel&quot; his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada when the law under which he had been charged, &quot;reporting false news&quot;, was ruled unconstitutional.

== Canadian Human Rights Commission; first departure from Canada==
In 1997, Zündel&#x27;s marriage with his second wife, Irene Marcarelli, ended after 18 months. She subsequently testified against him in the late 1990s when he was under investigation by the Canadian Human Rights Commission for promoting hatred against Jews via his website. In January 2000, before the commission had completed its hearings, he left Canada for Sevierville, Tennessee, in the US, where he married his third wife, Ingrid Rimland, and vowed never to return to Canada.

== Detention, deportation, and imprisonment ==

===Deportation from the United States===
In 2003, Zündel was arrested by the United States government for violating immigration rules, specifically visa waiver overstay, which he argued was a trumped up charge. After two weeks he was deported to Canada, where he was immediately jailed. A warrant for his arrest for &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; (incitement of the masses) had been issued in Germany, where he remained a citizen, in the same year. At his hearing, Zündel described himself as &quot;the Gandhi of the right&quot;.

===Detention and deportation from Canada===
Although Zündel lived in Canada for more than 40 years prior to moving to the United States, he never gained Canadian citizenship. Applications for citizenship were rejected in 1966 and 1994 for undisclosed reasons. On his return to Canada, he had no status in the country as he was not a citizen and as his landed immigrant status had been forfeited by his prolonged absence from the country. When returning to Canada, Zündel claimed refugee status in hopes of preventing his deportation to Germany. This claim elicited public ridicule; Rex Murphy, a columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and a well-known commentator on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, wrote, &quot;If Ernst Zündel is a refugee, Daffy Duck is Albert Einstein ... Some propositions are so ludicrous that they are a betrayal of common sense and human dignity if allowed a moment&#x27;s oxygen.&quot;

On May 2, 2003, Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Denis Coderre and Solicitor General Wayne Easter issued a &quot;national security certificate&quot; against Zündel under the provisions of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, indicating that he was a threat to Canada&#x27;s national security owing to his alleged links with violent neo-Nazi groups, including Aryan Nations leader Richard Girnt Butler, neo-Nazi Christian Worch, and former Canadian Aryan Nations leader Terry Long, as well as Ewald Althans, convicted in a German court in 1995 of charges that included insulting the memory of the dead and insulting the state.

Zündel moved twice to have Canadian Federal Court justice Pierre Blais recuse himself from the case for &quot;badgering and accusing the witness of lying&quot; and exhibiting &quot;open hostility&quot; towards Zündel, and filed two constitutional challenges, one in the Ontario courts and one in the federal courts, both unsuccessful. During the hearing, Zündel characterized his position as &quot;Sometimes I feel like a black man being convicted on Ku Klux Klan news clippings.&quot;

Zündel meanwhile moved to be released from detention on his own recognizance while the legal proceedings were ongoing. His lawyer, Doug Christie, introduced as a &quot;surprise witness&quot; Lorraine Day, a California doctor who practiced alternative cancer treatments, to testify that Zündel&#x27;s incarceration at Toronto&#x27;s Toronto West Detention Centre was causing his chest tumor (revealed to the court a few weeks previously) to grow and his blood pressure to rise, that the medication supplied to control his blood pressure was causing side effects such as a slow heart rate and loss of memory, and that he needed &quot;exercise, fresh air, and freedom from stress. The whole point is we need to have his high blood pressure controlled without the drug.&quot; On January 21, 2004, after three months of hearings including both public and secret testimony, Justice Blais again ruled against Zündel with a damning statement.

During his imprisonment, Canadian right-wing leader Paul Fromm attempted to hold numerous rallies in support of Zündel, both in Ontario and in Alberta. The rallies were met with formidable opposition, namely by the Anti-Racist Action group, which heightened its opposition to Fromm&#x27;s pro-Zündel work in the summer of 2004. The anti-racist efforts included participation by numerous Toronto activist groups and individuals, including Shane Ruttle Martinez and Marcell Rodden, and successfully managed to prevent similar future congregations of the neo-Nazis. Fromm eventually ceased his efforts after being advised by Zündel&#x27;s attorneys that public clashes between supporters and opponents of Zündel were not assisting the image of their client&#x27;s case.

On February 24, 2005, Justice Blais ruled that Canada could deport Zündel back to Germany at any time, and on February 25, Zündel&#x27;s lawyer, Peter Lindsay, announced that his client would not attempt to obtain a stay against the deportation and that his fight to remain in Canada was over. In his decision, Justice Blais noted that Zündel had had the opportunity to respond to the allegations of the decision of January 21 by explaining the nature of his contacts with the extremists mentioned and/or providing exonerating witnesses, but had failed to do so. Blais found that &quot;Mr. Zündel&#x27;s activities are not only a threat to Canada&#x27;s national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations.&quot;

Zündel was deported to Germany on March 1, 2005. Upon his arrival at Frankfurt airport, he was immediately arrested and detained in Mannheim prison awaiting trial for inciting racial hatred. In 2007, Zündel&#x27;s appeal to the UN Human Rights Committee against deportation was rejected, partly for his failure to exhaust all domestic remedies through a thorough defence as required by its charter, and partly because the committee ruled the case inadmissible as it did not find his rights had been violated.

=== Trial and imprisonment in Germany ===
German prosecutors charged Zündel on July 19, 2005, with 14 counts of inciting racial hatred, which is punishable under German penal code, Section 130, 2.(3) (Agitation (sedition) of the People) with up to 5 years in prison. The indictment stated Zündel &quot;denied the fate of destruction for the Jews planned by National Socialist powerholders and justified this by saying that the mass destruction in Auschwitz and Treblinka, among others, were an invention of the Jews and served the repression and extortion of the German people.&quot;

His trial was scheduled for five days beginning November 8, 2005, but ran into an early delay when Judge Ulrich Meinerzhagen ruled that lawyer Horst Mahler, whose licence to practise as a lawyer was withdrawn in 2004 and who, in January 2005, was sentenced to nine months in prison for inciting racial hatred, could not be part of the defence team. Mahler had been associated with the violent far-left Red Army Faction in the 1970s, but had since become a supporter of far-right and antisemitic groups. Zündel&#x27;s public defender Sylvia Stolz was also dismissed on the grounds that her written submissions to the court included Mahler&#x27;s ideas. On November 15, 2005, Meinerzhagen announced that the trial was to be rescheduled to allow new counsel time to prepare.

The trial resumed on February 9, 2006, for several court sessions but then adjourned on March 9 when the trial judge asked for Sylvia Stolz to be removed as Zündel&#x27;s defence lawyer after she repeatedly disrupted the trial and had to be dragged out of the court by two bailiffs. Stolz signed &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; on court motions, said the Holocaust was &quot;the biggest lie in world history,&quot; and yelled that the judge deserved the death penalty for &quot;offering succour to the enemy&quot;. In 2008, Stolz was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and stripped of her licence to practice law for five years.

The trial again resumed on June 9, 2006, and continued, intermittently, into early 2007. The prosecution concluded its case on January 26, 2007, calling for Zündel to be handed the maximum sentence of five years&#x27; imprisonment with state prosecutor Andreas Grossman calling him a &quot;political con man&quot; from whom the German people needed protection. After quoting extensively from Zündel&#x27;s writings on the Holocaust, Grossman argued &quot;[you] might as well argue that the sun rises in the West ... But you cannot change that the Holocaust has been proven.&quot; In its closing arguments the defence called for Zündel to be acquitted.

On February 15, 2007, Zündel was sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum sentence possible for violating the &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot; law in the German penal code which bans incitement of hatred against a minority of the population, which is how his Holocaust denial was interpreted by the Federal German court.

His time in pre-trial confinement in Canada was not taken into account on his sentence, but only the two years he was confined in Germany since 2005. One of his lawyers, Jürgen Rieger, a leading member of Germany&#x27;s NPD, was forbidden to voice petitions and ruled to put them down in writing; he let another lawyer read them aloud. Another lawyer read parts of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and parts of the NS race legislation aloud in his closing speech. Zündel asked for the inception of an expert&#x27;s commission to examine the Holocaust. The judge in his emotional closing speech called Zündel a &quot;&quot; (&quot;well-poisoner and arsonist, an admirer of this human-despising barbarian Adolf Hitler, of whom he rambles on with brash impertinence&quot;). Holocaust deniers used Zündel trials to claim that freedom of speech was impaired in Germany as that it depended on the ideology of the speaker.

===Release from prison===
Zündel was released on March 1, 2010, five years after his deportation to Germany. Following the end of his prison term, Canadian Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews reiterated that Zündel would not be permitted to return to Canada. &quot;In 2005, a Federal Court judge confirmed that Zündel is inadmissible on security grounds for being a danger to the security of Canada&quot;, Toews said in a written statement, adding that, &quot;The decision reinforced the government of Canada&#x27;s position that this country will not be a safe haven for individuals who pose a risk to Canada&#x27;s national security.&quot;

Zündel returned to his childhood home in the Black Forest, which had been vacant since his mother&#x27;s death in the 1990s, and lived there until his own death.

===Barred from entering the United States===
On March 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Administrative Appeals Office ruled Zündel inadmissible to the United States, rejecting his application for an immigrant visa which he had sought in order to be reunited with his wife. He was classified as inadmissible, because he has been convicted of foreign crimes for which the sentence was five years or more and a waiver deemed unwarranted due to Zündel&#x27;s &quot;history of inciting racial, ethnic, and religious hatred&quot;. Legal writer and law professor Eugene Volokh expressed the opinion that while his exclusion from the United States on hate speech grounds was not a violation of the First Amendment, it may be an incorrect application of current immigration law.

==UFOlogy==
When Zündel started Samisdat Publishers in the 1970s, he became interested in ufology when the subject was at its peak of worldwide attention. His main offerings were his own books claiming that flying saucers were secret weapons developed by the Third Reich and now based in Antarctica.

Under the pseudonyms Christof Friedrich and Mattern Friedrich, Zündel also wrote several publications promoting the idea that UFOs were craft developed by German scientists who had fled to New Swabia, Antarctica. These titles include &quot;Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions&quot; (1978) and &quot;Hitler at the South Pole&quot; (1979). He promoted the idea of Nazi secret bases in Antarctica, Nazi UFOs, secret polar bases and Hollow Earth theories.

Along with Willibald Mattern, a German living in Santiago, Chile, Zündel also wrote &quot;UFOs: Nazi Secret Weapon?&quot; on Nazi UFOs in German and translated into English.

It is not clear whether Zündel really believed these theories or whether they were merely speculative fiction.

In the Samisdat Publishers newsletter of 1978, Zündel advertised an expedition to Antarctica to find these bases and UFOs. A ticket would cost $9,999 for a seat on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth. This expedition never took place.

According to Frank Miele, a member of The Skeptics Society in the United States, Zündel told him that his book &quot;UFOs: Nazi Secret Weapon?&quot; (which became an underground bestseller, going through several printings) was nothing more than popular fiction to build publicity for Samisdat. Zündel said in a telephone conversation with Miele:
&quot;I realized that North Americans were not interested in being educated. They want to be entertained. The book was for fun. With a picture of the Führer on the cover and flying saucers coming out of Antarctica it was a chance to get on radio and TV talk shows. For about 15 minutes of an hour program I&#x27;d talk about that esoteric stuff. Then I would start talking about all those Jewish scientists in concentration camps, working on these secret weapons. And that was my chance to talk about what I wanted to talk about.&quot; &quot;In that case,&quot; I asked him, &quot;do you still stand by what you wrote in the UFO book?&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; he replied, &quot;it has a question mark at the end of the title.&quot; Zündel continued to defend these views as late as 2002.

==Ancestry==
According to &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; columnist Mark Bonokoski, Zündel&#x27;s mother was Gertrude Mayer, the daughter of Isadore and Nagal Mayer. Isadore Mayer was a trade union organizer for the garment industry in the Bavarian city of Augsburg.

According to Bonokoski, Ernst&#x27;s ex-wife, Irene Zündel, claimed that the possibility of being at least partly Jewish bothered Zündel so much that he returned to Germany in the 1960s in search of his family&#x27;s &quot;Ariernachweis&quot;, a Third Reich certificate of pure Aryan blood, but was unable to find any such document. 

In 1997, Zündel granted an interview to Tsadok Yecheskeli of the Israeli newspaper, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, that includes the following exchange:

==Death==
Zündel died at his home in Germany, of a heart attack, on August 5, 2017. He was survived by two children, and his widow Ingrid Rimland, who died on October 12, 2017.

<doc id="147619" wikidata="Q184664" url="?curid=147619" title="Tithe">
<text>A tithe (; from Old English: &quot;teogoþa&quot; &quot;tenth&quot;) is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Modern tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques or via online giving, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural produce. Church tax linked to the tax system are used in many countries to support their national church. Donations to the church beyond what is owed in the tithe, or by those attending a congregation who are not members or adherents, are known as offerings, and often are designated for specific purposes such as a building program, debt retirement, or mission work.

Many Christian denominations hold Jesus taught that tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for &quot;justice, mercy and faithfulness&quot; (cf. Matthew 23:23). Tithing was taught at early Christian church councils, including the Council of Tours in 567, as well as the Third Council of Mâcon in 585. Tithing remains an important doctrine in many Christian denominations, such as the Congregational churches, Methodist Churches and Seventh-day Adventist Church. Some Christian Churches, such as those in the Methodist tradition, teach the concept of &quot;Storehouse Tithing&quot;, which emphasizes that tithes must be prioritized and given to the local church, before offerings can be made to apostolates or charities.

Traditional Jewish law and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. Orthodox Jews commonly practice &quot;ma&#x27;aser kesafim&quot; (tithing 10% of their income to charity). In modern Israel, some religious Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., &quot;ma&#x27;aser rishon&quot;, &quot;terumat ma&#x27;aser&quot;, and &quot;ma&#x27;aser sheni&quot;.

==Ancient Near East==
None of the extant extrabiblical laws of the Ancient Near East deal with tithing, although other secondary documents show that it was a widespread practice in the Ancient Near East. William W. Hallo (1996) recognises comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment; however, as regards tithes, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is ambiguous, and Ancient Near Eastern literature provides scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes.

===The &quot;esretu&quot; – &quot;ešretū&quot; the Ugarit and Babylonian one-tenth tax===
Some specific instances of the Mesopotamian tithe, taken from &quot;The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago&quot;:
:[Referring to a ten percent tax levied on garments by the local ruler:] &quot;the palace has taken eight garments as your tithe (on 85 garments)&quot;
:&quot;...eleven garments as tithe (on 112 garments)&quot;..
:&quot;...(the sun-god) Shamash demands the tithe...&quot;
:&quot;four minas of silver, the tithe of [the gods] Bel, Nabu, and Nergal...&quot;
:&quot;...he has paid, in addition to the tithe for Ninurta, the tax of the gardiner&quot;
:&quot;...the tithe of the chief accountant, he has delivered it to [the sun-god] Shamash&quot;
:&quot;...why do you not pay the tithe to the Lady-of-Uruk?&quot;
:&quot;...(a man) owes barley and dates as balance of the tithe of the **years three and four&quot;
:&quot;...the tithe of the king on barley of the town...&quot;
:&quot;...with regard to the elders of the city whom (the king) has **summoned to (pay) tithe...&quot;
:&quot;...the collector of the tithe of the country Sumundar...&quot;
:&quot;...(the official Ebabbar in Sippar) who is in charge of the tithe...&quot;
=== Tyre and Carthage ===
According to Diodorus Siculus, the Carthaginians, who were originally Tyrian colonists, customarily sent Melqart (Heracles in Interpretatio graeca) a tenth of all that was paid into the public revenue.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Laws===
The Torah commands the giving of various agricultural tithes in various situations, specifically terumah, terumat hamaaser, the first tithe, second tithe, poor tithe, and animal tithe. Not all these &quot;tithes&quot; actually had the proportion of . These tithes are mentioned in the Books of Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

Every year, &quot;terumah&quot;, first tithe and &quot;terumat ma&#x27;aser&quot; were separated from the grain, wine and oil. (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) Terumah did not have a set amount, but the rabbis suggested it be of the crop. First tithe was of the crop. &quot;Terumah&quot; and &quot;terumat maaser&quot; were given to priests (kohanim); the first tithe was given to Levites. As priests and Levites did not own or inherit a territorial patrimony these tithes were their means of support. The Levites, in turn, separated &quot;terumat ma&#x27;aser&quot; from their tithe ( of the tithe, or of the crop).

The second tithe and poor tithe, both of the crop, were taken in an alternating basis according to the seven-year &quot;shmita&quot; cycle. In years 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the cycle, second tithe was taken. In years 3 and 6, poor tithe was taken. (In year 7, private agriculture was prohibited, all crops that grew were deemed ownerless, and no tithes taken.) The second tithe was kept by the owner, but had to be eaten at the site of the Temple. (If this was difficult, the second could be redeemed for money which would be used to buy food at the Temple site.) The poor tithe was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows, and distributed locally &quot;within thy gates&quot; to support the Levites and assist the poor.

An additional tithe, mentioned in is the cattle tithe, which is to be sacrificed as a &quot;korban&quot; at the Temple in Jerusalem.

===Stories===
Tithing is mentioned twice in the stories of the Biblical patriarchs:
* In , Abraham, after rescuing Lot, met with Melchizedek. After Melchizedek&#x27;s blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle.
* In , Jacob, after his visionary dream of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth of his possessions.

Tithing is mentioned several times in the Book of Nehemiah, which chronicles events in the latter half of the 5th century BC. outlines the customs regarding tithing. The Levites were to receive one tenth (the tithe) &quot;in all our farming communities&quot; and a tithe of the tithe were to be brought by them to the temple for storage. recounts how Eliashib gave Tobiah office space in the temple in a room that had previously been used to store tithes while Nehemaiah was away. When Nehemiah returned he called it an evil thing, threw out all Tobiah&#x27;s household items and had his rooms purified so that they could once more be used for tithes.

The Book of Malachi has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing. God (according to Malachi) promises that if the Jews begin to keep the laws of tithing, God will &quot;open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need&quot;.

==Deuterocanonical==

The deuterocanonical Book of Tobit provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the Babylonian captivity:
==Judaism==

Orthodox Jews continue to follow the biblical laws of tithes (see above) to a limited extent. As understood by the rabbis, these laws never applied and do not apply outside the Land of Israel. For produce grown in modern Israel, the tithes are separated but not given, as no Jew can prove they are a priest or Levite and thus entitled to the produce. Instead, a custom has arisen to tithe 10% of one&#x27;s earnings to charity (&quot;ma&#x27;aser kesafim&quot;).

The Mishnah and Talmud contain analysis of the first tithe, second tithe and poor tithe.

Animals are not tithed in the modern era when the Temple is not standing.

==Christianity==
Many churches practiced tithing, as it was taught by the Council of Tours in 567, and in the Third Council of Mâcon in AD 585, a penalty of excommunication was prescribed for those who did not adhere to this ecclesiastical law. Tithes can be given to the Church at once (as is the custom in many Christian countries with a church tax), or distributed throughout the year; during the part of Western Christian liturgies known as the offertory, people often place a portion of their tithes (sometimes along with additional offerings) in the collection plate.

 talks about giving cheerfully, encourages giving what one can afford, discusses giving weekly (although this is a saved amount for Jerusalem), exhorts supporting the financial needs of Christian workers, promotes feeding the hungry wherever they may be and states that pure religion is to help widows and orphans.

According to a 2018 study by LifeWay Research that interviewed 1,010 Americans, 86% of people with Evangelical beliefs say that tithe is still a biblical commandment. Of those surveyed, 87% of Baptist believers, 86% of Pentecostal believers, 81% of Non-denominational believers share this position.

===Denominational positions===
====Adventist churches====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches in its Fundamental Beliefs that &quot;We acknowledge God&#x27;s ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow men, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support of His Church.&quot;

====Anabaptist churches====
The Mennonite Church teaches that &quot;tithing as a minimum baseline is one of the principles on which financial giving in this &#x27;first fruits&#x27; system is based&quot;:
====Baptist churches====
The Southern Baptist Convention resolved in 2013 to &quot;exhort all Southern Baptists to tithe cheerfully and give sacrificially as good stewards of God’s blessings to their local churches.&quot; Article XIII the Baptist Faith and Message recognizes a Christian obligation to contribute without specifically mention a tithe. Other Southern Baptists do not observe a tithe, only an offering. Representing Southern Seminary, Professor Tom Schreiner states, &quot;Is a tithe required? ... I would say no, because a tithe is part of the Mosaic covenant.&quot;

The National Baptist Convention of America teaches that &quot;Baptists believe that a proper sense of stewardship begins with the &#x27;tithe&#x27;; a presentation of which belongs to Him. &#x27;The tithe is the Lord&#x27;s.&#x27; We have not given as a result of presenting the tithe. Our giving begins with the offering {after we have tithed}.&quot;

The Treatise of the National Association of Free Will Baptists, Chapter XVI, specifically states that both the Old and New Testaments &quot;teach tithing as God&#x27;s financial plan for the support of His work.&quot;

====Catholic Church====
The Council of Trent, which was held after the Reformation, taught that &quot;tithes are due to God or to religion, and that it is sacrilegious to withhold them&quot;, but the Catholic Church no longer requires anyone to give ten percent of income. The Church simply asks Catholics to support the mission of their parish. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church &quot;The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of the Church, each according to his own abilities&quot;

====Lutheran churches====
The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod teaches that &quot;Encourage[s] cheerful, first-fruit, proportionate (including but not limited to tithing) living and giving in all areas of life by Christian stewards&quot;.

====Methodist churches====
&quot;The Discipline of The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection&quot;, which teaches the doctrine of the Storehouse Tithing, holds: 

The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church states that it is the responsibility of ecclesiastics to &quot;educate the local church that tithing is the minimum goal of giving in The United Methodist Church.&quot;

The Church of the Nazarene teaches Storehouse Tithing, in which members are asked to donate one-tenth of their income to their local church—this is to be prioritized before giving an offering to apostolates or charities.

====Moravian Church====
The Moravian Church encourages its members to &quot;financially support the ministry of the Church toward the goal of tithing.&quot; It &quot;deem[s] it a sacred responsibility and genuine opportunity to be faithful stewards of all God has entrusted to us: our time, our talents, [and] our financial resources&quot;.

====Orthodox churches====
Tithing in medieval Eastern Christianity did not spread so widely as in the West. A Constitution of the Emperors Leo I (reigned 457–474) and Anthemius (reigned 467–472) apparently expected believers to make voluntary payments and forbade compulsion.

The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America teaches &quot;proportionate giving and tithing as normal practices of Christian giving.&quot;

====Pentecostal churches====
The Pentecostal Church of God teaches that &quot;We recognize the scriptural duty of all our people, as well as ministers, to pay tithes as unto the Lord. Tithes should be used for the support of active ministry and for the propagation of the Gospel and the work of the Lord in general.&quot;

The International Pentecostal Holiness Church likewise instructs the faithful that:
====Reformed churches====
The Book of Order of the Presbyterian Church (USA) states, with respect to the obligation to tithe:
The United Church of Christ, a denomination in the Congregationalist tradition, teaches that:
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) bases its tithing on the additional scriptures:


Tithing is defined by the church as payment of one-tenth of one&#x27;s annual income. Many church leaders have made statements in support of tithing. Every Latter-day Saint has an opportunity once a year to meet with their bishop for tithing declaration. The payment of tithes is mandatory for members to receive the priesthood or obtain a temple recommend for admission to temples.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a lay ministry. The money that is given is used to construct and maintain its buildings as well as to further the work of the church. None of the funds collected from tithing is paid to local church officials or those who serve in the church. Those serving in full-time church leadership do receive stipends for living expenses, but they are paid from non-tithing resources, such as investments. Brigham Young University, a church-sponsored institution, also receives &quot;a significant portion&quot; of its maintenance and operating costs from tithes of the church&#x27;s members.

===Church collection of religious offerings and taxes===
====England and Wales====

The right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by King Ethelwulf in 855. The Saladin tithe was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the Statute of Westminster of 1285. The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and the Crown – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. Adam Smith criticized the system in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.


====Dissenters====
In the seventeenth century various dissenting groups objected to paying tithes to Church of England. Quakers were prominent among these, objecting to &#x27;forced payments for the maintenance of a professional ministry&#x27;. In 1659 guidance was issued for a national system for recording the fines, impropriations and imprisonments for non-payment of tithes as seen in the following extract from a document.


These records were eventually collated and published in 1753 by Joseph Besse, documenting widespread persecution throughout the British Isles and further abroad. This only abated in the 1680s, due in no small measure to the efforts of William Penn who, through his father&#x27;s earlier connections at court, was friendly with Charles I and James, Duke of York and interceded with them in behalf of Quakers in England and on the Continent, respectively.

See below for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by Sir William Blackstone and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.

====End of the tithing system====
The system gradually ended with the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel repair liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records giving a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years&#x27; tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.

This commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led tenants to become freeholders and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-Anglicans. It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.

=====Tithe redemption=====

Rent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the Tithe Act 1936 (26 Geo. 5. &amp; 1 Edw. 8. c. 43) into annuities paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of Inland Revenue, and those remaining were terminated by the Finance Act 1977.

The Tithe Act 1951 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 6. c. 62) established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1, so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.

====Greece====
There has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established Church of Greece, in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each diocese independently.

====Ireland====

From the English Reformation in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain Roman Catholic and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area&#x27;s agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland, to which only a small minority of the population converted. Irish Presbyterians and other minorities like the Quakers and Jews were in the same situation.

The collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the Tithe War. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the Tithe Commutation Act 1838. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869, tithes were abolished.

====United States====
While the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax itemized deduction). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee&#x27;s share of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, and pay the employer&#x27;s share for the non-exempt income.

====Spain and Latin America====

Both the tithe (&quot;diezmo&quot;), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and &quot;first fruits&quot; (&quot;primicias&quot;), an additional harvest levy, were collected in Spain throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local Catholic parishes.

The tithe crossed the Atlantic with the Spanish Empire; however, the Indians who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial Spanish America were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.

The tithe was abolished in several Latin American countries, including Mexico, soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Argentina in 1826, and in Spain itself in 1841.

===Governmental collection of Christian religious offerings and taxes===
====Austria====
In Austria a colloquially called church tax (&quot;Kirchensteuer&quot;, officially called &quot;Kirchenbeitrag&quot;, i. e. &quot;church contribution&quot;) has to be paid by members of the Catholic and Protestant Church. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).

====Denmark====
All members of the Church of Denmark pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities. The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.

====Finland====
Members of state churches pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.

====Germany====
Germany levies a church tax, on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.

The church tax (&quot;Kirchensteuer&quot;) traces its roots back as far as the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the Concordat of 1933 between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Its legal basis is article 140 of the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot; (the German constitution) in connection with article 137 of the Weimar Constitution. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.

Church tax (&quot;Kirchensteuer&quot;) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the PAYE level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (&quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot. In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.

This opt-out is also used by members of &quot;free churches&quot; (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.

====Italy====

Originally the Italian government of Benito Mussolini, under the Lateran treaties of 1929 with the Holy See, paid a monthly salary to Catholic clergymen. This salary was called the &quot;congrua&quot;. The eight-per-thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the Holy See.

Under this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% (&#x27;eight per thousand&#x27;) of the total income tax IRPEF levied by Italy among some specific religious confessions or, alternatively, to a social assistance program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the IRPEF form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the IRPEF tax is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.

The last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the Catholic Church, the Waldenses, the Jewish Communities, the Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Assemblies of God in Italy.

The tax was divided up as follows:
*87.17% Catholic Church
*10.35% Italian state
*1.21% Waldenses
*0.46% Jewish communities
*0.32% Lutherans
*0.28% Adventists of the Seventh Day
*0.21% Assemblies of God in Italy

In 2000, the Catholic Church raised almost a billion euros, while the Italian state received about €100 million.

====Scotland====

In Scotland &quot;teinds&quot; were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.

====Switzerland====
There is no official state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.

===Tithes and tithe law in England before reform===
Excerpts from Sir William Blackstone, &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;:

====Definition and classification and those liable to pay tithes====
. . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:
:the first species being usually called &quot;predial,&quot; as of corn, grass, hops, and wood;
:the second &quot;mixed&quot;, as of wool, milk, pigs, &amp;c, consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in gross:
:the third &quot;personal&quot;, as of manual occupations, trades, fisheries, and the like; and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and profits is due.
in general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or &quot;ferae naturae&quot;, as deer, hawks, &amp;c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.

====History====
We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country. Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century. But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.

====Beneficiaries====
And upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called &quot;arbitrary&quot; consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.

...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the parson of the parish, unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual incumbent, or else the of the benefice: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.

====Exemptions====
We observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.

First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.

Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either &quot;de modo decimandi&quot;, or &quot;de non-decimando&quot;.

A &quot;modus decimandi&quot;, commonly called by the simple name of a &quot;modus&quot; only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner&#x27;s making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a &quot;modus decimandi&quot;, or special manner of tithing.

A prescription &quot;de non-decimando&quot; is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them. Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for &quot;ecclesia decimas non-folvit ecclesiae&quot;. But these &quot;personal&quot; to both the king and the clergy; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable. And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in &quot;lay&quot; hands, &quot;modus de non-decimando non-valet&quot;. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as
#By real composition :
#By the pope&#x27;s bull of exemption :
#By unity of possession; as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession :
#By prescription; having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands :
#By virtue of their order; as the knights templars, cistercians, and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by Henry VIII, most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again; had they not been supported and upheld by the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1539 (31 Hen. 8. c. 13) which enacted, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them.

And from this original have sprung all the lands, which, being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free: for, if a man can shew his lands to have been such abbey lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before-mentioned, this is now a good prescription &quot;de non-decimando&quot;. But he must shew both these requisites; for abbey lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course; neither will any prescription &quot;de non-decimando&quot; avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbeylands.

==Islam==

Zakāt ( ) or &quot;alms giving&quot;, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is the giving of a small percentage of one&#x27;s assets to charity. It serves principally as the welfare contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.

Zakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one&#x27;s personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or &quot;one-tenth&quot;), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.

Muslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer (salat). Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business. In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich. Because it holds such a high level of importance the &quot;punishment&quot; for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot; it states, &quot;...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted&quot;. This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.

Non-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay Jizya, this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.

Ismaili Muslims pay tithes to their spiritual leader the Aga Khan, known by the Gujarati language term &quot;dasond&quot;, which in turn refers to one-eighth of the earned income of the community member.

==Sikhism==

&quot;Daswandh&quot; (Punjabi: ਦਸਵੰਧ), sometimes spelled &quot;Dasvandh&quot;, is the one-tenth part (or 10 per cent) of one&#x27;s income that should be donated in the name of the God, according to Sikh principles.

== Non-religious ==
Outside religion, there are also organizations that encourage secular tithing.

Giving What We Can promotes a public commitment to donate at least 10% of one&#x27;s income to the most effective charities.

<text>In archaeology, lithic analysis is the analysis of stone tools and other chipped stone artifacts using basic scientific techniques. At its most basic level, lithic analyses involve an analysis of the artifact&#x27;s morphology, the measurement of various physical attributes, and examining other visible features (such as noting the presence or absence of cortex, for example).

The term &#x27;lithic analysis&#x27; can technically refer to the study of any anthropogenic (human-created) stone, but in its usual sense it is applied to archaeological material that was produced through lithic reduction (knapping) or ground stone. A thorough understanding of the lithic reduction and ground stone processes, in combination with the use of statistics, can allow the analyst to draw conclusions concerning the type of lithic manufacturing techniques used at a prehistoric archaeological site. For example, they can make certain equation between each the factors of flake to predict original shape. These data can then be used to draw an understanding of socioeconomic and cultural organization.

The term &quot;knapped&quot; is synonymous with &quot;chipped&quot; or &quot;struck&quot;, but is preferred by some analysts because it signifies intentionality and process. Ground stone generally refers to any tool made by a combination of flaking, pecking, pounding, grinding, drilling, and incising, and includes things such as mortars / metates, pestles (or manos), grinding slabs, hammerstones, grooved and perforated stones, axes, etc., which appear in all human cultures in some form. Among the tool types analyzed are projectile points, bifaces, unifaces, ground stone artifacts, and lithic reduction by-products (debitage) such as flakes and cores.

==Materials==
Stone is the one category of material which is used by (virtually) all human cultures and, for the vast majority of the human past, is the only record of human behaviour. The end of prehistory does not signify the end of stone working; stones were knapped in Medieval Europe, well into the 19th century in many parts of Europe and the Americas. Contemporary stone tool manufacturers often work stone for experimentation with past techniques or for replication.

Flint and chert are the most commonly knapped materials and are compact cryptocrystalline quartz. The difference between the two terms is colloquial, and flint can be seen as a variety of chert. In common usage, flint may refer more often to high quality material from chalky matrix (i.e. &quot;chalk flint&quot; as found in Britain) and chert refers to material from limestone matrices. To avoid this, the term &quot;silicate&quot; may be used to describe the family of cryptocrystalline quartzes that are suitable for knapping. As well as cryptocrystalline quartz, macrocrystalline quartz (both vein quartz and rock crystal) was a commonly used raw material around the globe.

In North America, Central America, and other places around the world, such as Turkey and New Zealand, obsidian, or volcanic glass, was also a highly sought-after material for knapping and was widely traded. This is due to the quality of the stone, the razor sharpness of edges that can be created, and the fact that it fractures in highly predictable ways.

Soapstone, or steatite, has been a popular rock for grinding and carving among many cultures worldwide. It has been used for production of such disparate items as vessels/bowls, pipes, cooking slabs, and sculptures.

==Areas of study==
Conventional approaches to the analysis of knapped stone can be grouped into three elementary, yet ultimately interconnected, areas of study: typological analysis, functional analysis, and technological analysis. Additional areas of study, such as geochemical analysis, have been developed in recent decades.

===Typological classification===
In reference to lithic analyses, typological classification is the act of artifact classification based on morphological similarities. Resultant classes include those artifacts subsumed by tool, production, and debitage categories.

The best known lithic typology is the series established by François Bordes (1950) for the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic of France, where sixty three types of stone tools were defined on the basis of manufacturing techniques and morphological characteristics. According to Bordes, the presence or absence of tool types, or differences in the frequency of types between assemblages, were manifestations of cultural differences between ethnic groups. Notwithstanding that there have been several re-evaluations of Bordes’ interpretation of the &quot;ethnicity&quot; of variations in assemblage type composition, the basic assumption that there is explanatory value in the construction of morphologically defined types of artifacts has remained. For instance, the use of typologies as indicators of chronological and/or cultural affiliations is rarely disputed and is acknowledged as an invaluable analytical tool for this purpose.

===Function===
Functional analysis of stone tools – a term given to a variety of approaches designed with the aim of identifying the use of a stone tool – is based on the argument that the uses to which tools were put in antiquity leave diagnostic damage and/or polish on their working edges. This type of analysis is also known as use-wear analysis

Experiments have been conducted in order to match up the microwear patterns on actual artifacts with experimental artifacts. At the site of Nausharo, the use-wear analysis conducted on the flint artifacts showed a match to the experimental use-wear of a potter using the flint blades as trimming tools for pottery placed on a potter&#x27;s wheel. This is significant because it gives direct evidence for the use of the blades and for the presence of a potter&#x27;s wheel.

Although there are debates concerning the physics of both edge polishes and edge damage which draw on the science of tribology, modern microwear analysis usually depends on the comparisons of the edge wear of modern experimentally produced samples with archaeological and/or ethnographic tools. The ability of a microwear analyst has been tested in the past by presenting them with a set of experimentally produced and utilised tool in a blind experiment. The overall purpose is to provide an accurate, and precise, analytical instrument for the identification of stone tool function. The precision of functional identifications may range considerably, from &quot;scraping soft material&quot; to &quot;scraping fresh hide for 10 minutes&quot; with a corresponding drop in accuracy as precision increases. Macrowear studies relying on 3D modelling are also increasingly common.

Ethnographic research is another way to figure out the use of stone tools by observing the modern communities which still have stone tool traditions. A research of the Wola society in Papua New Guinea shows that stone tools have a wide range of uses, but a short lifespan. They use stone tools to make weapons, utensils, clothing, and musical instruments. However, the lithic materials might be less important than wooden tools in their material culture when considering other resources in the Wola. It shows that studying both people and environment as a whole can provide a better understanding of the function and role of stone tools.

===Technology===
Technological analysis is concerned with the examination of the production of knapped-stone artifacts. The study of the attributes of waste products (debitage) and tools are the most important methods for the study of knapped-stone technology, backed up with experimental production. One such method of experimentation is to use steel balls dropped by an electromagnet onto a glass prism to test relationships such as platform thickness and flake length. Additionally, work by Patterson(1990) indicates that the process of bifacial reduction can be identified through analysis of debitage in the absence of an identifiable bifacial artefact by comparing the various proportions of an assemblage&#x27;s flake sizes. A very wide range of attributes may be used to characterize and compare assemblages to isolate (and interpret) differences across time and space in the production of stone tools. Lithic analysts identify flake scarring on stone artifacts in order to understand the manufacturing process of flake production. There have been efforts to identify variables to predict original size of discarded tool artifact but the results yielded from these studies have not been uniform and research continues. Kuhn (1990) presents his Geometric Index of Unifacial Reduction, an equation for estimating the mass loss of retouched stone artefacts. This index attempts to use 2D measurements of a flakes reduced edge to find the lost mass. Discovering the amount a particular flake has been reduced can help archaeologists answer questions of tool maintainability, optimal resources, and knapping practices. Kuhn&#x27;s GIUR method was recently reestablished as a robust method as evident through simulation and experiments yielding strong positive correlation coefficients of flake mass removed from retouched flakes. The GIUR method is best used on flakes that have been lightly retouched and it can only be used on flakes that are unifacial. 3D modelling is an increasingly important tool for lithic analysis.

Above all, whether the typological classification, function or technology, there is a premise in these analytic method. The premise is that archaeologists presume a blueprint of the end-product of stone tool, or say a mental map with step-by-step processes of prehistoric people in mind. This assumption contain the concept that people tend to shape stone tool into certain specific form for specific purpose. This is the foundation of lithic typology and widely accepted. However Hiscock (2004) provides an ethnographic observation from Australia and points out that the processes of making lithic flake are actually more social dynamic and with much negotiation between lithic knappers, the common measure attributes, such as retouched scar, form of flake and optimal economic presumption, are all less related to the function of the end-product. Although there are several other ethnographic studies lead to similar conclusion, Hiscock reminds that these observations are not to overthrow the classification system now but to provide an alternative possibility to consider lithic study. Shott proposed that the settlement mobility and lithic technology are related based on ethnographic and archaeological studies. The technological diversity decreases when the mobility frequency and magnitude become greater, which is consistent with theoretically derived expectations from 14 ethnographic groups. Though diversity decreases, however, the range in the tool&#x27;s flexibility in function greatly increases. As a result, the tool limit a group can carry can be determined by their mobility. Foragers need only two to three different tool classes in order to survive.

===Petrological and geochemical analysis===
Petrological and geochemical analysis can be useful in identifying the sources of lithics and assist in establishing trade and migration routes. Methods used are typical of those used in geologic research, such as petrographic thin section analysis, neutron activation analysis, stable isotope analysis, and X-ray fluorescence. One example of this application is Yellin (1996) in which neutron activation analysis was used to trace the source of obsidian artifacts found at the Gilat site in Israel. This investigation found that earlier obsidian was obtained from central Anatolia, but in later times, obsidian was obtained from another region in eastern Anatolia. This is used as evidence for changing trade relationships in Israel during the Chalcolithic period.

===Reduction===
Lithic reduction itself can be studied to help illuminate the settlement and movement patterns of hunter-gatherer groups by following the idea of Central Place Foraging Models. The Model dictates that the farther from a resource a group inhabits, the more processing of that resource will occur in the field before being transported to the primary habitation. Testing of this model has indicated it is indeed applicable to lithic assemblages, and can help to identify assemblages created by highly mobile hunter-gatherer societies in prehistory.

<doc id="147622" wikidata="Q1143631" url="?curid=147622" title="Cumann na nGaedheal">
<text>Cumann na nGaedheal (; ) was a political party in the Irish Free State, which formed the government from 1923 to 1932. It was named after the original Cumann na nGaedheal organisation which merged with the Dungannon Clubs and the National Council to form Sinn Féin in 1905. In 1933 it merged with smaller groups to form the Fine Gael party.

==Origins==

In 1922 the pro-Treaty Government of the Irish Free State lost the support of Sinn Féin, its political party. The need to create a party supporting the government was not immediate. &quot;Cumann na nGaedheal&quot; was the name of the antecedent nationalist umbrella organisation to Sinn Féin formed in 1900 (see Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)). The second &quot;Cumann na nGaedheal&quot; did not come into existence until more than a year later, on 27 April 1923 when the pro-Treaty TDs recognised the need for a party organisation to win elections. Initially, the party&#x27;s ability to influence the government was limited.

The party was largely centre-right in outlook. The pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Féin had decided to break off and become a distinct party in late December 1922, but its launch was delayed until after the New Year as a direct consequence of the turmoil caused by the Irish Civil War.

The leadership of the pro-Treaty Sinn Féin in 1922 included Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and W. T. Cosgrave. Cosgrave and Griffith had been prominent in Sinn Féin since the 1900s, while Collins rose quickly through its ranks after the 1916 Easter Rising. Griffith and Collins died in August 1922 during the early stages of the Civil War, leaving Cosgrave to lead the pro-Treaty Provisional Government in the run-up to the formal establishment of the Irish Free State. Cosgrave had also fought in the Easter Rising and had been prominent in the Government of the Irish Republic; the burden of responsibility for building the new state on solid foundations was now on Cosgrave and his colleagues. Difficult years of state-building amidst political violence characterised its time in government.

The Irish Unionist Alliance was dissolved in 1922, when many of its followers swung their support behind Cumann na nGaedheal, seeing it as less hostile to them than the anti-Treaty Republicans and the later Fianna Fáil.

==State building and reconstruction==
The first election the party contested was the general election of 1923, when it won 63 seats (out of 153), with 39% of the votes cast. Until 1932, Cumann na nGaedheal continued to form the Government of the Irish Free State, with Cosgrave as President of the Executive Council.

In government, the party established the institutions upon which the current Irish state is still built. It also re-established law and order through a number of public safety acts in a country that had long been divided by war and competing ideologies. The party&#x27;s Minister for Home Affairs, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, established the Garda Síochána, an unarmed police force. As Minister for External Affairs in 1927, he was successful in increasing the Free State&#x27;s autonomy within the British Commonwealth of Nations.

Cumann na nGaedheal as a government party was characterized by conservatism. Thus, when J.J. Walsh, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, resigned in 1927 due to the government&#x27;s lack of support for protectionism, he sent an open letter to Cosgrave, claiming inter alia that the party had gone ″over to the most reactionary elements of the state″.

==Consolidation and competition==

In the general election in June 1927, Cumann na nGaedheal performed very poorly, winning just 47 seats with 27% of the vote, and was able to survive in office only because of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s continued refusal to take up its 44 seats due to the party&#x27;s rejection of the Oath of Allegiance to the Free State.

The assassination of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the controversial Minister for Justice, by Republicans shortly after the election came as a bitter blow to the party. In response to this act of violence, the state introduced a second Public Safety Act, which introduced the death penalty and was widely unpopular with the public, and an Electoral Amendment Act which forced elected TDs to take the Oath of Allegiance. Thus the murder indirectly led to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s forced entry to the Dáil and in August 1927 the government narrowly survived a vote of no confidence. Following victory in two by-elections, Cosgrave called a snap election in September 1927. Cumann na nGaedheal regained most of the ground lost in June, winning 62 seats and 39% of the vote, although most of these gains were from potential allies.

For the first time the party now faced vigorous parliamentary (if not entirely constitutional) opposition in the Dáil, as Fianna Fáil also made significant gains. Since the foundation of the state Dáil business had been relatively calm as the relatively small Labour party functioned as the official opposition in the absence of die-hard Republicans. The scene was now set for a volatile atmosphere in parliament as the two sides who had fought each other in the civil war now met face to face.

==Electoral decline and merger==

The party&#x27;s support base gradually slipped to Éamon de Valera&#x27;s new party Fianna Fáil after its inception in 1926. Cosgrave&#x27;s Cumann na nGaedheal became solely identified with protecting the treaty and defending the new State while it seemed preoccupied with public safety. Economically the party favoured balanced budgets and free trade at a time when its opponents advocated protectionism. The weak economy of the Free State suffered during the Great Depression. Nonetheless, it came as a surprise when Cumann na nGaedheal was defeated by Fianna Fáil in the general election of February 1932, winning 57 seats to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s 72.

Having spent its entire existence prior to 1932 in government, Cumann na nGaedheal was ill-prepared for a role in opposition. Its support base contracted further at the general election in January 1933, when it won 48 seats compared to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s 77. Increasingly, the party found itself unable to counter de Valera&#x27;s populism and was increasingly labelled the party of the middle class. The party subsequently entered discussions with the National Centre Party and the ultranationalist National Guard (Blueshirts) on the possibility of a merger. That came about in September 1933, with the formation of &quot;Fine Gael&quot; from the three parties, though, in reality, Fine Gael was a larger version of Cumann na nGaedheal. It was in the lead-up to the merger that the then Editor of the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, R.M. Smyllie, described Cumann na nGaedheal as a party &quot;who one wished would be open to ideas, until one saw the kind of ideas they were open to&quot;.

<text>This is a complete list of the 2,056 cities and towns in Germany (as of 1 January 2024). There is no distinction between &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; in Germany; a &quot;Stadt&quot; is an independent municipality (see Municipalities of Germany) that has been given the right to use that title. In contrast, the generally smaller German municipalities that do not use this title, and are thus not included here, are usually just called &quot;Gemeinden&quot;. Historically, the title &quot;Stadt&quot; was associated with town privileges, but today it is a mere honorific title. The title can be bestowed to a municipality by its respective state government and is generally given to such municipalities that have either had historic town rights or have attained considerable size and importance more recently. Towns with over 100,000 inhabitants are called &quot;Großstadt&quot;, a statistical notion sometimes translated as &quot;city&quot;, but having no effect on their administrative status. In this list, only the cities&#x27; and towns&#x27; names are given. For more restricted lists with more details, see:

<text>An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.

Beyond this, the definition and geographical extent of a &quot;site&quot; can vary widely, depending on the period studied and the theoretical approach of the archaeologist.

== Geographical extent ==
It is almost invariably difficult to delimit a site. It is sometimes taken to indicate a settlement of some sort, although the archaeologist must also define the limits of human activity around the settlement. Any episode of deposition, such as a hoard or burial, can form a site as well. Development-led archaeology undertaken as cultural resources management has the disadvantage (or the benefit) of having its sites defined by the limits of the intended development. Even in this case, however, in describing and interpreting the site, the archaeologist will have to look outside the boundaries of the building site.

According to Jess Beck in &quot;How Do Archaeologists Find Sites?&quot; the areas with numerous artifacts are good targets for future excavation, while areas with a small number of artifacts are thought to reflect a lack of past human activity. Many areas have been discovered by accident. The most common people who have found artifacts are farmers who are plowing their fields or just cleaning them up, and they often find archaeological artifacts. Many people who are out hiking and even pilots find artifacts, and they usually end up reporting them to archaeologists for further investigation. When they find sites, they have to first record the area, and if they have the money and time for the site, they can start digging.

== Field survey ==
There are many ways to find sites, one example can be through surveys. Surveys involve walking around analyzing the land and looking for artifacts. It can also involve digging, according to the Archaeological Institute of America, &quot;archaeologists actively search areas that were likely to support human populations, or in places where old documents and records indicate people once lived.&quot; This helps archaeologists in the future. In case there is no time or money during the site&#x27;s discovery, archaeologists can come back and visit the site for further digging to find out the extent of the site. Archaeologist can also sample randomly within a given area of land as another form of conducting surveys. Surveys are very useful, according to Jess Beck, &quot;it can tell you where people were living at different points in the past.&quot; Geophysics is a branch of survey becoming more and more popular in archaeology, because it uses different types of instruments to investigate features below the ground surface. It is not as reliable because although they can see what is under the surface of the ground, it does not produce the best picture. Archaeologists still have to dig up the area in order to uncover the truth. There are also two most common types of geophysical survey, which is, magnetometer and ground penetrating radar. Magnetometry is the technique of measuring and mapping patterns of magnetism in the soil. It uses an instrument called a magnetometer, which is required to measure and map traces of soil magnetism. The ground penetrating radar is a method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave band of the radio spectrum and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.

There are many other tools that can be used to find artifacts, but along with finding artifacts, archaeologists have to make maps. They do so by taking data from surveys, or archival research and plugging it into a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and that will contain both locational information and a combination of various information. This tool is very helpful to archaeologists who want to explore in a different area and want to see if anyone else has done research. They can use this tool to see what has already been discovered. With this information available, archaeologists can expand their research and add more to what has already been found.

Traditionally, sites are distinguished by the presence of both artifacts and features. Common features include the remains of hearths and houses. Ecofacts, biological materials (such as bones, scales, and even feces) that are the result of human activity but are not deliberately modified, are also common at many archaeological sites. In the cases of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, a mere scatter of flint flakes will also constitute a site worthy of study. Different archaeologists may see an ancient town, and its nearby cemetery as being two different sites, or as being part of the same wider site. The precepts of landscape archaeology attempt to see each discrete unit of human activity in the context of the wider environment, further distorting the concept of the site as a demarcated area. Furthermore, geoarchaeologists or environmental archaeologists would also consider a sequence of natural geological or organic deposition, in the absence of human activity, to constitute a site worthy of study.

Archaeological sites usually form through human-related processes but can be subject to natural, post-depositional factors. Cultural remnants which have been buried by sediments are, in many environments, more likely to be preserved than exposed cultural remnants. Natural actions resulting in sediment being deposited include alluvial (water-related) or aeolian (wind-related) natural processes. In jungles and other areas of lush plant growth, decomposed vegetative sediment can result in layers of soil deposited over remains. Colluviation, the burial of a site by sediments moved by gravity (called hillwash) can also happen at sites on slopes. Human activities (both deliberate and incidental) also often bury sites. It is common in many cultures for newer structures to be built atop the remains of older ones. Urban archaeology has developed especially to deal with these sorts of site.

Many sites are the subject of ongoing excavation or investigation. Note the difference between archaeological sites and archaeological discoveries.

<text>Windex is an American brand of glass and hard-surface cleaners—originally in glass containers, later in plastic ones.

The name &quot;Windex&quot; (from &quot;window&quot; + &quot;-ex&quot;) is a registered trademark. Drackett sold the Windex brand to Bristol-Meyers in 1965. S. C. Johnson acquired it in 1993 and has been manufacturing it since.

The original Windex was yellow. Today, it is commonly blue. Varieties are marketed in several colors (ocean fresh blue, sunshine lemon and citrus orange) and fragrances (spring bouquet, ocean mist, lavender and tea tree), with a number of additives such as vinegar, lemon, lime or orange juice.

==Ingredients==
On August 26, 1969, Melvin E. Stonebraker and Samuel P. Wise received U.S. patent #3,463,735 for a glass cleaning composition, listing example formulae, one of which is 4.0% isopropyl alcohol, 1% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (a surfactant), calcium (Ca) 0.01%, tetrasodium pyrophosphate (a water softener), 0.05% of 28% ammonia, 1% of a dye solution and 0.01% perfume. This formula was not only inexpensive to manufacture but allowed the product to be packaged in glass bottles and dispensed with a plastic sprayer. 

In 1989, Windex was a 5% ammonia solution. The product was reformulated in 2006. In 2009, S.C. Johnson started publishing ingredients for all of its products, including Windex. The S.C. Johnson website lists Windex&#x27;s ingredients as water, 2-hexoxyethanol, isopropanolamine, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, lauramine oxide, ammonium hydroxide, fragrance and Liquitint sky blue dye. An alternative variant also for household use cites water, hexoxyethanol, isopropanolamine, ammonium hydroxide, sodium C10-C16 alkylbenzenesulfonate, lauramine oxide, sodium xylene sulfonate, colorants and fragrances.

==Competition==
Windex&#x27;s main competitor in the window cleaning market is Glass Plus, a glass cleaning product produced by Reckitt Benckiser, which Windex&#x27;s current owner S. C. Johnson &amp; Son was required to divest to gain the approval of the Federal Trade Commission to acquire Dow Chemical Company&#x27;s DowBrands consumer products division (the original owner of the Glass Plus brand).

<doc id="147628" wikidata="Q5843680" url="?curid=147628" title="Halicarnassus">
<text>Halicarnassus ( ; Latin: &quot;Halicarnassus&quot; or &quot;Halicarnāsus&quot;; &quot;Halikarnāssós&quot;; ; Carian: 𐊠𐊣𐊫𐊰 𐊴𐊠𐊥𐊵𐊫𐊰 &quot;alos k̂arnos&quot;) was an ancient Greek city in Caria, in Anatolia. It was located in southwest Caria, on an advantageous site on the Gulf of Gökova, which is now in Bodrum, Turkey. The city was famous for the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, also known simply as the Tomb of Mausolus, whose name provided the origin of the word &quot;mausoleum&quot;. The mausoleum, built from 353 to 350 BC, ranked as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

Halicarnassus&#x27; history was special on two interlinked issues. Halicarnassus retained a monarchical system of government at a time when most other Greek city states had long since rid themselves of their kings. And secondly, while their Ionian neighbours rebelled against Persian rule, Halicarnassus remained loyal to the Persians and formed part of the Persian Empire until Alexander the Great captured it at the siege of Halicarnassus in 333 BC.

Zephyria was the original name of the settlement, and the present site of the great Castle of St. Peter built by the Knights of Rhodes in 1404 AD. It was built on what was originally an island, which gradually expanded to include several Carian settlements on the mainland. However, in the course of time, the island topographically united with the mainland, and the city was extended to combine with the existing Salmacis, an older town of the native Leleges and Carians, and site of the later citadel. The first settlers were originally Dorians from the Peloponnese, but this was soon forgotten.

== Etymology ==
The suffix -ασσός (-assos) of Greek Ἁλικαρνασσός is indicative of a substrate toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced, or established the place&#x27;s name (compare Parnassus). In a 2015 article, linguist and philologist Ilya Yakubovich proposed that the element -καρνασσός is cognate with Luwian (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-na-sà / (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-ni-sà &#x27;fortress&#x27;. If so, the toponym is probably borrowed from Carian, a Luwic language spoken alongside Greek in Halicarnassus. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with 𐊠𐊣𐊫𐊰 𐊴𐊠𐊥𐊵𐊫𐊰 (&quot;alos k̂arnos)&quot; in inscriptions.

== History ==
===Late Bronze===
====Mycenaean period====
Some large Mycenaean tombs have been found at Musgebi (or Muskebi, modern Ortakent), not far from Halicarnassus. According to Turkish archaeologist Yusuf Boysal, the Muskebi material, dating from the end of the fifteenth century BC to ca. 1200 BC, provides evidence of the presence, in this region, of a Mycenaean settlement.

More than forty burial places dating back to that time have been discovered. A rich collection of artifacts found in these tombs is now housed in the Bodrum Castle. These finds cast some light on the problem of determining the territories of ancient Arzawa and Ahhiyawa.

===Iron Age===
The founding of Halicarnassus is debated among various traditions; but they agree in the main point as to its being a Dorian colony, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of Medusa, Athena or Poseidon, or the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were Troezen and Argos. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by Strabo, and were proud of the title of &quot;Antheadae&quot;.

At an early period Halicarnassus was a member of the Doric Hexapolis, which included Kos, Cnidus, Lindos, Kameiros and Ialysus; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games, instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century BC Halicarnassus was under the sway of Artemisia I of Caria (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the battle of Salamis. Of Pisindalis, her son and successor, little is known. Artemisia&#x27;s grandson Lygdamis II of Halicarnassus, is notorious for having put to death the poet Panyasis and causing Herodotus, possibly the best known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city ().

=== Hekatomnid dynasty===
Hecatomnus became king of Caria, at that time part of the Persian Empire, ruling from 404 BC to 358 BC and establishing the Hekatomnid dynasty. He left three sons, Mausolus, Idrieus and Pixodarus—all of whom—in their turn, succeeded him in the sovereignty; and two daughters, Artemisia and Ada, who were married to their brothers Mausolus and Idrieus.

Mausolus moved his capital from Mylasa to Halicarnassus. His workmen deepened the city&#x27;s harbor and used the dragged sand to make protecting breakwaters in front of the channel. 

On land they paved streets and squares, and built houses for ordinary citizens. And on one side of the harbor they built a massive fortified palace for Mausolus, positioned to have clear views out to sea and inland to the hills—places from where enemies could attack. On land, the workmen also built walls and watchtowers, a Greek–style theatre and a temple to Ares—the Greek god of war. Artemisia and Mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city. Mausolus and Artemisia had ruled over Halicarnassus and the region surrounding it for 24 years. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming marble. When he died in 353 BC, his wife, sister and successor, Artemisia II of Caria, began construction of a magnificent tomb for him and herself on a hill overlooking the city. She died in 351 BC (of grief, according to Cicero, &quot;Tusculan Disputations&quot; 3.31). According to Pliny the Elder the craftsmen continued to work on the tomb after the death of their patron, &quot;considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor&#x27;s art,&quot; finishing it in 350 BC. This tomb of Mausolus came to be known as the Mausoleum, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

Artemisia was succeeded by her brother Idrieus, who, in turn, was succeeded by his wife and sister Ada when he died in 344 BC. However, Ada was usurped by her brother Pixodarus in 340 BC. On the death of Pixodarus in 335 BC his son-in-law, a Persian named Orontobates, received the satrapy of Caria from Darius III of Persia.

===Alexander the Great and Ada of Caria===
When Alexander the Great entered Caria in 334 BC, Ada, who was in possession of the fortress of Alinda, surrendered the fortress to him. After taking Halicarnassus, Alexander handed back the government of Caria to her; she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. 

During the siege of Halicarnassus the city was fired by the retreating Persians. As he was not able to reduce the citadel, Alexander was forced to leave it blockaded. The ruins of this citadel and moat are now a tourist attraction in Bodrum.

===Later history===
Not long afterwards the citizens received the present of a gymnasium from Ptolemy and built in his honour a &quot;stoa&quot; or portico. Under Egyptian hegemony, around 268 BC, a citizen named Hermias became Nesiarch of the Nesiotic League in the Cyclades.

Halicarnassus never recovered altogether from the disasters of the siege, and Cicero describes it as almost deserted.

Baroque artist Johann Elias Ridinger depicted the several stages of siege and taking of the place in a huge copper engraving as one of only two known today from his Alexander set. The Christian and later history of the site is continued at Bodrum.

==Archaeological notes and restorations==

The site is now occupied in part by the town of Bodrum; but the ancient walls can still be traced round nearly all their circuit, and the position of several of the temples, the Theatre of Halicarnassus, and other public buildings can be fixed with certainty.

The ruins of the mausoleum were recovered sufficiently by the 1857 excavations of Charles Newton to enable a fairly complete restoration of its design to be made. The building consisted of five parts—a basement or podium, a pteron or enclosure of columns, a pyramid, a pedestal and a chariot group. The basement, covering an area of 114 feet by 92, was built of blocks of greenstone, cased with marble and covered in carvings of cows. Round the base of it were probably disposed groups of statuary. The pteron consisted (according to Pliny) of thirty-six columns of the Ionic order, enclosing a square cella. Between the columns probably stood single statues. From the portions that have been recovered, it appears that the principal frieze of the pteron represented combats of Greeks and Amazons. In addition, there are also many life-size fragments of animals, horsemen, etc., belonging probably to pedimental sculptures, but formerly supposed to be parts of minor friezes. Above the pteron rose the pyramid, mounting by 24 steps to an apex or pedestal.
On this apex stood the chariot with the figure of Mausolus himself and an attendant. The height of the statue of Mausolus in the British Museum is 9&#x27;9&quot; without the plinth. The hair falls from the forehead in thick waves on each side of the face and descends nearly to the shoulder; the beard is short and close, the face square and massive, the eyes deep set under overhanging brows. All sorts of restorations of this famous monument have been proposed. The original one, made by Newton and Pullan, is in error in many respects; and that of Oldfield, though to be preferred for its lightness (the mausoleum was said anciently to be &quot;suspended in mid-air&quot;). Another by veteran German architect, F. Adler was published in 1900; but studies have since been made (see below).

<text>A video jockey (abbreviated VJ or sometimes veejay) is an announcer or host who introduces music videos and live performances on commercial music television channels such as MTV, VH1, MuchMusic and Channel V.

==Origins==
The term &quot;video jockey&quot; comes from the term &quot;disc jockey&quot;, &quot;DJ&quot; (&quot;deejay&quot;) as used in radio. Music Television (MTV) popularized the term in the 1980s (see List of MTV VJs). The MTV founders got their idea for their VJ host personalities from studying Merrill Aldighieri&#x27;s club. Aldighieri worked in the New York City nightclub Hurrah, which was the first to make a video installation as a prominent featured component of the club&#x27;s design with multiple monitors hanging over the bar and dance floor. When Hurrah invited Aldighieri to show her experimental film, she asked if she could develop a video to complement the DJ music so that then her film would become part of a club ambiance and not be seen as a break in the evening. The experiment led to a full-time job there.

Several months later the future MTV founders patronized the club, interviewed her, and took notes. She told them she was a VJ, the term she invented with a staff member to put on her first pay slip. Her video jockey memoirs list the live music she documented during her VJ breaks. Her method of performing as a VJ consisted of improvising live clips using a video camera, projected film loops, and switching between two U-matic video decks. She solicited the public to collaborate. The club showcased many video artists, who contributed raw and finished works. Her work also incorporated stock footage. Aldighieri next worked at Danceteria, which had a video lounge and dance floor separate levels.

Sound &amp; Vision, however, credits the creation of the VJ to comedian and former DJ himself Rick Moranis, who would introduce music clips on television under his Gerry Todd persona on &quot;Second City Television&quot;. The sketches ran before MTV debuted in the United States. &quot;There had been no such thing&quot; up until that point, confirmed Moranis&#x27; SCTV castmate Martin Short, so &quot;the joke was that there would be such a thing.&quot;

<doc id="147634" wikidata="Q175305" url="?curid=147634" title="Simon Rex">
<text>Simon Rex Cutright (born July 20, 1974), known professionally as Simon Rex and his stage name Dirt Nasty, is an American actor and rapper. Rising to fame as an MTV VJ, Rex later became an actor known for &quot;What I Like About You&quot;, starring in three films of the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; franchise, and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Pledge This!&quot;. He later developed a rap persona, Dirt Nasty, and had several solo albums and co-founded the hip-hop group Three Loco. In 2021, he received critical acclaim for his lead role in Sean Baker&#x27;s drama film &quot;Red Rocket&quot;, winning the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.

== Early life ==
Rex was born in San Francisco, California, and raised in Alameda, the son of Zoe, an environmental consultant, and Paul, a relationship coach. He is Jewish.

Rex was an only child who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. Rex&#x27;s father was a breath-work coach (in the tradition of alternative psychologist Stanislav Grof) who left the family when Rex was little. At age 18, he was attending community college and working at a potato-sack factory when he began dating and living with a model in Oakland.

==Career==

=== Early work in porn and on MTV (1993–1998) ===
In 1993, aged 19, Rex responded to an advertisement in a Los Angeles magazine and agreed to be photographed nude for photographer Brad Posey and his Club 1821 studio. The following year, under the alias &quot;Sebastian&quot;, he appeared in solo masturbation scenes for three gay Club 1821 pornographic films: &quot;Young, Hard &amp; Solo #2&quot;, &quot;Young, Hard &amp; Solo #3&quot;, and &quot;Hot Sessions III&quot;. Archive footage of Rex was also used in the 2000 films &quot;Hot Sessions 11&quot; and &quot;Hot Sessions 12&quot;.

One day, while Rex was driving his girlfriend to a casting audition and also watching her child as she prepared to audition, a casting director spotted him sitting in the waiting room and the next day he was on a flight to Milan to work as a model. In 1994, Rex went on a modeling tour for Tommy Hilfiger, before going on to appear in mainstream modeling gigs for Calvin Klein Inc, Versace, and Levi&#x27;s.

In 1995, MTV hired Rex to work as a VJ and kept him on the air for over two years before he and two other VJs were let go.

=== Television and film (1999–2017) ===

In 1999, he was cast in the comedy-drama television series &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot;, which aired on The WB channel for two seasons. He appeared as Eli in the TV show &quot;Felicity&quot; and television guest appearances followed including &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Everwood&quot;, and &quot;Summerland&quot;.

Starting in 2002, Rex starred with Amanda Bynes in the sitcom &quot;What I Like About You&quot;. In 2006, he appeared on the Lifetime primetime telenovela &quot;Monarch Cove&quot;, which ran for fourteen episodes. From television into film, Rex has held the lead role in feature films including &quot;Scary Movie&quot; 3, 4, &amp; 5, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;The Karate Dog&quot;, &quot;King of the Avenue&quot;, and &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;. Rex more recently starred alongside comedian Nick Swardson in the Comedy Central show, &quot;Typical Rick&quot;, which ran for two seasons from 2016 to 2017.

=== Music (2005–2020) ===

Rex entered the music industry in 2005 as a rap artist after becoming friends with and discovering Mickey Avalon. Rex adopted his alter ego &quot;Dirt Nasty&quot; and formed the rap group &quot;Dyslexic Speedreaders&quot; with Avalon &amp; Andre Legacy. Rex both produced and was featured on the group&#x27;s hit song &quot;My Dick&quot;&quot;.&quot; Again the group paired with Lil Jon to create the song &quot;What Do You Say&quot; which was featured in 2009&#x27;s blockbuster comedy film, &quot;The Hangover&quot;.

Rex was an investor in the New York City nightclub The Plumm with partners Noel Ashman, Samantha Ronson, Chris Noth, and others. It opened in 2006 and closed in 2009.

In 2007, Dirt Nasty released his self-titled debut album which included the songs &quot;1980&quot;, &quot;Cracker Ass Fantastic&quot; &amp; &quot;Dropping Names&quot;. His second album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Nasty as I Wanna Be&quot;, featured Ke$ha, LMFAO, Too Short, and Warren G. Rex&#x27;s other musical projects under his Dirt Nasty alias include his third album &quot;Palatial,&quot; and the supergroup Three Loco which features Andy Milonakis and Riff Raff. As Three Loco, the group teamed up with producer Diplo and released the group&#x27;s eight-song EP on Diplo&#x27;s Mad Decent label. Dirt Nasty appeared in Season 1, episode 5 of Paris Hilton&#x27;s &quot;My New BFF&quot; where the girls had to play &quot;Seven Minutes in Heaven&quot; with him.

=== Film resurgence (2021–present) ===
In 2020, Rex, stuck in a floundering music endeavor with film opportunities having dried up, received a call from director Sean Baker asking him to send in a video audition for the film &quot;Red Rocket&quot;, after which he was quickly offered the lead role. Rex stated: &quot;Sean Baker gave me a shot when nobody else would ... I didn’t really work for over a decade. And I think Sean wanted to prove to people that he could show someone like me could do it.&quot; The film premiered in competition for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and the film - and particularly Rex&#x27;s performance - received overwhelmingly positive reviews. The film was considered a serious acting career breakthrough for Rex and his comeback in the industry.

In October 2021, as a result of the attention &quot;Red Rocket&quot; had garnered, Rex signed with the management firm Range Media Partners. He next appeared in &quot;Mack &amp; Rita&quot;, starring Diane Keaton, followed by &quot;Down Low&quot; with Zachary Quinto. Soon after that, he was cast in a number of other films that premiered in film festivals, such as &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;The Sweet East&quot;. Other film appearances include &quot;Greedy People&quot;, &quot;Blink Twice&quot;, and &quot;Everything&#x27;s Going to Be Great&quot;. He was cast in a supporting role in &quot;The Leader&quot;, a biopic about the Heaven&#x27;s Gate cult led by Marshall Applewhite.

Rex appeared in the April 2, 2022 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Jerrod Carmichael with musical guest Gunna, in the music video &quot;Short-Ass Movies&quot;, where in addition to appearing as himself, his face is used for Ernest P. Worrell.

===Other activities===
In late 2023, Rex co-founded a re-launched men&#x27;s skincare brand out of Colorado known as MOX. As the face of the brand, he regularly promotes MOX products on his social media and during interviews.

==Personal life==
In his late 40s, Rex reconnected with his father. They shared a &quot;psychedelic experience&quot; during which Rex learned his grandfather was a &quot;spiritual leader&quot; who was &quot;not always the most faithful member of his flock.&quot;

Rex bought a house in Laurel Canyon after the success of &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;. He was living in a guesthouse in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles when he was offered US$70,000 by British tabloids to falsely claim he had dated Meghan Markle, his co-star in &quot;Cuts&quot;.

Tabloids speculated that he had dated Paris Hilton, but he insisted they were just &quot;friends that held hands.&quot;

Rex lives off the grid in Joshua Tree, California, in the middle of the Mojave Desert.

<doc id="147635" wikidata="Q19186" url="?curid=147635" title="Middlesex">
<text>Middlesex (; abbreviation: Middx) is an area of South East England which was formerly a county; it is now mainly within the ceremonial county of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring ceremonial counties. The county&#x27;s boundaries largely followed three rivers: the Thames in the south, the Lea to the east and the Colne to the west. A line of hills formed its northern boundary with Hertfordshire. The county was the second smallest of the historic counties of England, after Rutland.

The name of the county derives from its origin as a homeland for the Middle Saxon people in the early Middle Ages, with the county subsequently formed from part of that territory in either the ninth or tenth century. The City of London, formerly part of the county, became a self governing county corporate in the twelfth century; the City was still able to exert influence as the sheriffs of London maintained their jurisdiction in Middlesex, though the county otherwise remained separate. To the east of the City, the Tower Division (or Tower Hamlets) had considerable autonomy under its own Lord Lieutenant. To the west, precincts around Westminster and Charing Cross became built up. 

Despite London&#x27;s expansion into rural Middlesex, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the City of London boundaries into the county, posing problems for the administration of local government, public infrastructure, and justice. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county, including the East and West Ends of London. In 1855 the densely populated southeast, together with sections of Kent and Surrey, came under the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain infrastructure purposes, while remaining a part of Middlesex. The Metropolitan Police also developed in the nineteenth century.

When county councils were introduced in 1889, about twenty per cent of the area of the historic county, along with a third of its population, was incorporated into the new administrative County of London. The remainder formed the administrative county of Middlesex, governed by the Middlesex County Council, which met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster. Further suburban growth, stimulated by the improvement and expansion of public transport, as well as the setting up of new industries, led to the creation of Greater London in 1965, an area which included almost all of the historic county of Middlesex, with the rest included in neighbouring ceremonial counties.

==Governance==


===Origin and toponymy===
The county has its roots in the settlement of the Middle Saxons. The extent of the province is not clear, and probably varied over time, but it is clear that it occupied at least the area of the current county and much of Hertfordshire. Although the province appeared to have come under the dominion of, and is only ever recorded as a part of the Kingdom of the East Saxons, charter evidence shows that it was not part of their core territory. However, it is probable the county was independent at some point.

At times, Essex was ruled jointly by co-Kings, and it is thought that the Middle Saxon province is likely to have been the domain of one of these co-kings. This link to Essex endured through the Diocese of London, re-established in 604 as the East Saxon see, and its boundaries continued to be based on the Kingdom of Essex until the nineteenth century.

The name means &quot;territory of the middle Saxons&quot;. The word is formed from the Old English, &#x27;middel&#x27; and &#x27;Seaxe&#x27; (&#x27;Saxons&#x27;) ( Essex, Sussex and Wessex). In 704, it is recorded as &quot;Middleseaxon&quot; in an Anglo-Saxon chronicle, written in Latin, about land at Twickenham. The Latin text reads: &quot;in prouincia quæ nuncupatur Middelseaxan Haec&quot;.

The Saxons derived their name, &quot;Seaxe&quot; in their own tongue, from the &quot;seax&quot;, a kind of knife for which they were known. The seax appears in the heraldry of the English counties of Essex and Middlesex, each of which bears three seaxes in their ceremonial emblem, or rather the Tudor heralds&#x27; idea of what a seax looked like, portrayed in each case like a falchion or scimitar. The names &#x27;Middlesex&#x27;, &#x27;Essex&#x27;, &#x27;Sussex&#x27; and &#x27;Wessex&#x27;, contain the name &#x27;Seaxe&#x27;.

===Early county government===

It is not known exactly when Middlesex was established as a county, possibly the early tenth century, but it is clear that it did not cover the whole of the former Middle Saxon Province of Essex. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being divided into the six hundreds of Edmonton, Elthorne, Gore, Hounslow (Isleworth in all later records), Ossulstone and Spelthorne. The City of London has been self-governing since the thirteenth century and became a county in its own right, a county corporate. Middlesex also included Westminster, which was separate from the City of London. Westminster Abbey dominated the area of Westminster, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries greatly reduced its influence. A Court of Burgesses was established, in 1585, to fill the power vacuum left behind by the Abbey.

Of the six hundreds, Ossulstone contained the districts closest to the City of London. During the 17th century it was divided into four divisions, which, along with the Liberty of Westminster, largely took over the administrative functions of the hundred. The divisions were named Finsbury, Holborn, Kensington and Tower. The county had parliamentary representation from the 13th century.

Middlesex outside the metropolitan area remained largely rural until the middle of the 19th century and so the special boards of local government for various metropolitan areas were late in developing. Other than the Cities of London and Westminster, there were no ancient boroughs. The importance of the hundred courts declined, and such local administration as there was divided between &quot;county business&quot; conducted by the justices of the peace meeting in quarter sessions, and the local matters dealt with by parish vestries. As the suburbs of London spread into the area, unplanned development and outbreaks of cholera forced the creation of local boards and poor law unions to help govern most areas; in a few cases parishes appointed improvement commissioners. In rural areas, parishes began to be grouped for different administrative purposes. From 1875 these local bodies were designated as urban or rural sanitary districts.

===Tower Division===
The Tower division, better known as the Tower Hamlets, was an area in the Southeast of the county covering what is now the London Borough of Tower Hamlets as well as most of what is now the London Borough of Hackney. The territory had its origin in the medieval Manor of Stepney.

The area was unusual in combining Hundred and many County responsibilities, to form a &quot;county within a county&quot; comparable to one of the Ridings of Yorkshire. Of particular note was its military autonomy: it had its own Lord-Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets and was thus independent of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex.

===Metropolitan challenges===
By the 19th century, the East End of London had expanded to the eastern boundary with Essex, and the Tower division, an area which approximated to the East End, had reached a population of over a million. When the railways were built, the north western suburbs of London steadily spread over large parts of the county. The areas closest to London were served by the Metropolitan Police from 1829, and from 1840 the entire county was included in the Metropolitan Police District. Local government in the county was unaffected by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and civic works continued to be the responsibility of the individual parish vestries or &quot;ad hoc&quot; improvement commissioners. From 1855, the parishes of the densely populated area in the south east, but excluding the City of London, came within the responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain infrastructure purposes, though the area remained a part of Middlesex. Despite this innovation, the system was described by commentators at the time as one &quot;in chaos&quot;.

===1889 - Administrative County of London===
In 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, the metropolitan area of approximately became part of the administrative County of London. The Act also provided that the part of Middlesex in the administrative county of London should be &quot;severed from Middlesex, and form a separate county for all non-administrative purposes&quot;.
The part of the County of London that had been transferred from Middlesex was divided in 1900 into 18 metropolitan boroughs:
* Bethnal Green
* Chelsea
* Finsbury
* Fulham
* Hackney
* Hammersmith
* Hampstead
* Holborn
* Islington
* Kensington (Royal Borough)
* Paddington
* Poplar
* Shoreditch
* St Marylebone
* St Pancras
* Stepney
* Stoke Newington
* Westminster (City)

===1889 - Middlesex County Council===
Following the Local Government Act 1888, the remaining county came under the control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken Hadley, which became part of Hertfordshire. The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly. Middlesex did not contain any county boroughs, so the county and administrative county (the area of county council control) were identical. At this time, Middlesex regained the right to appoint its own sheriff, lost in the 12th century.

The Local Government Act 1894 divided the administrative county into four rural districts and thirty-one urban districts, based on existing sanitary districts. One urban district, South Hornsey, was an exclave of Middlesex within the County of London until 1900, when it was transferred to the latter county. The rural districts were Hendon, South Mimms, Staines and Uxbridge. Because of increasing urbanisation these had all been abolished by 1934. Urban districts had been created, merged, and many had gained the status of municipal borough by 1965. The districts as at the 1961 census were:

After 1889, the growth of London continued, and the county became almost entirely filled by suburbs of London, with a big rise in population density. This process was accelerated by the Metro-land developments, which covered a large part of the county. The expanding urbanisation had, however, been foretold in 1771 by Tobias Smollett in &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot;, in which it is said:

Public transport in the county, including the extensive network of trams, buses and the London Underground came under control of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 and a New Works Programme was developed to further enhance services during the 1930s. Partly because of its proximity to the capital, the county had a major role during the Second World War. The county was subject to aerial bombardment and contained military establishments, such as RAF Uxbridge and RAF Heston, which were involved in the Battle of Britain.

===County town===
Middlesex arguably never, and certainly not since 1789, had a single, established county town. The City of London could be regarded as its county town for most purposes and provided different locations for the various, mostly judicial, county purposes. The county assizes for Middlesex were held at the Old Bailey in the City of London. Until 1889, the High Sheriff of Middlesex was chosen by the City of London Corporation. The sessions house for the Middlesex Quarter Sessions was Hicks Hall in Clerkenwell (just outside the City boundary) from 1612 to 1782, and Middlesex Sessions House on Clerkenwell Green from 1782 to 1921. The quarter sessions performed most of the limited administration on a county level prior to the creation of the Middlesex County Council in 1889. New Brentford was first promulgated as the county town in 1789, on the basis that it was where elections of knights of the shire (or Members of Parliament) were held from 1701. Thus a traveller&#x27;s and historian&#x27;s London regional summary of 1795 states that (New) Brentford was &quot;considered as the county-town; but there is no town-hall or other public building&quot;. Middlesex County Council took over at the Guildhall in Westminster, which became the Middlesex Guildhall. In the same year, this location was placed into the new County of London, and was thus outside the council&#x27;s area of jurisdiction.

===Creation of Greater London===
The population of inner London (then the County of London) declined after its creation in 1889 as more residents moved into the outer suburbs. In the interwar years, suburban London expanded further, with improvement and expansion of public transport, and the setting up of new industries.

After the Second World War, from 1951 to 1961, the populations of the administrative county of London and of inner Middlesex were in steady decline, with population growth continuing in the outer parts of Middlesex. According to the 1961 census, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston &amp; Isleworth, Tottenham, Wembley, Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100,000, which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status. If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs, it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half, to just under one million.

Evidence submitted to the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London included a recommendation to divide Middlesex into two administrative counties of North Middlesex and West Middlesex. However, the commission instead proposed abolition of the county and merging of the boroughs and districts. This was enacted by Parliament as the London Government Act 1963, which came into force on 1 April 1965.

The Act abolished the administrative counties of Middlesex and London. The Administration of Justice Act 1964 abolished the Middlesex magistracy and lieutenancy, and altered the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court.

====New London Boroughs from former London CC area====
Eighteen of London County Council Metropolitan Boroughs were part of the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1965 these merged to form seven of the twelve current boroughs of Inner London:

* Camden was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hampstead, Holborn and St Pancras.
* Hackney was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington.
* Hammersmith (known as Hammersmith and Fulham from 1979) was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham.
* Islington was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Finsbury and Islington.
* Kensington and Chelsea was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington.
* Tower Hamlets was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Stepney.
* The City of Westminster was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Paddington and St Marylebone and the City of Westminster.

====New London Boroughs from former Middlesex CC area====
In April 1965, nearly all of the area of the historic county of Middlesex became part of Greater London, under the control of the Greater London Council, and formed the new outer London boroughs of Barnet (part only), Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames (part only).

====Areas transferred to Surrey and Hertfordshire County Councils====
The remaining areas were Potters Bar Urban District, which became part of the administrative county of Hertfordshire, and Sunbury-on-Thames Urban District and Staines Urban District, which became part of the administrative county of Surrey. Following the changes, local acts of Parliament relating to Middlesex were henceforth to apply to the entirety of the nine &quot;North West London Boroughs&quot;. In 1974, the three urban districts that had been transferred to Hertfordshire and Surrey were abolished and became the districts of Hertsmere (part only) and Spelthorne respectively. In 1995 the village of Poyle was transferred from Spelthorne to the Berkshire borough of Slough. Additionally, the Greater London boundary to the west and north has been subject to several small changes since 1965.

====Judicial areas====
On its creation in 1965, Greater London was divided into five Commission Areas for justice. The one named &quot;Middlesex&quot; consisted of the boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Hillingdon and Hounslow. It was abolished on 1 July 2003.

==Earldom==
The title Earl of Middlesex was created twice, in 1622 and 1677, but became extinct in 1843.

==Geography==
The county lay within the London Basin and the most significant feature was the River Thames, which formed the southern boundary. The River Lea and the River Colne formed natural boundaries to the east and west. The entire south west boundary of Middlesex followed a gently descending meander of the Thames without hills. In many places &quot;Middlesex bank&quot; is more accurate than &quot;north bank&quot; — for instance at Teddington the river flows north-westward, so the left (Middlesex) bank is the south-west bank. The largely low-lying county was dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south.

In the north, the boundary ran along a WSW/ENE aligned ridge of hills. From the Colne to Barnet Gate Wood, this boundary is marked by a 20 kilometre hedge of great antiquity. East of the wood the hedge continues but did not forms the county boundary, suggesting that the eastern part of the boundary is younger.

After Barnett Gate Wood the hedge continues east to Arkley where it divides into two branches, one continuing east to Chipping Barnet and Cockfosters, with another heading north to form the parish boundary between Shenley and Ridge, both in Hertforshire. Neither branch formed part of the county boundary. The change to the county boundary was probably caused in the late 8th century, before Middlesex took the form of a county, when the Liberty of St Albans was created from parts of the Dioceses of London and Lincoln.

The hills are broken by Barnet or &#x27;Dollis&#x27; valleys. (South of the boundary, these feed into the Welsh Harp Lake or Brent Reservoir which becomes the River Brent). This formed a long protrusion of Hertfordshire into the county. The county was once well wooded, with much of it covered by the ancient Forest of Middlesex; Domesday returns for Middlesex indicate that it was around 30% wooded (much of it wood-pasture) in 1086, about double the English average. The highest point is the High Road by Bushey Heath at .

Bentley Priory Nature Reserve houses Middlesex&#x27;s oldest tree: The Master Oak.

==Economic development==
There were settlements in the area of Middlesex that can be traced back thousands of years before the creation of a county. The economy of the county was dependent on the City of London from early times and was primarily agricultural. A variety of goods were provided for the City, including crops such as grain and hay, livestock and building materials. Tourism began to develop in the late 16th century and, in 1593, John Norden noted that the county was attracting visitors to its &quot;divers devices, neatly decked with rare inventions, environed with orchards of sundry delicate fruits, gardens with delectable walks, arbours, alleys, and great variety of pleasing dainties.&quot; Inns and tea gardens at Isleworth, Tottenham, Edmonton and Hornsey are noted in the 17th and 18th centuries for attracting day-trippers from London. Hampton Court Palace was among the historic buildings opened to the public in the 19th century and 350,000 people visited in 1851.

During the 18th century, the inner parishes of Middlesex became suburbs of the City and were increasingly urbanised. In 1794, Thomas Cox wrote of Middlesex:
In 1803, Sir John Sinclair, president of the Board of Agriculture, spoke of the need to cultivate the substantial Finchley Common and Hounslow Heath (perhaps prophetic of the Dig for Victory campaign of World War II) and fellow Board member Middleton estimated that one tenth of the county, , was uncultivated common, capable of improvement. However, William Cobbett, in his &quot;Rural Rides&quot; first serialised in 1822, said that 
:&quot;A more ugly country between Egham and Kensington would with great difficulty be found in England. Flat as a pancake, and until you come to Hammersmith, the soil is a nasty, stony dirt upon a bed of gravel. Hounslow Heath which is only a little worse than the general run, is a sample of all that is bad in soil and villainous in look. Yet this is now enclosed, and what they call &#x27;cultivated&#x27;. Here is a fresh robbery of villages, hamlets, and farm and labourers&#x27; buildings and abodes.&quot;
Thomas Babington wrote in 1843, &quot;An acre in Middlesex is worth a principality in Utopia&quot; which contrasts neatly with its agricultural description.

The building of radial railway lines from 1839 caused a fundamental shift away from agricultural supply for London towards large scale house building. Tottenham, Edmonton and Enfield in the north developed first as working-class residential suburbs with easy access to central London. The line to Windsor through Middlesex was completed in 1848, and the railway to Potters Bar in 1850; and the Metropolitan and District Railways started a series of extensions into the county in 1878. Closer to London, the districts of Acton, Willesden, Ealing and Hornsey came within reach of the tram and bus networks, providing cheap transport to central London.

After World War I, the availability of labour and proximity to London made areas such as Hayes and Park Royal ideal locations for the developing new industries. New jobs attracted more people to the county and the population continued to rise, reaching a peak in 1951. Middlesex became the location of facilities for the film industry. Twickenham Studios were established in 1913. There were also studios at Cricklewood Studios, Gainsborough Pictures, Isleworth Studios, Kew Bridge Studios and Southall Studios.

==Former postal county== 
Middlesex (abbreviated Middx) is a former postal county. Counties were an element of postal addressing in routine use until 1996, intended to avoid confusion between post towns, and are no longer required for the routing of the mail. The postal county did not match the boundaries of Middlesex because of the presence of the London postal district, which stretched into the county to include Tottenham, Willesden, Hornsey and Chiswick. Addresses in this area included &quot;LONDON&quot; which is the post town but any overlap with the then County of London was coincidental. In 1965, Royal Mail retained the postal county because it would have been too costly to amend addresses covering the bulk of Outer London. Exceptionally, the Potters Bar post town was transferred to Hertfordshire. Geographically the postal county consisted of two unconnected areas, apart. The first was in and around Enfield and the second, larger area was to the west. This led the retention of 25 Post Towns to this day:

† = postal county was not required

The postal county had many border inconsistencies where its constituent post towns encroached on neighbouring counties, such as the villages of Denham in Buckinghamshire, Wraysbury in Berkshire and Eastbury in Hertfordshire which were respectively in the post towns of Uxbridge, Staines and Northwood and therefore in the postal county of Middlesex. Egham Hythe, Surrey also had postal addresses of Staines, Middlesex. Conversely, Hampton Wick was conveniently placed in Kingston, Surrey with its sorting offices just across the river. Nearby Hampton Court Palace has a postal address of East Molesey, therefore associating it with Surrey.

The Enfield post town in the EN postcode area was in the former postal county. All post towns in the HA postcode area and UB postcode area were in the former postal county. Most of the TW postcode area was in the former postal county.

==Culture and community==

===Flag and coat of arms===
The Middlesex Flag is included in the Flag Institute&#x27;s registry of county and regional flags. The flag is a banner of the arms of the former Middlesex County Council, abolished in 1965. A similar design had been used traditionally as a local badge in Middlesex and neighbouring Essex for centuries.

Coats of arms were attributed by the mediaeval heralds to the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. That assigned to the Kingdom of Essex, of which the Middle Saxon Province was part, depicted three &quot;seaxes&quot; or short notched swords on a red background. The seaxe was a weapon carried by Anglo-Saxon warriors, and the term &quot;Saxon&quot; may be derived from the word. These arms became associated with the two counties that approximated to the kingdom: Middlesex and Essex. County authorities, militia and volunteer regiments associated with both counties used the attributed arms.

In 1910, it was observed that the county councils of Essex and Middlesex and the Sheriff&#x27;s Office of the County of London were all using the same arms. Middlesex County Council decided to apply for a formal grant of arms from the College of Arms, with the addition of a heraldic &quot;difference&quot; to the attributed arms. Colonel Otley Parry, a justice of the peace for Middlesex and author of a book on military badges, was asked to devise an addition to the shield. The chosen addition was a &quot;Saxon Crown&quot;, derived from the portrait of King Athelstan on a silver penny of his reign, stated to be the earliest form of crown associated with any English sovereign. The grant of arms was made by letters patent dated 7 November 1910.

The undifferenced arms of the kingdom were eventually granted to Essex County Council in 1932. Seaxes were also used in the insignia of many of the boroughs and urban districts in the county, while the Saxon crown came to be a common heraldic charge in English civic arms. On the creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 a Saxon crown was introduced in its coat of arms. Seaxes appear in the arms of several London borough councils and of Spelthorne Borough Council.

===Military units===
As well as the ancient county fyrd and militia, Middlesex military units have included the Middlesex Regiment, the Middlesex Yeomanry and their predecessors.

In the south-east, the Tower Division, effectively a separate county, had its own military arrangements.

===County day===
Middlesex Day is celebrated each year on 16 May. This commemorates the actions of the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment in 1811, at the Battle of Albuera, during the Peninsular War. 
During the battle, Lieutenant-Colonel William Inglis, despite his injuries, refused to retire from the battle but remained with the regimental colours, encouraging his men with the words &quot;Die hard 57th, die hard!&quot; as they came under intense pressure from a French attack. The regiment held and the battle was won. The &#x27;Die Hards&#x27; subsequently became the West Middlesex&#x27;s regimental nickname and the phrase Die Hard entered the language. In 2003, an early day motion in the House of Commons noted the celebration of 16 May, the anniversary of Albuhera, as Middlesex Day.

===County flower===
In 2002 Plantlife ran a county flowers campaign to assign flowers to each of the counties of the United Kingdom. The general public was invited to vote for the bloom they felt most represented their county. The wood anemone was chosen as the flower of Middlesex. The flower was a common sight in the Forest of Middlesex.

When the suburbs of London swept over Middlesex, many of its woods were bypassed and preserved. The wood anemone still blooms there to this day.

===County history societies===
The London and Middlesex Archaeological Society (LAMAS) was founded in 1855 for the study of the archaeology and local history of the City of London and the county of Middlesex. It works in close association with the Museum of London and with the Museum of London Archaeology. It has over 40 affiliated local history societies in Middlesex.

The interests of family historians in Middlesex are supported by two member organisations of the Federation of Family History Societies: The London, Westminster and Middlesex Family History Society and the West Middlesex Family History Society. For genealogical research Middlesex is assigned Chapman code MDX, except for the City of London (&quot;square mile&quot;) assigned LND.

===Literature===
Sir John Betjeman, Poet Laureate from 1972 until his death in 1984, was born in 1906 in Gospel Oak and grew up in Highgate. He published several poems about Middlesex and suburban life. Many were featured in the televised readings &quot;Metroland&quot;.

==Sport==
Middlesex continues to be used as a geographic frame of reference by a number of sporting associations.

===Rugby Union===
Seven rugby union clubs at national league levels 1 to 4 have some or all of their other teams playing in Middlesex leagues (those marked * having grounds in Middlesex). These are Harlequins*, Saracens*, London Scottish, London Irish*, Richmond, Ealing Trailfinders*, and Barnes.

Middlesex Rugby is the governing body for rugby union in Middlesex. The union selects players from its 88 affiliated clubs for the Middlesex team in the County Championship. It runs the Middlesex RFU Senior Cup open to the top 8 Middlesex clubs that play between tiers 6–7 of the English rugby union system. It also runs the Middlesex RFU Senior Bowl and the Middlesex RFU Senior Vase for sides from lower down the pyramid. It helps run the Herts/Middlesex 1 (tier 9) and Herts/Middlesex 2 (tier 10) leagues. Middlesex Rugby is also active in promoting youth rugby and women&#x27;s rugby in the county.

===Football===
The Middlesex County Football Association regulates and promotes football in the county. The Middlesex F.A. organises many cup competitions, the most prestigious being the Middlesex Senior Cup (founded in 1889) and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup (founded in 1901).

The Middlesex County Football League was founded in 1984 and currently comprises 5 divisions. The premier divisions sits at level 7 of the National League System.

===Cricket===

Middlesex County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. The club was founded in 1864 but teams representing the county have played top-class cricket since the early 18th century and the club has always held first-class status. Middlesex have won thirteen County Championship titles (including 2 shared titles), the most recent in 2016.

The Middlesex Cricket Board is the governing body of all recreational cricket in Middlesex.

The Middlesex County Cricket League is the top-level competition for all recreational club cricket in the county. The League now consists of twenty two divisions in total. The top division has been designated an ECB Premier League.

<text>Kozan, formerly Sis (), is a municipality and district of Adana Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,903 km2, and its population is 132,703 (2022). It is northeast of Adana, in the northern section of the Çukurova plain. The Kilgen River, a tributary of the Ceyhan, flows through Kozan and crosses the plain south into the Mediterranean. The Taurus Mountains rise up sharply behind the town.

Sis was the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, today&#x27;s Sis (ancient city), now called Kozan Kalesi, was built on a long rocky ridge in the center of the modern city.

The population of the city has grown rapidly in recent years, from 15,159 in 1960, to 54,451 in 1990, to 72,463 in 2007 and to 74,521 in 2009 (census figures).

==Names==
The oldest known name is Sis or Siskia. Under the Roman Empire, it was for a time named Flavias or Flaviopolis. The Greek version of the older name, Σίσιον Sision, came back into use in the later Byzantine period. In Armenian, it is called Sis Սիս or Sissu.

&quot;Kozan&quot; () was originally the name of the administrative division the town Sis was a part of. This name originates from the Qōzānoğlu dynasty of derebeys that controlled the region from 1689 to 1865.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

In 704, Sis was besieged by the Arabs, but relieved by the Byzantines. The Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil took it and refortified it, but it soon returned to Byzantine hands. It was rebuilt in 1186 by Leo II, king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, one of the Rupenide dynasty who made the city the capital of the Kingdom of Lesser Armenia (from 1186 until 1375). During the Crusade the catholicate returned to Sis in 1294, and remained there 150 years.

In 1266 Sis, the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, was captured and damaged by the Egyptian Mamluks led by Baibars. al-Said Barakah sent Qalawun to attack the city in 1277, but in 1375, Sis was taken and demolished by the Ramadanids, under the flag of the Mamluke Sultan of Egypt. The town never recovered its prosperity, not even when it passed into the power of the Ottomans in 1516.

===Ecclesiastical history===

Sis had an important place in ecclesiastical history both the Armenian Apostolic Church and as a Roman Catholic titular see. It is first mentioned in Theodoret&#x27;s life of St. Simeon Stylites.

In the Middle Ages, Sis was the religious center of Christian Armenians, until the Armenians moved the seat of Catholicos back to Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), in Armenia. Lequien (II, 899) gives the names of several bishops of Sis, before and after Gregory IX.

Even prior to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, Sis was an episcopal see and several names of bishops and patriarchs can be found in the literature:

*Alexander, later Bishop of Jerusalem and founder of the famous library of the Holy Sepulchre in the third century
*Nicetas, present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325
*John, who lived in 451;
*Andrew in the sixth century
*George (681)
*Eustratus, Patriarch of Antioch about 868

In 1441, Sis having fallen from its high estate, the Armenian clergy proposed to remove the see, and on the refusal of the Catholicos of the day, Gregory IX, installed a rival, namely Kirakos I Virapetsi (Kirakos of Armenia) at Echmiadzin, who, as soon as Selim I had conquered Greater Armenia, became the more widely accepted of the two by the Armenian church in the Ottoman Empire.

The Catholicos of Sis (of the Holy See of Cilicia) maintained himself nevertheless, with under his jurisdiction several bishops, numerous villages and convents, when the patriarch Nerses, declaring finally for Echmiadzin, carried the government with him. In 1885, Sis tried to declare Echmiadzin schismatic, and in 1895 its clergy took it on themselves to elect a Catholicos; but the Porte annulled the election, and only allowed it six years later upon Sis renouncing its pretensions to independence. That Catholicos had the right to prepare the sacred myron (oil) and to preside over a synod, but was in fact not more than a metropolitan, and regarded by many Armenians as schismatic.

===Ottoman period===

In the Ottoman period, Kozan was in the sanjak of Adana, and the seat of the kaza of Kozan. Ottoman archives show that Devşirme system was implemented in Kozan. However there is evidence that the locals resisted the practise. In 1564, for example, villagers from Sis came to the Ottoman capital Istanbul and kidnapped their children back. From 1689 to 1865, the region was under the control of Kozanoğulları, a family of feudal lords. While there are various theories about their history and origin, they claimed descent from Turkmen tribes, and Ahmed Cevdet Pasha wrote that they were descended from the Arık tribe of Warsaks.

===Modern===

At the turn of the twentieth century, the town&#x27;s population was 8,000, about 5,600 of which were Armenians. They were all deported during the course of the Armenian genocide. Kozan was occupied by France between March 8, 1919 - June 2, 1920 during the Turkish War of Independence. After Turkey was declared a republic, Kozan was a province, compromising the districts of Kozan, Kadirli, Feke and Saimbeyli between 1923 and 1926.

<text>Wallia, Walha or Vallia (Spanish: &quot;Walia&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Vália&quot;), ( 385 – 418) was king of the Visigoths from 415 to 418, earning a reputation as a great warrior and prudent ruler. He was elected to the throne after Athaulf and Sigeric were both assassinated in 415. One of Wallia&#x27;s most notable achievements was negotiating a &quot;foedus&quot; (a kind of treaty or agreement) with the Roman emperor Honorius in 416. This agreement allowed the Visigoths to settle in Aquitania, a region in modern-day France, in exchange for military service to Rome. This settlement marked a significant step towards the eventual establishment of a Visigothic kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula. He was succeeded by Theodoric I.

==Biography==
Political intrigue preceded Wallia&#x27;s ascension to power, for his Visigothic predecessor Athaulf—who married Galla Placidia in 414—was murdered by his followers who believed him to be a puppet to Roman interests. Athaulf&#x27;s successor, Sigeric, ignored the Visigothic rights of procedure to military leadership and seemed to likewise acquiesce to the Romans; such perceptions among his people quickly led to his death in turn just seven-days after assuming power. Wallia was chosen to replace Sigeric in 415, since the Visigoths were convinced he would end any peace negotiations with Rome undertaken by his forerunners. At the time, the Goths&#x27; main antagonist was Constantius, the &quot;magister militum&quot; of emperor Honorius.

Like his predecessor Alaric, Wallia attempted to take his Gothic forces to northern Africa but ultimately &quot;foundered in the Sea of Gibraltar&quot;, a failure that precipitated his suing for peace. Subsequently, Wallia accepted a treaty offered by Honorius with the Roman Empire. Christian historian and theologian, Orosius, reported that the terms of the agreements made in 416 and 418 were very favorable for the Romans, including the return of Honorius&#x27; sister Galla Placidia to him. Whatever advantages won by Wallia in acquiring food for his forces via treaty with Rome, it was Constantius who exploited the situation by securing the return of emperor&#x27;s sister, a move historian Michael Kulikowski termed, a route &quot;into the imperial family&quot;.
Now operating in Roman service as &quot;foederati&quot;, Wallia and his Goths marched against the Alans and Vandals in both Baetica and Lusitania with &quot;dramatic success&quot;. These exploits against the Asding Vandals and Alans were at the behest of Constantius. Between 417 and into 418, Wallia&#x27;s Goths inflicted considerable defeats upon the Vandals and the Alans alike; even killing the Alan ruler, Addax. To this end, Roman writer and clergyman Hydatius recorded how Wallia, king of the Goths &quot;in the name of Rome...inflicted a vast slaughter upon the barbarians in Spain&quot;. For whatever reason, Constantius recalled Wallia&#x27;s Goths—historian Randers-Pehrson suggests that the &quot;magister militum&quot; was alarmed and fearful of their success—and then &quot;settled them in southern Gaul.&quot; Nonetheless, Wallia&#x27;s Gothic federates were &quot;assigned&quot; the Garonne valley from &quot;Toulouse to Bordeaux&quot; and the coastal strip along the Atlantic from Les Landes at the foot of the Pyrenees mountains &quot;to the Loire in the north&quot;. Despite his success, Wallia died before he was able to leave Spain.

Wallia&#x27;s daughter was the mother of Ricimer and the mother-in-law of Gundowech, King of the Burgundians.

Wallia is sometimes assumed to have been the historical model for the legendary figure of Walter of Aquitaine.

<text>Manbij (; ; ) is a city in the northeast of Aleppo Governorate in northern Syria, west of the Euphrates. The 2004 census gives its population as nearly 100,000. The population of Manbij is largely Arab, with Kurdish, Turkmen, Circassian, and Chechen minorities. Many of its residents practice Naqshbandi Sufism.

During the Syrian Civil War, the city was first captured by rebels in 2012, overrun by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2014 and finally captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in 2016, bringing it into the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). From 2018 to 2024, after an agreement with the SDF, the Syrian Arab Army had been deployed on the city&#x27;s periphery as a buffer between the Turkish occupation of Northern Syria and the AANES. On December 9, 2024, it was reported that the city came under the control of the Syrian Interim Government after a deal was reached between the U.S. and Turkey to allow the safe exit of SDF fighters.

==Etymology==
Coins struck at the city before Alexander&#x27;s conquest record the Aramean name of the city as Manbug (&quot;Mnbg&quot;, &quot;Site of the Spring&quot;). For the Assyrians it was known as Nappigu or Nanpigi. Its name was hellenized as Bambyce (, &quot;Bambykē&quot;) and recorded by Pliny as Mabog (, &quot;Mabbog&quot; or &quot;Mabbogh&quot;).

As the center of the worship of the Syrian fertility goddess Atargatis, it became known to the Greeks as Hieropolis (, &quot;Hierópolis&quot;), the &quot;City of the Sanctuary&quot;, and then as Hierapolis (, &quot;Hierápolis&quot;), the &quot;Holy City&quot;.

==Cult of Atargatis==

This worship of Atargatis was immortalized in &quot;De Dea Syria&quot; which has traditionally been attributed to Lucian of Samosata, who gave a full description of the religious cult of the shrine and the tank of sacred fish of Atargatis, of which Aelian also relates marvels. According to the &quot;De Dea Syria&quot;, the worship was of a phallic character, votaries offering little male figures of wood and bronze. There were also huge phalli set up like obelisks before the temple, which were ceremoniously climbed once a year and decorated.

The temple contained a holy chamber into which only priests were allowed to enter. A great bronze altar stood in front, set about with statues, and in the forecourt lived numerous sacred animals and birds (but not swine) used for sacrifice.

Some three hundred priests served the shrine and there were numerous minor ministrants. The lake was the centre of sacred festivities and it was customary for votaries to swim out and decorate an altar standing in the middle of the water. Self-mutilation and other orgies went on in the temple precinct, and there was an elaborate ritual on entering the city and first visiting the shrine.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The Arameans called the city &quot;Mnbg&quot; (Manbug). Manbij was part of the kingdom of Bit Adini and was annexed by the Assyrians in 856 BC. The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III renamed it Lita-Ashur and built a royal palace. The city was reconquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC. The sanctuary of Atargatis predates the Macedonian conquest, as it seems that the city was the center of a dynasty of Aramean priest-kings ruling at the very end of the Achaemenid Empire; two kings are known, &#x27;Abyati and Abd-Hadad. The fate of Abd-Hadad is not known but the city came firmly under the Macedonian empire, and prospered under the rule of the Seleucids who made it the chief station on their main road between Antioch and Seleucia on the Tigris. The temple was sacked by Crassus on his way to meet the Parthians (53 BC). The coinage of the city begins in the 4th century BC with the coins of the priest-kings followed by the Aramaic series of the Macedonian and Seleucid monarchs. They show Atargatis either as a bust with mural crown or as riding on a lion. She continues to supply the chief type even during imperial Roman times, being generally shown seated with the tympanum in her hand. Other coins substitute the legend Θεάς Συρίας Ιεροπολιτόν &quot;Theas Syrias Ieropoliton&quot; within a wreath.

In the third century, the city was the capital of Euphratensis province and one of the great cities of Roman Syria. It was, however, in a ruinous state when Julian gathered his troops there before marching to his defeat and death in Mesopotamia. Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I held it to ransom after Byzantine Emperor Justinian I had failed to defend it.

===Middle Ages===
The Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid restored Manbij at the end of the 8th century, making it the capital of the frontier province of al-Awasim. Afterward, the city became a point of contention between the Byzantines, Arabs and Turkic groups. The Arab chieftain Salih ibn Mirdas captured it circa 1022, making Manbij, along with Balis and al-Rahba, the foundation of his Mirdasid emirate. At the time, Manbij was one of the most important fortresses in northern Syria. In 1068, the Byzantine emperor Romanos Diogenes captured it, defeated the Mirdasids and their Bedouin allies, killed the city&#x27;s inhabitants and plundered the surrounding countryside. Romanos later withdrew due to a severe shortage of food and supplies. It was later captured by Seljuk Sultan Malik-Shah I in 1086. In 1124, Belek Ghazi tried to annex Manbij, after he had imprisoned its emir Hassan al-Ba&#x27;labakki, but he was hit and killed by an arrow during the siege.

The Crusaders never captured Manbij during their 11th–12th century invasions of the Levant, but the Latin Church archbishopric of Hierapolis was re-established in the town of Duluk by 1134. By 1152, Duluk and Manbij were captured by the Zengids under Nur ad-Din, who reconstructed and strengthened the city&#x27;s fortress. The Ayyubid sultan, Saladin, conquered it from its Zengid lord, Qutb ad-Din Inal, in 1175. In 1260, the Mongols under Hulagu destroyed Ayyubid Manbij, which was consequently abandoned by its Turkmen and Assyrian inhabitants as they migrated to Aleppo.

===Modern era===
Manbij&#x27;s ruins are extensive but mostly belong to the later period of its history. Most of the monuments of Manbij are gone, because it is a strategically important place at a group of crossroads, unlike Cyrrhus whose bishop was under Manbij. Henry Maundrell who visited Mambij in 1699 noticed a rock with large busts of a male and a female with two eagles below them. Another rock had three figures sculpted in low relief. Volney who visited the place in 18th century mentioned that no remains of Atargatis&#x27; temple existed. Alexander Drummond noticed walls of a square building which he said was Atargatis&#x27; temple and also a base in the building which he identified as an altar.

Travellers in the 19th century had recorded some of its ancient remains, but now almost all of them, including Atargatis&#x27; temple, its sacred lake, colonnades, Roman baths, Roman theatres, walls and churches built by the Byzantine Empire as well as madrassas built in the medieval era, have been destroyed. The sacred lake of Atargatis has disappeared and has been converted into a football field. Only a part of the wall that enclosed the lake has survived but no ruins of Atargatis&#x27; temple remains. Some ancient Roman military stele also exist. Ruins of the southern wall that enclosed Atargatis&#x27; temple still survive. The walls of the city still exist but have been plundered.

The Ottoman government resettled the area with Circassian refugees from the Russo-Turkish War in 1878. As of 1911, its 1,500 inhabitants were all Circassians. Armenian refugees settled in Manbij during the Armenian genocide. In autumn 1915 Djemal Pasha ordered the establishment of a camp for about 1000 families of the Armenian Clergy. In January and February 1916 the sub prefect of Manbij ordered the camp to be cleared and the Armenians to be deported to Meskene. The destruction of pre-modern Manbij has been attributed to its resettlement by Circassians and Armenians.

====Syrian Civil War====
Before and in the early years of the Syrian Civil War, Manbij had an ethnically diverse population of Arab, Kurdish, Turkmen, and Circassian Sunni Muslims, many of whom followed the Naqshbandi Sufi order. The city&#x27;s socio-political life was dominated by its main tribes. Tribal leaders served as the mediators and arbiters of major disputes in Manbij, while the state&#x27;s security forces largely dealt with petty offenses. The city was relatively liberal compared to other Sunni Muslim-majority cities in the countryside of Aleppo.

During the civil war, on 20 July 2012, Manbij fell to local rebel forces who thereafter administered the city. In December, there was an election to appoint a local council. In January 2014, forces from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took over the city after ousting the rebels. The city has since become a hub for trading in looted artifacts and archaeological digging equipment. In June 2016, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched an offensive to capture Manbij, and by 8 June had fully encircled the city. On 12 August the SDF had established full control over Manbij after a two-month battle.
By 15 August, thousands of previously displaced citizens of Manbij were reported returning. On 19 August 2016, the Manbij Military Council issued a written statement announcing it had taken over the security of Manbij city center and villages from the SDF, of which it is a component.

Today Manbij is self-administered by the Manbij City Council, co-chaired by Sheikh Farouk al-Mashi and Salih Haji Mohammed, as part of Shahba region within the &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous Federation of Northern Syria – Rojava framework. While public administration including public schools has regained secular normalcy after the ISIL episode, a reconciliation committee to overcome rifts created by the civil war was formed, and international humanitarian aid has been delivered, the democratic confederalist political program of Rojava is driving political and societal transformations in terms of direct democracy and gender equality. Reconstruction after devastations of civil war combat remains a major challenge.
Until October 2019, when US and other Western forces withdrew from northern Syria, Manbij was also a hub for Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve training of new SDF recruits in the fight against ISIL and other Islamist militias in Syria. On 26 February, the United States announced its support for the security of the Manbij Military Council. The United States also reportedly sent special forces and several military convoys to Manbij after the announcement.

On 12 March 2017, the Legislative Assembly of Manbij approved the elected co-presidents who then took office. During the meeting the departments of the committee members, co-presidents and committees were determined after speeches and evaluations. 13 committees were determined. The 13 new committees include 71 Arabs, 43 Kurds, 10 Turkmen, 8 Circassians, an Armenian and a Chechen.

On 1 November 2018, Turkish and US troops began joint patrols around Manbij along the front lines of the Euphrates Shield rebel territory and the Manbij Military Council. The joint patrols were seen as part of a &quot;roadmap&quot; for easing tensions between militants in the region and tensions between the two NATO allies.

On 28 December 2018, the YPG asked the Assad government via Twitter to protect Manbij from attacks by the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army. The Syrian government&#x27;s media said the Syrian army had entered Manbij, a claim that was disputed by other sources the same day. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the Syrian Army was still outside of the town.

On 15 January 2019, a suicide attack in Manbij claimed by ISIL left at least 19 casualties. Among them, four U.S. military personnel were reported dead and three wounded. One of the dead was a U.S. Army soldier, one was U.S. Navy sailor Shannon M. Kent, one was a U.S. Department of Defense civilian working in support of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and one was an employee of Valiant Integrated Services, a contractor supporting American operations.

During the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, following the withdraw of US and other Western troops from northern Syria, the Syrian Arab Army and Russian Military Police entered Manbij to preempt a Turkish and TFSA offensive.
On 6 December 2024, the Syrian National Army launched an offensive on Manbij against the Syrian Democratic Forces. On 9 December 2024, it was reported, that they took control of the city. Since the takeover, Manbij has faced a sharp rise in security incidents and looting, mirroring trends in other areas under SNA control. The SOHR reported that SNA militants had looted the houses of Kurdish residents. On February 3, 2025, a VBIED detonated near the Hassin station, just outside Manbij City, killing at least 19 people. The following day, residents of the city conducted a general strike to protest the negligence of pro-Turkish factions in maintaining security and order.

==Ecclesiastical history==

Lequien names ten bishops of Hierapolis. Among the best-known are Alexander of Hierapolis, an ardent advocate of Nestorianism, who died in exile in Egypt; Philoxenus of Mabbug, a famous Miaphysite scholar; and Stephen of Hierapolis (c. 600), author of a life of St. Golindouch. In the sixth century, the metropolitan see had nine suffragan bishoprics. Chabot mentions thirteen Jacobite archbishops from the ninth to the twelfth century. One Latin bishop, Franco, in 1136, is known.

Hierapolis in Syria is the nominal see of three Catholic successor titular sees:
* the Latin Catholic Metropolitan titular archbishopric of Hierapolis of the Romans
* the Melkite Catholic Titular Archbishopric of Hierapolis of the Melkites
* the Syrian Titular Bishopric of Hierapolis of the Syrians

<text>It&#x27;s That Man Again (commonly contracted to ITMA) was a BBC radio comedy programme which ran for twelve series from 1939 to 1949. The shows featured Tommy Handley in the central role, a fast-talking figure, around whom the other characters orbited. The programmes were written by Ted Kavanagh and produced by Francis Worsley. Handley died during the twelfth series, the remaining programmes of which were immediately cancelled: &quot;ITMA&quot; could not work without him, and no further series were commissioned.

&quot;ITMA&quot; was a character-driven comedy whose satirical targets included officialdom and the proliferation of minor wartime regulations. Parts of the scripts were rewritten in the hour before the broadcast, to ensure topicality. &quot;ITMA&quot; broke away from the conventions of previous radio comedies, and from the humour of the music halls. The shows used sound effects in a novel manner, which, alongside a wide range of voices and accents, created the programme&#x27;s atmosphere.

The show presented more than seventy regular characters during its twelve seasons, most of them with his or her own catchphrase. Among them were the bibulous Colonel Chinstrap (&quot;I don&#x27;t mind if I do&quot;), the charlady Mrs Mopp (&quot;Can I do you now, sir?&quot;), the incompetent German agent Funf (&quot;this is Funf speaking&quot;), the courtly odd-job men Cecil and Claude (&quot;After you, Claude—no, after &quot;you&quot;, Cecil&quot;), the Middle Eastern hawker Ali Oop (&quot;I go—I come back&quot;), and the lugubrious Mona Lott (&quot;It&#x27;s being so cheerful that keeps me going&quot;). To keep the show fresh, old characters were dropped and new ones introduced over the years.

&quot;ITMA&quot; was an important contributor to British morale during the Second World War, with its cheerful take on the day-to-day preoccupations of the public, but its detailed topicality—one of its greatest attractions at the time—has prevented it from wearing well on repeated hearing. The show&#x27;s lasting legacy is its influence on subsequent BBC comedy. &quot;ITMA&quot;″s innovative structure—a fast-moving half-hour show with musical interludes and a cast of regular characters with popular catchphrases—was successfully continued in comedy shows of the 1950s and 1960s, such as &quot;Take It from Here&quot;, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Round the Horne&quot;.

==Background==
The comedian Tommy Handley started as in music hall before becoming a regular feature on BBC radio from 1924. By the end of the 1920s he was, according to the writers Andy Foster and Steve Furst, a household name in Britain; his popularity continued into the 1930s. The scriptwriter Ted Kavanagh was a fan of Handley and wrote a script for a comedy sketch for him in 1926. Handley liked the work and bought it; it was the start of a professional relationship that lasted until Handley&#x27;s death in 1949.

Although the BBC featured many comic acts in its variety programmes, it had no regular comedy series until early 1938, when &quot;Band Waggon&quot; and &quot;Danger! Men at Work&quot; began. The former, which ran for three series in 1938 and 1939, was a particular success; John Watt, the BBC&#x27;s director of variety, wanted a successor and decided that Handley would be the right person to present it. In June 1939 Handley, Kavanagh and the producer Francis Worsley met at the Langham Hotel, London, to discuss ideas for a sketch show to meet Watt&#x27;s criteria. They decided to emulate the quick-fire style of American radio programmes such as the &quot;Burns and Allen Show&quot;, although with a much more English quality.

Initial plans were to call the new programme &quot;MUG&quot;—the &quot;Ministry of Universal Gratification&quot;—but Worsley preferred &quot;ITMA&quot;. &quot;ITMA&quot;, or &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;, referred to Adolf Hitler, and the term was used as a headline to describe him by Bert Gunn, the editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

==Format==
&quot;ITMA&quot; was a character-driven comedy and contained parody and satire, unlike previous British radio comedy. The programme&#x27;s satirical targets during the war were government departments and the ostensibly petty wartime regulations, although the programme &quot;never challenged authority but instead acted as a safety valve for the public&#x27;s irritation with bureaucracy, wartime shortages, queues and the black market&quot;, according to the cultural historian Martin Dibbs.
According to Foster and Furst &quot;ITMA&quot; was &quot;entirely new, breaking away from the conventions of both radio and music hall comedy&quot;. It relied on Handley&#x27;s quick-fire delivery of the humour, with his &quot;near-miraculous technique&quot;. The writer and producer John Fisher, in his examination of 20th-century comedians and comedy, highlights &quot;ITMA&quot;″s &quot;speed of delivery, its quick-fire succession of short scenes and verbal non-sequiturs, all breaking away from the traditional music hall sketch orientation of &quot;Band Waggon&quot;&quot;. The broadcasts had an average of eighteen-and-a-half minutes of dialogue into which Kavanagh would attempt to write one hundred laughs—an average of a laugh every eleven seconds. Between the comic scenes there were usually two musical interludes in each show: the first purely orchestral and the second featuring a song from the current resident singer.

The storylines for each week were thin, and the programme was written to have Handley at the centre interacting with a cast of recurring characters, all of whom had their own catchphrase or phrases. The catchphrases were used deliberately to help the listening public to identify which of the characters was speaking. The programme was broadcast live each week and many of the show&#x27;s sound effects were done live alongside the actors. For &quot;ITMA&quot; a sound effect was not a shorthand way of setting a scene for a listener, but &quot;as a means of punctuating the rapid progress of events ... doing the work of words, and permitting an extraordinarily economical drama for a medium that relies on words—and sounds&quot;, according to the academic Peter Davison. The variety of characters and sounds was key to Kavanagh, who wrote that he wanted:
to use sound for all it was worth, the sound of different voices and accents, the use of catchphrases, the impact of funny sounds in words, of grotesque effects to give atmosphere—every device to create the illusion of rather crazy or inverted reality.

The scripts were written during the week of broadcast to ensure topicality. The year after &quot;ITMA&quot; ended, Kavanagh reflected &quot;I myself cannot understand some of the jokes. They were skits on a nine-days wonder—a headline of that day&#x27;s paper, and dead the following week. Every programme is an accurate reflection of the war situation at the time.&quot; Some parts of a script were rewritten in the hours leading up to a broadcast as the news changed. Kavanagh visited army camps and factories to listen to the patois and slang, the current jokes doing the rounds, as well as complaints and frustration, and used the material in the show. In this manner, Worsley considers that &quot;ITMA&quot; was &quot;the closest radio had come to the everyday jokes that ordinary people have always made&quot;.

As the programme matured, Kavanagh changed the flow of the programme away from the disjointed collection of scenes or sketches and towards a more defined storyline.

==Broadcasts==
===Pre-war===
====Series 1: July to August 1939====

The first series of &quot;ITMA&quot; was planned to be a trial run of six shows of 45-minute duration, broadcast fortnightly. They began on 12 July 1939, performed at a BBC sound facility, either at Maida Vale Studios, or St. George&#x27;s Hall. The shows were broadcast live on the BBC National Programme at 8.15 pm. The programme was set on a ship able to broadcast radio programmes, with Handley as the station controller and presenter. He was accompanied by Cecilia Eddy, Eric Egan and Sam Heppner. The show included a quiz hosted by Lionel Gamlin.

In an article in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; that accompanied the first programme, Worsley described the premise of the show: Handley &quot;gets hold of a ship, equips it with a transmitter and studio, and sails the Seven Seas scattering broadcast culture (Handley brand) and &#x27;commercials&#x27; (any brand)&quot;. Music was provided by the Jack Harris Band, who had been performing at London hotspots, including the Café de Paris and the London Casino. With a tense international situation in mid-1939, Kavanagh was careful to avoid writing in political jokes, or any material too topical or sensitive. Handley was known to keep to a script, with little or no ad-libbing to worry the producers.

The fourth episode of &quot;ITMA&quot; was broadcast on 30 August. When the Second World War broke out on 3 September, the remainder of the series was cancelled. The show had been of limited success, and Worsley thought it was likely to have been &quot;another broadcasting flop&quot;.

===Wartime===
====Series 2: September 1939 to February 1940====
The BBC had planned for the outbreak of war, and once it was declared, the Variety Department was moved to Bristol. The relocation meant some of the original performers were not available; a new cast was assembled from those who had moved to Bristol and who had received the requisite security clearance from the Ministry of Information. Handley was accompanied by Vera Lennox, Maurice Denham, Sam Costa and Jack Train, and the music for the second series was by the Jack Hylton Band, conducted by Billy Ternent and supported by the Rhythm Octet.

With the idea of a broadcasting ship now too improbable during wartime, the premise of the programme changed to have Handley as the head of the fictional Ministry of Aggravation and Mysteries, where he worked in the Office of . Other changes to the format included dropping the quiz section of the programme—which Worsley thought held up the flow of the show—replaced by &quot;Radio Fakenburg&quot;, a spoof of Radio Luxembourg. The running time was reduced from the 45 minutes of the first series to half an hour, and remained so through all the subsequent series. A blackout was in place for evenings and nights, and all cinemas and theatres had been closed by the government; such measures provided a boost to the listening figures for the show. The writer and comedian Barry Took writes that the success also came from the programme&#x27;s &quot;self-assurance and cheerful optimism [which was] a welcome relief in that time of fear and uncertainty&quot;.

The second series of &quot;ITMA&quot; finished in February 1940 and the show went on a nationwide tour that kept it off the air for nearly 18 months, except for one special edition in May 1940. Took notes that the show lacked the impact it had on radio, as Handley&#x27;s performances were more intimate through a microphone than in a theatre.

====Series 3 and 4: June 1941 to May 1942====
While &quot;ITMA&quot; was absent from the airwaves, the German bombing campaign had included Bristol, which triggered a move of the Variety Department to Bangor, northwest Wales, in April 1941. When series three began broadcasting in June 1941, Kavanagh had introduced more characters, and set the show in the fictional seaside town of Foaming-at-the-Mouth with Handley as its mayor, renaming the programme, briefly, &quot;It&#x27;s That Sand Again&quot;, before it reverted to &quot;ITMA&quot;. There were also changes in the cast. Denham and Costa had both joined the armed forces since the previous series; new actors were brought in, including Horace Percival, Dorothy Summers, Clarence Wright and Fred Yule.

Series 3 ran for six weeks, ending on 25 July 1941. Series 4 followed two months later, beginning on 26 September. The programme was attracting 16 million listeners by this stage, and was the most popular programme the BBC Variety Department had ever broadcast. During programme five, listeners heard the explosion of two naval mines that had been dropped on Bangor, landing half a mile (0.8 km) from the studio, instead of in the River Mersey. Although the actors continued after a brief pause, the programme had been taken off the air and replaced with music.

In April 1942 &quot;ITMA&quot; provided a command performance at Windsor Castle in the presence of George VI and his queen on the occasion of the 16th birthday of Princess Elizabeth. It was, notes Worsley, the first Royal Command Radio Show. The royal family were fans of the programme; a member of the Royal Household said that if the war were to end between 8.30 and 9.00 pm on a Thursday night none of the household would dare to tell the King until &quot;ITMA&quot; had finished.

====Series 5 and 6: September 1942 to July 1943====
Series 5 started in September 1942 and ran for twenty weeks. One of the programmes in November was broadcast on the BBC Forces Programme to the soldiers in North Africa, the first time the show had been transmitted to the troops. The shows became increasingly topical and up-to-the-minute. Worsley began experimenting with the size of the audience to see which worked best. He tried in the theatres and cinemas of Bangor and Llandudno to get an audience of 2000, and in the studio in Bangor with 200; he also tried with no audience, and settled on 200 as the right number. The premise of the show changed again with Handley ejected as the mayor of Foaming-in-the-Mouth, and now the manager of a munitions factory. Several new characters were introduced, including Colonel Chinstrap, a dipsomaniac retired army officer voiced by Train.

Before the sixth series began recording, a film version, &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot;, was released. Starring Handley and including many of the radio programme regulars, it was written by Kavanagh and Howard Irving Young and directed by Walter Forde. &quot;The Times&quot; considered it difficult to transpose a radio show format onto a cinema screen, but thought Forde &quot;manages his difficult task extremely well&quot;. As a consequence, the reviewer thought the film &quot;achieves at least a partial success through the extravagance of its own craziness&quot;.

The scenario of the programme changed again for series six, when, following a decision to move the munitions factory underground, a sulphur spring was tapped and Foaming-in-the-Mouth became a spa.

====Series 7 and 8: October 1943 to June 1945====
In the latter part of 1943 the Variety Department finished a relocation back to London. Series 7 of &quot;ITMA&quot;, which began in October that year, was recorded in the Criterion Theatre at Piccadilly Circus. The show restarted without Train, whose health, which had been worsening for some time, broke down completely; he spent a year in a sanatorium in North Wales recovering. Worsley took the decision to rest Train&#x27;s characters rather than have another actor portray him; although he was criticised for the decision, he said &quot;any imitation was to my mind as paste to real diamonds&quot;. The series included broadcasts for each of the three forces: in January 1944 &quot;ITMA&quot; was broadcast from the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow, a show for the Royal Air Force was recorded at the Criterion in February, and an Army edition from the Garrison Theatre at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich.

Series 8 began in September 1944 with a special show from the Wolseley Motors factory in Birmingham, but the show was not well received, and it was decided not to have any further broadcasts away from the studio. Train returned to the cast, but at the end of 1944 Worsley was hospitalised for seven months. The production duties were taken up by Ronnie Waldman until Worsley returned in May 1945. His first programme back was &quot;V-ITMA&quot;, the special edition show of 11 May 1945, which celebrated the end of the war in Europe. The series came to an end a month later, after a run of 39 weeks.

===Post-war===
====Series 9 to 12, post-war: September 1945 to January 1949====
For the start of the post-war &quot;ITMA&quot;s, Handley, Kavanagh and Worsley decided to change many of the cast to keep the show fresh; Dorothy Summers, Sydney Keith, Dino Galvani and Horace Percival were all released from the show and replaced by Hugh Morton, Mary O&#x27;Farrell, Carleton Hobbs and Lind Joyce; Clarence Wright returned to the programme. The premise of the show changed too: Handley left Foaming-in-the-Mouth and became the governor of the fictional island of Tomtopia. The storyline towards the end of series 9 centred on a government investigation of the administration on Tomtopia; the series ended in June 1946 with Handley leaving Tomtopia to return to Britain.

A prequel programme to series 10, &quot;Whither Tomtopia?&quot;, was based in the idea that Handley had &quot;to face an enquiry into his governorship&quot; of the island. He faced questions from, among others, Dilys Powell—the film critic from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;—the medical spokesman Dr Charles Hill and the author A. G. Street; the programme was chaired by Sir William Darling, MP. The remainder of the series dealt with Handley living in the fictional Castle WeeHoose in Scotland, where he was building a rocket to take him to the Moon. In about week six of the series, the rocket was launched, but crash-landed on Tomtopia, where a new governor—Percy Palaver, played by Deryck Guyler—was in charge.

Series 11, which began in September 1947, had the final recruit to the &quot;ITMA&quot; cast: Hattie Jacques, who played Ella Phant and Sophie Tuckshop. She became so nervous during the audition that Handley held her hand, which she found made her more nervous. Handley&#x27;s health was beginning to decline by the end of the 38-week series, and it was suggested that series 12 should be delayed. He said no, and &quot;ITMA&quot; began again in September 1948. On 9 January 1949, three days after the sixteenth episode of the series—the 310th episode of &quot;ITMA&quot;—Handley died suddenly of a cerebral haemorrhage. The news was announced on that evening&#x27;s radio, at the close of the Sunday evening repeat of the show, by the Director General of the BBC, Sir William Haley, who insisted on making the announcement himself. Without its star, &quot;ITMA&quot; was cancelled; Took observes that Handley &quot;was so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance that &quot;ITMA&quot; died with him&quot;.

==Leading characters==
The main character was always Handley&#x27;s, whether as manager of the pirate radio station, head of the Office of Twerps, Mayor of Foaming-at-the-Mouth, factory manager, Governor of Tomtopia or down-and-out. He remained the fast-talking central figure, around whom all the other characters orbited. Took comments that it is impossible to put them into order of popularity: &quot;They were all successful. Everyone had their own favourite&quot;. Some of the best known are described below, in order of first appearance in the show.

===Funf===
Funf, &quot;the enemy agent with the feet of sauerkraut&quot;, was the earliest of the show&#x27;s major supporting characters, making his debut in the second programme of the second series. He was an incompetent German agent, &quot;ITMA&quot;&#x27;s response to a national scare in 1940 about a supposed &quot;fifth column&quot; in Britain. He would telephone Handley to make dark threats, in a sinister, hollow voice, which Train produced by speaking across the top of an empty glass held next to the microphone. Handley&#x27;s verbal dexterity continually left Funf in confusion. Funf, described by the media historian Denis Gifford as &quot;the greatest of all war-time characters&quot;, became what Worsley called &quot;a national craze&quot; and helped to make the German propaganda machine a source of public ridicule in Britain.

===The Diver===
The Diver was drawn from a real-life figure familiar to Handley&#x27;s generation of Merseysiders. The one-legged diver and swimmer Frank Gadsby was well known at New Brighton in the first decades of the 20th century for high-diving off the pier, watched by what the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; called &quot;countless boatloads of people&quot; He would solicit donations with phrases appropriated by his caricature in &quot;ITMA&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget the diver, sir, don&#x27;t forget the diver. Every penny makes the water warmer!&quot;

In &quot;ITMA&quot; the Diver was what Worsley called a &quot;crossing&quot; character: he would cross a scene for a few seconds, often to interrupt Handley at a particularly inopportune moment:

===Cecil and Claude===
Two ceremonious odd-job men—also broker&#x27;s men—who talked in rhyme:

:Cecil: After you, Claude –
:Claude: No, after &quot;you&quot;, Cecil
:Handley: Cut out the etiquette—you&#x27;ve a big job to do.
:Cecil: Do you want us to push your chair, Mr Mayor?
:Claude: It&#x27;ll need a new tyre, sire.
:Handley: No. I want you to go round to the lighthouse and lend a hand erecting our Foaming Fun Fair.
:Cecil: Will there be swings and things?
:Claude: There&#x27;ll be coconut shies I surmise.
:Handley: Yes, and merry-go-rounds, you hounds ...
:Cecil: Then we&#x27;ll have a dekko Sir Echo.
:Claude: We&#x27;ll have a penn&#x27;orth Sir Kenneth.

===Ali Oop===
Ali Oop was a caricature of a Middle-Eastern hawker, persistently trying to sell improbable goods to Handley:

:Ali Oop: Please mister, you give me permission to peddle on your pier?
:Handley: Certainly not.
:Ali Oop: Any other town I peddle where I like.
:Handley: Ah, but we&#x27;re very particular here.
:Ali Oop: You give me licence—I give you very funny toy. Make loud noises when sat on.
:Handley: They used to laugh when I sat down at the piano. You get out of here and take your penetrating effluvia with you.
:Ali Oop: I go—I come back.

===Sam Scram and Lefty===
Sam and Lefty were two American characters, both nominally gangsters, but of a conspicuously uncombative kind. Sam, Handley&#x27;s bodyguard, was prone to panic:

:Sam: Boss, boss, sumpin&#x27; terrible&#x27;s happened!
:Handley: Don&#x27;t tell me the Scharnhorst has come up again?
:Sam: No, there&#x27;s a tough-looking guy outside, boss.
:Handley: Has he got a broken handcuff on one wrist?
:Sam: Yes, boss!
:Handley: And a bludgeon in the other?
:Sam: Yeah, boss!
:Handley: And crime written all over his face?
:Sam: Yeah, boss!
:Handley: It&#x27;s my brother: send him in.
Lefty was of a nervous disposition. At a fairground shooting gallery with Sam:
:Lefty: I got the gun—they&#x27;re going to get the woiks. ... Missed &#x27;em!
:Sam: I thought you were a dead shot with one of dem tings.
:Lefty: Aw—it&#x27;s me noives, I tell ya—its me noives.

When Train was ill during series 7, Lefty was temporarily replaced by Butch Scram, Sam&#x27;s brother, played by Bryan Herbert.

===Mrs Mopp===
Although Mrs Mopp, the charlady, was in fewer than half the series of &quot;ITMA&quot;, she was one of the best-loved characters, and was remembered long after the show finished. She would burst through Handley&#x27;s door, usually when least convenient, and hoarsely ask, &quot;Can I do you now sir?&quot; She regularly brought Handley peculiar presents, nominally edible as a rule, beginning with some carrot jelly she had sieved through her jumper. In a show recorded before a Royal Navy audience she brought him &quot;a Bosun&#x27;s Blancmange&quot;. At the end of their scenes together she would bid him &quot;Ta-ta for now&quot;, soon abbreviated to &quot;TTFN&quot;.

:Mrs Mopp: Can I do you now, sir?
:Handley: Well, if it isn&#x27;t Mrs Mopp the vamping vassal with the tousled tassel. I thought you told me you were called up?
:Mrs Mopp: Well, sir, I had me medical.
:Handley: And were you passed A.1?
:Mrs Mopp: Oh no, sir. I&#x27;m passed sixty-two.
:Handley: You don&#x27;t look a day over sixty-one. I mean, were you passed fit? ...
:Mrs Mopp: No, sir—I was examined by a lady doctor. She wanted me to remove my bonnet.
:Handley: Disgraceful! I expect she wanted to open a false front.
:Mrs Mopp: I wouldn&#x27;t let her meddle with my modesty vest, sir. I said, &quot;You must take me as you find me&quot;. The Labour [viz. labour exchange] sent me to you, sir.
:Handley: The Labour? That&#x27;s capital. I&#x27;ll put you in charge of the sock exchange.
:Mrs Mopp: Oh, thank you, sir. I brought this for you.
:Handley: Isn&#x27;t that nice. What is it—an engineer&#x27;s indiscretion?
:Mrs Mopp: No, sir, it&#x27;s an overseer&#x27;s &#x27;otpot.
:Handley: Thank you, Mrs M. There&#x27;ll be an &#x27;otpot in the Old Tom tonight.
:Mrs Mopp: Ta-ta for now.

At their last meeting Mrs Mopp bade Handley &quot;TTFN&quot;, to which he responded, &quot;NCTWWASBE&quot;—&quot;Never Clean The Window With A Soft-Boiled Egg&quot;. After being written out of &quot;ITMA&quot; she had her own series of quarter-hour programmes, &quot;The Private Life of Mrs Mopp&quot;, written by Kavanagh.

===Commercial Traveller===
The Commercial Traveller, like the Diver, was a &quot;crossing&quot; character, distracting Handley from the business at hand with his irrelevant sales patter:

:Traveller: Good morning.
:Handley: Good morning
:Traveller: &quot;Nice&quot; day.
:Handley: No.
:Traveller: Any helicopters, motor cars or washing machines?
:Handley: Yes, please.
:Traveller: You can&#x27;t have them—they&#x27;re only for export.
:Handley: What have you come here for, then?
:Traveller: So that I can call again. Good morning.
:Handley: Good morning.
:Traveller: &quot;Nice&quot; day.

===Signor So-So===
Handley&#x27;s scatty secretary was planned as an Italian equivalent of Funf, but &quot;his chronic mismanagement of the English tongue proved too endearing and he remained at Handley&#x27;s side as a well-loved language joke&quot;. His incurable tendency to malapropisms caused him to address a female character: &quot;Ah, you attract me like a maggot! Let me cuss you on both cheeks&quot;. His verbal infelicities became infectious and regularly caused Handley&#x27;s character to trip over his words:

:Handley: Now, So-So, you are an architect, aren&#x27;t you?
:So-So: Oh yes, Mr Hagglemuch. I am an unqualified artichoke. I have built many sky-scrappers, and bolks of falts.
:Handley: Bolks of falts?
:So-So: Yes—luxury falts.
:Handley: Now listen, you leaning tower of Pisa, you can say bolks of falts as easy as I can.
:So-So: You mean blocks of flats. I have also built a villain in the country.
:Handley: A villain?
:So-So: Yes, a semi-detached villain. ... Come this way. This is your office. I will finish it.
:Handley: Listen, So-So, leave the finishing—er—furnishing of this to me. Any more of your basic English and I&#x27;d go mad.
:So-So: Oka-da-doke.

===Colonel Chinstrap===
The bibulous Colonel Chinstrap was a retired army officer, perpetually on the look-out for a free drink. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that his voice &quot;carried the unmistakeable aroma of vintage port and brandy&quot;. An unnamed prototype of the character appeared in the third series:

:Handley: Didn&#x27;t I meet you in Rumbellipoor, sir?
:Train: You did not, sir. I was never there.
:Handley: Then you must have a double.
:Train: Thanks, I will.

The character reappeared in the fifth series, now identified as Colonel Humphrey Chinstrap; he rapidly became one of the show&#x27;s most popular features. He would &quot;mishear&quot; an innocent remark as an invitation to a drink:
The catchphrase, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind if I do&quot;, was not new, but &quot;ITMA&quot; brought it into widespread popular use.
The Colonel had a life beyond &quot;ITMA&quot;. Train (&quot;assisted by Colonel Chinstrap&quot;) made a gramophone record of a song called &quot;I don&#x27;t mind if I do&quot; in 1949; Chinstrap and his &quot;ITMA&quot; colleague Major Mundy offered comments on the Lord&#x27;s Test Match in two short broadcasts in June 1949; Train, playing Chinstrap, co-starred in the 1950 comedy series &quot;The Great Gilhooly&quot;, and appeared weekly on television in late 1951 and early 1952 with scenes from the Colonel&#x27;s life story. In 1952 Evans Brothers published Chinstrap&#x27;s autobiography—ghost-written by Kavanagh, with a foreword by Train. In a 1954 BBC radio programme he featured in &quot;The True Story of Humphrey Chinstrap (Col. Retd.)&quot;, &quot;the authentic history of a warrior who penetrated the darkest jungles of Whitehall and Wooloomooloo armed only with a sword and a corkscrew&quot;. Train twice made guest appearances as Chinstrap in &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (1957 and 1959).

===Mona Lott===
Mona Lott (subsequently, after her marriage, Mona Little), the lugubrious laundress, was among the later creations to feature in the show, appearing in the last three series. She would regale Handley with her latest woes, her doleful demeanour in ludicrous contrast with her mantra, &quot;It&#x27;s being so cheerful that keeps me going&quot;. For Mona, a domestic disaster such as a burst water tank would become increasingly calamitous, until her husband ...

Among other catastrophes recounted by Mona were her brother-in-law, a champion runner, walking in his sleep and getting half-way to Brighton before anyone could catch him, and, when on a train journey, &quot;I put me head out of the window to look at the view, and the mail-bag catcher caught me. Before I knew where I was I found myself on the platform between a sack of fertiliser and a dead duck&quot;.

===Sophie Tuckshop===
Sophie Tuckshop was a replacement for a less successful character, Ella Phant. Jokes about the latter&#x27;s size did not work well on radio because the light and girlish voice of the performer, Hattie Jacques, did not suggest a heavyweight. She described Sophie as &quot;a terrible child who never stopped eating, with the inevitable sickening results&quot;.

:Sophie: I had such a lovely dream last night—I dreamt the bed was made of marzipan and the mattress was marshmallow and the sheets were jelly and the pillows embroidered with lovely sugar violets.
:Handley: Stop! Once more we halt the roar of Sophie&#x27;s Tuckshop to tell you of some of the interesting things that are In Tum Tonight! Carry on, Bicarb!

==Other characters==
Kavanagh and the &quot;ITMA&quot; team caricatured people of all ages, both sexes, and many nationalities, classes and professions. There were spoofs of national and regional types, including Johann Bull, a conspicuously Teutonic German agent trying to pass himself off as English; Chief Bigga Banga of Tomtopia, who spoke no English and Wamba M&#x27;Boojah who spoke with the grandest of Oxford accents, having been a BBC announcer; the American publicity agent, Luke Slippy; Hari Kari, a Japanese caller whose gibberish only Handley could understand, and his compatriots Bowing and Scraping. From the British regions there were the Scottish Tattie Mackintosh (and her mother); the Welsh Sam Fairfechan (&quot;Hello, how are you? As if I cared&quot;) and his family; and the Liverpudlian Frisby Dyke, with a strong Scouse accent, puzzled by some of Handley&#x27;s longer words (&quot;What&#x27;s a concentrated cacophony?&quot;), but usually winning their weekly battle of wits.

Leading female characters included three secretaries to Handley in his various capacities: Cilly, Dotty (her sister), and the formidable but soft-hearted Miss Hotchkiss; Mrs Lola Tickle, Handley&#x27;s first charlady; the shy Lady Sonely; Banjeleo, Bigga Banga&#x27;s daughter and translator; Nurse Riff-Rafferty, Handley&#x27;s old nanny, with a fund of embarrassing stories of his early years; Naieve, Major Mundy&#x27;s old-fashioned daughter; the &quot;pert poppet&quot; Poppy Poopah; Ruby Rockcake who ran the railway buffet: &quot;No cups outside!&quot;; the generously proportioned Ella Phant; and the two unnamed Posh Ladies, whose conversations were strewn with &quot;dahlings&quot; and always ended with the cry, &quot;Taxi!&quot;

Military figures in addition to Colonel Chinstrap included his puritanical nephew Brigadier Dear, mortified by his uncle&#x27;s excesses; and Major Mundy, a British expatriate on Tomtopia with an unreconstructed 19th-century mindset.

Among the mock authority figures were Sir Short Supply, a strangulated-voiced bureaucrat; the Town Clerk, a north-country official who would offer &quot;have a cher, Mr Mer&quot;, later Mer himself; Fusspot, an official whose name was self-explanatory; two characters with a habit of repeating the ends of their sentences: the Man from the Ministry and Inspector Squirt: &quot;I&#x27;m Inspector Squirt—I said Squirt&quot;; and Percy Palaver, appointed governor of Tomtopia in Handley&#x27;s absence, and notable for his generally unintelligible speech punctuated with &quot;oomyahs&quot; and &quot;harrumphs&quot;.

Professions and occupations were represented by, among others, the announcer at Radio Fakenburg; Atlas, the hypochondriac strongman; Bookham, a variety agent; Curly Kale, a chef who hated food and loved dreadful old jokes; Dan Dungeon, the jocose tour guide at Castle Weehouse; Farmer Jollop; Lemuel the office boy; Norman the Doorman; and Vodkin and Vladivostooge, two mad scientists.

Eccentrics included Basil Backwards (&quot;Sir, morning good! Coffee of cup. Strong too not. Milk have rather I&#x27;d&quot;); George Gorge, a champion glutton; Comical Chris, a persistent would-be joker; Mark Time, a nonagenarian whose response to anything was, &quot;I&#x27;ll have to ask me dad&quot;; Mr Sninch-of-Puff, a man who spoke in spoonerisms; and Whats&#x27;isname, a man who struggled to recall the simplest nouns, and had the same effect on Handley.

==Performers==
The list is not exhaustive: members of the cast played many other roles, mostly one-off, unnamed, and sometimes not even human; the singers, the orchestra and the musical director, Charles Shadwell, sometimes had lines in the script. From time to time guests appeared on the show. There were recurring characters who were mentioned frequently but were never heard, such as Peter Geekie, or appeared regularly but were not given a name, such as Carleton Hobbs&#x27;s man whose banal weekly tales began and ended &quot;Ain&#x27;t it a shame, eh? Ain&#x27;t it a shame?&quot; and Hugh Morton&#x27;s speaker whose sentences began softly and ended in a deafening shout.

==Catchphrases==
The following are among the best known of the catchphrases from the show. Some became common currency among the general public for many years; others were more ephemeral. One—&quot;TTFN&quot;—remained in frequent use throughout the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st, latterly being used in chat rooms, emails and newsgroups to sign off a message or posting. &quot;It&#x27;s being so cheerful that keeps me going&quot; also remains in use, seen in British newspapers many times in the first two decades of the 21st century.
==Reputation==
&quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;ITMA&quot; &quot;achieved a humour of universal appeal and found eager listeners in every rank of society&quot;. A 2002 history of Britain in the first half of the 20th century called the show &quot;the most celebrated wartime radio programme ... praised by intellectuals for its surrealism and wordplay, but loved by the mass listening public for its delirious silliness&quot;. The size of the audience was unprecedented; one historian records that more than sixteen million people listened to &quot;ITMA&quot; every week&quot;, and another that &quot;a staggering 40 per cent of the population&quot; regularly tuned in. But the show was not without its critics. Took quotes hostile letters to &quot;Radio Times&quot;: &quot;Why should the producers in the Variety department assume that the listeners are a body of half-wits? The puns served up last night in &quot;ITMA&quot; were an insult to anyone&#x27;s intelligence&quot; (1939) and &quot;I am constantly amazed by the number of otherwise intelligent people who rave about this programme. I have tried to discover some sort of level of culture or intelligence from which &quot;ITMA&quot; fans are drawn—but in vain&quot; (1944). In 1947 a Scottish MP, Jean Mann, referred to Handley—or his character—as a &quot;twerp&quot;.

In the show&#x27;s early days critical response was not uniformly enthusiastic. The radio critic of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote in December 1939 that amusing as the show could be, &quot;it is beginning to pall by its regularity and its attachment to the same style of humour&quot;. By the end of the last series, in 1949, writers in the same paper were comparing &quot;ITMA&quot; to the comedies of Aristophanes and Ben Jonson, as &quot;a brilliant, penetrating commentary on our times ... enlightening millions of people—a cunningly dispensed and cleverly administered medicine for the lesser ills of society&quot;. A contemporary critic observed that &quot;ITMA&quot; was entirely original and avoided stock characters:

Historians of the show acknowledge that the topicality that was one of &quot;ITMA&quot;&#x27;s strengths has prevented it from wearing well. Kavanagh himself admitted that reading his old scripts he could not work out what some of the jokes were about. Even while the show was still running, its producer, Worsley, said that recordings of earlier series &quot;seem curiously dusty and faded, like an album of old photographs&quot;.

In a 2013 study of British comedy, John Fisher emphasises the influence of &quot;ITMA&quot; on later comedy shows by virtue of &quot;its speed of delivery, its quick-fire succession of short scenes and verbal non-sequiturs, its surrealist overtones, all breaking away from the traditional music hall sketch orientation of &quot;Band Waggon&quot;, and anticipating &quot;Take It From Here&quot;, and even more so &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Round the Horne&quot;&quot;.

<text>The Temptations is an American vocal group formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1960 as The Elgins, known for their string of successful singles and albums with Motown from the 1960s to the mid-1970s. The group&#x27;s work with producer Norman Whitfield, beginning with the Top 10 hit single &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in October 1968, pioneered psychedelic soul, and was significant in the evolution of R&amp;B and soul music. The group members were known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and dress style. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are among the most successful groups in popular music.

Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group&#x27;s founding members came from two rival Detroit vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of (Otis Williams &amp;) The Distants, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of The Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group&#x27;s biggest hits, including &quot;My Girl&quot; (1964), &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; (1966), and &quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot; (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with whom the group continued to record hit records such as &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; (1968), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Next to You&quot; (1969), and &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot; (1970). Kendricks and Paul Williams both left the group in 1971, with subsequent members including Richard Street, Damon Harris, Glenn Leonard, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, the last of whom was the lead singer on late-period hit &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; in 1984 and the theme song for the children&#x27;s movement program &quot;Kids in Motion&quot; in 1987.

Over the course of their career, the Temptations released four &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles and fourteen R&amp;B number-one singles. The group was the first Motown act to win a Grammy Award – for &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in 1969 – and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, received in 2013. They won four Grammy Awards in total. The Temptations – specifically Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams – were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three Temptations songs, &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot; (1971), and &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; (1972), are included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Temptations were ranked No. 68 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; in 2010. In 2023, the group were ranked No. 1 by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine on its list of the on the &quot;100 Greatest R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists Of All Time&quot;.

, The Temptations continue to perform with Otis Williams in the lineup, who is the group&#x27;s last surviving original member. Williams owns the rights to &quot;The Temptations&quot; name.

==History==
===Origins: second half of the 1950s===
Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams started singing together in church as children in Birmingham, Alabama. By their teenage years, they formed a Doo-wop quartet in 1955 with Kell Osborne and Wiley Waller, naming themselves The Cavaliers.

After Waller left the group in 1957, the remaining trio left Birmingham to break into the music business. The group settled in Detroit where they changed their name to The Primes under the direction of Milton Jenkins. The Primes soon became well known around the Detroit area for their meticulous performances. Jenkins later created a sister group, The Primettes, later known as The Supremes. Kendricks was already seen as a &quot;matinee idol&quot; in the Detroit area, while Williams was well received for his baritone vocals.

Meanwhile, concurrently, Texas teenager Otis Williams moved to Detroit as a youngster to be with his mother. By 1958, Williams was the leader of a vocal group named Otis Williams and the Siberians. The group included Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, James &quot;Pee-Wee&quot; Crawford, Vernard Plain and Arthur Walton. The band recorded a song, &quot;Pecos Kid&quot; for a label run by radio deejay Senator Bristol Bryant. Shortly after its release, the group changed its name to The El Domingoes. Subsequently, Montgomery native Melvin Franklin replaced Arthur Walton as bass vocalist and Detroit-born Richard Street (claimed by Melvin Franklin to be his cousin) replaced Vernard Plain as lead singer. Signing with Johnnie Mae Matthews&#x27; Northern Records, the group had their name changed again to The Distants.

The group recorded two Northern Records singles including &quot;Come On&quot; (1959) and &quot;Alright&quot; (1960). Between these releases, &quot;Come On&quot; became a local hit, and the Warwick Records label picked the record up for national distribution. Following the release of &quot;Alright&quot;, Matthews appointed Williams the group leader, and the group&#x27;s name was changed to Otis Williams &amp; The Distants. During this period, both The Primes and The Distants were influenced by other vocal groups including The Miracles. Other inspirations included The Cadillacs, Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, The Drifters, and The Isley Brothers. Though &quot;Come On&quot; was a local hit in the Detroit area, The Distants never saw much record sales, and &quot;Alright&quot; was not so successful. After receiving an offer from Berry Gordy to sign with Motown Records, The Distants got out of their contract with Northern Records. However, James &quot;Pee-Wee&quot; Crawford and Richard Street shortly departed from the group and the remaining members lost use of &quot;The Distant&quot; name. Richard Street later formed another &#x27;Distants&#x27; band who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.

===Early years: 1960-1963===

Members of The Distants were acquainted with The Primes, as both groups participated in the same talent shows and performed at the same public venues. Friendly rivals, The Primes were considered to be the more polished and vocally stronger group of the two. However, this last group disbanded in 1960 after Kell Osborne moved to California. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams returned to Alabama following the band&#x27;s dissolution. While visiting relatives in Detroit, Kendricks called Otis Williams, who desperately needed two more members for an audition for Gordy&#x27;s label and offered Kendricks a lead singer place in this new group, which would also include fellow former Distants members Franklin and Bryant. Kendricks agreed on the condition he bring Paul Williams with him. Otis Williams happily agreed, and Kendricks and Paul Williams moved back to Detroit to join the new group.

The original name for the new lineup of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, Eddie Kendricks, and Paul Williams was The Elgins. Under that name, the group auditioned for Motown in March 1961. Already impressed with some of the members after hearing session work, Berry Gordy agreed to sign the group to the Motown imprint, Miracle Records. However, before signing, Gordy discovered another group was using the name of &quot;Elgins&quot;. The group began tossing about ideas for a new name on the steps of the Hitsville U.S.A. studio. On a suggestion from Miracle Records employee Billy Mitchell, songwriter Mickey Stevenson, and group members Otis Williams and Paul Williams, The Temptations became the group&#x27;s new moniker. The &quot;Elgins&quot; name re-surfaced at Motown in 1965, when Gordy renamed a quartet called The Downbeats as The Elgins.

The Temptations&#x27; first two singles, &quot;Oh Mother of Mine&quot; and &quot;Check Yourself&quot;, with Paul Williams on lead, were released on Miracle before Gordy closed the label down and reassigned the band to his latest imprint, Gordy Records. On the Gordy imprint, Eddie Kendricks sang lead on The Temptations&#x27; first charted single, &quot;(You&#x27;re My) Dream Come True&quot;, which peaked at number 22 on the R&amp;B chart in 1962. Later that year, The Temptations began touring as part of the Motortown Revue. The group issued eight recordings between 1961 and 1963 without much success.

Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks split the leads during this early period, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead, as they did on a song titled &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Pretty&quot;. For a brief time, the group almost had their name changed to The Pirates, and under that name they recorded the songs &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Love You Till I Die&quot;. Eventually the label and the group decided against it. One hit song, &quot;Do You Love Me&quot;, was originally to be recorded by The Temptations. When he couldn&#x27;t get in contact with the group, Gordy produced a version for The Contours. In 1963, The Temptations began working with Smokey Robinson as producer and writer. Robinson&#x27;s first work with the group was the Paul Williams-led &quot;I Want a Love I Can See&quot;. While the song failed to chart, it did eventually become a popular live performance spot for the group and particularly for Paul Williams in general. Some called the group &quot;The Hitless Temptations&quot; due to their lack of hits.

During this time, David Ruffin began following the group around as he aspired to join them. During a local Detroit performance, Ruffin joined the group onstage and impressed the group with his vocal talent and dancing skills. Following that same time, Al Bryant had grown frustrated with the group&#x27;s lack of success and became restless and uncooperative, preferring the mundane routine of his day job as a milkman over the rigors of rehearsal and performing. After a second altercation onstage at a Christmas performance, following an incident where he struck Paul with a beer bottle during a heated quarrel at an earlier gig in the middle of the year, Bryant was summarily fired from the group. As a result, David Ruffin was brought in as his replacement in January 1964. Though Ruffin&#x27;s brother Jimmy was also considered for the slot, David was selected following his performance with them in 1963.

Bryant continued to perform in a number of other local groups and died at the age of 36 in Flagler County, Florida, of liver cirrhosis on October 26, 1975.

===&quot;Classic Five&quot; Era: 1964-1968===
The Temptations then consisted of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, Eddie Kendricks, and David Ruffin; the success that followed the group resulted in what would, in later years, be frequently referred to as the &quot;Classic Five&quot; lineup. In January 1964, Smokey Robinson and Miracles bandmate Bobby Rogers co-wrote and produced &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; with Eddie Kendricks on lead and the single became The Temptations&#x27; first Top 20 hit that April.

Shortly afterward, &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot; and several pre-David Ruffin singles were compiled into the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Meet the Temptations&quot;, released in early 1964. The next two Temptations singles in 1964, &quot;Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)&quot; along with &quot;I&#x27;ll Be in Trouble&quot; and its B-side &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Alright with Me&quot;, all featured Kendricks on lead (although Franklin sang one line in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be in Trouble&quot;). However, producer Smokey Robinson saw potential in the &quot;mellow yet gruff&quot; voice of David Ruffin, and thought that if he could write the perfect song for his lead, then the group could have a Top 10 hit.

While traveling as part of Motown&#x27;s Motortown Revue later that year, Robinson and fellow Miracles member Ronnie White wrote &quot;My Girl&quot;, which The Temptations recorded in the fall of 1964 with Ruffin singing his first lead vocal for the group. Released as a single on December 21, 1964, the song became The Temptations&#x27; first number-one pop hit in March 1965. Over 50 years and multiple chart topping songs later, it is still their signature song to this day.

After the success of &quot;My Girl&quot;, Ruffin sang lead on the next three singles: &quot;It&#x27;s Growing&quot;, &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot;, and &quot;My Baby&quot;, which all made it to the Top 20 in 1965. The B-side to &quot;My Baby&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, featured a stirring lead from Paul Williams, and was a sleeper hit on the R&amp;B charts and a standard for vocal group playlists.

Norman Whitfield had requested the opportunity to write for the group and in 1966, Berry Gordy promised him that if Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Get Ready&quot;, with Eddie Kendricks on lead, failed to chart in the Top 20, Whitfield would be allowed to produce the next song. &quot;Get Ready&quot; subsequently missed its mark, so Gordy issued the Whitfield-produced &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;, with David Ruffin on lead, as the next single. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; outperformed &quot;Get Ready&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and Whitfield became The Temptations&#x27; new main producer. He began pulling the group away from the ballad-based productions espoused by Robinson, toward a harder-edged and brass-heavy soul sound reminiscent of James Brown.

Nearly all singles Whitfield produced prior to 1968 featured David Ruffin on lead, including the R&amp;B number-one/pop Top 10 hits &quot;Beauty Is Only Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; and the early 1967 hit &quot;(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It&#x27;s You That I Need&quot;. Other important singles from this period include &quot;All I Need&quot;, produced by Frank Wilson, a Whitfield protégé, and the &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything&quot;, on which Kendricks and Ruffin share lead. Studio albums during the &quot;Classic Five&quot; period, apart from &quot;Meet the Temptations&quot;, include &quot;The Temptations Sing Smokey&quot; (1965), &quot;The Temptin&#x27; Temptations&quot; (1965), &quot;Gettin&#x27; Ready&quot; (1966), &quot;The Temptations with a Lot o&#x27; Soul&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Temptations Wish It Would Rain&quot; (1968).

During this period, the various songwriting partners of Norman Whitfield included Roger Penzabene, Edward Holland, Jr., and The Temptations road show manager and guitarist Cornelius Grant. Subsequently, Barrett Strong, who sang the first hit at Motown in 1959, &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, began working with Whitfield and Penzabene on The Temptations material after Eddie Holland left Motown with the rest of the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting/production team in 1967. Two of the Whitfield-Strong-Penzabene collaborations, &quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot; and &quot;I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)&quot;, became hits in early 1968 after the suicide of Roger Penzabene in December 1967. Subsequently, Barrett Strong became the sole collaborator of Norman Whitfield.

From early 1964 to mid-1968, The Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars and as a result, appeared frequently on television shows such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;. At the same time, the group began to achieve a crossover popularity, catering to middle America with a pop standards album (&quot;The Temptations in a Mellow Mood&quot;, 1967), the success of which resulted in performances at the famous Copacabana in New York City along with dates at other similar supper clubs. Outside of music, The Temptations were also made honorary members of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

===David Ruffin&#x27;s departure and Dennis Edwards&#x27; arrival: 1967-1969===
By 1967, David Ruffin had begun demanding special treatment as lead singer, riding to and from gigs in a private mink-lined limousine with his then-girlfriend, Motown singer Tammi Terrell, instead of the limousine used by the other four bandmates. The other members slowly became irritated and annoyed with Ruffin&#x27;s behavior. Following Motown&#x27;s decision to rechristen The Supremes as Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes and Martha &amp; the Vandellas as Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas, Ruffin felt entitled to the same treatment, and demanded that his group be renamed as well to David Ruffin &amp; The Temptations. Ruffin was also causing friction with Berry Gordy by demanding an accounting of the group&#x27;s earnings; Motown partially acquiesced by allowing The Temptations to retain an outside accounting firm, but the firm did not have full access to the books from The Temptations&#x27; manager, International Talent Management, Inc., which was a subsidiary of Motown.

Some of this behavior was attributed to the fact that by this time Ruffin had begun using cocaine regularly, building further tension within the group and causing him to miss a number of group meetings, rehearsals, and concerts. There was a consensus among the rest of the group that Ruffin needed to be replaced. When Ruffin missed a June 1968 engagement at a Cleveland supper club in order to attend a show by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin (daughter of Dean Martin), the group decided that he had crossed the line. The other four Temptations drew up legal documentation, officially firing Ruffin on June 27, 1968. The next day, Dennis Edwards, a singer formerly of The Contours that Eddie Kendricks and Otis Williams already had pegged as a potential Ruffin replacement, was hired to take Ruffin&#x27;s place.

Edwards and Ruffin were good friends, and at first, Ruffin accepted his dismissal and encouraged Edwards. However, at Edwards&#x27; official debut with The Temptations in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on July 7, Ruffin came to the show and jumped onstage, taking the microphone from Edwards, singing lead on &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;, and disappearing as quickly as he had appeared. Ruffin repeated this stunt several times throughout the group&#x27;s July tour run. Despite the group hiring extra security to keep Ruffin out, he continued to find ways to sneak into the venue and jump onstage when the group performed one of the songs he had once sung lead on.

In a story recounted several times by Dennis Edwards (rebutted by Otis Williams and The Temptations&#x27; road manager Don Foster), after several of these stunts, the positive audience reactions and a remorseful Ruffin&#x27;s pleas to be let back into the act convinced the other Temptations members to do so. Otis Williams informed the then still-new Edwards that the group would lay him off and rehire Ruffin while in Gaithersburg, Maryland. However, when Ruffin failed to show up on time the next night for his &quot;return&quot; engagement, the group kept Edwards on and ceased to entertain the prospect of rehiring Ruffin.

After Gaithersburg, Ruffin stopped attempting to disrupt The Temptations&#x27; concerts and instead turned his attention to the Motown offices back in Detroit. He sued Motown in October 1968, seeking a release from the label, but Motown countersued the singer to keep him from leaving and the case was eventually settled out of court. The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown as a solo artist to finish out his contract.

Edwards&#x27; first album with The Temptations was &quot;Live at the Copa&quot;, recorded at the group&#x27;s return to the Copacabana nightclub. The Temptations debuted in one of the first of a number of collaborations with Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes in 1968. The results included two studio albums: &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join The Temptations&quot; (1968), which featured Edwards&#x27; first studio recordings with the group and the number-two hit single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;. There was also a joint tour and two NBC television specials, &quot;TCB&quot; (aired December 9, 1968) and &quot;G.I.T. on Broadway&quot; (aired November 12, 1969).

===Switch to Psychedelic soul: 1968-1970===

The addition of Dennis Edwards to The Temptations coincided with the adoption of a new sound for the group by producer Norman Whitfield, and in the fall of 1968, Whitfield began producing psychedelic-based material for The Temptations, derived primarily from the sound of funk bands as Sly &amp; the Family Stone and Funkadelic. This new style, which debuted with the Top 10 hit single &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in October 1968, was a marked departure from the David Ruffin-era ballads. The instrumentation was funkier, the beat was hard-driving, and all five Temptations members traded lead vocals, similar to Sly &amp; the Family Stone. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, the centerpiece of the group&#x27;s landmark eponymous album, was a Top 10 hit and won Motown its first Grammy Award, for Best R&amp;B Vocal Group Performance of 1969.

The blending of the Motown sound and psychedelic rock sound resulted in a new subgenre of music called psychedelic soul, also evident in the work of &quot;Diana Ross and The Supremes&quot; (&quot;Reflections&quot;, &quot;Love Child&quot;), Marvin Gaye&#x27;s version of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, and music of The 5th Dimension, The Undisputed Truth, and The Friends of Distinction. More Temptations psychedelic soul singles followed in 1969 and 1970 - among them &quot;Runaway Child, Running Wild&quot; (a number-one R&amp;B hit), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Next to You&quot; (a number-one pop hit), &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot;, and &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot; - but the formula began to wear thin when &quot;Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)&quot;, only went to no. 33 Pop in the fall of 1970. The group&#x27;s other important albums from this period included &quot;Puzzle People&quot; (1969) and &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot; (1970). The latter included the original version of &quot;War&quot;, later made famous by Edwin Starr.

===Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams: 1969-1973===
Paul Williams, who suffered from sickle-cell disease, fell into depression because of the stress of touring and personal issues. By the late 1960s, he had developed a serious case of alcoholism. Having never previously consumed anything stronger than milk, he began to drink quite heavily, and it was hard to take, according to Otis Williams. As his physical and mental health began to decline sharply, it made performing with his bandmates increasingly difficult. Williams began traveling with oxygen tanks, and the other four Temptations members made valiant efforts to raid and drain his alcohol stashes.

In late 1969, Richard Street, lead singer of Motown act The Monitors and a former Distant, was hired by Otis Williams to tour with the group as a backup replacement for Williams. For most shows, save for his solo numbers, Williams danced and lip-synched on stage to parts sung live by Street into an offstage mic behind a curtain. At other shows, and during most of the second half of 1970, Street substituted Williams on stage when he was too sick to go on.

Eddie Kendricks became detached from the group after David Ruffin&#x27;s firing and as the health of Paul Williams continued to fail. He regularly picked fights with Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin, which often became violent, and in addition, he preferred the ballad material from the earlier days and was uncomfortable with the psychedelic soul material the group was now performing. Kendricks rekindled his friendship with Ruffin, who persuaded him to go solo. He no longer felt he had a say in Otis Williams&#x27;s handling of the group and was also convinced Motown&#x27;s handling of The Temptations&#x27; finances was cheating the group out of money. Kendricks, being the only member to continue an alliance with Ruffin, also repeatedly suggested that Ruffin should be allowed back into the group, despite the other members&#x27; strong objections.

Kendricks lobbied strongly in 1970 to have The Temptations go on &quot;strike&quot; – no performances, no recordings – until Berry Gordy and the Motown staff were willing to go over all group finances with independent accountants. Otis Williams and Franklin strongly opposed this idea, and regular group infighting between Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Franklin grew from this disagreement. After a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, a final confrontation between the three caused Kendricks to walk out in-between shows and not return. Both Kendricks and Williams then agreed that the first would be leaving the group. Kendricks later stated that he actually considered leaving as early as 1965, but remained with The Temptations and unsuccessfully attempted to get permission to record a solo album without leaving the group.

Before Kendricks officially left The Temptations, he and Paul Williams recorded the lead vocals for &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot;, a ballad that became Kendricks&#x27; final single with the group. Included on the &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; LP along with the original album version of &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; was released as a single in January 1971, and the song began steadily climbing the US pop singles chart, peaking at number 1 two months later. By the time &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; topped the charts, Kendricks had negotiated his release from the group and signed a solo deal with Motown&#x27;s Tamla label.

The Temptations originally hired Ricky Owens, from the Los Angeles-based vocal group The Vibrations, to replace Kendricks. However, Owens only played three dates with the group before he was fired for forgetting the words to his solo numbers due to nervousness. For several weeks of the spring of 1971, The Temptations were without a fifth member. Owens meanwhile returned to The Vibrations and died in Los Angeles, California, on December 6, 1996, at the age of 57.

Whitfield took the remaining Temptations quartet and re-recorded &quot;It&#x27;s Summer&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot;, as a replacement single. &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot; was released as a single for The Undisputed Truth instead, becoming a Top 5 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971. Meanwhile, &quot;It&#x27;s Summer&quot; peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it the first Temptations single to miss the Top 40 since &quot;Farewell My Love&quot; eight years earlier.

After his doctor declared a few weeks later that he was unable to continue performing for medical reasons, Paul Williams quit The Temptations in May. Richard Street officially took Williams&#x27;s place, although Williams continued to be paid his customary one-fifth of group revenue (Street was paid on salary for the first eighteen months of his tenure), and worked when he could with the group as an adviser and choreographer. After Williams had recovered enough to record again, he recorded two sides in 1973 for a debut solo single. However, on August 17, 1973, Williams died in Detroit at the age of 34 from a gunshot wound, his death ruled a suicide by the Wayne County coroner.

===Another genre change to funk: 1971-1976===
In May 1971, The Temptations finally found a permanent replacement for the first tenor position in twenty-year-old Baltimore native Damon Harris. Otis Williams, Edwards, Franklin, Street, and Harris continued recording and performing, and Norman Whitfield continued producing hits for them. There were Top 40 hits such as &quot;Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)&quot; (1971), a message from The Temptations to David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, and &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; (1972). During this period, the group toured with Quiet Elegance as their back-up singers. Quiet Elegance featured Lois Reeves, the sister of Martha Reeves, alongside Frankie Gearing and Millie Vaney-Scott.

Late 1972 saw the release of &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, a magnum opus written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and produced by Whitfield. Originally a three-minute record written and produced for The Undisputed Truth, Whitfield took the somber tune and created a sprawling, dramatic twelve-minute version for The Temptations - a forerunner of the extended single - soon to become popular in clubs and discothèques. An edited seven-minute version was released as a single and became one of the longest hit singles in music history: it hit number 1 on the pop charts and number 5 on the R&amp;B charts. In 1973, &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; won The Temptations their second Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Group. Whitfield and arranger/conductor Paul Riser won the award for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance for the instrumental version on the B-side, and Whitfield and Barrett Strong won the songwriting Grammy for Best R&amp;B Song.

After &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, Whitfield stopped working with Barrett Strong, and began writing The Temptations&#x27; material on his own. The success of such single led Whitfield to create more elongated, operatic pieces, including the Top 10 hit &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (1973) and several of the tracks on the resulting &quot;eponymous album&quot;. Tensions developed between Whitfield and the group, who found Whitfield arrogant and difficult to work with. Citing his habitual tardiness, his emphasis of the instrumental tracks at the expense of their vocals on many of his productions, and the declining singles and albums sales as other sources of conflict, the group sought to change producers. Otis Williams complained about Whitfield&#x27;s actions and The Temptations&#x27; stagnant sales to Berry Gordy; as a result, the group was reassigned to Jeffrey Bowen, co-producer of the 1967 &quot;In a Mellow Mood&quot; album.

The final Norman Whitfield-produced Temptations album, &quot;1990&quot;, was released in December 1973, and included the Top 30 single &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Whitfield left Motown, and in 1975 established Whitfield Records, taking with him The Undisputed Truth and Willie Hutch, along with Rose Royce, who recorded in 1976 the hit &quot;Car Wash&quot;. The last track Whitfield produced for the group was the single &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;, released in 1973.

===Further switch to Adult Contemporary: 1975-1980===
Bowen&#x27;s first LP with The Temptations was January 1975&#x27;s &quot;A Song for You&quot;, which included a cover of the titular Leon Russell tune (popularized with soul audiences by Donny Hathaway), along with the pop Top 40/R&amp;B number-one hits &quot;Happy People&quot; (featuring the Commodores as the instrumentalists) and &quot;Shakey Ground&quot; (featuring instrumentation by Parliament-Funkadelic&#x27;s Eddie Hazel along with Billy Bass Nelson). &quot;Glasshouse&quot;, the group&#x27;s final Top 40 Pop hit, was also included. Damon Harris was fired from the group during the recording of &quot;A Song for You&quot;, as his behavior and work ethic were deemed unprofessional, and his replacement was Washington, D.C. native Glenn Leonard, formerly of the Unifics.

A number of producers, including Bowen, Brian Holland, James Anthony Carmichael, and even The Temptations themselves tried producing hits for the next three LPs, &quot;House Party&quot; (November 1975), &quot;Wings of Love&quot; (March 1976), and &quot;The Temptations Do the Temptations&quot; (August 1976). However, none of these recordings were as commercially successful as &quot;A Song for You&quot;, and none of their associated singles entered the Billboard charts.

As time progressed, Bowen pushed Dennis Edwards further to the front of the group. This was evident on &quot;Wings of Love&quot;, where several tracks featured Edwards&#x27; vocal more prominently than the other Temptations backing vocals. Otis Williams felt that this was hurting the group, accused Motown of inattention, and cited this as the reason for the group&#x27;s declining sales and popularity. After &quot;The Temptations Do the Temptations&quot; was recorded in 1976, Edwards was fired from the group, and with new lead Louis Price on board, they left Motown for Atlantic Records.

Success continued to elude the group at Atlantic, however. Their two releases on Atlantic – &quot;Hear to Tempt You&quot; (1977), and &quot;Bare Back&quot; (1978), along with their associated singles - had failed to perform any better at Atlantic than their last handful of singles had at Motown. As a result, in 1979, Atlantic released the group from its contract, and shortly afterwards, The Temptations met once again with Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy, who re-signed the group to Motown in 1980.

===Return to Motown Records and &quot;Reunion&quot;: 1982-1983===
Upon the return to Motown several lineup changes occurred. Louis Price departed from the group and joined The Drifters. Dennis Edwards - who had made an unsuccessful attempt at developing a solo career during his three-year exit from the group - returned to the lineup. Berry Gordy co-wrote and produced &quot;Power&quot;, The Temptations&#x27; first single under the new contract. This song, from the album of the same name, hit no. 11 on the R&amp;B charts but failed to chart in the Top 40. Two years of under-performing singles and albums followed, including an eponymous album with Philadelphia-based producer Thom Bell, until Motown began planning a Temptations reunion tour in 1982.

Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin agreed to rejoin the group for the new album, aptly titled &quot;Reunion&quot;, and its subsequent promotional tour. Rick James, the Motown funk star who had previously used The Temptations as backup vocalists on his 1981 hit &quot;Super Freak&quot; and whom Franklin claimed as his nephew, wrote, produced, and guested on the &quot;Reunion&quot; album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;. The single went to no. 6 on the R&amp;B charts and featured Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards trading back and forth on lead.

While the ensuing &quot;Reunion&quot; tour with all seven Temptations (Ruffin, Kendricks, Otis Williams, Franklin, Edwards, Richard Street, and Glenn Leonard) was financially successful, it ended up being a stressful venture: Kendricks&#x27; voice had weakened after decades of chain smoking, Ruffin (still addicted to drugs) missed a number of the performances due to being incapacitated, and current group members Dennis Edwards and Glenn Leonard were causing problems. At the conclusion of the &quot;Reunion&quot; tour, Ruffin and Kendricks were dismissed, and they began touring and performing together as a duo.

One more album, &quot;Surface Thrills&quot;, released in 1983, featured a sharp departure in the group&#x27;s sound by incorporating elements of then-current rock. Following its release, Glenn Leonard was let go and replaced by Ron Tyson, who was with the Philadelphia groups the Ethics and Love Committee. Tyson had been a staff songwriter at Atlantic during The Temptations&#x27; tenure at that label, and co-wrote several songs on the album &quot;Hear to Tempt You&quot;.

===Autobiography and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: the 1980s===
By this time, The Temptations&#x27; releases were no longer performing well on the pop charts, though some singles still made the R&amp;B Top 20. &quot;Love on My Mind Tonight&quot;, a single from &quot;Surface Thrills&quot;, charted at no. 17.

The lineup of Franklin, Williams, Street, Tyson, and Edwards proved to be short-lived. The five performed on &quot;Motown 25&quot; and released the direct to video &quot;The Temptations: Live in Concert&quot; (filmed at Harrah&#x27;s Atlantic City). The album &quot;Back to Basics&quot;, released later in 1983, was the first album featuring Ron Tyson on lead. The song &quot;Sail Away&quot;, produced by a returning Norman Whitfield and featuring Ron Tyson&#x27;s first lead vocal, peaked at no. 13 on the US R&amp;B chart.

In addition, a then-relatively unknown singer/musician, Ali-Ollie Woodson was featured on one track, &quot;Stop the World Right Here (I Wanna Get Off)&quot;. Woodson was a Detroit native who had been a potential candidate to replace Dennis Edwards back in 1977. Meanwhile, Edwards (who also had his share of lead vocals on the &quot;Back to Basics&quot; album) was fired again in 1984, for missing rehearsals or showing up hungover. He then attempted a second solo career, scoring a hit with the 1984 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Any Further&quot;, a duet with Siedah Garrett.

At this point, Woodson officially joined the group, taking Edwards&#x27; place. Woodson&#x27;s first lead on a single was 1984&#x27;s &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;, co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by former Earth, Wind &amp; Fire members Al McKay and Ralph Johnson. The song became their biggest success on R&amp;B radio since 1975, reaching number-two on the R&amp;B charts, and just missing the Pop Top 40 at no. 48. The group enjoyed further successes with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Do You Really Love Your Baby&quot;, a no. 14 R&amp;B hit co-written by soul star Luther Vandross, and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Lady Soul&quot;, the group&#x27;s third Top 10 R&amp;B hit of the decade.

Ali Woodson remained with The Temptations until 1987, when he was fired for consistent lateness. He was replaced by the again-returning Dennis Edwards. The group recorded one album during Edwards&#x27; third tenure, &quot;Together Again&quot;, released later that year. In 1988, Otis Williams published his autobiography, &quot;Temptations&quot;, co-written with Patricia Romanowski, chronicling the careers of the group from The Primes/Distants days and focusing on the lives of Williams and Melvin Franklin. (An updated version of the book was published in 2002.) Together, they worked on the theme song to the children&#x27;s educational musical movement series, &quot;Kids in Motion&quot; created by Greg &amp; Steve.

Edwards was fired from the group for the third and final time in late 1988, with Woodson re-joining the lineup. In 1989, The Temptations released the album &quot;Special&quot;, which included the soulful singles &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Soul to Soul&quot;. On January 18, 1989, The Temptations were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The event honored Edwards, Franklin, Otis Williams, Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks (now performing as &quot;Eddie Kendrick&quot;), and, posthumously, Paul Williams. Most of The Temptations, present and former, showed no ill feelings towards each another, although Otis Williams reported that Kendricks refused to speak to him during the ceremony. The Temptations ended their induction ceremony with a performance of Paul Williams&#x27; signature song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, dedicated to his memory.

===Further recordings and performances: the 1990s===
After reuniting at the induction ceremony, and much to the chagrin of Otis Williams and Motown, Edwards, Ruffin, and Kendrick made plans to tour and record as &quot;Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards, Former Leads of The Temptations&quot;. The tour was in fact carried out, but production on the album was canceled when 50-year-old David Ruffin died in Philadelphia after a cocaine overdose on June 1, 1991. Kendricks was diagnosed with lung cancer soon after; he continued to perform until his death on October 5, 1992, in his native Birmingham.

Richard Street missed a performance in 1992 after undergoing emergency surgery to remove kidney stones. Otis Williams, completely unaware of Street&#x27;s surgery, called him angrily about his absence. Street felt Williams was unsympathetic, and as a result, he left the group in 1993 after twenty-two years. His replacement was St. Louis native Theo Peoples.

By the early 1990s, bassist Melvin Franklin began missing performances due to failing health and Ray Davis, former bass man of Parliament-Funkadelic, began touring as a fill-in during 1993. Franklin died after suffering a brain seizure at the age of 52 on February 23, 1995, and Davis was named his official replacement. The group subsequently finished production on &quot;For Lovers Only&quot;, an album of pop standards featuring two tracks recorded with Melvin Franklin prior to his death.

However, this lineup did not last, as Davis was diagnosed with lung cancer and left shortly after completing the album. Davis died in New Brunswick, New Jersey of respiratory problems and complications of lung cancer on the evening of Tuesday July 5, 2005.

The group continued as a quartet for a short time before recruiting bassist Harry McGilberry, a former member of The Futures. &quot;For Lovers Only&quot; was also the last contribution for lead Ali-Ollie Woodson; he was released from the group shortly after McGilberry&#x27;s hiring due to health problems: he suffered two bouts of throat cancer in a short time. He was replaced by new member Terry Weeks, who had served as his substitute.

The Temptations&#x27; new lineup, consisting of Otis Williams, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples, and newcomers Harry McGilberry and Terry Weeks, toured throughout 1997, and was featured in the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXII in early 1998, which celebrated the 40th anniversary of Motown. Later that year, The Temptations released the album &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot;, vocally arranged by 1980s producer Narada Michael Walden, Isaias Gamboa, Claytoven Richardson, Theo Peoples, Tony Lindsey and Skyler Jett, which became their first million-selling LP in more than 20 years. The album was anchored by &quot;Stay&quot;, a single featuring Theo Peoples on lead and including a sample from &quot;My Girl&quot;, which became a number-one hit on the urban adult contemporary charts. It was released to extremely positive reviews.

Peoples was fired from the group before the release of &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot; because of his issues with drug addiction, and was replaced by Barrington &quot;Bo&quot; Henderson. Henderson lip-synched to Peoples&#x27; vocals in the &quot;Stay&quot; music video, and the completed album features lead vocals on different tracks by both Henderson and Peoples.

===TV miniseries: late 1990s-early 2000s===

Also in 1998, three months after the release of &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot; earlier in the year, de Passe Entertainment (run by former Motown vice-president Suzanne de Passe) and Hallmark Entertainment produced &quot;The Temptations&quot;, a four-hour television miniseries based on Otis Williams&#x27; &quot;Temptations&quot; autobiography. The miniseries was broadcast in two parts on NBC on November 1 and November 2, 1998, with the first part covering the group&#x27;s history from 1958 to 1968, and the second part the years from 1968 to 1995. The miniseries was a ratings success and was nominated for five Emmy Awards, with Allan Arkush winning for Best Direction; it was subsequently rerun on the VH-1 cable television network and released to VHS and DVD.

Otis Williams&#x27; former wife Josephine Miles, Melvin Franklin&#x27;s mother Rose Franklin, David Ruffin&#x27;s family, and Johnnie Mae Matthews filed lawsuits against Williams, Motown, de Passe and de Passe Entertainment, Hallmark, and NBC for a number of charges, including defamation.

The lawsuits were consolidated, the judges ruled in favor of the defendants, and the ruling was upheld when the plaintiffs appealed in 2001. Williams later claimed that, although his book was used as the source material for the film, he did not have a great deal of control over how the material was presented.

===Later decades: from 2000s to present===
The Temptations were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2001, their 2000 album &quot;Ear-Resistible&quot; won the group its third Grammy, this one for Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Bo Henderson was fired from the group in 2003, prompting a wrongful termination lawsuit.

His replacement was former Spinners lead G. C. Cameron. The lineup of Cameron, Otis Williams, Ron Tyson, Harry McGilberry, and Terry Weeks recorded for a short time before McGilberry was dismissed; his replacement was former Spaniels member Joe Herndon. McGilberry died on April 3, 2006, at the age of 56.

The group&#x27;s final Motown album, &quot;Legacy&quot;, was released in 2004. Later that year, The Temptations asked to be released from their Motown contract, and moved to another Universal label, New Door Records. Their sole album with this lineup, &quot;Reflections&quot;, was released on January 31, 2006, and contains covers of several popular Motown songs, including Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes&#x27; &quot;Reflections&quot;, The Miracles&#x27; &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot;, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, and The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. Dennis Edwards, Ali-Ollie Woodson and David Sea (deep soul singer from Alabama, not David Ruffin) formed The Temptations tribute group &quot;The Temptations Revue featuring Dennis Edwards&quot;.

G.C. Cameron left the group in June 2007 to focus on his solo career. He was replaced by Bruce Williamson, who first affiliated with the group a year earlier. The new lineup recorded another album of soul covers, &quot;Back to Front&quot;, released in October 2007. Former member Ali-Ollie Woodson died on May 30, 2010, after a long battle with leukemia.

On May 4, 2010, the group released another album titled &quot;Still Here&quot;. The first single from &quot;Still Here&quot;, &quot;First Kiss&quot;, was criticized for having instances of using Auto-Tune technology.

The Temptations received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award on February 9, 2013. Otis Williams, Dennis Edwards, and the children of David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, and Melvin Franklin attended the ceremony to accept the six Grammys given to the group for the occasion.

Former member Damon Harris died on February 18, 2013, from prostate cancer at a Baltimore hospital. Nine days later, former member Richard Street died of pulmonary embolism in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time of his death, Street was in the process of writing a book regarding his time with The Temptations entitled &quot;Ball of Confusion: My Life as a Temptin&#x27; Temptation&quot;. Completed by his co-author, Gary Flanigan, the book was published in 2014; it is the second autobiography regarding the group.

In late 2015 both Bruce Williamson and Joe Herndon announced their departures from the group. Williamson&#x27;s replacement, Larry Braggs, was lead singer of Tower of Power from 2000 to 2013. Herndon&#x27;s replacement is Willie Green, who had previously toured with former Temptations members Richard Street and Ali-Ollie Woodson. Dennis Edwards died on February 1, 2018, at age 74. He had been battling with meningitis before his death.

On May 4, 2018, The Temptations released &quot;All the Time&quot;, their first album since 2010&#x27;s &quot;Still Here&quot;, as well as their first for Universal&#x27;s UMe Direct imprint.

Former member G. C. Cameron substituted an absent Larry Braggs in shows in August 2019. By October 2019 Braggs was no longer a member of the group. They then temporarily toured as a quartet until June 19, 2020, when it was announced that Mario Corbino was the new member of the group replacing Larry Braggs.

On September 6, 2020, former Temptations member Bruce Williamson died at age 49 from Covid-19.

In the fall of 2021, The Temptations released two singles, &quot;Is It Gonna Be Yes Or No&quot;, featuring Smokey Robinson, and &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, as part of their upcoming album, &quot;Temptations 60&quot;. The album is scheduled to be released in January 2022. In December 2021, Otis Williams introduced Tony Grant as the newest member of The Temptations at a concert in Orlando, Florida. Grant, who formerly sang with the Rhythm and blues group Az Yet, and starred in several Tyler Perry stage plays, replaced Mario Corbino.

The band announced in June 2022 that Jawan M. Jackson was joining on bass, replacing Willie Green.

==Sound==

===Motown soundtrack (1961–68)===
Following their first Motown hit, the group altered their style several times over the ensuing years, adapting to the popular styles of the day while retaining their signature visual and vocal styles. The earliest Temptations recordings backed by Motown&#x27;s stalwart studio band, The Funk Brothers, reflect the influence of producers Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, and featured a cohesive blend of black Rhythm and blues along with elements of white pop music that later came to be known as the &quot;Motown Sound&quot;. Recordings made prior to 1966, such as &quot;My Girl&quot;, were built-around songs with simple, direct lyrics supported by an R&amp;B rhythm section with orchestral strings and horns added for pop appeal. During this period, each recording usually featured only one lead singer, usually David Ruffin or Eddie Kendricks, although Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams each had solo numbers of their own at various times during this period.

In 1966, Norman Whitfield changed the group&#x27;s dynamic, moving them away from the previous one lead singer model and adding elements derived from the rougher soul of artists such as James Brown, Wilson Pickett, and the performers at Stax Records. Whitfield and his lyricists crafted Temptations songs with shifts of dynamics, syncopated horn stabs, and more intricate harmony arrangements which spotlighted each singer&#x27;s unique vocal range. Onstage, this change was reflected in the group&#x27;s use of a custom-made four-headed microphone stand, invented by David Ruffin.

===Progressive, psychedelic and cinematic soul (1968–73)===
When Ruffin was replaced by Dennis Edwards, and Sly and the Family Stone became popular, Whitfield again restructured The Temptations&#x27; sound, this time driving the group almost completely into a progressive sound, as well a pioneering psychedelic soul. However, ballads in the traditional style of the group were still being recorded as B-sides and album fillers, with the lone exception being &quot;Just My Imagination&quot;.

Tracks such as the album version of &quot;Run Away Child, Running Wild&quot; from &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, &quot;Take a Stroll Thru Your Mind&quot; from &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot;, and &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot; from &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot;, all run at least eight minutes. At Whitfield&#x27;s insistence, a large portion of the additional running time for each song consisted of instrumental passages without vocals. For example, the hit version of their smash 1972 single &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; was nearly seven minutes, featuring an instrumental intro that was almost two minutes, a rarity for songs of that era.

&quot;Psychedelic soul&quot; soon gave way to &quot;cinematic soul&quot;, highlighting a further series of lengthy recordings featuring detailed orchestration, extended instrumental introductions and bridging passages. Often focusing on lyrics about the ghettos and inner cities of black America, these songs were heavily influenced by the work of singer-songwriters Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield.

Unlike Hayes and Mayfield however, The Temptations had no creative control over their recordings, and were in no way fond of the 12- and 13-minute-long songs being forced upon them by Whitfield, whose contributions were the focal point of The Temptations albums such as &quot;Solid Rock&quot;, &quot;All Directions&quot;, and particularly &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.

===From funk to some disco to adult contemporary music (1974 to present)===
In 1974, after Whitfield was dismissed as the producer for The Temptations, the group altered its sound to accommodate a balance of both up-tempo dance material as well as ballads. The vocal arrangements began to focus again primarily on one lead singer per track, although some leads were still being shared periodically. In addition, The Temptations themselves, after fighting Motown and Berry Gordy for creative control, began to write and produce some of their own material. From this point on, The Temptations focused almost exclusively on songs about romance. However, songs about social issues similar to the recordings made during Whitfield&#x27;s tenure were periodically produced as well.

The Temptations recordings of the mid-1970s focused significantly on the influences of funk music from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Sly and the Family Stone, and members of both acts contributed significantly to material recorded by the group during this period. Their signature ballad sound, reduced to filler material during much of the Whitfield period, was restored to the lush, full productions of the earlier hits produced by Smokey Robinson. After a brief diversion into disco in the late-1970s, The Temptations settled into a form of an adult contemporary-rooted type of R&amp;B, a style in which they continue to record.

==Legacy and influence==
Berry Gordy insisted that all his acts be equally appealing to both white as well as black audiences, and employed an extensive creative team to help tailor Motown talent for the crossover success he desired. Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins, along with Paul Williams, created the trademark precise and energetic, yet refined, dance steps used by The Temptations onstage. The most famous of these, the &quot;Temptation Walk&quot;, or &quot;Temptation Strut&quot;, was adapted from similar moves by The Flamingos and The Vibrations, and, from those two sources, Atkins and Williams crafted the resulting signature dance routine.

Like other similar independent companies of the period, Motown was not a member of the Recording Industry of America, preferring to stay independent and handling their own widely varied distribution through thousands of &quot;Mom &amp; Pop&quot; record stores and small radio stations. As such, hit singles by Motown artists such as The Temptations never achieved official &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; RIAA certification until after Motown joined the RIAA in 1977.

The Temptations&#x27; songs have been covered by scores of musicians, from R&amp;B singers such as Otis Redding (&quot;My Girl&quot;), Bobby Womack (&quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot;) and Luther Vandross (&quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot;), to white soul and reggae bands such as Rare Earth (&quot;Get Ready&quot;), UB 40 (&quot;The Way You Do and The Things You Do&quot;) and The Rolling Stones (&quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;, &quot;Just My Imagination&quot;) and Mick Jagger&#x27;s collaboration with reggae artist Peter Tosh on (&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;). The Funk Brothers (Motown) recorded &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Runaway Child Running Wild&quot;, and &quot;Papa Was a Rolling Stone&quot;. Hall &amp; Oates performed &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot; in Live with Ruffin and Kendricks. Marcus Miller covered &quot;Papa Was a Rolling Stone&quot;. British rock singer Rod Stewart released a cover of &quot;I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; in 1971, and, in 1991, collaborated with The Temptations on the single &quot;The Motown Song&quot;. In 2017, The Temptations and Otis Williams&#x27; then-protégé, Kyle Maack, recorded a cover of &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; for Maack&#x27;s &quot;Shaky Ground&quot; EP which also included two additional Temptations covers.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked The Temptations number 67 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Temptations were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005. They received the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013. On Saturday August 17, 2013, The Temptations were officially inducted into the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame at the inaugural ceremony held at the Waetejen Auditorium on the campus of Cleveland State University.

In 2018, the story of The Temptations served as inspiration for the jukebox musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud&quot;, which opened on Broadway in March 2019. The show was nominated for 11 Tony Awards at the 73rd Tony Awards and won for Best Choreography.

<text>Andrew D. Gordon is a British computer scientist employed by software synthesis company Cogna as Chief Science Officer, and by the University of Cambridge. Formerly, he worked for Microsoft Research. His research interests include programming language design, formal methods, concurrency, cryptography, and access control.

==Biography==
Gordon earned a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1992. Until 1997, Gordon was a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He then joined the Microsoft Research laboratory in Cambridge, England, where he was a principal researcher in the Programming Principles and Tools group. He also holds a professorship at the University of Edinburgh.

==Research==
Gordon is one of the designers of Concurrent Haskell, an extension to the functional programming language Haskell, which added explicit primitive data types for concurrency, and then became a library named codice_1 as part of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. He is the co-designer with Martin Abadi of Spi calculus, a π-calculus extension, for formalized reasoning about cryptographic systems. He and Luca Cardelli invented the ambient calculus for reasoning about mobile code. With Moritz Y. Becker and Cédric Fournet, Gordon also designed SecPAL, a Microsoft specification language for access control policies.

==Awards and honours==
Gordon&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis, &quot;Functional programming and input/output&quot;, won the 1993 Distinguished Dissertation Award of the British Computer Society. His 2000 paper on the ambient calculus subject with Luca Cardelli, &quot;Anytime, Anywhere: Modal Logics for Mobile Ambients&quot;, won the 2010 SIGPLAN Most Influential POPL Paper Award.

<text>Spaced is a British television sitcom created, written by and starring Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, and directed by Edgar Wright, about the comedic, and sometimes surreal and action-packed, misadventures of Daisy Steiner and Tim Bisley, two twenty-something Londoners who, despite only having just met, decide to move in together after she gives up on squatting and he is kicked out by his ex-girlfriend. Supporting roles include Nick Frost as Tim&#x27;s best friend Mike, Katy Carmichael as Daisy&#x27;s best friend Twist, Mark Heap as lodger Brian who lives downstairs and Julia Deakin as landlady Marsha.

The first series of the show, comprising seven episodes, premiered in the UK on Channel 4 on 24 September 1999, and the second and final series, also consisting of seven episodes, started on 23 February 2001 and concluded on 13 April.

Both series were nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Situation Comedy.

== Plot ==
Daisy Steiner and Tim Bisley are two London based twenty-somethings who meet by chance in a café while both are flat-hunting. Despite barely knowing each other, they conspire to pose as a young professional couple in order to meet the requisites of an advertisement for a relatively cheap flat in the distinctive building at 23 Meteor Street, Tufnell Park, owned by resident landlady Marsha Klein. Also in the building is Brian Topp, an eccentric conceptual artist who lives and works on his various pieces in the ground-floor flat. Frequent visitors are Daisy&#x27;s best friend Twist Morgan and Tim&#x27;s best friend Mike Watt. The latter ends up becoming a lodger after Marsha&#x27;s daughter Amber Weary &quot;flies the nest&quot;.

The series largely concerns the surreal and awkward adventures of Tim and Daisy as they navigate through life, come to terms with affairs of the heart, and try to figure out new and largely unproductive ways of killing time. They repeatedly clarify that they are not a couple to everyone but Marsha, but despite this, romantic tension develops between them, particularly during the second series.

== Characters ==
* Simon Pegg as Tim Bisley
* Jessica Stevenson as Daisy Steiner
* Nick Frost as Mike Watt
* Katy Carmichael as Twist Morgan
* Mark Heap as Brian Topp
* Julia Deakin as Marsha Klein
* Aida as Colin, a Miniature Schnauzer

== Production ==
The show has a distinctive style inspired by cinema and sitcoms, with Edgar Wright citing &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and the &quot;whimsical dream sequences&quot; of &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot; as influences. It was shot with a single camera. In addition to borrowing liberally from the visual language of film it has particular stylistic mannerisms, such as the recurring device of scene changes occurring in the middle of a pan. The series&#x27; atmosphere is also established by the use of a particular flavour of contemporary dance music on its soundtrack.

&quot;Northern Exposure&quot;&#x27;s frequent use of fantasy sequences was &quot;one of the key influences&quot; in the creation of the show, and Pegg and Stevenson pitched the show to LWT as &quot;a cross between &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.&quot;

The series is dense with references to popular culture, including but not limited to science fiction and horror films, comic books, and video games. The Series 2 DVD release introduced the &quot;Homage-o-meter&quot;, an alternative set of subtitles listing every reference and homage; the &quot;Definitive Collectors Edition&quot; boxed set introduced a similar subtitle track for Series 1. &quot;2000 AD&quot; artists Jim Murray and Jason Brashill provided the artwork for Tim&#x27;s comic &quot;The Bear&quot;, as well as other incidental artwork for the show. Tim&#x27;s boss Bilbo wears a 2000 AD comic T-shirt whilst lecturing Tim about &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;.

The series is also noted for its regular recreational drug use references, from its title onwards. Tim and Daisy smoke cannabis on a number of occasions, one episode centring on its use. Tim and Mike take speed on one occasion, and it is implied that Tim, Mike, Daisy, Twist and Brian take ecstasy while clubbing.

== Music ==
Individual tracks that were particularly featured in an episode included &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby?&quot; by Louis Jordan, &quot;Smash It&quot; by Fuzz Townshend, and &quot;The Staunton Lick&quot; by Lemon Jelly. A Guy Pratt remix of the &quot;A-Team&quot; theme song, featured at the conclusion of &quot;Epiphanies&quot;, was a fan favourite, but was never made commercially available.

In 2001, a was released in tandem with the first series&#x27; release on DVD and videotape. A second soundtrack was not released, although the series&#x27; official fan website has an episode-by-episode list of music featured in the second series.

== Episodes ==
=== Series 1 (1999) ===
=== Series 2 (2001) ===
== Awards ==
&quot;Spaced&quot; was nominated in 2000 and 2002 for a British Academy Television Award for situation comedy. Jessica Stevenson won the British Comedy Award in 1999 and 2001 for best TV Comedy Actress. Simon Pegg was nominated in 1999 for the British Comedy Award for Best Male Comedy Newcomer, and the series was nominated that same year for the British Comedy Award for Best TV Sitcom. The show&#x27;s second series was nominated for an International Emmy Award in 2001 for Popular Arts.

== Home releases ==
Series 1 and 2 of &quot;Spaced&quot; were both released on DVD in the United Kingdom. These were followed by a boxed set which collects the previously released single-series DVDs, adding a bonus disc with a feature-length documentary, &quot;Skip to the End&quot;, behind the scenes of the show, as well as a music video by Osymyso.

Music rights issues long prevented the release of &quot;Spaced&quot; in Region 1 (U.S. and Canada). Despite the raised profile resulting from &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (film collaborations between Pegg and Wright that performed well in the Region 1 countries), no DVDs surfaced between 2004 and 2007. In an interview, it was suggested a deal with Anchor Bay Entertainment failed to come to fruition over the music rights.

Wright announced the release of a Region 1 &quot;Spaced&quot; DVD release on 22 July 2008, which included an all-new commentary with Wright, Pegg, and Stevenson, as well as special guests Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Bill Hader, Diablo Cody, Matt Stone and Patton Oswalt. Supplemental features included the original commentaries, the &quot;Skip to the End&quot; documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, and raw footage.

== End of the series ==
Since the show&#x27;s end, cast and crew associated with &quot;Spaced&quot; have been quoted with differing opinions as to whether a third series would be produced, with their most recent statements reflecting a consensus that the show has concluded and will not see a third series.

Edgar Wright initially was &quot;torn&quot; about making more &quot;Spaced&quot;, saying &quot;we have genuinely talked about it and have some neat ideas that could work in a &quot;Before Sunset&quot;/&quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot; kind of way&quot;. However, in April 2007, Wright confirmed that the show no longer had any possibility of returning in any form, as the actors were all now &quot;too old&quot;, and he and Pegg feared it would ruin a good thing. In August of that same year, Wright told Rotten Tomatoes that &quot;there&#x27;s not going to be a third season, it would be silly now&quot; but that they could &quot;do something that sort of like catches our heroes ten years later.&quot;

During an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2013 promoting &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost, Pegg stated: &quot;Whenever we get asked about... another series of &quot;Spaced&quot;... one of the reasons we&#x27;re not going to do it is because we couldn&#x27;t possibly write it with any degree of truth now, because that&#x27;s not where we are or who we are any more. I always find it&#x27;s better to write from a perspective of truth.&quot;

== American remake ==
Fox announced on 29 October 2007 that it would commission a pilot for an American version of &quot;Spaced&quot;, a project they then scuttled in May 2008 following a generally negative reaction from the series&#x27; creators and fans of the original show.

Wright was initially approached about an American version after the first series was broadcast in 1999, and felt an American remake was impossible due to the series&#x27; fundamental theme. &quot;Same reason it couldn&#x27;t be a film,&quot; Wright said. &quot;Part of the charm of &#x27;Spaced&#x27; is, it&#x27;s people in north London acting out stuff from American films... you know, Hollywood in, kind of, suburbia... American TV is much more glamorous. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense. I remember that the producer at the time said, &#x27;Yeah, we&#x27;d have to change a few things. We&#x27;d have to take out the drugs and the swearing, and obviously, Mike can&#x27;t have guns.&#x27;&quot;

Neither Wright, Pegg, nor Stevenson were at any point approached regarding the proposed American remake, which Wright had dubbed &quot;McSpaced&quot;, due to the involvement of film director McG. Wright was upset that &quot;they would a) never bother to get in touch but still b) splash my and Simon&#x27;s names all over the trade announcements and imply that we&#x27;re involved in the same way Ricky [Gervais] and Steve [Merchant] were with &quot;The Office&quot;&quot;. Pegg and Stevenson also complained of the &quot;lack of respect&quot; demonstrated by the creators of the proposed American series, who left them out of discussions as well.

Wright was also angry at the media for what he felt was their overlooking of Stevenson&#x27;s role in the creation of &quot;Spaced&quot; by connecting the series to &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; in news articles.

<text>The Pretenders are a British-American rock band formed in March 1978. The original band consisted of founder and main songwriter Chrissie Hynde (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), James Honeyman-Scott (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Pete Farndon (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Martin Chambers (drums, backing vocals, percussion). Following the deaths of Honeyman-Scott in 1982 and Farndon in 1983, the band experienced numerous personnel changes; Hynde has been the band&#x27;s only continuous member.

The band&#x27;s hit songs include &quot;Kid&quot; (1979), &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; (1979), &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; (1980), &quot;Message of Love&quot; (1981), &quot;My City Was Gone&quot; (1982), &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot; (1982), &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; (1983), &quot;2000 Miles&quot; (1983), &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong&quot; (1986), &quot;My Baby&quot; (1986) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; (1994). The Pretenders were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.

==History==
===Background===
Hynde, originally from Akron, Ohio, moved to London in 1973, working at the weekly music paper &quot;NME&quot; and at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s clothes store. She was involved with early versions of the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned and played in short-lived bands such as Masters of the Backside (1976) and the Moors Murderers (1978 lineup), but failed to find a regular or equal partnership in the bands she joined.

Hynde&#x27;s own provocative band project, centred around her own songwriting, was initially called (Mike Hunt&#x27;s) Dishonorable Discharge and featured former London SS and future Damned members, along with Mick Jones and Sid Vicious (where Hynde taught Vicious to play guitar), but failed to get managerial backing from either Malcolm McLaren or Bernie Rhodes, despite them both poaching her band members for, or asking her to fill in, in their pet projects.

The Pretenders formed in 1978 after Dave Hill at Anchor Records heard some demos of Hynde&#x27;s music. He arranged a rehearsal studio in Denmark Street, London, where a three-piece band consisting of Hynde, Mal Hart on bass (he had played with Hynde and Steve Strange in the Moors Murderers), and Phil Taylor of Motörhead on drums played a selection of Hynde&#x27;s original songs. Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough &quot;star potential&quot; to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records.

Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including a cover of the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers (of the Vacants). Hynde named the band the Pretenders after the Platters song &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, which was the favourite song of one of her former boyfriends.

===Original band (1978–1982)===
The band&#x27;s first single, a cover of the Kinks song &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot; (produced by Nick Lowe and recorded at the July Regents Park sessions) was released in January 1979 and gained critical attention. It was followed by &quot;Kid&quot; in June 1979. In January 1980, the band reached No. 1 in the UK with &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;, which was also successful in the US, reaching No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
Their self-titled debut album was released in January 1980 and was a success in the United Kingdom and the United States both critically and commercially. Produced by Chris Thomas, it is regarded as one of the best debut albums of all time, and has been named one of the best albums of all time by VH1 (no. 52) and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (no. 155).

The second full-length album, &quot;Pretenders II&quot;, was released during August 1981. &quot;Pretenders II&quot; included the songs from the US EP &quot;Extended Play&quot;, the MTV video success &quot;Day After Day&quot;, and popular album-radio tracks &quot;The Adultress&quot;, &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys Get Spanked&quot;, and &quot;The English Roses&quot;.

On 18 September 1981, the Pretenders were the musical guest on the US late night sketch comedy show &quot;Fridays&quot;. The band performed &quot;The Adultress&quot;, &quot;Message of Love&quot; and &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; (not the Kingsmen song). Andy Kaufman was the guest host of the program on that night.

Due to Farndon&#x27;s escalating drug abuse, he was fired from the band after a meeting between Hynde, Honeyman-Scott, and Chambers on 14 June 1982. Two days later, on 16 June 1982, Honeyman-Scott died of heart failure as a result of cocaine intolerance. While in the midst of forming a new band, Farndon was found dead by his wife on 14 April 1983. After taking heroin and passing out, he had drowned in his bathtub.

===Re-grouping (1983–1989)===

Hynde and Chambers continued the band after Honeyman-Scott&#x27;s death. During July 1982, a caretaker team of Hynde, Chambers, Rockpile guitarist Billy Bremner, and Big Country bassist Tony Butler was assembled to record the single &quot;Back on the Chain Gang&quot;. The song was released in October and became their biggest success in the US, staying at No. 5 for three consecutive weeks. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;My City Was Gone&quot; was (except for a brief period in the 1990s) the theme music for &quot;the Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; since its inception.

Hynde then set up a more permanent lineup for the band, keeping Chambers and adding Robbie McIntosh on guitar and Malcolm Foster on bass. &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; was this line-up&#x27;s first single, released in the US in November 1983 and reaching the top 20 there. The US B-side, &quot;2000 Miles&quot;, was released as a single in the UK. The third Pretenders album, &quot;Learning to Crawl&quot; was produced by &quot;fifth Pretender&quot; Chris Thomas and released in January 1984.

In July 1985, the band (including Rupert Black on keyboards) played at Live Aid. Soon after recording sessions for the next album began and one track had been completed, Hynde declared that Chambers was no longer playing well and dismissed him. Discouraged at the loss of his bandmate, Foster quit (&quot;My whole argument was that Martin Chambers was the rhythm section of the Pretenders and it didn&#x27;t really matter who was playing bass. So I just said I didn&#x27;t want to be involved any more.&quot;) Hynde and McIntosh recorded the rest of the album in various sessions in New York City and Stockholm with assorted session musicians. Towards the end of the sessions, Hynde hired two of the guest players–bassist T.M. Stevens and ex-Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham—as the new Pretenders rhythm section. The &quot;Get Close&quot; album was released in 1986; the disc included the top 10 singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong&quot; from the film &quot;Gung Ho&quot; (helped by a popular video homage to the television series &quot;the Avengers&quot;) and &quot;Hymn to Her&quot;, a No. 8 success in the UK. In the US, both &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong&quot; and &quot;My Baby&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

For the &quot;Get Close&quot; tour, Bernie Worrell was added to the live lineup on keyboards. During the tour, Hynde felt the band&#x27;s sound had strayed from its new wave rock roots. She believed that she was now fronting a new band that was &quot;not Pretenders&quot;. Partway into the tour, she took drastic action: Stevens and Worrell were both sacked, Malcolm Foster was reinstated on bass, and Rupert Black returned on keyboards. In mid 1987, McIntosh left the band and was replaced by ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, who remained with the group until early 1988.

===1990s===
In 1990, Hynde hired session players (including one-time Pretenders Bremner and Cunningham and bassist John Mckenzie) and recorded a new Pretenders album, &quot;Packed!&quot; Hynde was the only person pictured anywhere on the album, and was the only official member of the band.

By 1993, Hynde had teamed with ex-Katydids guitarist Adam Seymour to form a new version of Pretenders. The team of Hynde and Seymour then hired a number of session musicians to record &quot;Last of the Independents&quot; that year, including ex-Smiths bassist Andy Rourke, ex-Primitives bassist Andy Hobson, and former Pretender and drummer/writer/producer James Hood, previously with the Impossible Dreamers and Moodswings. But by the end of the album sessions (and for the subsequent tour) the official band line-up was Hynde, Seymour, Hobson, and returning drummer Martin Chambers.

When &quot;Last of the Independents&quot; was released in 1994, it rated gold in the US. Lead single &quot;Night In My Veins&quot; was a minor success in the US, a mid-chart success in the UK, and a top 10 success in Canada. The second single was the album&#x27;s centrepiece ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot;; this track received substantial airplay, and was a top 10 success in the UK, and top 20 in the US (No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and in Canada.

On 10 April 1999, Hynde led the memorial concert &quot;Here, There and Everywhere – A Concert for Linda&quot; for her late close friend Linda McCartney at the Royal Albert Hall, London, organised by Hynde and Carla Lane. Pretenders were the backing band for all artists.

&quot;Viva el Amor&quot; was released during 1999, as was their collaboration with Tom Jones on the album &quot;Reload&quot;.

===2000s===
The Pretenders joined with Emmylou Harris on &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;, performing the song &quot;She&quot;. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation followed in 2000. During 2002 &quot;Loose Screw&quot; was released by Artemis Records, the first Pretenders record to be released by a company other than WEA. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted its &quot;refinement, stylish melodies and vocal fireworks,&quot; while &quot;Blender&quot; called it &quot;slick, snarky pop with flashes of brilliance&quot;.

In March 2005, the Pretenders were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the induction ceremony, the band performed &quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Message of Love&quot;. During her acceptance speech, Hynde named and thanked all the replacement members of the group, then said:
&quot;I know that the Pretenders have looked like a tribute band for the last 20 years. ... And we&#x27;re paying tribute to James Honeyman-Scott and Pete Farndon, without whom we wouldn&#x27;t be here. And on the other hand, without us, they might have been here, but that&#x27;s the way it works in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;
The Pretenders&#x27; album &quot;Break Up the Concrete&quot; was released through Shangri-La Music on 7 October 2008. It was the band&#x27;s first Top 40 album in the US in twenty-two years, and its last to date. Tracks include &quot;Boots of Chinese Plastic&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cut Your Hair&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s a Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Last Ride&quot; and &quot;Almost Perfect&quot;.

===2010s===
In September 2012, the Pretenders re-grouped (Hynde, Chambers, Heywood, Walbourne, Wilkinson) as part of the entertainment line-up for the 2012 Singapore Grand Prix. They were joined by keyboardist/acoustic guitarist Carwyn Ellis in autumn 2012.

On 6 September 2016, Stevie Nicks announced that the Pretenders would tour with her on a 27-city tour for the last three months of 2016. The live band consisted of Hynde, Chambers, Heywood, Walbourne, Wilkinson, as before. Pretenders released their 10th studio album, &quot;Alone&quot;, on 21 October 2016. However, as on &quot;Packed!&quot;, Hynde was the only Pretender on the album, which was otherwise played entirely by session musicians. In May 2017, Ellis resumed touring with the Pretenders, who toured Australia and New Zealand with Nicks. In October 2017, the Pretenders appeared on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

===2020s===
The band was originally scheduled to release their 11th studio album &quot;Hate for Sale&quot; on 1 May 2020, and lead single &quot;The Buzz&quot; was released on 17 March 2020. However, on 24 March, the album release was delayed to 17 July. On the same day (24 March), they released the second single, which is the title track, &quot;Hate for Sale&quot;.

17 April 2020 saw the release of the third single &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurt a Fool&quot;. On 12 May 2020, they released their fourth single &quot;Turf Accountant Daddy&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to be This Lonely&quot;, release 28 May 2020, was the fifth and final single from the album.

A five-month North American tour with Journey was originally slated to begin 15 May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was cancelled.

On 3 September 2022, Pretenders performed at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium with Dave Grohl on bass. They performed &quot;Precious&quot;, &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot; and &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot;.

&quot;Relentless&quot; was announced in May 2023, with a release date of 1 September, which has subsequently been moved to 15 September. The announced line-up for the recording was Chrissie Hynde (vocals), James Walbourne (guitars), Carwyn Ellis (keyboards, guitar), Kris Sonne (drums), and Chris Hill (double bass) and Nick Wilkinson (bass). The new album announcement coincided with a return to major touring in 2023, starting with various UK, Ireland and European dates with a wide variety of headline, festival and support shows reaching the US, Canada and further European dates to be completed by October.

<doc id="147661" wikidata="Q5395424" url="?curid=147661" title="Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum">
<text>Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum has been both exhibited as art and censored as pornography. The Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum around the bay of Naples were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, thereby preserving their buildings and artefacts until extensive archaeological excavations began in the 18th century. These digs revealed the cities to be rich in erotic artefacts such as statues, frescoes, and household items decorated with sexual themes. 

The ubiquity of such imagery and items indicates that the treatment of sexuality in ancient Rome was more relaxed than in current Western culture. The creation of erotic art in ancient Rome is thought to have occurred over seven centuries from the first century BCE to the fifth or sixth century CE.

Much of what might strike modern viewers as erotic imagery, such as oversized phalluses, could arguably be fertility imagery. Depictions of the phallus, for example, could be used in gardens to encourage the production of fertile plants. 

This clash of cultures led to many erotic artefacts from Pompeii being locked away from the public for nearly 200 years. In 1819, when King Francis I of Naples visited the Pompeii exhibition at the Naples National Archaeological Museum with his wife and daughter, he was embarrassed by the erotic artwork and ordered it to be locked away in a &quot;secret cabinet&quot;, accessible only to &quot;people of mature age and respected morals&quot;. Re-opened, closed, re-opened again and then closed again for nearly 100 years, the Secret Museum, Naples was briefly made accessible at the end of the 1960s (the time of the sexual revolution) and was finally re-opened for viewing in 2000. Minors are still only allowed entry to the once-secret cabinet in the presence of a guardian, or with written permission.

== Phalluses ==
The phallus (the erect penis), whether on Pan, Priapus or a similar deity, or on its own, was a common image. It was not seen as threatening or even necessarily erotic, but as a ward against the evil eye. The phallus was sculpted in bronze as &quot;tintinnabula&quot; (wind chimes). Phallus-animals were common household items.

== Priapus ==
A wall fresco which depicted Priapus, the god of sex and fertility, with his oversized erection, was covered with plaster (and, as Karl Schefold explains, even the older reproduction below was locked away &quot;out of prudishness&quot; and only opened on request) and only rediscovered in 1998 due to rainfall.
The Romans believed that he was a talisman protecting the riches of the house.

The second image, from &quot;Schefold, Karl: Vergessenes Pompeji: Unveröffentlichte Bilder römischer Wanddekorationen in geschichtlicher Folge. München 1962.&quot;, with its much more brilliant colors, has been used to retouch the younger, higher resolution image .

A statuette of Priapus in the House of the Vettii in Pompeii is from a small cubicle leading off from the kitchen. It is thought the statue used to be placed in the garden and was used as a fountain. A hole runs through its phallus allowing it to spurt like a fountain. Also in this room where the statue was located were erotic paintings.

== Brothels ==
It is unclear whether the images on the walls were advertisements for the services offered, or if they were merely intended to heighten the pleasure of the visitors. As previously mentioned, some of the paintings and frescoes became immediately famous because they represented erotic, sometimes explicit, sexual scenes.

One of the most curious buildings recovered was in fact, a &quot;Lupanar&quot; (brothel), which had many erotic paintings and graffiti inside. The erotic paintings seem to present an idealised vision of sex at odds with the reality of the function of the lupanar. The Lupanare had 10 rooms (&quot;cubicula&quot;, 5 per floor), a balcony, and a &quot;latrina&quot;. There is no proof that the rooms in the brothel were reserved for specific sexual acts to be performed within them. In 1995, Andrew Wallace-Hadrill determined that the lupanar was the only location that could certainly be identified as a brothel in the ancient world. He argued that, for a location to be a brothel in the ancient world, it needed these three elements: raised stone areas that could be used as beds for performing sexual favors, erotic art, and erotic graffiti. While the lupanar has all three of these identifying features, these are not the only determining factors for a brothel in the ancient world. The Lupanar is not the only brothel in Pompeii, though it is the most famous and the first officially discovered. The town seems to have been oriented to a warm consideration of sensual matters: on a wall of the Basilica (sort of a civil tribunal, thus frequented by many Roman tourists and travelers), a piece of graffiti tells the foreigner: &quot;If anyone is looking for some tender love in this town, keep in mind that here all the girls are very friendly&quot; (loose translation). Other inscriptions reveal some pricing information for various services: &quot;Athenais 2 As, Sabina 2 As&quot; (CIL IV, 4150), &quot;The house slave Logas, 8 As&quot; (CIL IV, 5203) or &quot;Maritimus licks your vulva for 4 As. He is ready to serve virgins as well&quot;. (CIL IV, 8940). The amounts vary from one to two asses up to several sesterces. In the lower price range, the service was not more expensive than a loaf of bread.

Prostitution was relatively inexpensive for the Roman male, but it is important to note that even a low priced prostitute earned more than three times the wages of an unskilled urban labourer. However, it was unlikely a freed woman would enter the profession in hopes for wealth because most women declined in their economic status and standard of living due to demands on their appearance as well as their health.

Prostitution was overwhelmingly an urban creation. Within the brothel, it is said prostitutes worked in a small room usually with an entrance marked by a patchwork curtain. Sometimes, the woman&#x27;s name and price was placed above her door. Sex was generally the cheapest in Pompeii, compared to other parts of the Empire. All services were paid for with cash.

== Suburban baths ==
The Suburban Baths are located near the Marine Gate in Pompeii. In one room, thought to be a dressing room, there are seven wall paintings of sexual scenes and one of a figure with an enlarged scrotum.
These eight paintings are located above paintings of numbered boxes sitting on a shelf. These wall paintings were found in 1986 when the room was first excavated. The paintings are dated to 62 to 79 CE. The building that the baths are in is two stories with the baths taking up the ground floor.
The function of the wall paintings is not yet clear: some authors say that they indicate that the services of prostitutes were available on the upper floor of the bathhouse and could be a sort of advertising, while others prefer the hypothesis that their only purpose was to decorate the walls with joyful scenes, as these were in Roman culture.

Another idea is that both the paintings of sexual scenes and the paintings of boxes with numerals on them were related to the use of spintria tokens that gave people access to a locker in the dressing room.

Each wall painting of a sexual scene has a painting just below it of a box with a number on it. It is thought that there were actual boxes that were placed under these paintings. These boxes would have been placed on a wooden shelf. This wooden shelf would have run along two walls of this dressing room just underneath where the paintings of numbered boxes are. There are some holes in the rear and right wall where brackets that held the shelves could have been. It is thought that these boxes that were sitting on this wooden shelf under these paintings would have been where people attending the baths would have put their clothes after they had undressed in this room. The only remains of the boxes themselves are metal straps. In the wall paintings of the boxes an &quot;X&quot; shape at the front of the boxes indicates where the straps were. The wall painting also shows the wooden shelf underneath the boxes.

Spintria tokens have a numeral on one side and an image of a sexual scene on the other. It is speculated that the sexual scenes and numerals on the tokens related to the wall paintings of sexual scenes and numerals in the dressing room. When the token was given to a person it then gave them access to a place to put their clothing. Possibly they may have put their clothing inside the box that was sitting on the wooden shelf in the dressing room. 

It has been commented that &quot;Graffiti from Pompeii, Herculaneum and 2nd century Ostia Antica, often refer to group sex, although none describe the pose of scene VI [from the suburban baths].&quot;

== Venus ==

Venus was the divine protector of Pompeii, and featured in many frescoes around the city. The goddess of love, sex, and fertility, Venus was closely associated with eroticism and prostitution in ancient Rome. The mural of Venus from Pompeii may have been a Roman copy of the then famous painting by Apelles which Lucian mentioned.

The fresco of Mars and Venus, located in the tablinum of the House of Mars and Venus, is believed to model the proper family roles of husband and wife for those entering the home. Mars and Venus, a popular couple from mythology, were represented in many houses&#x27; tablinum for this reason. Venus has appeared in Pompeian artwork at least 197 times, the majority of these depictions located in a home&#x27;s reception area where a guest would not need an invitation to enter, although she also appears on tavern signs and political banners. Previous scholarship assumed Venus would be more common in &quot;cubicula&quot;, small inclosed rooms that may function as a bedroom, due to her association with love and sex. Recent studies have shown this is not the case and that Venus is more commonly portrayed in large common rooms. Approximately one third of artwork featuring Venus represents some sort of love scene. There are two Venus types found almost exclusively in Pompeii, &quot;Venus Pompeiana&quot; (&quot;Venus of Pompeii&quot;) and &quot;Venus Pescatrice&quot; (&quot;Venus the Fisher-woman&quot;). &quot;Venus Pompeiana&quot; is depicted standing rigidly, usually trapped with a mantle and holding her right arm across her chest. She is most commonly depicted in places that would be seen by many people, possible to demonstrate a house&#x27;s patron goddess or for protection as this form of Venus has special religious and ritual significance to Pompeii. &quot;Venus Pescatrice&quot; is typically shown sitting down, holding a fishing rod and is always semi-naked. The depictions of &quot;Venus Pescatrice&quot; are all similar in structure, suggesting they derive from the same source, though this source has not been found.

<doc id="147672" wikidata="Q238464" url="?curid=147672" title="Simon Pegg">
<text>Simon John Pegg (; born 14 February 1970) is an English actor, comedian and screenwriter. He came to prominence in the UK as the co-creator of the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001), directed by Edgar Wright. He and Wright co-wrote the films &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007), and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013), known collectively as the &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy, all of which saw Wright directing and Pegg starring alongside Nick Frost. Pegg and Frost also wrote and starred in the sci-fi comedy film &quot;Paul&quot; (2011).

Pegg is one of the few performers to have achieved what &quot;Radio Times&quot; calls the &quot;Holy Grail of Nerd-dom&quot;, having played popular supporting characters in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005), &quot;Star Trek&quot; as Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott (2009–2016), and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015). He currently stars as Benji Dunn in the (2006–present). He provided the voice of Buck in &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot; (2009), &quot;Ice Age: Collision Course&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Simon John Pegg was born Simon John Beckingham on 14 February 1970 in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, the son of Gillian Rosemary (née Smith), a former civil servant, and John Henry Beckingham, a jazz musician and keyboard salesman. His parents divorced when he was seven, and he took on his stepfather&#x27;s surname &quot;Pegg&quot; after his mother remarried. His brother, Mike (who starred in the 2020 film &quot;The Host&quot;), still uses Beckingham as his surname. He attended Castle Hill Primary School, Brockworth Comprehensive Secondary School, and The King&#x27;s School, Gloucester.

Pegg moved to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire when he was 16 and studied English literature and theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon College. He graduated from the University of Bristol in 1991 with a BA in theatre, film, and television, titling his undergraduate thesis &quot;A Marxist overview of popular 1970s cinema and hegemonic discourses&quot;. While there, he performed as a member of a comedy troupe called &quot;David Icke and the Orphans of Jesus&quot;, alongside David Walliams, Dominik Diamond, and Jason Bradbury.

&quot;When I graduated from university where I studied theater, film and television, I went into stand-up because comedy was something I enjoyed but also because it offered me a certain autonomy that I wouldn&#x27;t have if I was sitting and waiting for the phone to ring as an actor. Then, I drifted into comedy acting through doing stand-up, and that was something that I really enjoyed. But, it wasn&#x27;t the only thing I ever wanted to do. There was a time when I was younger where I just wanted to be at The Royal Shakespeare Theatre.&quot;

==Career==

Pegg&#x27;s early appearances in TV series and films include &quot;Six Pairs of Pants&quot; (Meridian &amp; Anglia, 1995), &quot;Asylum&quot;, &quot;Faith in the Future&quot;, &quot;Big Train&quot; and &quot;Hippies&quot;. Between 1998 and 2004, Pegg was regularly featured on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The 99p Challenge&quot;. Pegg&#x27;s other credits include appearances in the World War II mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;; the television comedies &quot;Black Books&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;; and the films &quot;The Parole Officer&quot;, &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, and &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot;. He played various roles during the tour of Steve Coogan&#x27;s 1998 live stage show &quot;The Man Who Thinks He&#x27;s It&quot;.
In 1999, he created and co-wrote the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; with Jessica Stevenson. The series was directed by Edgar Wright, with whom Pegg and Stevenson had previously worked on &quot;Asylum&quot;, and Pegg wrote the character of Mike Watt specifically for his friend Nick Frost. For his performance in this series, Pegg was nominated for a British Comedy Award as Best Male Comedy Newcomer. The experience of making a &quot;Spaced&quot; fantasy sequence featuring zombies led to Pegg and Wright co-writing the &quot;romantic zombie comedy&quot; film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, released in April 2004, in which Pegg also starred. At George A. Romero&#x27;s invitation, Pegg and Wright made cameo appearances in Romero&#x27;s zombie film, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. In 2004, Pegg guest-starred in a spin-off of the television show &quot;Danger! 50,000 Volts!&quot; called &quot;Danger! 50,000 Zombies!&quot;, in which he played a zombie-hunter named Dr. Fell.

He played mutant bounty hunter Johnny Alpha, the Strontium Dog, in a series of Big Finish Productions audio plays based on the character from British comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Pegg also appeared in Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio story &quot;Invaders From Mars&quot; as Don Chaney, and appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series, playing the Editor in the 2005 episode &quot;The Long Game&quot;. He also narrated the first series of the &quot;making-of&quot; documentary series &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot;.

Upon completion of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, Pegg was questioned as to whether he would be abandoning the British film industry for Hollywood, and he replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going to go away and do, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;Mission: Impossible III&quot;&quot;, picking the title of an imaginary blockbuster. When the film &quot;&quot; was subsequently made, Pegg appeared in it as Benji Dunn, an IMF technician who assists Tom Cruise&#x27;s character Ethan Hunt. He has reprised the role in four further &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; sequel films: &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2023), and will appear in &quot;&quot; in 2025.
In 2006, he played Gus in &quot;Big Nothing&quot; alongside David Schwimmer. The same year, Pegg and Wright completed their second film, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, released in February 2007. The film is a police-action movie homage and also stars Nick Frost, in which Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a London policeman transferred to rural Sandford, a fictional village where grisly events take place. In 2007, Pegg starred in &quot;The Good Night&quot; (directed by Jake Paltrow) and &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; directed by David Schwimmer and co-starring Thandie Newton and Hank Azaria. In 2008, he wrote the dialogue for an English language re-release of the cult 2006 animated Norwegian film, &quot;Free Jimmy&quot;. Pegg received screenwriting credit for this, and also voiced one of the main characters in the English-language version, which has an international range of actors including Woody Harrelson.

Pegg co-wrote the script for a film called &quot;Paul&quot;, about two young men who encounter a comedic extraterrestrial alien during a road trip across the US. The completed script appeared on the 2008 &quot;Brit List&quot;, a film-industry-compiled survey of the best unproduced British screenplays, inspired by the American Black List. In those films and in &quot;Spaced&quot;, Pegg typically plays the leading hero while Frost plays the sidekick. However &quot;Paul&quot; reverses this dynamic. The film was released in 2011.
Pegg played engineer Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the eleventh film in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series, released 8 May 2009. He reprised the role in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013) and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016), also co-writing the latter. In 2010 he appeared as William Burke in &quot;Burke &amp; Hare&quot;, a film directed by John Landis about two Ulstermen who were notorious murderers and bodysnatchers in early 19th-century Edinburgh. His likeness was also used for the character of Wee Hughie in the comic book series &quot;The Boys&quot;; while this was done without Pegg&#x27;s permission, he quickly became a fan of the title, and even wrote the introduction to the first bound volume. He voiced Reepicheep, the heroic mouse in &quot;Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

Pegg and Wright completed the &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy&quot; (the first two films being &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;) with their 2013 film &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;. In July 2014, Pegg appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; held at the O2 Arena, London. He was the special guest in their &quot;Blackmail&quot; sketch. In 2015 he appeared in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; as Unkar Plutt, the Junkyard dealer on Jakku.

Pegg voiced Professor Phineas Nigellus Black in the 2023 video game &quot;Hogwarts Legacy&quot;.

In May 2023, Pegg was interviewed by Lauren Laverne on the long running BBC radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

==Political views and activism==
In 2014, Pegg announced his support for the feminist campaign HeForShe.

In 2016, Pegg spoke of having respect for Jeremy Corbyn and believing in Britain Stronger in Europe&#x27;s ideas in relation to the EU.

In 2020, Pegg signed an open letter calling for the wealthiest in society to pay more tax in order to help fight inequality.

Pegg has been an activist for Greenpeace since 2021, protesting overfishing and supporting their &quot;Don&#x27;t stop thinking about tomorrow&quot; campaign.

==Personal life==
Pegg is an atheist. He married his long-time girlfriend, music industry publicist Maureen McCann, in Glasgow on 23 July 2005. They reside in Essendon, Hertfordshire. Nick Frost was the best man at his wedding. The couple have one child together, born in 2009.

Pegg is close friends with Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin, and appears as a violin-playing Elvis impersonator in the video for Coldplay&#x27;s 2010 single &quot;Christmas Lights&quot;. Along with Jonny Buckland, Pegg is godfather to Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s daughter Apple. In return, Martin is godfather to Pegg&#x27;s daughter. In a video interview with British &quot;GQ&quot; magazine in July 2018, Pegg stated that his daughter has sung backing vocals for Coldplay onstage at the Glastonbury Festival. Pegg is also godfather to the son of actor and friend Martin Freeman. Pegg&#x27;s parents and sister briefly appeared in &quot;Spaced&quot;, while his mother appeared in both &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;.

In a July 2018 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Pegg spoke about his battle with depression and alcoholism, and how rehab helped him recover from the latter. He stated: &quot;When I watch &quot;&quot;, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic [...] I&#x27;m not ashamed of what happened. And I think if anyone finds any relationship to it, then it might motivate them to get well. But I am not proud of it, eitherI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cool, like I was Mr. Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll, blackout and all that shit. It wasn&#x27;t, it was just terrible.&quot; Pegg checked into a rehab facility shortly before production of &quot;&quot;. He hid his recovery from the tabloids through court orders, although some journalists went so far as to call the clinic pretending to be his mother. Pegg attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and has remained sober since.
