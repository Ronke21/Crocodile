<text>Eaton is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 712 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
The Town of Eaton is located in the center of Clark County and is bordered to the north by the city of Greenwood. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Eaton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.11%, is water. The Black River flows from north to south through the center of the town.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Eaton was first surveyed in June 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in October and November of the same year another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. The survey produced a map which shows a &quot;Waggon Road&quot; winding east of the Black River and sites of four cabins along the river, including &quot;Vanduser&#x27;s cabin,&quot; along with Vanduser&#x27;s millsite near the future site of Greenwood. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
T26N R2W is 2nd rate gently rolling land Some good Pine in the NE part of the Township between Black and Rock rivers. A Saw Mill is about being built on black river in the NE 1/4 Sec 3 [near Greenwood] There(?) are the finest kind of Sugar Lind Elm &amp; Some ash timber The Mill Sites on Black and Rock rivers are without Number Black river is a Swift (?) rough and rocky Stream all through this and the two adjoining TownShips. This township is well calclulate(?) for agricultural purposes well water timber and good quality of sile(?) and will Some day contain a large population(?). 

An 1873 map of Clark County showed a &quot;highway&quot; reaching up from Neillsville through Eaton and Greenwood, and into what would become Longwood. Though the road followed the course of modern Highway 73, this was a dirt wagon road. Greenwood was already marked on this map, and three miles south of Greenwood, a Lumberman post office. A wagon road ran east from 73 along what is now Twenty Six Road. West of the Black River, some sort of road followed the course of modern County O for five miles, then jogged off a mile to the west.

By 1880 Eaton consisted of the modern townships of Hendren and Eaton. The plat map from that year shows no settler homesteads west of the Black River; instead much of the land there was in large blocks owned by lumbermen and speculators, with C.C. Washburn and D.J. Spaulding Estate holding the largest share. East of the river, roads had been added since 1873, and many settlers along those roads, particularly in the northeast corner near Greenwood. A school stood where Twenty Six Road now crosses 73, and a &quot;hotel&quot; 3/4 mile to the north. A flood dam had been built on Cawley Creek in the southeast corner of the town. That road from the 1873 map along County O is largely missing from this map.

By 1890 the Neillsville-to-Withee stage passed through Eaton each day, following a dirt road that would become modern highway 73.

By 1893 more roads had been added east of the Black, with about 50 settler homes lining those roads. The plat map from that year shows a mill west of Greenwood where the Rock River meets the Black, another mill south of Greenwood where the Rock now crosses 73, and another near where Mann Road now crosses 73. A spur of the Wisconsin Central Railroad snaked in from Marshfield through Loyal to the south side of Greenwood. A rural schoolhouse had been added a half mile west of where Hinker Road now meets Owen Avenue. Much of the west side of the river was still held in large blocks, with the largest portions held by J.J. Hogan, Geo. Hiles &amp; Midland Lumber Manufacturing Company, and Greenwood Manufacturing &amp; Merchandise Company. The plat map shows some sort of road following much of the course of modern Reesewood Avenue, then cutting over to where County O now runs, with a few settlers near a rural school where O crosses West Eaton Road.

By 1906 more roads had been added, and many more settlers. East of the river, a church had appeared where Willard Road now crosses Fairground Avenue, with a rural school a half mile to the east. A wagon-road predecessor of County OO reached from the future highway 73 across the river to join up with a north-south road that would become County O. A quarter mile east of that intersection stood a new rural school. A few other road segments connected to those, with a couple dozen settlers&#x27; homes west of the Black. A new railroad arced across the top of Eaton, the Fairchild and Northeastern, swooping south of Greenwood on its way to Owen. Some large blocks of unsettled land remained - mostly west of the Black - and some smaller blocks were still held by the land companies that sold cutover lands left by logging companies to settlers.

By 1920 Eaton had its current six by six mile footprint, with Hendren split off as a separate township. The plat map shows the modern road grid 90% complete and most of the town settled - even west of the river. Cheese factories appear on this map: one three miles south of Greenwood on Fairground Avenue, one where OO crosses 73, and one on the south edge of the town where Bobwhite Road now crosses O. The transition from logging to agriculture was well underway.

<text>Green Grove is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 756 at the 2010 census, down from 902 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Atwood and Bright are located in the town.

==Geography==
The town of Green Grove is in northeastern Clark County. It is bordered to the northwest by the city of Owen and at its northeast corner by the village of Curtiss. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.58%, is water.

The terrain of most of Green Grove is fairly flat, with soils mostly &quot;deep, nearly level to sloping, poorly drained to moderately well-drained, silty soils on ground moraines.&quot; Most of the bedrock underneath is Mount Simon sandstone, interspersed with some areas of volcanic and metavolcanic rock.

==History==
Some of the early European Americans to walk the six mile square that would become Green Grove were the U.S. government&#x27;s surveyors. From 1845 to 1847 they surveyed the outline of the township on foot with chain and compass. Then others came back in January of 1853 to survey all the section lines. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township is nearly entirely(?) level a great part of it Swampy and unfit for cultivation. The part Which is not swamp is but little elevated above(?) Swamp, Soil 3rd(?) rate, thickly timbered with Pine, ? and Elm, very(?) free from undergrowth, but few Streams and those Small Except One Near the Northwest part of the Town. of Some Size that With all the rest bears N. West(?)&quot;
Once the land was surveyed, the federal government began selling parcels to private individuals and lumber companies. The first land patent in Green Grove was in 1856 - a sale of 40 acres in section 11 to a John Lewis.

By 1880 the area that would become Green Grove was the western half of an early Town of Colby. Some sort of road ran along what is now County E, with a Green Grove post office where E now meets Eddy Road. Settlers had farms ranging from 40 to 160 acres for the first mile. Beyond that eastern mile, most of the 6-mile square was in larger parcels owned by lumber companies, with D.J. Spaulding Estate owning the largest portion, followed by J.S. Keator and Bright and Withee. Some sort of wagon road followed the course of modern County N across the township. In 1886 the 6 by 6-mile Town of Green Grove was split out from the Town of Colby.

By 1906 the roads and farms had filled in a little, but much of the west and north of Green Grove was still in the hands of lumber companies like J.S. Owen and H.A. Bright. The Fairchild and Northeastern Railroad was under construction, arcing across the west end of the township on its way from Willard to Owen, with Bright post office where the F&amp;NE crossed the road that is now County N. A schoolhouse stood on that same road at the west end of Green Grove. Other schools stood where modern Sparrow meets Popple River Road, on Oak Grove Avenue north of Eddy Road, and on N west of Oak Grove. A town hall was at the intersection of N and Romadka.
In 1910, the Soo Line Railroad built a railroad line diagonal across the town of Green Grove, connecting Spencer with Owen. Prior to this, trains heading between Chicago and Superior had to jog out of their direct route up to Abbotsford and over to Owen. The railroad added a couple sidings in the farms and forest and Atwood grew there. The 1918 History of Clark County describes Atwood as &quot;a new village in Section 21, Green Grove, on the &quot;Soo&quot; line, from Spencer to Owen. It contains the railroad station, a store and a saloon.

That same 1918 history book includes this description of the community of Bright: &quot;Bright is located in Section 20, Greenwood (sic) on the Fairchild and Northeastern, between Greenwood and Owen. It has a railroad station, a store, and a cheese factory. The old sawmill is no longer operated.&quot;

By 1920 most of the middle and west of Green Grove was filled in with farms. A cheese factory had been started at what is now the corner of Romadka and Oak Road. The transition from logging to dairy was well underway.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 902 people, 225 households, and 177 families residing in the town. The population density was 24.7 people per square mile (9.5/km2).

<text>Greenwood is a city in Clark County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,026 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Greenwood is located at (44.767826, -90.598959).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

The town has a peace memorial, created by Ernest Durig from an artificial stone made using concrete and fine white sand. Unveiled in 1937, it was restored in 1982, and sits adjacent to the 1934 City Hall, on the corner of Main Street and Division Street.

==History==
In the years just before settlement, the future site of Greenwood was a hunting ground shared by Ojibwe, Menominee and Ho-Chunk people. The Black River ran quietly through immense forests until Mormon loggers came upstream in 1844, working out of a camp downstream from Greenwood&#x27;s site, cutting white pine logs and floating them down the rivers to be used in their temple in Nauvoo, Illinois.

In 1847 or 1848 Van Dusen and Waterman built a mill on the west side of the Black River across from where Greenwood would grow. Albert Lambert built another mill nearby. Elijah and Frederick Eaton bought Van Dusen&#x27;s mill in 1854. A little mill town began to take shape, called &quot;Eatonville&quot; for a while.

By 1869 the community had a log schoolhouse, several log houses, and two frame houses, and S.C. Honeywell sold a few goods out of his house. The following year Chandler and Brown from Black River Falls opened a store and W.H. Begley opened a hotel. At this time a stagecoach came up from Black River Falls to Greenwood. The village of Greenwood was platted in 1871. That same year, a four-room frame school was built.

A fire in 1885 destroyed eight buildings, but the town continued to grow. By 1890 the village had &quot;three general stores, two hardware stores, two meat markets, two blacksmith shops, two millinery and dressmaking establishments, one wagon shop, one grocery store, one confectionary store, one flour and agricultural implement store, one harness shop, one shoe shop, one furniture store and factory, one hotel, one barber shop, one public hall, one Odd Fellows hall, one Methodist Episcopal Church, one photograph gallery, one creamery and one sawmill.&quot;

Greenwood was incorporated as a city in 1891, the same year the Wisconsin Central Railroad connected Greenwood to Loyal and Marshfield. In 1895 the Fairchild and Northeastern Railroad connected from the southwest, and ran its line north to Owen. A fire in 1900 destroyed Greenwood&#x27;s heading mill.

By 1918, Greenwood&#x27;s main industries were agricultural - not lumber. The Greenwood Cheese House and Parafining Station coated the product of surrounding cheese factories in paraffin and shipped it. Greenwood Roller Mills was a steam-powered mill which produced flour and feed. The American Society of Equity was a cattle dealer. Eau Claire Creamery Company ran a plant that bought, pasteurized and shipped milk.

<text>Hixon is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 740 at the 2000 census. Most of the village of Withee, most of the city of Owen, and the ghost town of Clark are located in Hixon.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 33.7 square miles (87.4 km2), of which, 33.3 square miles (86.4 km2) of it is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) of it (1.13%) is water. The Black river cuts across the west side of Hixon.

Except for stream cuts, Hixon&#x27;s terrain is fairly flat. The soil is mostly Colby silt loam, weathered from the drift left by a glacier so long ago that erosion has mostly levelled it. Beneath the drift, the bedrock is volcanic schists and hornblende in the north of Hixon - Mount Simon sandstone in the south.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Hixon was first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in late 1853 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
The Surface of this Township is generally level except a small portion near the Margin of Black River. The Soil is mostly second rate. The Timber is principally White Pine of good quality and valuable for lumber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are Several large Swamp in the Township most of which are unfit for cultivation. The Township is well watered with numerous Small Streams. Black River Enter this Township in Section 5 and runs through it in Southerly direction until it leaves the Township in Section 32 the banks of which are generally high water from 1 to 2 feet deep and averaging about 150 links in width. It is well adapted to logging purposes. There are no Settlers in the Township. 

An 1873 map of Clark County showed an early town of Hixon encompassing many 6-mile squares in the county&#x27;s northwest corner, which then included the southern twelve miles of what is now Taylor County. No signs of development were marked on the 6-mile square which is modern Hixon, in contrast to the area around Neillsville, which had roads reaching out from a settlement grid. The nearest road to modern Hixon was the one wagon road that ran up through the center of the county, ending two miles north of Longwood. The town was named for Gideon C. Hixon, a lumber executive from La Crosse.

An 1880 map of the area showed Taylor County split off and Hixon reduced, but Hixon still covering the modern towns of Hixon, Withee, Reseburg, and Longwood. The Wisconsin and Minnesota Railroad ran across the south of what would be modern Hixon. It had been built just that year by the owners of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, who were eager to connect their railroad at Abbotsford with the economic activity at Chippewa Falls, which was already connected by rail to the Twin Cities. The map showed a wagon road following the future course of French Town Road to the north edge of the modern Hixon. (Half of that road would disappear in the next map, so take that road with a grain of salt.) Another road followed the course of modern Highway 73 up through what would become Withee and then turned east on what is now Willow Road. A few homesteads were marked along French Town Road, an A.L. Godwin had a home marked west of the Black River, and a homestead was marked near the future site of Owen on D.J. Spaulding land on the Popple River. Most of the land was in large blocks, with W.T. Murray owning the most, followed by D.J. Spaulding, W.H. Polley &amp; Sons. Hixon and Bussell own a few small parcels, as does N. H. Withee.

An 1893 map of Hixon showed French Town Road only 3.5 miles into the township, but it showed a dozen settlers sprinkled along it - among them a Thibert, a Lambert, and two Daphners. It showed a hamlet of Withee with a school, and wagon roads from Withee to French Town along what are now Hixwood and Willow. A sawmill was marked where the railroad crossed the Black River, and at the site where Owen would grow, a sawmill was labelled &quot;Owens Mill&quot;. Most of the land away from the roads was in large blocks with W.T. Murray owning the most land, followed by D.J. Spaulding, H.H. Camp, and the N. H. Withee estate. At this point, John S. Owen still owned only a few small parcels.

Around 1894 John S. Owen of Eau Claire bought the timber land and two sawmills of Dudley J. Spaulding and Midland Lumber and Manufacturing Company, which had gone bankrupt. Owen dismantled Spaulding&#x27;s sawmill west of Withee, shipped it on the railroad two miles east, and rebuilt it on Brick Creek, starting the city of Owen. Around 1902 Owen&#x27;s company partnered with the Wisconsin Central to build a new rail line northwest from Owen to Ladysmith, cutting across Hixon.

A 1906 plat map shows the new village of Owen in the southeast corner of Hixon, with the new railroad cutting across diagonally. By then the network of roads had grown and settlers were filling in along all the roads. Of note, a large portion of the names north of Withee were Scandinavian - many members of the Danish community centered on Nazareth Lutheran. Rural schools had appeared where modern County T meets Hickory, on French Town Road, and 3 miles west of Withee on what is now County X. This is the first map where a cemetery is marked at Riverside. Some land was still in large blocks, with J.S. Owen Lumber Company the largest owner.

A plat map from around 1920 shows practically the whole town settled. Cheese factories were marked on the map for the first time: two on the outskirts of Withee, one between Withee and Owen, and one near Amber, the settlement near the north end of Hixon which is now called &quot;Clark&quot; on some maps.

<text>Longwood is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 698 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.7 square miles (92.5 km2), of which, 35.7 square miles (92.5 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Longwood was first surveyed in June of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in December of 1848 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
The surface of the township ... is mostly rolling, some slightly rolling and a small part level. There are but few swamps in it except Black Alder swamps along the small streams. The township is watered by Black River, running nearly in a south direction through the western part, and the Sauteetswasin(?) River running through th eeastern part of the township and numerous small streams emptying into them. The soil is generally of a 2nd rate quality, and is mostly tolerably well adapted for agricultural purposes. The timber is White Pine, Lind, Birch, Sugar Maple, Soft Maple, Elm, Black and White Oak, Hemlock, Ash, Ironwood and Balsam. 

An 1873 map of Clark County showed a road reaching up from Neillsville through Greenwood to &quot;Longwood PO&quot; at the current Longwood corners, ending two miles north of there. Though this followed the course of modern Highway 73, this was probably a dirt wagon road. The Popple River is labelled on this map with its modern name - changed from the Indian name in the surveyors&#x27; notes above.

By 1880 the future town of Longwood was part of a larger town of Hixon. Much of the land was owned in large blocks by logging operations and land speculators, with C.C. Washburn, N.H. Withee, and the D.J. Spaulding Estate holding the largest share. The wagon road along the future Highway 73 had been extended through to the future Withee, where the railroad had just arrived. Other wagon roads followed sections of the future County N, Black River Road, and River Avenue. The 1880 map shows a dozen homesteads scattered along the roads, one school a half mile south of Longwood corner, and another where Black River Road now meets River Ave. The map also shows a &quot;flood dam&quot; in section 13, to help drive logs down the Popple River when the natural flow was insufficient. 

By 1893 Longwood was still part of Hixon township. Lumber companies still owned large chunks, with J.J. Hogan and John S. Owen new major players, but wagon roads had grown to cover more of the town, lined with more settlers on smaller parcels. A schoolhouse had been added where Sandy Lane Road now meets County O, and a sawmill on Black River Road.

A 1906 plat map shows the modern road grid nearly complete. Farms are sprinkled through the township, with large gaps remaining only on the west and east sides. The remaining large blocks of land are mostly owned by W.W. Withee and J.S. Owen. The community at Longwood corner shows a blacksmith, a store, two churches, a creamery, and a school. The two rural schools nearby had disappeared, but another rural school had appeared on the future 73 north of Eddy Road. Another church had appeared in the southwest part of the town north of where County O meets Popple River Road. By this time Longwood corner also had a creamery. 

A plat map from around 1920 shows the modern road grid complete and much of town settled, except for a few parcels owned by lumber enterprises. Two more cheese factories had been added - one where Colby Factory Road and River Avenue now cross and one where County N now meets O. The transition from logging to agriculture was well underway.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 698 people, 226 households, and 181 families residing in the town. The population density was 19.6 people per square mile (7.5/km2).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.72% of the population.

There were 226 households, out of which 38.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.0% were married couples living together, 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.9% were non-families. 16.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<text>Owen is a city in Clark County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 940 at the 2010 census. Owen is located directly east of the village of Withee, which is about half the size of Owen.

==History==
In 1880 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line through what would become Owen, on its way from Abbotsford to Chippewa Falls.

In 1893 the John S. Owen Company of Eau Claire managed to buy from J.D. Spaulding 400 square miles of virgin timber that ran from the current site of Owen north through Taylor County and into Rusk County. Near where the railroad crossed Brick Creek and that creek flowed into the Popple River, the company built a warehouse, a boarding house, and five log buildings clustered around the rail line. They dammed Brick Creek to make a mill pond and built a sawmill, a planing mill, and a company store. A one-room school was built in 1894. Early on, John&#x27;s son Aloney moved to the settlement to oversee local operations.

In 1904 the Village of Owen incorporated, with 315 people. In 1906 the Owen Company started the Owen Box and Crating factory, the Woodland Hotel, and began providing electrical service within the village of Owen. In 1907 the Owens organized the State Bank of Owen, headed by J.G. Owen.
By 1914, Owen&#x27;s population was 1,000. The Owens organized the State Bank of Withee, headed by A.R. Owen. The Owens also had a hand in a bottling works, a theater, a telephone company, and three hotels. They donated land for a city park and churches. In 1915 the company opened a retail lumber store.

By 1918 the Owen Company was running 25 miles of railroad in Clark and Taylor Counties, hauling logs from their timber holdings in to their sawmill. At one point they thought their supply might last for five or six years, but it ended up lasting 40. The last log was sawed in 1932.

<doc id="138848" wikidata="Q6497044" url="?curid=138848" title="History of literature">
<text>The history of literature is the historical development of writings in prose or poetry that attempt to provide entertainment or education to the reader, as well as the development of the literary techniques used in the communication of these pieces. Not all writings constitute literature. Some recorded materials, such as compilations of data (e.g., a check register) are not considered literature, and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above.

==Ancient (Bronze Age–5th century)==
Early literature is derived from stories told in hunter-gatherer bands through oral tradition, including myth and folklore. Storytelling emerged as the human mind evolved to apply causal reasoning and structure events into a narrative and language, allowing early humans to share information with one another. Early storytelling provided opportunity to learn about dangers and social norms while also entertaining listeners. Myth can be expanded to include all use of patterns and stories to make sense of the world, and it may be psychologically intrinsic to humans. Epic poetry is recognized as the pinnacle of ancient literature. These works are long narrative poems that recount the feats of mythic heroes, often said to take place in the nation&#x27;s early history.

The history of writing began independently in different parts of the world, including in Mesopotamia about 3200 BC, in Ancient China about 1250 BC, and in Mesoamerica about 650 BC. Literature was not initially incorporated in writing, as it was primarily used for simpler purposes, such as accounting. Some of the earliest surviving works of literature include &quot;The Maxims of Ptahhotep&quot; and the &quot;Story of Wenamun&quot; from Ancient Egypt, &quot;Instructions of Shuruppak&quot; and &quot;Poor Man of Nippur&quot; from Mesopotamia, and &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; from Ancient China.

=== Mesopotamia ===

Sumerian literature is the oldest known literature, written in Sumer. Types of literature were not clearly defined, and all Sumerian literature incorporated poetic aspects. Sumerian poems demonstrate basic elements of poetry, including lines, imagery, and metaphor. Humans, gods, talking animals, and inanimate objects were all incorporated as characters. Suspense and humor were both incorporated into Sumerian stories. These stories were primarily shared orally, though they were also recorded by scribes. Some works were associated with specific musical instruments or contexts and may have been performed in specific settings. Sumerian literature did not use titles, instead being referred to by the work&#x27;s first line.

Akkadian literature developed in subsequent Mesopotamian societies, such as Babylonia and Assyria, from the third to first millennia BC. During this time, it spread to other areas, including Egypt, Ugarit, and Hattusa. The Akkadian language was influenced by the Sumerian language, and many elements of Sumerian literature were adopted in Akkadian literature. Many works of Akkadian literature were commissioned by kings that had scribes and scholars in their service. Some of these works served to celebrate the king or the divine, while others recorded information for religious practices or medicine. Poetry, proverbs, folktales, love lyrics, and accounts of disputes were all incorporated into Akkadian literature.

=== Ancient Egypt ===

Literature of the Old Kingdom of Egypt developed directly from practical use during the Fifth Dynasty. Lists of offerings to the gods were rewritten as prayers, and statistical information about state officials was expanded into autobiographies. These autobiographies were written to exemplify the virtues of their subjects and often incorporated a free flow style that blended prose and poetry. Kings were not written about beyond clerical recordings, but poetry was performed during the funerals of kings as part of a religious ritual. The &quot;Instructions&quot;, a form of wisdom literature that was popular during most of Ancient Egyptian history, taught maxims of Ancient Egyptian philosophy that combined pragmatic thought and religious speculation.

These literary traditions continued to develop in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt as autobiographies became more intricate. The role of the king in literature expanded during this period; royal testaments were written from the perspective of the king to his successor, and celebrations of the king and advocacy of strong leadership were included in autobiographies and &quot;Instructions&quot;. Fiction and analysis of good and evil also developed during this period. During the New Kingdom of Egypt, the popularity of wisdom literature and educational works persisted, though the use of teachings and stories was prioritized over the use of discourses. Entertainment literature was popular among the nobility during this period, incorporating aspects of narrative myth and folklore, religious hymns, love songs, and praise for the king and the city.

===Ancient China===
==== Zhou dynasty ====

Chinese mythology played a notable role in the earliest Chinese literature, though it was less prominent compared to mythological literature in other civilizations. By the time of the Zhou dynasty, Chinese culture emphasized the community over the individual, discouraging mythological stories of great personages and characterization of the divine. Mythological literature was more common in the southern Chu nation. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; are philosophical compilations that serve as the foundation of Taoism. Confucius was a defining figure in ancient Chinese philosophy and politics. He collected the Six Classics as founding texts of Confucianism, and they became the central texts by which other works were compared in Chinese literary scholarship. Confucianism dominated literary tastes in Ancient China starting in the Warring States period. The sayings of Confucius were later compiled into the &quot;Analects&quot; by his students.

Anthologies were common in Ancient China, and anthologizing was used as a means of literary criticism to determine literary classics. The &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, one of the Six Classics, is the oldest existing anthology of Chinese poetry. It comprises 305 works by anonymous authors dating from the 12th to 7th centuries BC. Prior to the collection of these works, poetic tradition in Ancient China was primarily oral. The &quot;Chu Ci&quot; anthology is a volume of poems from the Warring States period written in Chu and attributed to Qu Yuan. These poems were written as rhapsodies that were meant to be recited with a specific tone rather than sung. The Music Bureau was developed during the Zhou dynasty, establishing a governmental role for the collection of musical works and folk songs that would persist throughout Chinese history.

Historical documents developed into an early form of literature during the Warring States period, as documentation was combined with narrative and sometimes with legendary accounts of history. Two of the Six Classics, the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; and the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, are historical documents. The latter inspired works of historical commentary that became a genre in their own right, including the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, the &quot;Gongyang Zhuan&quot;, and the &quot;Guliang Zhuan&quot;. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; is considered to be the first large scale narrative work in Chinese literature. &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu was an influential book on military strategy that is still referenced in the modern era.

==== Qin and Han dynasties ====
Poetry written in the brief period of the Qin dynasty has been entirely lost. Poetry in the Han dynasty diverged as several branches developed, including short length, paralleled exposition, rhymed exposition, and ancient style, and idealism also became popular during the Han dynasty. The &quot;Nineteen Old Poems&quot; were written at this time, though how they came about is the subject of debate. Poetry during this period abandoned tetrasyllabic verse in favor of pentasyllabic verse. The ballads of Chu spread through China and became widely popular, often focusing on concepts of inevitable destiny and fate.

Political and argumentative literature by government officials dominated Chinese prose during this period, though even these works often engaged in lyricism and metaphor. Jia Yi was an essayist known for his emotional political treatises such as &quot;The Faults of Qin&quot;. Chao Cuo was an essayist known for treatises that were meticulous rather than emotional. Confucianism continued to dictate philosophical works, though a movement of works criticizing contemporary application of Confucianism began with Wang Chong in his &quot;Lunheng&quot;. Prose literature meant for entertainment also developed during this period. Historical literature was revolutionized by the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the first general history of ancient times and the largest work of literature to that point in time.

==== Six Dynasties ====

Centralism declined during the Six Dynasties period, and Confucianism lost influence as a predominating ideology. This caused the rise of many local traditions of philosophical literature, including that of Taoist and Buddhist ideas. Prose fiction during the Wei and Jin dynasties consisted mainly of supernatural folklore, including those presented as historical. This tradition of supernatural fiction continued during the Northern and Southern dynasties with the &quot;Records of Light and Shade&quot; attributed to Liu Yiqing. Another genre of prose was collections of short biographical or anecdotal impressions, of which only &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot; survives.

Jian&#x27;an poetry developed from the literary tradition of Eastern Han, incorporating idiosyncrasies and strong demonstrations of emotion to express individualism. This movement was led by then-ruler of China Cao Cao. The poetry of Cao Cao consisted of ensemble songs published through the Music Bureau and performed with music. The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were influential poets in the Wei dynasty mid-3rd century, addressing political and philosophical concerns directly in their poetry. Chinese poetry developed significantly during the Jin dynasty, incorporating parallelism, prosody, and emotional expression through scenery. Zhang Hua, Lu Ji, and Pan Yue are recognized as the great poets that developed early Western Jin poetry. Zuo Si and Liu Kun were poets in later Western Jin. In Eastern Jin, philosophical poetry went through a period of abstraction that removed much of its literary elements. Guo Pu and Tao Yuanming were notable poets in Eastern Jin.

The popularity of literary poetry and aestheticism grew during the Southern dynasties, and literature as art began to be recognized as distinct from political and philosophical literature. This resulted in the growth of literary criticism, with &quot;The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons&quot; and &quot;Ranking of Poetry&quot; being written at this time. The Sixteen Kingdoms of the Northern dynasties saw little cultural growth due to their instability, and Northern literature of this time was typically influenced by the Southern dynasties. Shanshui poetry also became prominent in Six Dynasties poetry.

=== Levant ===

Ancient literature of the Levant was written in the Northwest Semitic languages, a language group that contains the Aramaic language, as well as the Canaanite languages such as Phoenician and Hebrew. A corpus of Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions (or &quot;Northwest Semitic inscriptions&quot;) are the primary extra-Biblical source for the writings of the ancient Phoenicians, Hebrews and Arameans. These inscriptions occur on stone slabs, pottery ostraca, ornaments, and range from simple names to full texts.

The books that constitute the Hebrew Bible developed over roughly a millennium, with the oldest texts originating from about the eleventh or tenth centuries BCE. They are edited works, being collections of various sources intricately and carefully woven together. The Old Testament was compiled and edited by various authors over a period of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BC. The New Testament was an additional collection of books that supplemented the Hebrew Bible, consisting of the gospels that described Jesus and the epistles written by notable figures of early Christianity.

===Classical antiquity===
==== Ancient Greece ====
Early Greek literature was composed in dactylic hexameter. Homer is credited with the codification of epic poetry in Ancient Greece with the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey.&quot; Hesiod is credited with developing a literary tradition of poetry derived from catalogues and genealogies, such as the &quot;Megala Erga&quot; and the &quot;Theogony&quot;. Notable writers of religious literature also held similar prominence at the time, but these works have since been lost. Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who contributed to the development of lyric poetry and was widely popular in antiquity.

Ancient Greek plays originate from the chorus plays of Athens in the 6th century BC as a tradition to honor Dionysus, the god of theater and wine. Greek plays came to be associated with &quot;elaborate costumes, complex choreography, scenic architecture, and the mask&quot;. They were often structured as a tetralogy in which three tragedies were followed by a satyr play. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were known for their tragedies, while Aristophanes and Menander were known for their comedies. Sophocles is most well known for his play &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, which established an early example of literary irony.

Ancient Greek philosophy was developed as the foundation of Western philosophy. Thales of Miletus was the first person in recorded history to engage in Western philosophy. The Ancient Greek philosophical literature was advanced by Plato, who incorporated philosophical debates into dialogues with Socratic questioning. Aristotle, Plato&#x27;s student, wrote dozens of works on many scientific disciplines. Aristotle also developed early literary criticism and literary theory in his &quot;Poetics.&quot;

====Ancient Rome====
In the Roman Republic, literature took the form of tragedy, comedy, epic, and historical. Livius Andronicus is recognized as the originator of literature in the Latin language, and due to Rome&#x27;s influence, the development of Latin literature often extended beyond the traditional boundaries of Rome. Plautus was an influential playwright known for his comedies that emphasized humor and popular culture. The late republic saw the rise of Augustan literature and Classical Latin, which was primarily prose and included the works of Cicero and Sallust. Upon the formation of the Roman Empire, political commentary declined and prose went out of favor to be replaced by poetry. Poets such as Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Ovid are recognized as bringing about the Golden Age of Latin literature. Virgil&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Aeneid&quot; closely followed the formula established by Homer.

Prominent Latin authors that lived during the early empire included Pliny the Elder, Seneca the Younger, and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. As the Roman Empire grew, Latin literature increasingly came from Spain and Northern Africa. Historical works of the early empire included the epic &quot;Pharsalia&quot; by Lucan, which followed Caesar&#x27;s civil war, and the &quot;Annals&quot; of Tacitus, which recorded the events of the first century. &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius was written in the later Empire and is possibly the world&#x27;s oldest novel. The adoption of Christianity in the Roman Empire became apparent in Latin literature, most notably in the confessional writing of Augustine of Hippo, such as the &quot;Confessions&quot;.

===Ancient India===

Knowledge traditions in India handed down philosophical gleanings and theological concepts through the two traditions of Shruti and Smriti, meaning &quot;that which is learnt&quot; and &quot;that which is experienced&quot;, which included the Vedas. It is generally believed that the Puranas are the earliest philosophical writings in Indian history, although linguistic works on Sanskrit existed earlier than 1000 BC. Puranic works such as the Indian epics: Ramayana and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, have influenced countless other works, including Balinese Kecak and other performances such as shadow puppetry (wayang), and many European works. Pali literature has an important position in the rise of Buddhism. Classical Sanskrit literature flowers in the Maurya and Gupta periods, roughly spanning the 2nd century BC to the 8th century AD. Classical Tamil literature also emerged in the early historic period dating from 300 BC to 300 AD, and is the earliest secular literature of India, mainly dealing with themes such as love and war. The Gupta period in India sees the flowering of Sanskrit drama, classical Sanskrit poetry and the compilation of the Puranas.

==Post-classical (5th century–15th century)==
===Medieval Europe===

After the fall of Rome (in roughly 476), many of the literary approaches and styles invented by the Greeks and Romans fell out of favor in Europe. In the millennium or so that intervened between Rome&#x27;s fall and the Florentine Renaissance, medieval literature focused more and more on faith and faith-related matters, in part because the works written by the Greeks had not been preserved in Europe, and therefore there were few models of classical literature to learn from and move beyond. Although much had been lost to the ravages of time (and to catastrophe, as in the burning of the Library of Alexandria), many Greek works remained extant: they were preserved and copied carefully by Muslim scribes. What little there was became changed and distorted, with new forms beginning to develop from the distortions. Some of these distorted beginnings of new styles can be seen in the literature generally described as Matter of Rome, Matter of France and Matter of Britain.

Around 400 AD, the &quot;Prudenti Psychomachia&quot; began the tradition of allegorical tales. Poetry flourished, however, in the hands of the troubadours, whose courtly romances and &quot;chanson de geste&quot; amused and entertained the upper classes who were their patrons. The First Crusade in 1095 also affected literature. For instance the image of the knight would take on a different significance. The Islamic emphasis on scientific investigation and the preservation of the Greek philosophical writings would also affect European literature.

Hagiographies, or &quot;lives of the saints&quot;, were frequent among early medieval European texts. The writings of Bede—&quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;—and others continue the faith-based historical tradition begun by Eusebius in the early 4th century. Between Augustine and &quot;The Bible&quot;, religious authors had numerous aspects of Christianity that needed further explication and interpretation. Thomas Aquinas, more than any other single person, was able to turn theology into a kind of science, in part because he was heavily influenced by Aristotle, whose works were returning to Europe in the 13th century. Playwriting essentially ceased, except for the mystery plays and the passion plays that focused heavily on conveying Christian belief to the common people.

Latin continued to be used as a literary language in medieval Europe. Though it was also spoken, it was primarily learned and expressed through literature, and scientific literature was typically written in Latin. Christianity became increasingly prominent in medieval European literature, also written in Latin. Religious literature in other languages proliferated during the 13th century as those who were not educated in Latin sought religious literature that they could understand. Women in particular were not permitted to learn Latin, and an extensive body of religious literature in many languages was written by women at this time.

==== Medieval England ====
Early medieval literature in England was written in Old English, which is not mutually intelligible with modern English. Works of this time include the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Arthurian fantasy based on the legendary character of King Arthur. Literature in the modern English language began with Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century, known for &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

==== Medieval Italy ====
&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri was completed circa 1321. Organized into three parts called &quot;cantiche&quot;, &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; is a narrative poem that is regarded as a preeminent work in Italian literature. It follows Dante&#x27;s journey into three different realms of the dead, &quot;Inferno&quot; (Hell), &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (Purgatory), and &quot;Paradiso&quot; (Paradise), with the Roman poet Virgil and Beatrice, Dante&#x27;s idealized woman, guiding him. Though &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; was largely ignored by the literary world during and a while after its publication, it gained further acclaim in the English-speaking world after British Romanticist poet William Blake and other 19th century Romanticist writers &quot;rediscovered&quot; the poem, influencing later writers such as T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. The narrative reflects the medieval philosophy of the afterlife as it existed in the 14th century Western Church as well as established the Tuscan language as the standard Italian language. &quot;The Decameron&quot; by Giovanni Boccaccio was published in 1351, and it influenced European literature over the following centuries. Its framing device of ten individuals each telling ten stories introduced the term &quot;novella&quot; and inspired later works, including Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.

===Islamic world===


The most well known fiction from the Islamic world was &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), which was a compilation of many earlier folk tales told by the Persian Queen Scheherazade. The epic took form in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France.

====Arabic literature====

====Persian literature====
Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the national epic of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history and the longest epic poem ever written. From Persian culture the book which would, eventually, become the most famous in the west is the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. The Rubáiyát is a collection of poems by the Persian mathematician and astronomer Omar Khayyám (1048–1122). &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; means &quot;quatrains&quot;: verses of four lines. &quot;Amir Arsalan&quot; was also a popular mythical Persian story.

Examples of early Persian proto-science fiction include Al-Farabi&#x27;s &quot;Opinions of the residents of a splendid city&quot; about a utopian society, and elements such as the flying carpet.

====Ottoman literature====

===Post-classical Hebrew literature===
Medieval Jewish fiction often drew on ancient Jewish legends, and was written in a variety of languages including Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic. Liturgical Jewish poetry in Hebrew flourished in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries with the writings of Yose ben Yose, Yannai, and Eleazar Kalir Later Jewish poets in Spain, Provençal, and Italy wrote both religious and secular poems in Hebrew; particularly prominent poets were the Spanish Jewish poets Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi. In addition to poetry and fiction, medieval Jewish literature also includes philosophical literature, , ethical (musar) literature, legal (halakhic) literature, and commentaries on the Bible.

===Medieval India===
Sanskrit declines in the early 2nd millennium, late works such as the &quot;Kathasaritsagara&quot; dating to the 11th century, to the benefit of literature composed in Middle Indic vernaculars such as Old Bengali, Old Hindi.

===Mid-imperial China===
==== Sui and Tang dynasties ====
Lu Sidao, Xue Daoheng, and Yang Su were notable poets of the early Sui dynasty, with Yang moving away from the dominant traditions of Southern poetry. In the Sui and early Tang dynasties, literature was supported by the various emperors, who commissioned many works and wrote some of their own. Poetry in this period followed the Palace Style until it diverged with the work of the Four Paragons. Wang Changling and Li Bai are recognized among the great poets of High Tang. Landscape poetry and frontier poetry were both influential during the Tang dynasty. Tang poetry also included &quot;cí&quot;, a type of lyric poetry. Chinese poetry increased focus on politics, human suffering, and realism in the mid-Tang dynasty, such as in the works of Du Fu. Chinese poetry diverged into two schools in the early-9th century; poets such as Meng Jiao and Han Yu wrote about the unusual, while poets such as Bai Juyi and Yuan Zhen emphasized simplicity. The final years of the Tang dynasty saw the rise of lyric poetry and erotic poetry. Li Shangyin and Wen Tingyun were influential poets during this period.

Fictional narrative became prominent in the Tang dynasty, written with looser restrictions on form and length. Fiction in the mid-Tang period focused primarily on social commentary and romantic love, and notable authors during this time included Shen Jiji and Yuan Zhen. Collections of stories became more common in the Late Tang period, particularly those of chivalrous tales by authors such as Pei Xing. Popular literature of the time included transformation text, vernacular story, sutra, song, and rhapsody. The style of prose was not initially developed during the Tang dynasty. Parallel prose remained popular in the early Tang dynasty, though writers such as Li Bai moved away from strict form that was common at the time. Han Yu promoted the use of classical prose in the style of ancient Confucisionist works. Printing began in Tang dynasty China. A copy of the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;, a key Buddhist text, found sealed in a cave in China in the early 20th century, is the oldest known dated printed book, with a printed date of 868. The method used was block printing.

==== Song and Jin dynasties ====
Printing first became widespread in the Northern Song. Northern Song lyric poetry was developed by Yan Shu, Liu Yong, and Zhang Xian, and it became a popular pastime among the lower class. Ouyang Xiu developed the popular style of lyric poetry while Yan Jidao developed the refined style. Lyric poetry contrasted with the more formal &quot;shi&quot; poetry that followed canonical literary forms and was used by scholars. Political pressures heavily influenced the poetry of scholars in the Northern Song, as proficiency in older styles was a requirement for scholars to enter into civil service. Politics and Confucianism in particular increasingly influenced poetry in Northern Song. Poets such as Mei Yaochen and Su Shunquin developed the style of poetry used in the Middle Northern Song. Ouyang Xiu was a prominent literary scholar in Northern Song that refined the mainstream literary style of the time, and Su Shi is said to have perfected it.

Chen Yuyi defined the style of Early Southern Song poetry. Lu You was a poet in the Middle Southern Song that wrote extensively about political life in civil service and frustration with the dynasty&#x27;s weakened position in the Jin–Song Wars, while Xin Qiji was a Middle Southern Song poet that wrote on similar topics from a military perspective. Poetic style did not advance significantly in the Late Southern Song, though Yan Yu&#x27;s &quot;Canglang Shihua&quot; was influential in poetic theory. Classical poetry in the Early Jin emphasized emotion, while elegance was emphasized later in the Jin dynasty.

Popular fiction was typically performed in the Song dynasty, made up primarily of small talk fiction and historical tales. Classical prose fiction in the Song dynasty often sacrificed linguistic quality and imagination for plain language and moral teaching. &quot;Zaju&quot; variety plays developed during the Song dynasty as a predecessor to drama. The scientist, statesman, and general Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) was the author of the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; (1088), a large book of scientific literature that included the oldest description of the magnetized compass. During the Song dynasty, there was also the enormous historical work of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, compiled into 294 volumes of 3 million written Chinese characters by the year 1084 AD. The Jin dynasty saw advances in popular literature, including &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;.

==== Yuan dynasty ====
Drama was significantly developed as a literary form in the Yuan dynasty and made up much of the era&#x27;s fictional works. Variety plays were influential in the Early Yuan period, with Khanbaliq, present-day Beijing, as the cultural center of variety plays. As the 14th century began, variety play writers moved to Hangzhou, though variety plays declined and they did not achieve the same prominence. The &quot;nanxi&quot; was developed as a genre of play at the same time, reflecting the unique political life of the Yuan dynasty in which civil service, infidelity, and inter-clan politics all played a major role. &quot;Tale of the Pipa&quot; by Gao Ming was an influential &quot;nanxi&quot; drama. &quot;Qu&quot; was a common type of poetry in the Yuan dynasty that was used both as a standalone work and part of the structure of a play.

Two of the earliest Chinese novels, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot;, first appeared in the Yuan dynasty. Poetry in the Yuan dynasty remained the primary form of expression for classical writers, though the Song tradition of intellectual poetry was replaced by poetry that expressed strong emotion. Northern Yuan poetry was influenced by the works of Yuan Haowen while Southern Yuan poetry was influenced by Yan Yu.he was a very honerable man.

===Classical and feudal Japan===
Japanese literature first diverged from Chinese literature around the eighth century. &quot;Fudoki&quot; were eighth century records that were typically written in Chinese and documented both historical and mythological stories. Folk ballads were also common, including those recorded in the &quot;fudoki&quot; and musical ballads. These ballads were written to be chanted and often had a syllabic structure, with the &quot;tanka&quot; being highly regarded in particular. The writing of &quot;waka&quot; poetry became increasingly important in the Heian period as it became a necessary skill for the aristocracy in both social and courtship settings.

The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; is the oldest collection of Japanese poetry, written in Japanese with Chinese characters through &quot;Man&#x27;yōgana&quot; and compiling &quot;waka&quot; poetry from the fifth to eighth centuries. The &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; was a collection of ninth century &quot;waka&quot; poetry compiled by imperial command. While the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; was varied in the classes and professions of its writers, the poems of the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; were limited to those of aristocratic poets. &quot;The Tales of Ise&quot; is a collection of loosely connected poems and narratives based on the life of Ariwara no Narihira.

&quot;Utsubo Monogatari&quot; and &quot;Ochikubo Monogatari&quot; were early prose works from the 10th century that realistically portrayed the lives of the aristocracy, and the former is sometimes considered to be the first full-length novel. At the same time, women of the aristocracy began keeping diaries that followed aristocratic life. &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; was the next major prose work in Japan, written in the 11th century. Its use of realism and romantic idealization inspired later works of Heian period prose fiction, including historical works such as &quot;Eiga Monogatari&quot; and &quot;Ōkagami&quot;; romantic novels such as &quot;The Tale of Sagoromo&quot;, &quot;Yoru no Nezame&quot;, &quot;Hamamatsu Chūnagon Monogatari&quot;, and &quot;Torikaebaya Monogatari&quot;; and short story collections such as &quot;Tsutsumi Chūnagon Monogatari&quot;. While these stories typically portrayed the aristocracy, &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot; was written in the 12th century, compiling roughly one thousand stories from different walks of life in Japan, China, and India. Japanese literature expanded beyond the aristocracy in the 13th century and became increasingly accessible to lower classes, often through the narration of religious texts such as &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; by blind priests. In the 14th and 15th centuries, poetry such as &quot;renga&quot; and drama such as &quot;noh&quot; and &quot;kyōgen&quot; was written by professional writers under the patronage of the court, temples, or local lords.

=== Southeast Asia ===
The literary tradition of Java and the Kawi language is most well known for &quot;kakawin&quot; poetry. These were narrative poems based on the traditions of Sanskrit poetry, and they often incorporated religious elements. The oldest surviving &quot;kakawin&quot; is &quot;Kakawin Ramayana&quot; from the 9th century, a Javanese localization of the Sanskrit &quot;Bhaṭṭikāvya&quot;.

=== Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica ===
Mesoamerican literature was typically recorded on codices, though most surviving codices of pre-Columbian literature were written in the Latin alphabet to preserve oral tradition after colonization. Nahuatl literature was divided into , which included song and poetry, and , which included prose works of history and discourses. The were divine hymns that were sung to praise the gods, while other Nahuatl poetry was sung in celebration of life and friendship, to honor warriors, or to pose philosophical questions. King Nezahualcoyotl of Tetzcoco was a notable poet and songwriter.

Literature in the Mayan languages was closely related to oral tradition in which writing guided memorized passages that were often performed. It was highly symbolic and incorporated heavy use of wordplay. Metaphor and imagery involving the natural world was also common. Mayan literature was often religious in nature, including information on religious practices, divination, and the gods. Much of this literature was later condemned as heretical and destroyed by Christian priests. The Dresden Codex, the Paris Codex, and the Madrid Codex are the only surviving pre-Columbian Mayan codices. Notable surviving Mayan texts include the Popol Vuh, the Chilam Balam, and the Annals of the Cakchiquels that describe the religious beliefs of Mesoamerican cultures.

==Early modern (15th century–18th century)==

=== Early modern Europe ===

The Renaissance encompassed much of European culture during the early modern period. This period saw a renewed interested in the classical works of Ancient Greece and Rome and a proliferation of artistic and scientific achievement. Literature, as with most forms of art in the early modern period, was financed through patronage by nobles. Fiction writing was not considered a profession in its own right and was typically undertaken by those who already possessed independent wealth. The invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century revolutionized European literature. The production of printed books allowed for more uniformity in literary works and the spread of literacy. Religious literature in particular was affected by the printing press, as churches funded and involved themselves in the printing process. Literary criticism also developed as literary works became more accessible.

The form of writing now commonplace across the world—the novel—originated from the early modern period and grew in popularity in the next century. Before the modern novel became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when &quot;novelty&quot; began to appear in the style of the epic poem. Petrarch popularized the sonnet as a poetic form; Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; made romance acceptable in prose as well as poetry; François Rabelais rejuvenates satire with &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;; Michel de Montaigne single-handedly invented the essay and used it to catalog his life and ideas. Perhaps the most controversial and important work of the time period was a treatise printed in Nuremberg, entitled &quot;De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium&quot;: in it, the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus removed the Earth from its privileged position in the universe, which had far-reaching effects, not only in science, but in literature and its approach to humanity, hierarchy, and truth.

Plays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe&#x27;s stages in the early modern period. William Shakespeare is the most notable of the early modern playwrights, but numerous others made important contributions, including Molière, Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson. From the 16th to the 18th century Commedia dell&#x27;arte performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dell&#x27;arte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the improvisation were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of jesters and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (&quot;en travesti&quot;) but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th century.

==== British literature ====

As England grew to become a world power, focus on England itself appeared in English literature. This tradition began with &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; by Edmund Spenser, written through the 1590s in honor of Queen Elizabeth I. Metaphysical poetry developed in the 17th century, led by John Donne, most well known for his love poems. The Augustan literature movement developed in the 18th century, led by Samuel Johnson, seeking to imitate the classical tastes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Augustan critics condemned metaphysical poetry for its frivolity and subversion. John Milton wrote the epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to create an English Christian epic that rivaled those of Homer and Virgil. During the rule of Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s, the arts were restricted along Puritan ideals. This censorship contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth of England and the restoration of the British monarchy. Under the restored monarchy, the arts were freer than they had been previously, and King Charles II became a patron of the theater.

William Shakespeare was a famed playwright in the late-16th and early-17th centuries, and he is generally recognized as the greatest author in the English language. He is known for his comedies, his dramas, and his histories, as well as his use of blank verse, sonnet, and soliloquy. Shakespeare&#x27;s historical plays ignored historical accuracy and often contemplated royal succession, reflecting the concerns of his day regarding the succession of Elizabeth I. Early English novels include &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; by John Bunyan and &quot;Oroonoko&quot; by Aphra Behn, both published in the 1680s. Bunyan introduced into English literature ideas of individualism and the quest of personal fulfillment. Behn used her writing as social criticism to question the Atlantic slave trade. &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; by Daniel Defoe is considered to be the first modern English novel, written as a celebration of the social mobility introduced by capitalism. The book was written in a realistic style, and the original edition was marketed as a true autobiography without any mention of Defoe as an author. Jonathan Swift introduced the fantasy novel to English literature, most notably through Gulliver&#x27;s Travels, which was similarly marketed as a true story.

==== French literature ====
&quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; was written by François Rabelais in five parts throughout the mid-16th century. It was an early influence of the novel, using an informal style and subversive humor.

The 17th century in France is known as the Grand Siècle (Great Century). The most famous French authors, beside playwrights, include Jean de La Fontaine and Charles Perrault known primarily for their fables.

==== Italian literature ====
The Italian Renaissance was the starting point of what would become the European Renaissance over the following centuries.

The earliest work considered an opera in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597. It is &quot;Dafne&quot;, (now lost) written by Jacopo Peri for an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the &quot;Camerata&quot;.

==== Spanish literature ====
&quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes was published in the early-17th century and is recognized as an early novel. It was a picaresque novel that parodied chivalric romance. The 16th and 17th centuries are recognized as the Spanish Golden Age.

=== Early modern Islamic world ===
=== Early modern East Asia ===

==== Qing dynasty ====
Printing became prominent in China during the Ming dynasty in the beginning of the 16th century. By this time, urban areas were highly literate, assisted by the availability of paper in China. Written works were divided into four categories, including classics, histories, philosophy, and belles-lettres. Among the lower class, aria and folk songs were common, often performed by entertainers. Literature was suppressed by the Ming dynasty&#x27;s founding Hongwu Emperor, and writers that did not comply with his rule were executed, beginning a decline in Chinese literature in the 14th and 15th centuries. &quot;Jiandeng Xinhua&quot; by Qu You was a collection of supernatural and &quot;chuanqi&quot; stories, and it was one of the few works that maintained influence despite the suppression of literature. Variety plays were the most common type of drama in the Early Ming period, and Prince Zhu Youdun was the most influential playwright of the time. A literary revival took place in the Middle Ming period. The revival of poetry was led by literary groups such as the Four Talents of Suzhou and the Earlier Seven Masters and continued by groups such as the Tang-Song School and the Latter Seven Masters. Xu Wei became an influential poet and prose writer after his death for his use of authenticity and his rejection of the preceding literary schools. Early Chinese novels were developed in the Middle Ming period, including works such as &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

In the Late Ming period, literature increasingly focused on the role of individuals within a society, beginning with the works of Li Zhi. Chinese philosophy developed humanist elements that challenged subservience to community and imperial hierarchy. The Gong&#x27;an School, led by the Three Yuan Brothers, produced literature of &quot;natural sensibility&quot; that favored delight and simplicity over reason and ambition. The Jingling School, led by Zhong Xing and Tan Yuanchun, was a response to the Gong&#x27;an School that accepted the concept of &quot;natural sensibility&quot; but rejected the carefree style of Gong&#x27;an poetry. Novels became more common in the Late Ming period as book publishers emerged. &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; is recognized as a great novel of the Late Ming period and the first novel to follow day-to-day life of commoners. &quot;Huaben&quot; stories were also common in this period, such as those collected by Feng Menglong in the &quot;Three Words&quot; and by Ling Mengchu in &quot;Slapping the Table in Amazement&quot;. Dramas became more common in the Late Ming period as it became fashionable for the aristocracy to entertain guests with private theater troupes. Tang Xianzu was an influential playwright of this period, and the Wujiang School led by Shen Jing was responsible for expanding upon drama as an artform with emphasis on its musical elements.

==== Japanese literature ====

Wood block printing became popular in the 17th century, and over a thousand books were sold annually by 1670. By the 17th century, increasing social divisions separated drama, with &quot;samurai&quot; watching &quot;noh&quot; and &quot;chōnin&quot; watching &quot;kabuki&quot;. Writers typically dedicated themselves to the government, to a specific clan, to the commons, or to a reclusive lifestyle. Ishikawa Jōzan was an influential 17th century poet.

==== Korean literature ====

Korean literature diverged from Chinese literature in the Joseon dynasty. The &quot;akjang&quot;, the &quot;sijo&quot;, and the &quot;gasa&quot; are forms of lyric composition that were popular in the Joseon dynasty. &quot;Yongbieocheonga&quot; was a major collection of poems produced in the 1440s. Korean vernacular fiction was developed by Heo Gyun at the beginning of the 17th century with &quot;Hong Gildong jeon&quot;. The structure of &quot;Hong Gildong jeon&quot; was used to develop heroic fiction. &quot;The Cloud Dream of the Nine&quot; was written by Kim Man-jung to reflect historical and philosophical changes of the time using dream structure. &quot;Pansori&quot; fiction was developed in the early 18th century.

=== Early modern Southeast Asia ===
=== Early modern India ===
=== Pre-colonial Africa ===
== Late modern (18th century–20th century) ==
=== Late modern Europe ===
The 18th century was Age of Enlightenment and its most important authors are Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and Adam Smith. The second half of the century sees the beginnings of Romanticism with Goethe. In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;, with its &quot;Fin de siècle&quot; retrospectively appeared as a &quot;golden age&quot; of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Modernist literature was written from roughly 1900 to 1940.

In Britain, the 19th century was dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel. Charles Dickens, perhaps the most famous novelist in the history of English literature, was active during this time and contributed to the novel&#x27;s emergence as the leading literary genre of Victorian England.

In Romania, the first novels were plublished in the 19th century by Dimitrie Bolintineanu and Nicolae Filimon. During the same century, one of the most-known Romanian poets was Mihai Eminescu.

In Denmark, the early 19th century Golden Age produced prolific literary authors such as Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen.

In Germany, the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe&#x27;s activity, covering the first third of the century. The conservative &quot;Biedermeier&quot; style conflicts with the radical &quot;Vormärz&quot; in the turbulent period separating the end of the Napoleonic wars from the Revolutions of 1848.

=== United States ===
Literature of the American Revolution included &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot; by Thomas Jefferson and &quot;Common Sense&quot; by Thomas Paine. &quot;The Power of Sympathy&quot; by William Hill Brown was the first American novel, written in a realistic style with a clear moral message. Judith Sargent Murray is credited with establishing American feminism through her essays and poetry. The United States quickly achieved widespread literacy in the early-19th century, and many authors made fiction-writing their primary source of income. Washington Irving set precedent for comic literature and short stories, and he established the Knickerbocker School that wrote affectionately of New York. James Fenimore Cooper similarly set the precedent for American sea stories, novels of manners, political satire, dynastic novels, and frontier stories. Edgar Allan Poe was highly influential in fiction writing, poetry, and essays, and he is particularly credited for his contributions to Gothic fiction and mystery fiction as genres. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote moralistic stories such as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; inspired by colonial-era Puritan literature. Herman Melville explored human contradiction in sea stories such as &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, though his work did not become influential until the 1920s. William Cullen Bryant was credited as the &quot;founding father of American poetry&quot;, Walt Whitman is celebrated as defining the essence of America in his day with his poetry collection &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. Emily Dickinson was refused to publish her poetry during her lifetime, but her works of this period were later acclaimed.

Transcendentalism evolved as a philosophical school in the early-19th century, and authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson contributed to transcendentalist literature. Many works were written on the topic of slavery in the early United States, including &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Freed slaves such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs also wrote autobiographies that promoted the cause of abolitionism. Native American literature in the early-19th century was in conflict between retaining traditional elements and incorporating elements of contemporary American literature. Realism and naturalism became popular in the United States in the late-19th century. Mark Twain saw wide acclaim for his novels, including &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Regionalism developed in which different literary traditions evolved in the West, the Midwest, the South, and New England. African American and Native American literature also evolved as distinct literary traditions.

A movement of backlash against small-town and middle-class values emerged at the beginning of the 20th century, including authors such as Theodore Dreiser, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, and Sherwood Anderson. Civil rights literature of the early-20th century was written by authors such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and James Weldon Johnson. American poetry expanded significantly during the 20th century, introducing or incorporating modernist poetry traditions such as Imagism, Vorticism, and Objectivism. Poets such as Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, and Robinson Jeffers were influential in developing poetic form. Authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner analyzed their own places in American society through modernist novels, while authors such as Thomas Wolfe and John Steinbeck sought to find a future identity for the United States. Counter-movements emerged in response to modernism, including traditionalism in the South and populism in Chicago literature. The early-20th century also saw the emergence of American drama distinct from that of Europe. Popular genre fiction at the time included westerns and detective fiction.

=== Canada ===

Early Canadian novels adapted the literary trends of Europe. &quot;The History of Emily Montague&quot; was the first Canadian novel, published in 1769. The aftermath of the Seven Years&#x27; War was a significant influence on Canadian literature in the 18th and 19th centuries as French Canada was transferred to the British. Popular novels, such as those of Julia Catherine Beckwith, came about in the early-19th century with an emphasis on day-to-day experiences rather than grand narrative. Nature featured prominently in Canadian literature by the mid-19th century. Edward Hartley Dewart was a prominent figure in early Canadian poetry, having published the first Canadian poetry anthology in 1864. He identified the formation of a Canadian literary body as a part of a conflict between colonial origins and a distinct Canadian identity. Octave Crémazie led the French Canadian literature movement in the 1860s. Notable Canadian poets of this period included Charles Sangster, Alexander McLachlan, Charles Heavysege, and the Confederation Poets. Victorian poetry remained prominent in Canada through the early-20th century, though international modernist movements such as Imagism gained influence after World War I. Poets such as Arthur Stringer and Frank Oliver Call lead a free verse movement in the 1910s and 1920s.

=== Latin America ===
Latin American literature diverged from European literature and began as its own literary tradition at the start of the 19th century. The primary change was in the subject matter and theme of the literature, while the form remained relatively European. It began with an individualist trend associated with the Latin American independence movements that were developing at the time. Within this movement developed the individual literature of each Latin American country as they formed their own national identities. Andrés Bello is recognized as a founder of modern literature in Hispanic America, and he is credited for popularizing Romanticism in the region. The balance of national and continental literary identities was a major issue in early Latin American literature, particularly within the Spanish language.

=== Late modern Islamic world ===
=== Late modern East Asia ===
==== Qing dynasty and Republic of China ====
The Qing dynasty saw the return of prose literature as a vehicle primarily for Confucian teaching, and individualist literature declined. The Three Masters of Jiangdong were the most prominent poets during the transition from Ming to Qing. Wang Shizhen led poetry trends in the Early Qing period through the expression of sentimentality through imagery and prosody rather than vocabulary, particularly with his &quot;Autumn Willows: Four Poems&quot;. Song lyrics also reemerged as a popular poetic form as literary critics viewed the individual aria as unrefined. Heroic fiction was adapted to popular novels in the Early Qing period. Supernatural fiction also became popular, including &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot; by Pu Songling.

In the Middle Qing period, Shen Deqian, Weng Fanggang, and Yuan Mei each formed new trends in poetry in opposition to the style of Wang Shizhen. &quot;Pianwen&quot; became popular among prose writers in the Middle Qing period in opposition to the Tongcheng school. &quot;Six Records of a Floating Life&quot; was an autobiography by Shen Fu that emphasized direct language and emotional appeal over style. Performing arts of the Middle Qing period included the northern &quot;guci&quot; drum lyric and the southern &quot;tanci&quot; strummed lyric, the latter of which was often written by women poets. Novels of the Middle Qing period included &quot;The Scholars&quot; and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, both of which eschewed popular taste in favor of philosophy. Drama went out of fashion among the Qing literati, though theatrical performances remained common entertainment for the public. In the Late Qing period, Western culture was a significant influence on Chinese society. The Tongguang school was popular among adherents to typical Chinese poetry, styled after that of the Song dynasty. Chivalrous novels telling the tales of folk heroes, political novels that were critical of the falling Qing government, and genre fiction all became popular in the final years of the Qing dynasty.

Literature in the Republic of China reflected the societal changes brought about by the 1911 Revolution. Chinese literature broke away from classical tradition and literary restrictions with the New Literature Movement in 1919, beginning with works such as &quot;Experiments&quot; by Hu Shih, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; by Lu Xun, and &quot;The Goddess&quot; by Guo Moruo. The May Fourth Movement was a further cultural movement that promoted the use of vernacular Chinese. Advocates of liberal reform in China supported these shifts in literary tradition to challenge imperial institutions, and these works typically supported humanism and individualism. A refutation of individualism emerged in response at the onset of the Chinese Civil War, and revolutionary literature was spread in support of the Chinese Red Army.

== Contemporary (20th century–21st century) ==
Contemporary literature is defined as literature written after the end of World War II in 1945. Postmodern literature was written from roughly 1945 to 1980. Popular literature developed its own genres such as fantasy and science fiction. Ignored by mainstream literary criticism, these genres develop their own establishments and critical awards, such as the &quot;Nebula Award&quot; (since 1965), the &quot;British Fantasy Award&quot; (since 1971) or the &quot;Mythopoeic Awards&quot; (since 1971).

<text>Warner is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2000 census, the town had a total population of 627. Hemlock, now a ghost town in Warner, was once a little mill town that grew around a dam below the confluence of the Black and Popple rivers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.0 square miles (90.6 km2), of which, 34.9 square miles (90.3 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.37%) is water.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Warner was first surveyed in June of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in November of 1847 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
This township is low gently rolling Soil about Second rate and heavy timbered with W. Pine Sugar Lyn Elm Birch (?) under growth Prickly Ash(?) then Gooseberry (?) along the Streams (?) (?) part of the township there is Considerable good Pine. Black River runs through this township from North to South Swift water and like a torrent rough(?) rocky channel and numerous Mill sites on it. Considering every thing this township will Soon be Settled with a heavy population. Plenty of good routes(?) through(?) the(?) township(?). 

An 1873 map of Clark County showed one road, reaching up from Neillsville through Greenwood and Warner, across the Popple River and into what would become Longwood. Though the road followed the course of modern Highway 73, this was a dirt wagon road.

In 1879 the Black River Improvement Company built a &quot;flooding dam&quot; below the confluence of the Black and Popple rivers, which could be opened to flush logs down the river when the natural floods were insufficient. Frederick Limprecht and N.H. Withee powered a gristmill from this dam, and Withee built a sawmill with an &quot;upright and rotary saw.&quot; The following year C.G. Reul added a shingle mill. Limprecht built the first home in what would become the hamlet of Hemlock.

By 1880 the Town of Warner was six miles from north to south and eighteen miles across, reaching from the west edge of Clark County through the modern town of Warner. The 1880 plat map shows seven structures in Hemlock, a school a half mile to the east, and a &quot;hotel&quot; a mile up the Popple River. Much of Warner&#x27;s land was owned in large blocks by logging operations and land speculators, with C.C. Washburn, N.H. Withee, and W.H. Mead holding the largest share. Only a few roads had been added east of the Black River, mostly in the southeast corner north of Greenwood. West of the river, early wagon road segments of Century Road, Sidney Avenue, Capital Road, Riplinger Road and County O were in place. Farmers had begun to settle along these roads, especially in the south, and other schools had appeared: a mile and a half northeast of Greenwood, near the future crossing of Century Road and School Avenue, where Capitol Avenue crosses County O, and north of where Popple River Road crosses O. A &quot;German church&quot; had also appeared where Century Avenue now crosses O.

An 1890 promotional pamphlet described Hemlock: &quot;The little village of Hemlock, on Black River... has two large mills, one flour mill and one lumber, shingle and lath mill... Hemlock is the northern terminus of the telephone line which extends south to La Crosse, and east to the towns of the Wisconsin Central Line.&quot; At that time, Hemlock was on a daily stage line which ran from Neillsville up through Hemlock and Warner to Longwood and then Withee.

By 1893 not much had changed. Warner was still eighteen miles wide. Much of the town was still owned in large chunks by loggers and speculators, with J.J. Hogan a new major owner. Some of the wagon roads had been extended and more settlers had appeared along those roads. A sawmill had appeared on the map at Hemlock. 

By 1906, the eastern 12 miles of Warner were split off into the Town of Mead, leaving Warner with its current six by six-mile footprint. More roads had been added, and many more settlers, with 80-acre farms common. T.O. Withee now held most of the large tracts of land, but J.S. Owen Lumber Co. had appeared on the map. Another sawmill had appeared on the Black River just north of Greenwood, and the Fairchild and Northeastern Railroad cut across the southeast corner of Warner, heading from Willard toward Owen.

A 1914 flood of the Black River washed out Hemlock&#x27;s dam and mill. A 1919 history described Hemlock as an &quot;abandoned village in Warner Township, deriving its name from an island of hemlock trees now washed away... Nothing now remains but the ruined dam, and the abandoned buildings.&quot;

The plat map of Warner from around 1920 shows the modern road grid nearly complete and most of Warner settled. Three cheese factories had appeared: one east of Hemlock where Kingston Road now crosses highway 73, another where Sidney Avenue now meets Century Road, and another where County O meets MM. The transition from logging to agriculture was well underway.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 627 people, 195 households, and 164 families residing in the town. The population density was 18.0 people per square mile (6.9/km2). There were 208 housing units at an average density of 6.0 per square mile (2.3/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.41% White, 1.28% Asian, and 0.32% from two or more races.

<text>Weston is a town in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 638 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated communities of Christie and Globe are located in the town.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.3 square miles (94.0 km2), of which, 36.1 square miles (93.6 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.36%) is water.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Weston was first surveyed in June 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. Then in October of the same year another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. This survey produced a map which shows some sort of road already arcing roughly along the course of future highway 73 on the high ground east of the Black River, an &quot;Indian Camp&quot; on the east bank of the Black in sections 21 or 22, and a cabin on the west bank in section 4. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township is well Situated for agricultural purposes(?) the Central and South Western parts are gently rolling and heavily timbered with Sugar Lind White and Black Oak timber. the SE part has an extensive body of White Pine timber on it of the best quality for this country the NW part is low &amp; wet but good timber. Perry&#x27;s Creek which runs through the Eastern part of this township has a Saw Mill on the NE 1/4 Section 35 and many(?) more might be built on this and Black river There is a mill site(?) almost any where on Black river Current rapid &amp; rock bottom all along Some Strong rapids(?)&quot;

An 1873 map of Clark County showed a &quot;highway&quot; reaching up from Neillsville through Weston to Greenwood and beyond. Though that road somewhat followed the course of modern Highway 73, it was a dirt wagon road. Another wagon road ran east from 73 along what is now County H for a mile, then wandered south, crossing Cawley Creek. The Town of Weston at that time extended much farther to the west than today, but the map shows no development west of the Black River.

By 1880 Weston consisted of the modern townships of Seif and Weston. The plat map from that year shows more wagon roads. East of the Black River, in addition to the road along 73, forerunners of Suckow Road, Heintown Road, County H, River Avenue, Panther Creek Road, Schofield Road, and Fremont Road were taking shape. Along these wagon roads were sprinkled about 30 settler homesteads. The Christie Post Office is marked on the map, a rural school where Panther Creek Road crosses 73, another school where Schofield Road crosses 73, a sawmill a mile west of there on Cawley Creek, and some sort of &quot;Hotel&quot; where Fremont Road crosses 73. West of the Black, roads and settlers were thinner, with forerunners of H and G and Resewood Avenue drawn in, along with some roads that no longer exist. A rural school was where H now meets Reesewood and another where Chili Road now crosses G. A dozen settlers&#x27; homes were marked west of the Black, but much of the land there was still in large blocks, owned by lumbermen and speculators, with the largest shares held by Blakeslee &amp; Austin, Thayer and Kingman, and Samuel Marsh.

By 1890 the Neillsville-to-Withee stage passed through Weston each day, following the dirt road that would become modern highway 73.

By 1893 more roads had been added on both sides of the Black, and more settler homes lining those roads. The plat map from that year shows a new school where 73 now passes Christie Mound. The map shows a new mill, church, and cemetery at Globe. Large chunks of unsettled land were still held by Davis and Starr Lumber Company and Coburn..

By 1906 Weston had its current six by six mile footprint, with Seif split off as a separate township. More roads had been added, and many more settlers. The plat map shows a new sawmill where County G now meets Fremont Road.

Christie is an unincorporated community in Weston on Highway 73 just south of Christie Mound. The 1918 &quot;History of Clark County&quot; described it at that time: &quot;Christie is located on the old tote road, between Neillsville and Greenwood, and for years was an important postoffice in the county. It now has a store, two churches and a school.&quot;
Globe was another small rural community that developed a few miles west of Christie to serve local farmers. The 1918 &quot;History of Clark County&quot; described Globe as &quot;...ten miles north of Neillsville in the center of a prosperous farming community. It has a creamery, a large German Lutheran Church and school, and a store.&quot;

By 1920 Weston was largely settled - even west of the river. The plat map shows a cheese factory on what is now Panther Creek Road south of Christie. The transition from logging to agriculture was well underway.

<text>Cambria is a village in Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 777 at the 2020 census, 767 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1844, two brothers, John and Samuel Langdon, settled on the site. Samuel P. Langdon built a sawmill on a branch of Duck Creek, the other opened a small stock of merchandise. They surveyed and platted four blocks, and called the village Florence. But the mill dominated the landscape in those days, and the settlement around it was called Langdon&#x27;s Mills.

The settlement had just begun when about fifty Welshmen, with their wives and children, came from North Wales, many from Dolwyddelan. Morris J. Rowlands, a son of one of the colonists, wrote in 1912,

Early in the summer of 1845 several families from North Wales met accidentally at Liverpool, England, seeking passage as immigrants to the United States of America. On the 17th day of July they sailed from Liverpool harbor on board a sailing vessel named the Republic, and after a voyage of six weeks and two days arrived safely in New York City on the 30th of August, 1845...

After arriving in New York, a number of families whose male members were quarrymen in the old country, went to the slate quarries of New York and Vermont, but the majority of them turned their faces &#x27;Westward,&#x27; a word taken as their motto before leaving their native land.

The next portion of the journey from New York to Albany was made on a steamboat. From Buffalo they took passage over the lakes on board of a steamboat named Wisconsin, the name possibly being the means of drawing them to that particular boat; for that state was their &#x27;promised land.&#x27; After a stormy voyage on the lakes they arrived at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the 16th day of September, where a portion of them landed, and on the 17th at Racine, where the remainder left the boat.

On the 24th of September, having previously agreed upon them, Robert Closs, David D. Roberts, John R. Rowlands Sr., Evan Edwards and Jabez Lloyd left their families at the places mentioned, and were joined by E. B. Williams, William R. Williams, John O. Jones and John Edwards (single men). The party then started on foot in search of a suitable place on which to locate, traveling westward over the eastern part of the state, and passing through the village of Fox Lake, where a branch land office was located... They entered into Columbia, then called Portage County, about four miles north of the present site of the village of Randolph, arriving foot-sore and weary on Saturday evening, September 27th...

...[T]hey continued their westward course until they came to a point on the Fox River near the center of Section 16, Township 13, Range 11. There they discontinued for the first time their westward course and turned south, passing over Portage Prairie...

After crossing Duck Creek the party entered South Prairie, to which they took quite a fancy, and after traveling over the land, examining the quality of the soil, locating the timber land and investigating the source of water supply, late in the afternoon they walked up to the highest point, which was about half a mile southwest of Zion&#x27;s Church in Springvale, and there sat down on the green grass deliberating over the situation and comparing notes on the different localities through which they had passed during the week. Viewing the beautiful landscape before them and stretching in splendor for miles in every direction under the variable-colored rays of the setting sun, they deliberately decided to make that locality their place of future abode, hoping that they were thus forming a nucleus around which their countrymen in the future would gather to form a Welsh colony.

After deciding on the location, they prepared to return, calling first at the Fox Lake land office to enter their claims. Then, returning to their families at Milwaukee and Racine, they immediately prepared to move onto their farms, coming over in covered emigrant wagons — &#x27;prairie schooners&#x27; — and by the middle of October they were all on their places, housed in what people nowadays would call &#x27;miserable shanties,&#x27; but to them, after their wearisome journey, they were &#x27;comfortable homes.&#x27; Facing the winter of 1845–46, the settlement contained in round numbers, including children, fifty-three persons, composed of nine families and seven single men.

Cambria was described as, &quot;an outpost of Dolwyddelan&quot;, in an article published posthumously by J. Glyn Davies, a descendant of John Jones, Talysarn, whose brothers and sisters had emigrated to Cambria. In the article, he records that as a young man in 1898, he had visited Cambria to meet his kindred and found it was still a Welsh-speaking community which maintained its links with Wales.

In 1848 the Langdons raised a frame for a gristmill, but they had exhausted their means in their sawmill and store, and were unable to purchase the necessary machinery to operate it. In the spring of 1849 a Mr. Bell appeared and advanced money for that purpose, taking a mortgage upon the Langdon property as security. In consequence of nonpayment of the debt, the property passed into his hands, and the new owner surveyed and platted quite a large addition to the original site. In order to perpetuate his name he called the village Bellville.

Bell continued to operate the mill until 1851, when he disposed of all his holdings to John Jones and Evan Edwards. However, the new proprietors of the village, as well as the Welshmen who had settled there, were not pleased with the name Bellville, and by them it was changed to Cambria, the Latin name for Wales, probably on account of the Welsh settlers. The town was incorporated in 1866. Little growth was attained until the completion of the railroad through the place in 1857, and it has never had a rapid development.

The Didion Milling Co. plant explosion killed five workers, injured 14 others and reduced the facility to rubble on May 31, 2017. The company was fined more than $1.8 million by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company agreed in 2023 to plead guilty to federal charges that employees at the plant falsified logbooks inspectors use to determine whether the plant was handling corn dust safely and complying with dust-cleaning rules from 2015 until May 2017. At least seven employees have pleaded guilty or been convicted of charges including concealing environmental violations, lying to investigators and falsifying cleaning logs. The corn products were produced for food and beverage manufacturers that require sanitation for food safety as excessive accumulation of grain dust can cause food safety problems besides the explosion risk.

<doc id="138875" wikidata="Q260619" url="?curid=138875" title="Portage, Wisconsin">
<text>Portage is a city in and the county seat of Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 10,581 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Columbia County. It is part of the Madison metropolitan area.

Portage was named for the Fox–Wisconsin Waterway, a portage between the Fox River and the Wisconsin River, which was recognized by Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet during their discovery of a route to the Mississippi River in 1673. The city&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Where the North Begins.&quot;

== History ==

The Native American tribes that once lived here, and later the European traders and settlers, took advantage of the lowlands between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers as a natural &quot;portage&quot;. This is reflected in indigenous names for the town, such as the Menominee name &quot;Kahkāmohnakaneh&quot;, which means &quot;at the short cut&quot;. In May 1673, Jacques Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer, to find the Mississippi River. They departed from St. Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry (Métis). They followed Lake Michigan to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. From there, they were told to portage their canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. Later, French fur traders described the place as &quot;le portage&quot;, which eventually lent itself to the name of the community. As a portage, this community developed as a center of commerce and trade; later, a canal was constructed to facilitate this trade. When the railroads came through, the community continued in this role.

Portage emerged at this place because of its unique position along the one and a half mile strip of marshy floodplain between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. By the end of the 17th century, the Fox-Wisconsin waterway, linked at the Portage, served as the major fur trade thoroughfare between Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. It was not until the 1780s and 1790s that traders built their posts and warehouses at each end of the Portage. In the early 19th century Portage was primarily populated by Métis. In 1828, the federal government recognized the strategic economic importance of The Portage and built Fort Winnebago at the Fox River end. After 15 years of controversy, Winnebago settlement (now Portage) won the county seat in 1851. The community incorporated as Portage City in 1854.

The Portage business district lies along a hill that overlooks the Portage Canal. The buildings now in the city&#x27;s downtown were once part of a bustling, urban commercial center serving a large region across north central Wisconsin. The building of the city paralleled its commercial prominence between the end of the American Civil War and the second decade of the 20th century.

== Geography ==

Portage lies in the Wisconsin River valley. The city is surrounded by prairies and grasslands. Approximately three miles (5 km) west of the city are the Baraboo bluffs. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The location of the town at the split of the Wisconsin and Fox river is what gives it the name &quot;Portage&quot;, which means carrying a boat and its cargo between two navigable waters. In addition to the rivers, the city has access to Swan Lake and Silver Lake.

=== Cityscape ===
When Portage was first established, the streets were laid out on a traditional grid system. Today, the streets of the outlying city are contorted as a result of the many marshes and lowlands that run through much of Columbia County. The northern side of the city thus looks different from the central city, with the organized grid street system giving way to a more suburban streetscape with a lower housing density.

The city has two commercial areas. One is the downtown historic district, which features several small boutique shops and restaurants; the other is the Northridge commercial area that features big box stores. In the summer of 2007, the Portage Canal was cleaned up and now features a bike path that runs alongside part of it. In the summer of 2008, the main downtown street was redone. Historical landmarks of the city include the Museum at the Portage, the Indian Agency house, and the Surgeons Quarters.

<text>Gays Mills is a village in Crawford County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 523 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

In 1847 James B. Gay, a native of Indiana, built a dam and a sawmill on the Kickapoo River, which proved to be a flourishing success. When his health started to fail, James convinced his brothers John and Thomas to move to the area. In 1865 John Gay built the first flour mill south of the saw mill. In 1872 Thomas Gay and family organized the First Congregational Church, the first church in Gays Mills and in 1898 the church building itself was finished. In the years between 1848 and 1865, many families moved into the community, which came to be known as Gays Mills in honor of the founder and his brothers.

Gays Mills was also the home of the Twining apple-growing family. One of the Twinings took his apples to the World&#x27;s Fair, where they were a great success, generating mild fame for Gays Mills. Twining and his companions are honored with a historical marker on a hill overlooking the village. Consequently, apples are grown heavily in Crawford County, with numerous commercial orchards surrounding the village.

===Flooding===
Almost 60 homes were substantially damaged by flooding on the Kickapoo River in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, a meeting was held to discuss moving the village to higher ground because of repeated flooding, which damaged the local economy. In October 2008, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released a 72-page report asking residents and businesses to relocate from the Kickapoo River flood plain. Relocation is estimated to cost $1.7 million to purchase north of the existing location. About 150 of the village&#x27;s 230 houses lie in the flood plain. As of October 2008, village leaders were considering what course to take.

In March 2010, a grant of $4.31 million was awarded by the Economic Development Administration to the Village of Gays Mills and the Redevelopment Authority of Gays Mills to develop a strategy for relocating the Village’s commercial district outside of the floodplain.

In September 2016, July 2017, and August 2018 Gays Mills was once again hit by flooding.

<doc id="138888" wikidata="Q1229202" url="?curid=138888" title="VESA Display Power Management Signaling">
<text>VESA Display Power Management Signaling (VESA DPMS) is a standard from the VESA consortium for power management of video monitors. Example usage includes turning off, or putting the monitor into standby after a period of idle time to save power. Some commercial displays also incorporate this technology.

== History ==

VESA issued DPMS 1.0 in 1993, basing their work on the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) earlier Energy Star power management specifications. Subsequent revisions were included in future VESA BIOS Extensions.

== Design ==

The standard defines how to signal the H-sync and V-sync pins in a standard SVGA monitor to trigger the monitor&#x27;s power saving capabilities. 

DPMS defines four modes: normal, standby, suspended and off. When in the &quot;off&quot; state, some power may still be drawn in order to power indicator lights.

The standard is:
== Reception ==

By the late 1990s, most new monitors implemented at least one DPMS level.

DPMS does not define implementation details of its various power levels;
while in a CRT-based display the three steps could logically be mapped to three blocks to be shut down in order of increasing savings, thermal stress, and warm-up time (video amplifier, deflection, filaments) not all designs would be trivially adaptable to this model, and neither would the technologies that commercially succeeded CRT monitors.

Partially due to this reason, most major operating environments (such as Microsoft Windows and the MacOS family) do not implement the 3-level DPMS specification either, offering only a single timer. Notable exceptions include X11 and the XFCE Power Manager.

DPMS competed with the alternative Nutek power saving system, in which the monitor recognizes a black picture produced by a screensaver and enters a power saving mode after an appropriate delay.

<doc id="138894" wikidata="Q2574546" url="?curid=138894" title="Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin">
<text>Soldiers Grove is a village situated along the Kickapoo River in Crawford County, Wisconsin, in the United States. The population was 552 at the 2020 census. The town is notable for having relocated its central business district due to flooding on the nearby Kickapoo River during the 1970s, and has become a case study in best practices for managed retreat.

==History==
Soldiers Grove was first settled in 1856 by Joseph H. Brightman, who began a sawmill at the site to process logs rafted down the Kickapoo River. The village which sprang up near the sawmill was initially named &quot;Pine Grove&quot; because of the abundance of Eastern White Pine in the vicinity. In 1867, the village&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Soldiers Grove&quot; to commemorate the troops who had camped in the area during the Black Hawk War.

===Flooding and Relocation===
In its early years, Soldiers Grove depended upon the Kickapoo River for timber rafting and hydropower for flour and lumber mills. The village&#x27;s proximity to the river became a liability in the early twentieth century, however, when major floods began to afflict the settlement. Significant flooding occurred in 1907, 1912, 1917, and 1935. Following the last of these incidents, Soldiers Grove and other area communities petitioned the United States Congress to provide funds for a flood control project.

Despite another major flood in 1951, Congress did not agree to a flood control plan until 1962, when it authorized a project that included levees and a flood control dam on the Kickapoo River upstream of Soldiers Grove near La Farge, Wisconsin. Owing largely to environmental concerns, however, construction of the proposed dam was halted partway through construction in 1975 and never finished. In the meantime, a 1974 floodplain zoning ordinance had already taken effect in Soldiers Grove, prohibiting new construction and severely limiting maintenance options near the river and crippling the village&#x27;s downtown area. Although a levee proposed by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in 1975 would have lessened the restrictions, the village rejected the plan because of costs. While the downtown property was worth approximately $1 million, a levee to protect it would have required $3.5 million to construct and an additional $10,000 a year afterward for annual maintenance.

Rather than building and maintaining a levee, village leaders proposed that the federal funds already appropriated for levee construction be used instead to relocate the business district away from the floodplain. Federal agencies repeatedly denied this request, however. Even so, in 1977 the village used its own funds to purchase land on nearby high ground onto which the business district could be relocated.

In 1978, flooding again inundated the Soldiers Grove area. In the aftermath of the disaster, $900,000 in federal funds were finally provided to assist in relocating the village&#x27;s business district to higher ground. Construction of the new business district began in 1979 and was completed by 1983. A park replaced the old downtown area along the river. Although major flooding occurred along the Kickapoo River again in 2007 and 2008, the village escaped major damage by virtue of the relocation.

===Solar Village===
When Soldiers Grove began its relocation project in 1979, the United States was suffering from its second oil crisis in six years. In response to high energy costs, an energy task force for the Soldiers Grove relocation recommended that the new business district use solar heating. Despite the village&#x27;s location in the northern state of Wisconsin, studies showed it was feasible for new buildings to achieve a majority of their heat from solar energy. Consequently, the village council, led by eco-champion Daniel Naccarato, enacted an unprecedented ordinance requiring all new commercial buildings obtain at least 50% of their heat from the sun. Another law prohibited any new structure from blocking sunlight to another building.

To meet the solar energy requirements, buildings in the new business district were constructed with heavy insulation and earth-berming to supply thermal mass. South facing roof slopes and windows were built to capture maximum sunlight, and blowers and hydronic systems were installed to circulate the collected heat. Over twenty solar heated businesses were eventually built in the small community. While federal funds had been allocated to help relocate businesses from the floodplain, no additional federal monies were provided for the solar heating initiative.

In addition to solar heating, the village of Soldiers Grove passed ordinances for the new business district that mandated handicapped accessibility, placed restrictions on advertising signs, and promoted the use of natural building materials.

According to a 2003 report in Solar Today magazine, poor upkeep and lax regulation has reduced the energy efficiency of some of the solar heated businesses, but &quot;most of the buildings are still excellent examples of solar energy at work.&quot;

<text>The Town of Albion is located in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,069 at the 2020 Census. The unincorporated communities of Albion, Highwood, Hillside, and Indian Heights are located in the town.

==History==
The Town of Christiana was created from the Town of Albion on May 6, 1847.
Freeborn Sweet was the first settler of the Town of Albion, migrating from Oneida County, New York in August 1841. Other settlers began arriving that fall. In 1842, the first inhabitants in what would become the hamlet of Albion arrived, and the following year they organized a Seventh Day Baptist Church, which became a prominent institution in the community.

In 1844, settlement began in the northern part of the town, known as &quot;Albion Prairie&quot;. A school was organized the same year. A Primitive Methodist Church was soon started, but burned down in the 1860s. A later building, constructed in the early 1870s, still stands near Rice Lake. In 1868, a Methodist Episcopal Church was built near the Primitive Methodist Church, but that building was demolished in the 1930s.

In the 1800s, the hamlet of Albion was a retail center for the area, with a general store, a wagon and blacksmith shop, a steam mill that manufactured wagons and sleighs, a harness shop, and a hotel.

In 1854, Albion Academy was founded by the Seventh Day Baptists in the hamlet of Albion. It offered a classical education, including courses in the classics, mathematics, science, and music. It is considered one of the first co-educational colleges in Wisconsin. Among faculty members at this school were the famed Swedish-American naturalist, Thure Kumlien, and the Norwegian-American author and diplomat, Rasmus Anderson. Graduates of the college included naturalist Edward Lee Greene, educator John Q. Emery, newspaper editor Christopher J. Rollis, Colorado governor Alva Adams, and Minnesota&#x27;s U.S. Senator Knute Nelson. The last remaining building of the academy, Kumlien Hall, was destroyed by fire in the 1960s. However, it was rebuilt and a museum devoted to the academy and the early education of southern Wisconsin is now located on the Albion green. Among the treasures at the museum is the canoe paddle created by Sterling North, author of the 1963s bestseller &quot;Rascal&quot;, for the canoe that North built at his childhood home. The canoe, unfortunately, was destroyed in the 1960s fire of Kumlien Hall.

<text>Marshall is a village in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Maunesha River. The population was 3,787 at the 2020 United States Census. It is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In June 1837, Andrew Bird, Zenas Bird and Aaron Petrie began a settlement along the banks of the Maunesha River. In the fall of 1838, a fire destroyed the settlement. For more than a decade after that the area was known as Bird&#x27;s Ruins. In 1849, Bird&#x27;s Ruins became Hanchettville to recognize Asahel Hanchett for luring several needed businesses to the village. Railway officials located a depot of the new Milwaukee to Madison rail line in Hanchettville, and the village residents renamed Hanchettville to Howard City after one of the leading railway promoters. Howard City did not prosper, so Asahel Hanchett sold his land holdings to Madison real estate brokers William F. Porter and Samuel Marshall in 1860. This included the grist mill created by Ansel Hanchett in 1852 which Marshall renamed &quot;Marshall&#x27;s Roller Mill.&quot; Marshall was the original home of what became Augsburg University from its opening in September 1869 to its move to Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1872.

The settlement was then renamed after Samuel Marshall in 1861. Samuel Marshall founded Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corporation (M&amp;I) Bank in Madison in 1853. The Porter family moved from Madison to make their home in Marshall in 1860, and William F. Porter left in 1865 for Massachusetts, leaving his share of the property to his son William Henry Porter. Marshall was officially incorporated as a village on January 24, 1905, and had a population of 467. In 1908, the mill it was sold to the Blaschka family, and today it operates under its present name, the &quot;Blaschka Milling Co.&quot; The mill, an important centerpiece of Marshall history, celebrated its sesquicentennial of continuous operation in 2002.

<doc id="138913" wikidata="Q2226176" url="?curid=138913" title="Mount Horeb, Wisconsin">
<text>Mount Horeb is a village in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 7,754 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Madison metropolitan area.

==History==
===The Ho-Chunk nation===
The Village of Mount Horeb is part of the ancestral territory of the Ho-Chunk nation. Ho-Chunk translates into &quot;People of the Sacred Language,&quot; or &quot;People of the Big Voice,&quot; and belong to the Siouan linguistic family. Beginning in 1829, the Ho-Chunk, sometimes referred to by the exonym, Winnebago (which is derived from the French &quot;Ouinipegouek,&quot; or &quot;People of the Stinking Water&quot;) experienced massive amounts of pressure from European and American settlers as their land was opened for agriculture and lead mining. Their territory was ceded to the United States&#x27; Government through three treaties: 1829, 1832, and 1837. The treaty signed in 1829, encompassed territory that would be the future site of Mount Horeb. These treaties, accompanied by colonizing pressure and xenophobic fears rising from the Dakota War of 1862, forced the tribe West from their land across the Mississippi River. Currently, the tribe has no reservation, rather, 8,800 acres, located throughout twenty counties in western Wisconsin, are held by the 7,100 members of the Ho-Chunk.

===Early settlement===
Settlement in Dane County began in 1828 when Ebenezer Brigham discovered a lode of lead in the Blue Mounds area, and established a tavern and inn. In 1849, the tract of land that would become Mount Horeb was purchased by James Morrison, and a year later sold a portion to Granville Neal. This initial settlement largely drew individuals of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ethnic backgrounds, as well as Yankees and settlers from Southern states. As the population of the Blue Mounds Township grew, so too did the need for a new post office. In 1861, the first post office in Mount Horeb was established in the home of English immigrant and Methodist Episcopal lay minister George Wright. As the new postmaster, Wright selected the name Mount Horeb for the settlement. The &quot;Mount&quot; portion of the name is said to be inspired by the surrounding geography, while &quot;Horeb&quot; is derived from the Biblical location wherein the prophet Moses received the Ten Commandments from the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God while leading the Jewish people through the Sinai Peninsula on their exodus out of Egypt. References to this site can be found in the books of Exodus, Deuteronomy, 1 Kings, Psalms, and Malachi. When Wright moved to Norwalk, Iowa, the post office moved to a space closer to the settlement referred to as &quot;The Corners.&quot; The name changed to &quot;Horeb&#x27;s Corner,&quot; before officially being designated as Mount Horeb.

===Norwegian immigration===
The presence of Norwegian immigrants has played a significant factor in the historic and contemporary identity of not only Mount Horeb, but the State of Wisconsin. The first Norwegian immigrant to arrive in the Wisconsin Territory was Ole Nattestad, from the Numedal valley east of Telemark in 1838, establishing Jefferson Prairie near Beloit. By 1850, 9,467 Norwegians were identified by the federal census, and by the 1870 census, the population had exploded to 59,619. Norwegian-immigration historian Odd S. Lovoll observes that by the 1870s, Norwegian immigrants had created significant settlements throughout Wisconsin, particularly in Dane County. In 1871, Andrew Levordson became the first Norwegian immigrant to arrive in Mount Horeb, marking the beginning of this ethnic-group&#x27;s presence in the village.

====Little Norway====
Although Mount Horeb had large Norwegian and Norwegian-American ethnic populations, the community also chose to display its identity through multiple forms of museums, performances, and tourist oriented ideas.
The first of which was Little Norway, Wisconsin, near Blue Mounds. In 1856, Osten Olson Haugen and his family, who emigrated from Tinn, Telemark, Norway, established a forty-acre farmstead. In 1926, Isak J Dahle, an insurance agent from Chicago, Illinois, but who was raised in Mount Horeb, purchased the site and renamed the farmstead Nissedahle. The name is a play on words. Nisse (see Tomte), in Norwegian folklore traditions, are playful elves that provide assistance to humans when kept in good spirit. While the Norwegian word &quot;Nissedal&quot; translates into &quot;Valley of the Elves,&quot; Dahle chose to incorporate his last name into valley, therefore, &quot;Nissedahle.&quot; Over the years, Dahle converted the site into a living history museum, creating an idealized folk version of Norway. The site was opened to the public in 1934. One of the most striking features of Little Norway was the replica of the 12th century &quot;Stavkirke,&quot; a Christian Norwegian stave church. This structure was built in Trondheim, Norway for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Eventually, it would be purchased by the Wrigley family, and later gifted to Dahle in 1935. The stave church housed over 7,000 individual artifacts. Little Norway became a major attraction in the area, and guests were invited to participate in educational activities as they explored the open air museum as it told the story of immigrant Norwegian and Norwegian rural life. After eighty-five years, Little Norway closed its doors due to financial reasons. Many of the objects in the museum were auctioned to historical preservation and interpretation organizations, and the stave church returned to Norway. Today, visitors to the Driftless Historium in Mount Horeb can take virtual, 3-D tours of the stave church.

====Song of Norway====
After returning from a trip abroad to Scandinavia, Mount Horeb resident and artist, Oljanna Cunneen, suggested to that hosting a festival centered on a performance of ethnic identity may be a &quot;fun&quot; endeavor for the community to engage. In 1966, Mount Horeb premiered &quot;Song of Norway&quot; (1944), an operetta by Robert Wright (writer) and George Forrest (author) (1944). &quot;Song of Norway&quot; tells the fictionalized account of Norwegian composer, Edvard Grieg. The first performance was held at the Tyrol Ski Basin. In 1979, the play moved to the Cave of the Mounds, where a permanent stage was constructed. The play featured local and professional actors who performed on an outdoor stage. The Norwegian folk costumes, such as the bunad, were made by local artists dedicated to the success of this play and its performance of the community&#x27;s Norwegian heritage. The play ran currently each summer until the early 2000s when it eventually ceased annual production.

====The Troll Capital of the World and the Trollway====
During the 1980s, as part of an effort to continue celebrating their Norwegian and Norwegian-American heritage, as well as a reaction to the construction of the Business Highway 18/151 bypass, Mount Horeb transformed itself into the &quot;Troll Capital of the World.&quot; In Norwegian folklore, trolls are said to be about the size of, if not smaller than, humans. They have ugly faces, stout bodies, and tails. These trolls featured in Mount Horeb hearken to this tradition, and residents have incorporated these playful, often numbskull, characters throughout the village. The majority of them, whether painted, sculpted, or carved from logs with a chainsaw, are located along Main Street, &quot;The Trollway.&quot; Each of the 40 trolls in Mount Horeb have their own distinct identity, such as &quot;The Chicken Thief,&quot; &quot;The Accordion Player,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Swill.&quot;

The &quot;Trollway&quot; originated from the Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s attempts to draw traffic away from the bypass and back into the center of town to promote local businesses.

==Geography==
Located in southwestern Wisconsin, Mount Horeb is situated in a region referred to as the Driftless Area. While including parts of southeastern Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, and northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area is a distinct feature of the Wisconsin landscape, stretching across eighteen different counties. In her analysis of place name in the Driftless Area, folklorist Janet Gilmore observes that, &quot;travelers who cross in and out of the territory today will note how its distinctive contours and impressive views emerge from wider, flatter expanses to the east, south, west, and north.&quot; These &quot;contours&quot; are the result of glaciers going around this space, smoothing out the surrounding prairie while leaving behind rolling hills. The Village of Mount Horeb is located in southwestern Dane County. The geographic boundary of the Driftless Area runs down the center of the county, creating an east/west topographical division. Mount Horeb is also located near Blue Mound State Park, which also has access to the Military Ridge State Trail. Mount Horeb is located approximately twenty miles southwest of the state capital, Madison, which is also home to the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Located along the major thoroughfare of U.S. Highway 151, Mount Horeb encompasses a total area of 3.25 square miles.

==Business and industry==
Mount Horeb offers several good access points to the Military Ridge State Trail, a bicycle trail built on a former railroad right-of-way.

Mount Horeb was once home to the Mount Horeb Mustard Museum, a light-hearted museum with an approximately equal amount of floor space devoted to exhibits and to its museum store. The store has hundreds of varieties of mustard that can be sampled before purchase. The museum exhibits a large collection of unusual mustards and antique mustard jars. In 2002 the museum was showcased on the Food Network television series &quot;Unwrapped&quot;. The museum and its curator have also been featured on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; broadcast of July 29, 2010, and &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot; on February 18, 1995.

In 2009 the Mustard Museum relocated to Middleton, Wisconsin, where it is now known as the National Mustard Museum.

Mount Horeb has been known by some residents as the &quot;Mustard Capital of the World&quot; as well as the &quot;Troll Capital of the World&quot;. The Chamber of Commerce calls the main street the &quot;Trollway,&quot; and troll statues and themes decorate many area businesses. This reflects Mount Horeb&#x27;s largely Norwegian heritage.

Mount Horeb is home to the Gonstead Clinic of Chiropractic, founded in 1939 by Dr. C.S. Gonstead. Gonstead developed the widely-used Gonstead chiropractic technique for spinal adjustment. With the completion in 1964 of a building on Route 151, and the adjoining Karakahl Inn, it became a nationally recognized chiropractic center. It gradually declined in importance after the 1978 death of its founder, and the buildings are currently deteriorating and the target of a preservation effort.

In December 2016, Duluth Trading Company announced it would be moving its corporate headquarters from Belleville, Wisconsin, to Mount Horeb.

<text>(2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-4-Hydroxyproline, or -hydroxyproline (C5H9O3N), is an amino acid, abbreviated as Hyp or O, &quot;e.g.&quot;, in Protein Data Bank.

==Structure and discovery==
In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer isolated hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed gelatin. In 1905, Hermann Leuchs synthesized a racemic mixture of 4-hydroxyproline.

Hydroxyproline differs from proline by the presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

==Production and function==
Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification). The enzyme catalyzed reaction takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it is not directly incorporated into proteins, hydroxyproline comprises roughly 4% of all amino acids found in animal tissue, an amount greater than seven other amino acids that are translationally incorporated.

=== Animals ===

==== Collagen ====
Hydroxyproline is a major component of the protein collagen, comprising roughly 13.5% of mammalian collagen. Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles for collagen stability. They permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. In the canonical collagen Xaa-Yaa-Gly triad (where Xaa and Yaa are any amino acid), a proline occupying the Yaa position is hydroxylated to give a Xaa-Hyp-Gly sequence. This modification of the proline residue increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. It was initially proposed that the stabilization was due to water molecules forming a hydrogen bonding network linking the prolyl hydroxyl groups and the main-chain carbonyl groups. It was subsequently shown that the increase in stability is primarily through stereoelectronic effects and that hydration of the hydroxyproline residues provides little or no additional stability.

==== Non-collagen ====
Hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen. For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount. However, the mammalian proteins elastin and argonaute 2 have collagen-like domains in which hydroxyproline is formed. Some snail poisons, conotoxins, contain hydroxyproline, but lack collagen-like sequences.

Hydroxylation of proline has been shown to be involved in targeting Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) for degradation by proteolysis. Under normoxia (normal oxygen conditions) EGLN1 protein hydroxylates the proline at the 564 position of HIF-1 alpha, which allows ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) and subsequent targeting for proteasome degradation.

=== Plants ===
Hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are also found in plant cell walls. These hydroxyprolines serve as the attachment points for glycan chains which are added as post-translational modifications.

==Clinical significance==
Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy.

Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have also been demonstrated in Paget&#x27;s disease.

Mass spectrometry analysis showed decreased amount of hydroxyproline post-translational modifications in non inflamed tissue from ulcerative colitis patients when compared to tissue from donors without the disease. 

==Other hydroxyprolines==
Other hydroxyprolines also exist in nature. The most notable ones are 2,3-&quot;cis&quot;-, 3,4-&quot;trans&quot;-, and 3,4-dihydroxyproline, which occurs in diatom cell walls and are postulated to have a role in silica deposition. Hydroxyproline is also found in the walls of oomycetes, fungus-like protists related to diatoms. (2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;)-&quot;cis&quot;-4-Hydroxyproline is found in the toxic cyclic peptides from &quot;Amanita&quot; mushrooms (&quot;e.g.&quot;, phalloidin).

<doc id="138919" wikidata="Q1886424" url="?curid=138919" title="Roxbury, Wisconsin">
<text>The Town of Roxbury is located in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,871 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated communities of Alden Corners and Roxbury are located in the town. The unincorporated community of Lutheran Hill is also located partially in the town.

==History==
The Town of Roxbury has been called &quot;Dane County&#x27;s most historic township (sic)&quot;. Among its earliest recorded occurrences is the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, the penultimate engagement of the 1832 Black Hawk War between the United States militia and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. After being pursued from Illinois, Black Hawk&#x27;s band took a stand against the militia just south of the Wisconsin River, in what is today the Town of Roxbury. Although Black Hawk&#x27;s band took severe casualties, their stand allowed several hundred noncombatant Sauk and Fox to retreat to the Mississippi River which saved their lives.

Five years later, Charles Floyd, an Eastern speculator, established a company whose goal was to build an exemplary city in the Midwest. Floyd bought over of land in section 19 in the Town of Roxbury and had it surveyed. Then he drew up a map depicting streets, public buildings, and parks in what he called the &quot;City of Superior&quot;, boasting that he would make the area known throughout the country. His map was circulated in Chicago, New York, and Boston, along with glowing descriptions of the city. Lots were sold to investors, including Daniel Webster, but there were no settlers. The 1842 census showed only two residents in the town. Floyd&#x27;s grand plan had been a failure.

A settlement located across the Wisconsin River, in what is today Sauk City, was the impetus for the next development in Roxbury. In 1840, Agoston Haraszthy, a colorful nobleman and political refugee from Hungary, arrived in the United States. By 1841, he had purchased a large parcel of land where Sauk City now stands. He also built a hunting lodge, opposite his home, on a bluff in Roxbury overlooking the river. For the next several years, Haraszthy was active as a trader, hunter, steamboat operator, and viticulturist, and his business activities attracted attention to the area. He established a ferry that crossed the river, connecting Roxbury with Sauk City (then named &quot;Haraszthy&quot;), and in 1841, Robert Richards and Jacob Fraelich, the ferry operators, became the first settlers in Roxbury after Haraszthy.

For several years, no other settlers appeared in the town. Then in 1845, Rev. Adelbert Inama, a Norbertine missionary originally from the Tirol in Austria, arrived in the area. Impressed with what he found, Inama extolled the virtues of Roxbury to his superiors in Austria:

 Inama&#x27;s active promotion of the area was instrumental in attracting immigrants, mostly from German territories, particularly Bavaria. Within two years of his arrival, 15 families had settled in Roxbury.

Known as &quot;the Apostle of the Four Lakes Region&quot; because of his pioneering missionary work in the area, Inama established the first Catholic church in Dane County in Roxbury. In 1845, he erected a log chapel in section 18 of the town. Church services were held there until 1853, when a small brick church was constructed.

Inama also acquired of land in the area, of which had been donated by Haraszthy. Three acres were set aside for the construction of a church and a school. The remainder were sold to immigrants at cost, which was done to prevent speculators from preying on the naïve newcomers.

As an increasing number of settlers arrived, they called for their own local government, and in 1849 the area that is now the Town of Roxbury was detached from the Town of Dane (then known as Clarkson). The Town of Roxbury was formed by an act of the legislature on March 21, 1849. Burke Fairchild was elected the town&#x27;s first chairman. In a vote held to select the town&#x27;s name, two factions debated the issue. One wanted &quot;Nelson&quot;, after Admiral Nelson, the hero of the English wife of the town chairman; another wanted &quot;Roxbury&quot;, after a town in New York where some of the settlers originated. A tie vote resulted in the secretary casting the deciding ballot for Roxbury.

Although many of the first settlers of Roxbury were Yankees, Inama&#x27;s work attracted an element that was heavily German. Within a short time, the original Yankee settlers moved on and Germans predominated. As the town grew, the small settlement of Alden&#x27;s Corners developed in the southern part of the town, and at one time a post office was located there. By 1875 the population of the town had reached 1,151.

Having outgrown the church built only a few years earlier, a new one was constructed in 1857. Though it has been enlarged several times, the 1857 building remains at the core of the present church. Erected on a hill, the Romanesque Revival style church is a stately edifice overlooking a small settlement below. It is graced by a large altar painting depicting St. Norbert and the allegory of life, which was donated to Inama in 1860 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria.
St. Norbert&#x27;s Church has always been the centerpiece of the hamlet and focal point of the community. School was originally held in the basement of the church, until a separate school building was erected in 1864. A convent to house the Dominican nuns who ran the school was erected in 1879. The only settlement in the town is the hamlet of Roxbury, which is centered around the church. At one time, the hamlet consisted of the church, school, convent, a blacksmith shop, an auto garage, two stores, a meat market, and a handful of houses, but now only the church, the school, a restaurant, and a tavern remain, and the school is no longer in operation, with the exception being religious instruction twice weekly. The number of houses in the hamlet has been increasing since the 1970s.

Because Roxbury was populated almost exclusively by Germans, German was spoken in the community for over 80 years, well into the 1930s. Tradition has it that the Kelly family were the only ones in Roxbury who could not speak German. School classes at St. Norbert&#x27;s were conducted in German until 1905, when they began to be taught half in German and half in English. For many years, the church also followed a German tradition of segregating the congregation during services, with men on one side and women on the other, married adults in the rear, single adults in the center, and children in the front. Local residents still refer to the hamlet of Roxbury as &quot;the Dorf&quot;, German for &quot;village&quot;.

Given the proximity of the town to the city of Madison, concerns have been raised about development in the town. As a result, the town&#x27;s most recent comprehensive plan addressed a number of issues, including growth and economic development; land use and preservation; agricultural, natural, and cultural resources; community facilities; and housing. The key goals that were identified by residents of the town of Roxbury and delineated in the plan were to preserve agricultural land and agriculture as a way of life, to preserve natural resources and wildlife, to preserve areas of cultural and historic importance, and to carefully site and design new development so as to maintain the existing character of the town.

Its original location was intended to be at Packham&#x27;s Mill, about where Mill Road crosses the railroad track today two miles southeast downtown. But two local settlers, Louis Baker and George Fish, platted a village on their land two miles further northwest along the railroad. Railroad officials agreed to move a train depot to the new community in exchange for $1,500 and two miles of right of way. The village was founded in 1871 and formally incorporated in 1893.

Baker and Fish did not want credit for naming the community, so they asked Simeon Mills and Mr. Hill of Madison to come up with a list. The name &quot;Waunakee&quot; has a Native American origin meaning &quot;fair and pleasant valley.&quot; In their &quot;Dictionary of Wisconsin History&quot;, on the other hand, the Wisconsin Historical Society has the village&#x27;s name deriving from the Chippewa name of &quot;a friendly Indian&quot; from the area, &quot;Waunaki&quot;, meaning &quot;he lives in peace&quot;.

Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy each visited the village to campaign for their brother John before the contested Wisconsin presidential primary in March 1960. Former First Lady Barbara Bush visited the village to campaign for her son George for president in October 2000. In October 2024, Donald Trump held a rally in the village at Dane Manufacturing, the first visit by a Republican presidential nominee to Dane County since 1996.

The landmark Waunakee Railroad Depot, in the central part of town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It now houses the Waunakee Area Chamber of Commerce offices.

<text>Brownsville is a village in Dodge County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 598 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Village of Brownsville was first known as Thetis Station and had a narrow gauge railroad connection to Fond du Lac and Iron Ridge. In April 1878 the village was officially renamed to its current name, which was taken in honor of Alfred D. Brown, an English immigrant and pioneer farmer who in 1850 had settled an 80-acre farm on the edge of the village and became one of the first merchants there as well. The village remained unincorporated until it gained official status as an incorpated village on December 23, 1952. 1878 can therefore be regarded as the village&#x27;s founding, with 1952 being its start as a proper municipality. As the town became more established towards the turn of the 20th Century, additional businesses and agricultural infrastructure were built, including crop storage bins and a grain elevator. In 1902 a small factory was built in town where it was used in local cheese production by various owners until the building was purchased by Michels Corporation in 1965, and demolished in 1973.

The Brownsville Fire Company, the local fire department, was organized in 1891 and originally consisted of 13 members and hook-and-ladder wagon with a hand-operated water pump. It was reorganized in October 1912. The first mechanical fire truck was purchased in 1931, a Studebaker pump truck which remains preserved today in local private ownership. The fire department today operates modern equipment, and responds to local and surrounding emergencies in collaboration with the emergancy services of other towns in Dodge and Fond du Lac counties.

The local Lutheran church, Saint Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church, began in 1885 when 15 local families from the congregation in Lomira (bearing the same name) were released to begin meeting as their own congregation. They built their first church building in 1887, which was located on Main Street next to the current cemetery until it was destroyed by a fire on September 6, 1909. The same year as the construction of the first church, the congregation elected a local Mr. Gottmanshausen as its first pastor, who accepted the call of the community. Reverend Gottmanshausen was installed on June 25, 1887. The current church, located a block away from the cemetery, was constructed in June 1915. It was completed in November later that year, and still stands in use today.

On August 28, 2018, an EF1 tornado caused major damage in the village. The tornado uprooted trees, tore siding off from buildings, damaged roofs, and downed power lines, among other destruction. The village was put under a state of emergency, with residents only being allowed in days after the tornado.

==Geography==

Brownsville is located two miles from US Hwy 41 and Wisconsin Highway 175. Wisconsin Highway 49 runs through the village.

Kummel Creek, a tributary of the Rock River, begins just north of the village, through which it flows, and the Horicon Marsh sits approximately five miles west of the town.

<text>Brussels is a town in Door County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,136 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated communities of Brussels, Misere, and Kolberg are located in the town. The unincorporated community of Rosiere is also located partially in the town.

==History==
Brussels, a civil town in Door County, was created on November 12, 1858.

The largest Belgian-American settlement in the United States is located in portions of Brown, Kewaunee, and Door counties in Wisconsin, adjacent to the waters of Green Bay. Walloons settled the region in the 1850s and their descendants still constitute a high proportion of the population. A variety of elements attests to the Belgian-American presence: place names (Brussels, Namur, Rosiere, Luxemburg), the Walloon language, surnames, foods (booyah, trippe, and jutt), the Kermis harvest festival, and especially architecture. Many of the original wooden structures of the Belgian Americans were destroyed in a firestorm that swept across southern Door County in October 1871. A few stone houses made of local dolomite survived. More common are 1880s red brick houses, distinguished by modest size and gable-end, bull&#x27;s-eye windows. Some houses have detached summer kitchens with bake ovens appended to the rear. And the Belgians, many of them devout Catholics, also erected small roadside votive chapels like those in their homeland.

=== Most Belgian-American towns ===
Brussels, Wisconsin is the third-most Belgian-American community in the United States, by proportion of residents.

# Union, Door County, Wisconsin: 49%
# Red River, Wisconsin (Kewaunee County): 47%
# Brussels, Wisconsin (Door County): 36.4% (composed of &quot;Brussels community&quot; &amp; &quot;Namur Community&quot;)
# Lincoln, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin: 35.4%
# Green Bay (town), Wisconsin (Brown County): 31.8%

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.2 square miles (93.6 km2), all of it land.

=== Brussels Hill ===

The 102 ft high Brussels Hill (, elevation 851 feet) is the highest point in the county. It has been explained as the result of a meteorite impact. The hill is missing blocks of rock ripped off during glaciation. The broken rocks leave behind nearly horizontal and vertical rock surfaces along the pre-existing weaknesses (beds and joints) in the rock. This is considered a feature of glaciokarst geology.

The town of Washington Island is made up of a group of small islands that includes Plum Island, Detroit Island, Hog Island, Rock Island, Pilot Island, Fish Island, and the largest, Washington Island. The majority of the population of the town lives on Washington Island and many of the other smaller islands are partly or entirely protected areas with no year-round population, if any at all. As a result, the area is rarely if ever referred to as the town of Washington or just Washington; more commonly the names of the individual islands are used as a reference.

Most of the people who settled on Washington Island were Scandinavian immigrants, especially Icelanders. Today, Washington Island is one of the oldest Icelandic communities in the United States and among the largest outside of Iceland itself.
