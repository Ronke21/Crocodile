<doc id="136894" wikidata="Q1086416" url="?curid=136894" title="Oradell, New Jersey">
<text>Oradell is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,244, an increase of 266 (+3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 7,978, which in turn reflected a decline of 69 (-0.9%) from the 8,047 counted in the 2000 census. The borough includes a dam on the Hackensack River that forms the Oradell Reservoir. Oradell is a suburb of New York City, located approximately northwest of Midtown Manhattan.

Oradell was originally formed on March 8, 1894, as the borough of Delford, from portions of Harrington Township, Midland Township (now Rochelle Park) and Palisades Township. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. The name &quot;Delford&quot; was a portmanteau created from the names of two communities within the new borough: Oradell and New Milford. The Hotel Delford had been constructed in 1870 after the construction of the first railroad to reach the area. On November 12, 1920, the borough&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Oradell&quot;, based on the results of a referendum held ten days earlier. Oradell derives its name from &quot;ora&quot; (Latin for &quot;edge&quot;) and &quot;dell&quot;.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; ranked Oradell as the 68th best place to live in New Jersey in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Top Towns&quot; in the state. This ranking also makes the borough the seventh best place to live in Bergen County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.57 square miles (6.65 km2), including 2.41 square miles (6.25 km2) of land and 0.16 square miles (0.40 km2) of water (6.07%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Delford.

The borough borders the Bergen County municipalities of Dumont, Emerson, Haworth, New Milford, Paramus and River Edge.

Oradell Reservoir was formed by the Oradell Reservoir Dam placed on the Hackensack River, which was started in 1921 and finished in 1923. The reservoir is fed by the Pascack Brook and Dwars Kill in addition to the Hackensack River. The Dam has greatly reduced the amount of flooding in the eastern part of Oradell caused by the Hackensack River, though it also resulted in the loss of flora and fauna that depended on the fresh water that flowed down the river. Fed by rain from Hurricane Irene in August 2011, the water level in the reservoir rose two feet above the top of the dam, allowing billions of gallons of water to flow over the dam and exacerbating flooding conditions in Oradell and New Milford.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Oradell has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Ridgefield Park is a village in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the village&#x27;s population was 13,224, an increase of 495 (+3.9%) from the 2010 census count of 12,729, which in turn reflected a decline of 144 (−1.1%) from the 12,873 counted in the 2000 census. Of the 564 municipalities in the state, Ridgefield Park is one of only four with a village type of government, though it operates a Walsh Act (city commission) form of government. Of the four New Jersey villages, Loch Arbour also uses the commission form of government, while Ridgewood operates under the council-manager form, and the Township of South Orange Village operates under a special charter form with many characteristics of village government.

Ridgefield Park was formed as a village on June 15, 1892, within Ridgefield Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on June 6, 1892. Overpeck Township was formed on March 23, 1897, to be coextensive with Ridgefield Park village, and was created within Ridgefield Township for the purpose of administering a Board of Education. Portions of the village gained in both 1921 and 1926 were taken from Bogota and Teaneck. On May 31, 1938, Overpeck Township became Ridgefield Park Township. The village was named for the area&#x27;s terrain.

The village&#x27;s Fourth of July Parade, first established in 1894, is said to be the longest continuously celebrated such event in New Jersey and one of the oldest in the country. The village eliminated its July 4 fireworks in 2009, citing the $50,000 cost amid a difficult economy, but has restored the tradition since then.

<text>Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 18,834, an increase of 773 (+4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 18,061, which in turn reflected a decline of 49 (−0.3%) from the 18,110 counted in the 2000 census.

Rutherford was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 21, 1881, from portions of Union Township, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. The borough was named for John Rutherfurd, a U.S. Senator who owned land in the area.

Rutherford has been called the &quot;Borough of Trees&quot; and &quot;The First Borough of Bergen County&quot;, and is known as well for its pedestrian-focused downtown area adjacent to the borough&#x27;s Bergen County Line (New Jersey Transit) railway station.

==History==
The ridge above the New Jersey Meadowlands upon which Rutherford sits was settled by Lenape Native Americans long before the arrival of Walling Van Winkle in 1687. Union Avenue, which runs from the Meadowlands to the Passaic River, may have been an Indian trail, but was more likely a property boundary line; it was referenced in the 1668 grant of land by proprietary Governor Philip Carteret to John Berry.
During the early days of settlement, the land that is now Rutherford was part of New Barbadoes Township, as Berry had lived in Barbados, another English colony, before claiming his grant in New Jersey. New Barbadoes was part of Essex County from 1693 to 1710, when Bergen County was formed. In 1826, the land became part of Lodi Township (of which today&#x27;s remaining portion is now South Hackensack). When Hudson County was formed in 1840, the area that is today North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford and East Rutherford became part of Harrison Township (of which today&#x27;s remaining portion is Harrison town). However, the area reverted to Bergen County in 1852 and became known as Union Township.

Part of the region was known as Boiling Springs for a powerful and ceaseless spring located in the vicinity. Despite its name, the spring actually consisted of cold groundwater seeps rather than hot springs.

The Erie Railroad built its Main Line from Jersey City across the Meadowlands in the 1840s. Daniel Van Winkle, a descendant of Walling, donated land in 1866 for a train station at Boiling Springs. Several resorts were built along the Passaic, with guests disembarking at Boiling Springs station and taking Union Avenue to the river. Later, the railroad opened a station closer to the river, at Carlton Hill, and a horsecar line (briefly on rails) along Jackson Ave took travelers to the resort area.

At the time, much of the property in Rutherford was farmland owned by the estate of John Rutherfurd, a former New Jersey legislator and U.S. Senator, whose homestead was along the Passaic River, near present-day Rutherford Avenue. Van Winkle opened a real estate office at Depot Square (now Station Square) to sell the land of the &quot;Rutherfurd Park Association&quot;, and began to lay out the area&#x27;s street grid. The main roads were Orient Way, a wide boulevard heading south-southwest from Station Square, and Park Avenue, which headed west-southwest from Station Square to bring traffic to the new Valley Brook Race Course in what is now Lyndhurst.

In the 1870s, the area began to be called &quot;Rutherford&quot;. The definitive reason for the change in spelling of the final syllable from &quot;furd&quot; to &quot;ford&quot; is unknown, though the change may have been the result of name recognition of the Ohio politician Rutherford B. Hayes, who was elected President in 1876, or could have been because of a clerical error by the United States Postal Service. The Post Office opened a facility called &quot;Rutherford&quot; in 1876. On September 21, 1881, the Borough of Rutherford was formed by formal vote of secession from Union Township. By then, the community had about 1,000 residents.

===Historic sites===
Rutherford is home to the following locations on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Iviswold – 223 Montross Avenue (added 2004). Located on the campus of Felician College, a $9 million renovation project of the Iviswold castle that took 14 years was completed in 2013. Originally constructed by Floyd W. Tomkins in 1869, the house was expanded to three levels, 25 rooms and by textbook publisher David Brinkerhoff Iverson after he acquired the home in 1887, based on a design by architect William H. Miller.
* Kip Homestead – 12 Meadow Road (added 1983).

==Economy==
Rutherford is the site of Architectural Window Manufacturing Corporation&#x27;s plant and Blue Foundry Bank&#x27;s (formerly Boiling Springs Savings Bank) corporate headquarters.

Rutherford, together with Lyndhurst and North Arlington, was the site of the EnCap project, an effort to remediate landfills on the site and construct homes and golf courses on top of the remediated site. On May 27, 2008, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission terminated its agreement with EnCap Golf Holdings, the company that had the contract to redevelop the site, after the company had missed targets to clean up the landfills as part of the project.

The Highland Cross Development is a proposed project to consist of 800 units of housing, including 160 affordable units, two hotels, and a large retail component. Rutherford officials have worked to get approval for the plan, in the face of opposition from the 14 mayors of the Hackensack Meadowlands Municipal Committee.

==Arts and culture==
William Carlos Williams, the Pulitzer Prize–winning poet who died in 1963, was born in Rutherford in 1883. For most of his adult life, he maintained a physician&#x27;s office in the house in which he lived, at 9 Ridge Road, at the corner of Park Avenue, even as he continued his artistic endeavors.

The Rivoli Theatre was opened in 1922 as a vaudeville house but was quickly converted into a movie palace. It was known for a large crystal chandelier suspended from the center of the auditorium. On January 9, 1977, the Rivoli was severely damaged in a fire. Soon afterward, a plan was developed to restore the Rivoli and turn it into a performing arts center. The William Carlos Williams Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1981 and contains three movie screens as well as two performance halls. Since 1995, the Williams Center&#x27;s primary focus has been on concerts, ballet, opera, and theater for children.
The Meadowlands Museum, which focuses on local history and began as a project of parents of children in the public schools in 1961 and was originally based in a room at Sylvan School, moved to the Yereance-Berry House at 91 Crane Avenue in 1974.

The GFWC Woman&#x27;s Club of Rutherford is a non-profit volunteer organization that was organized in 1889. The club is located in the former Iviswold carriage house.

The Rutherford Community Band was founded in 1941 and performs free concerts at venues throughout the borough, including the Hutzel Memorial Band Shell in Lincoln Park.

===Annual cultural events===
Rutherford holds an annual street fair on Labor Day, which is the longest running street fair in New Jersey, and usually attracts 20,000 people.

The first annual Rutherford West End Festival was held October 3, 2009, in the West End section of town.

The Rutherford Multicultural Festival is an annual event that provides traditional entertainment and food from around the world.

In 2017, the first annual Rutherford Downhill Derby provided kids and adults with the opportunity to build, design, and race gravity powered race carts.

In 2018, the Rutherford Pride Alliance was founded. In June 2019, there was a public raising of the LGBTQ Rainbow flag, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots; the Rutherford council unanimously approved the flag raising, despite opposition from residents who argued that the move was divisive, and special preferences were being granted.

==Parks and recreation==
Rutherford Memorial Park, in the northwest corner of town along the Passaic, was set aside as parkland by the voters in 1951. Its include two baseball diamonds, five softball diamonds, a Little League Baseball field, a football stadium, six tennis courts, two basketball courts, and three playgrounds. Other active recreation parks include Tamblyn Field, near Route 3.

The borough also has several smaller passive parks, including Lincoln Park across from borough hall, which was renovated in 2004. It includes a band shell and several monuments, including a cannon dating to the Spanish–American War, and is home to the borough&#x27;s 9/11 memorial, containing a piece of steel debris recovered from the site of the attacks. Sunset Park is located just north of the intersection of Union and Jackson Avenues and is on the western-facing side of a rather steep hill. A plan to redesign the park is currently being developed. Firefighters&#x27; Memorial Park is a pocket park located at the intersection of Park and Mortimer Avenues.

Lincoln Park has been host to town events, concerts, and memorials for decades. The Rutherford Community Band plays concerts during the summer. Other summer concerts are sponsored by the borough, as well as several movie nights in the park. In the fall, it has hosted the Bergen County Cultural Festival, which is funded and run by the Civil Rights Commission.

The Nereid Boat Club occupies a former boat sales building on the Passaic, at the foot of Newell Avenue. The rowing club, established in Nutley in 1875, relocated to Rutherford in 1996.

==Government==
===Local government===
Rutherford is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Rutherford is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The borough operates with numerous committees to assist the government in carrying out its responsibilities. In addition to statutory bodies such as the planning board and zoning board of adjustment, dozens of volunteers staff other committees appointed annually, providing recommendations to the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Rutherford is Democrat Frank Nunziato, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023.

The Rutherford School District serves the borough&#x27;s public school students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of five schools, had an enrollment of 2,652 students and 208.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.7:1. Public education began in Rutherford prior to 1900, but the oldest school structure that is still standing is the former Park School, built in 1902. It is currently the home of the Rutherford borough hall, on Park Avenue. Schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Kindergarten Center (opened in 2014), 
Lincoln School (490 students; in grades Pre-K–3), 
Washington School (326; 1–3), 
Pierrepont School (595; 4–6), 
Union School (424; 7–8) and 
Rutherford High School (762; 9–12), built in 1922.

Rutherford formerly had three &quot;neighborhood&quot; schools for grades K–5 (Washington, Lincoln, and Sylvan) which fed into two &quot;magnet&quot; schools for 6–8. The magnet schools also served as elementary schools for their neighborhoods. Sylvan School was closed at the end of the 2004–2005 school year and has become a handicapped preschool, as well as office space for the special services department.

Public school students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student&#x27;s home school district.
St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was established in Rutherford in the 1890s and opened a school shortly thereafter. The parish offers The Academy at Saint Mary for preschool through eighth grade and St. Mary High School, founded in 1929. Both schools are operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.

In 1942, Fairleigh Dickinson University was founded in Rutherford as a two-year college, anchored by the Iviswold Castle on Montross Avenue, which was built in the 1880s as a summer home by David B. Ivison. After FDU expanded to a four-year college and then to offering graduate programs, it acquired other, larger campuses, and eventually left Rutherford, offering the campus for sale due to financial difficulties. In the fall of 1997, the Rutherford campus was purchased by Felician College, an independent private Roman Catholic institution, which often has cultural and community events.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Bergen County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
In the 1920s, the original Route 17 came through downtown Rutherford. Following the 1927 New Jersey State Highway renumbering, the new New Jersey Route 2 (later Route 17) was built in 1928, skirting the southeast edge of the borough, between the residential area and the New Jersey Meadowlands.

In 1948, a new bypass road along the southwest edge of the borough was built to bring traffic from Clifton and points west to the Lincoln Tunnel. The construction of the highway spur Route S3 (now Route 3) caused the demolition or relocation of numerous borough homes. In 2013, the Route 3 bridge over the Passaic River was replaced, and further improvements were made to the Rutherford section of the highway. The swing span of the Union Avenue Bridge over the Passaic was replaced in June 2002 as part of a $9.5 million project.

A short portion of the New Jersey Turnpike Western Spur (Interstate 95) passes through the southern section of Rutherford, but the closest interchange is located in neighboring East Rutherford at exit 16W.

===Public transportation===

Thanks to its easy access to New York City by rail, Rutherford became an early bedroom community. Following the initial wave of settlement in the late 19th century, an additional building boom occurred in the 1920s, when the majority of the borough&#x27;s current housing stock was constructed.

Public Service Railway brought trolley lines into Rutherford around the start of the 20th century. The lines extended east to Jersey City, south to Newark, north to Hackensack, and west to Passaic. By the late 1940s, the trolleys were replaced by bus service.

After the opening of the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937, the Inter-City Bus Company began bus service direct from Paterson to New York City. The line was taken over by NJ Transit in the early 1980s.

Today, NJ Transit offers service to and from New York City&#x27;s Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on several routes. The 163 offers rush hour service only, as Rutherford is not typically along its route. The 190 offers local service along Union Avenue and Orient Way. The 191, 192 and 195 routes all serve the portion of Rutherford that is adjacent to Route 3, as well as the portion of Route 17 that goes through Rutherford. The 76 bus provides service between Hackensack and Newark.

Rutherford&#x27;s train station, which was built by the Erie Railroad in 1898, serves passengers on NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line. Service is available to Suffern and various stations along Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Port Jervis Line, as well as all other Bergen County Line stations as Rutherford is the last stop before Secaucus Junction. Service is also provided to Hoboken Terminal with connections to Hudson–Bergen Light Rail, PATH, and NY Waterway service, and customers can connect at Secaucus for trains to New York Penn Station, Newark Liberty International Airport, and points west and south along the Morris &amp; Essex Lines, North Jersey Coast Line, Northeast Corridor Line, and Montclair-Boonton Line. Access to the Raritan Valley Line is available at either Hoboken or at Newark Penn Station via Secaucus.

<text>Teterboro ( ) is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 61, a decrease of 6 (−9.0%) from the 2010 census count of 67, which in turn reflected an increase of 49 (+272.2%) from the 18 counted in the 2000 census. After being ranked as the fourth-smallest municipality, by population, in New Jersey through the 2010 census, the borough is the third-smallest since the merger of Pine Valley into Pine Hill in 2022.

Teterboro is the home of Teterboro Airport (operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) which takes up a majority of the borough, as well as portions of Hasbrouck Heights and Moonachie.

== History ==
Teterboro was incorporated on March 26, 1917, from land that was part of the boroughs of Moonachie, Little Ferry and Lodi Township. The borough was enlarged on July 5, 1918, by an area annexed from Hasbrouck Heights. The borough was named for Walter C. Teter, a New York investment banker, who had purchased the land in 1917 to build a racetrack and developed a site, reclaiming marshland and building an airport and an 18-hole golf course. The name Teterboro was changed on April 14, 1937, to Bendix Borough, but reverted to Teterboro Borough on June 1, 1943. In 1951, Vera Martucci became the first woman to be elected mayor of the borough.

Throughout the borough&#x27;s history, neighboring municipalities, such as Hasbrouck Heights and South Hackensack, have made repeated attempts to dissolve Teterboro, in hopes of absorbing the borough&#x27;s ratables (the value of land and buildings which are assessed for property taxes). Some have argued that the population is too small for the borough to justify its own existence. However, all such attempts have met with failure. In July 2010, a bill was introduced in the New Jersey state senate in a renewed effort to divide Teterboro among neighboring towns. The bill, sponsored by Senator Robert M. Gordon and Assembly members Connie Wagner and Vincent Prieto, stalled in the state Legislature after its introduction, due to opposition from borough officials, residents, business and land owners, and the neighboring municipalities of Moonachie and Hasbrouck Heights. Legislators attempted to include a 20-year tax abatement within the bill to alleviate the concerns of Teterboro business and property owners who were concerned that taxes could spike if the borough was dissolved. The legality of such an abatement was also called into question.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.11 square miles (2.88 km2), including 1.11 square miles (2.87 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.36%).

Borough officials stated that the 2000 census had failed to count any of the residents of the Vincent Place housing units who had moved into the newly built homes in 1999. The uncounted residents, including the Mayor and all four council members, would help account for a projected tripling of the population enumerated by the census. Previously, the Mayor and Council, as well as several other Vincent Place residents, had all been residents of Huyler Street, the only other street zoned as a residential area in the borough. In a March 2010 article, published in &quot;The Record&quot;, Teterboro&#x27;s municipal manager at the time noted that the actual population of the town had grown to approximately 60.

<text>Upper Saddle River is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,353, an increase of 145 (+1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,208, which in turn reflected an increase of 467 (+6.0%) from the 7,741 counted in the 2000 census.

Upper Saddle River had a per capita income of $73,639 and was ranked 20th in New Jersey based on data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey (ACS) from the United States Census Bureau, more than double the statewide average of $34,858. In the 2013–2017 ACS, Upper Saddle River had a median household income of $176,674 (ranked 8th in the state) and included 42.9% of households earning more than $200,000 annually.

==History==
Upper Saddle River was originally settled by the Lenape Native Americans and was colonized in the 18th century principally by Dutch settlers who built mills along the Saddle River. The area was granted borough status in 1894 and remained principally rural until the 1950s. The suburban growth of New Jersey affected Upper Saddle River and surrounding municipalities, as the borough&#x27;s population increased tenfold from 1950 to 1970. The population has remained fairly constant since 1970.
Predominantly a residential community consisting of one-acre (4,000 m2) lots, Upper Saddle River also contains a library, police station, fire station, ambulance corps, municipal hall, and three primary schools. Commerce and industry are concentrated along the town&#x27;s western border along Route 17. Postal service is shared with the neighboring borough of Saddle River.

Upper Saddle River was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 22, 1894, from portions of Hohokus Township and Orvil Township, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Upper Saddle River&#x27;s referendum passed on November 20, one day after the referendum passed for Saddle River. The name of the river, and hence the borough, is thought to come from early explorers who thought that the geography of the area resembled that of the Sadle Burn, the valley surrounding a stream in the Scottish area of Argyll.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.27 square miles (13.66 km2), including 5.25 square miles (13.60 km2) of land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) of water (0.38%). The borough is bisected by the Saddle River, a tributary of the Passaic River.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Duffys Mills, Hoppers Mills and Posts Mills.

Upper Saddle River is bounded by seven municipalities: Mahwah, Montvale, Ramsey, Saddle River, as well as small portions of Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County, New Jersey; and both Airmont and Chestnut Ridge in the Town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York.

The borough is served by several major highways, including the Garden State Parkway at exits 172 and 171 in Montvale and Woodcliff Lake, and Route 17, which runs through the borough, though some portions of Upper Saddle River are served by roads located in Saddle River, Ramsey and Mahwah.

==Government==

===Local government===
Wood-Ridge is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Wood-Ridge is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Wood-Ridge is Democrat Paul Sarlo, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023; Sarlo also represents the borough and district in the New Jersey Senate. Members of the Borough Council are Ezio I. Altamura (D, 2024), Dominick Azzolini (D, 2023), Michael Donato (D, 2025), Michele A. Mabel (D, 2025), Edward Marino (D, 2024) and Philip D. Romero (D, 2023).

In September 2012, the borough council selected Phil Romero from a list of three candidates offered by the Democratic Municipal Committee to fill the vacant seat of Cosimo &quot;Tom&quot; Gonnella, who had resigned from office to accept a position with the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission after serving 16 years in office, which made him the longest-serving councilmember in borough history.

<doc id="136903" wikidata="Q1021563" url="?curid=136903" title="Wyckoff, New Jersey">
<text>Wyckoff ( ) is an affluent township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 16,585, a decrease of 111 (−0.7%) from the 2010 census count of 16,696, which in turn reflected an increase of 188 (+1.1%) from the 16,508 counted in the 2000 census.

As of the 2010 census, Wyckoff ranked 55th in highest-household income places in the United States with a population of at least 10,000 at $103,614. Statewide, Wyckoff ranked 41st among New Jersey locations by per capita income, with a per capita money income of $49,375 as of 1999, an increase of 49.1% from the $33,124 recorded in 1989.

From the mid-18th century, what is now Wyckoff was a community within Franklin Township, formed on June 1, 1797, when Saddle River Township (now Saddle Brook) was split, which consisted of most of northern Bergen County west of the Saddle River. Starting in the 1840s, several new municipalities were created from portions of Franklin Township (Pompton Township on April 10, 1797, Hohokus Township (now Mahwah) on April 9, 1849, and Ridgewood Township on March 30, 1876; remaining now the Village of Ridgewood), so that today what is now Wyckoff borders eight different communities. Wyckoff was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 2, 1926, replacing Franklin Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Portions of Wyckoff were ceded to Midland Park based on the results of a referendum held on June 9, 1931.

Though there is no solid historical evidence for any of the various theories, the most commonly given origin for the name Wyckoff, which was the origin accepted by the township committee when the municipality was established, is that the name is from the Lenape word , meaning &quot;high ground&quot;, or that it is from , meaning &quot;water&quot;. However, similarly named Wyckoff Heights in New York City is named after the Wyckoff family, who settled in the New York/New Jersey area when both states were part of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. Other sources ascribe the name to Wicaugh in Malpas, England.

==History==
The first known human inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans who lived north of the Raritan River and spoke a Munsee dialect of Algonquian. Sicomac, said to mean &quot;resting place for the departed&quot; or &quot;happy hunting ground&quot;, is an area of Wyckoff that, according to tradition, was the burial place of many Native Americans, including Chief Oratam of the Ackingshacys, and many stores and buildings in the community have been named after the area&#x27;s name, including Sicomac Elementary School. Most Native Americans had left by the 19th century, although a small group lived near Clinton Avenue until 1939.

What is Wyckoff today was originally part of Saddle River Township, which included all of Bergen County west of the Saddle River. Saddle River Township was split in 1771, with the area containing Wyckoff becoming Franklin Township. By 1755, about 100 families lived in the Franklin Township area, of which no more than 20 were in what is now Wyckoff. Franklin Township (1771) consisted of what is today Ho-Ho-Kus (seceded 1849), Ridgewood (seceded 1876), Midland Park (seceded 1894), Oakland (seceded 1902), Franklin Lakes (seceded 1922), and Wyckoff. The size of Franklin Township decreased as areas seceded and were incorporated into their own municipalities. After Franklin Lakes was established in 1922, Franklin Township consisted of only the area known locally as Wyckoff. On November 2, 1926, residents voted (243 positive votes out of 337) to change the name from Franklin Township to the Township of Wyckoff.

The first recorded permanent settlers were John and William Van Voor Haze (Anglicized as Voorhees), who bought of land in the area in 1720. Other early settlers, primarily Dutch, included the Van Horns, Terhunes, Ackermans, Quackenbushes, Pulises and Vanderhoffs. In 1940, the population was just under 4,000, with 30% of the land devoted to farming. By 1969, the number of farms had decreased to 13. By 2012, only two farms remained: Abma&#x27;s Farm and Goffle Road Poultry Farm, which is Bergen County&#x27;s only remaining live market. Rail service by the New Jersey Midland Railway began in 1870. That service was purchased by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, which abruptly ended passenger service in 1966.

The Terhune House is an historic home listed on the National Register of Historic Places, located at 161 Godwin Avenue, that was initially constructed in 1737.

In 1994, the Vander Plaat funeral home prepared the body of Richard Nixon for burial.

Bogdansky (R, 2027), Roger Lane (R, 2026; elected November 2024 to complete an unexpired term), Thomas J. Madigan (R, 2027) and Peter J. Melchionne (R, 2026).

===Township politics===

====2006====

In November 2006, voters approved a ballot measure establishing the Municipal Open Space Tax to support a Municipal Open Space Fund. Authorized for five years, the tax is an annual levy of a half cent per every $100 assessed valuation. The Municipal Open Space Fund is used to &quot;...[acquire] lands for recreation, and conservation purposes,&quot; develop and maintain these lands, &quot;...[acquire] farmland for...preservation purposes,&quot; and preserve and acquire, &quot;...historic properties, structures,
facilities, sites, [etc.]&quot;. In 2011, 2016, and 2021, Wyckoff voters reauthorized the tax and fund. The Russell Farms property was acquired by the township in 2012 for $3.1 million, using $1.2 million from the Municipal Open Space Fund and $1.85 million from a county grant awarded through the Bergen County Open Space Program; Republican mayor Chris DePhillips said the purchase was &quot;...an historic moment for the township&quot;.

====2007====

In the June 2007 Republican primary, committeeman Henry J. McNamara (with 917 votes) defeated challenger Diane Sobin (who earned 713 votes). 17.35% of Wyckoff Republicans turned out for the primary. Afterwards, Sobin launched a write-in campaign against McNamara. In September 2007, McNamara announced that he would not run for re-election due to work commitments, prompting the Bergen County Republican Party&#x27;s committee on Wyckoff to nominate Rudy Boonstra as their general election candidate. At the time of nomination, Boonstra was chairman of the township&#x27;s Board of Adjustment (a position he had served in since 1997) as well as chairman of the Bergen County Republican Party that had selected him; Boonstra had lived in Wyckoff his entire life, and had served on the township&#x27;s Board of Education for 13 years as well as the Ramapo Indian Hills Board of Education for nine.

Sobin continued her write-in campaign on the basis that, &quot;...the township is run by a small circle of friends and relatives, [including] Boonstra,&quot; which, according to Sobin&#x27;s husband, was evidenced by Boonstra&#x27;s cousin, Harold Galenkamp, being a township committeeman at the time as well as the fact that, &quot;...[Boonstra&#x27;s extended] family are likely the largest developers of real estate in Wyckoff,&quot; owning, &quot;about 60 acres&quot;. Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate, Christopher Hillmann, campaigned on Wyckoff purchasing open space and Boonstra advocated for an ordinance that would limit the size of buildings allowed on a given lot. In the November race for one three-year term on the township committee, Boonstra (with 1,866 votes) overcame 1,032 write-in votes cast in opposition and also defeated Hillmann (who earned 754 votes). 35.98% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

====2008====

In the November 2008 election, Brian Scanlan became the first Democrat to win a seat on Wyckoff&#x27;s township committee in 75 years, edging out planning board member Republican Kathleen Scarpelli in a race that was close enough to require that provisional ballots be counted: Republican committeeman David Connolly (with 4,670 votes) and Scanlan (with 4,506) defeated Kathleen Scarpelli (who earned 4,486 votes) and Democrat Brian Hubert (who earned 4,402) in the race for two terms on the committee, which 81.59% of Wyckoff voters turned out for.

Scanlan had first become active in Wyckoff politics in 2005 when he organized a public protest against the proposed development of 99 units on eight acres of the Deep Voll Ravine property; Scanlan fought for a public park on the site, though the Township compromised by approving an alternative plan of nine homes on 13 acres. According to Marsha Stoltz (writing for The Record), Scanlan, &quot;...won public approval for his advocacy and stunned the Republican stronghold when he was elected&quot;.

During the 2008 campaign, the Democrats criticized Wyckoff&#x27;s one-party rule, with Scanlan stating, &quot;We think that the township would be better off if there were alternate points of view,&quot; and suggesting that the committee had ignored dissenting voices — leading to local decisions such as a new Wyckoff Stop &amp; Shop being approved that the pair claimed was, &quot;too large and ugly&quot;; committeeman Connolly countered that, &quot;...governing on the local level is about knowing the community,&quot; and, &quot;On the local level it is not true [that one-party rule is bad],&quot; as, &quot;Politics is personal&quot;.

====2009====

In the November 2009 election, the Republican slate of Chris DePhillips (with 3,696 votes) and zoning board chairman Kevin Rooney (with 3,548) defeated Democrat Brian Hubert (who earned 2,597 votes) and independent Diane Sobin (who earned 2,131) in a race for two three-year terms opened by mayor Joseph Fiorenzo and committeeman Richard Alnor deciding not to run for re-election. 56.61% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

Both teams campaigned on improving committee openness, Smart Growth, fiscal conservatism (with DePhillips and Rooney emphasizing shared services), and open-space preservation (though the Republicans qualified their support as for &quot;economically prudent&quot; preservation). Hubert and Sobin argued that their opponents were &quot;late&quot; to some of these issues (as Sobin, &quot;...[while] point[ing] to her track record regarding open space...question[ed] her opponents&#x27; sincerity...saying that neither signed [the] petition to put a municipal open space tax on the ballot&quot;), characterized them as part of the township&#x27;s &quot;entrenched&quot; Republican establishment (saying they were &quot;handpicked&quot; by Republicans on the Township Committee), suggested there was a need for differing views on the committee, and specifically advocated for televised committee meetings. DePhillips and Rooney, meanwhile, contended that they brought fresh perspectives, were especially focused on responding to voters&#x27; concerns (as evidenced by their estimation that they &quot;...knocked on 80 to 90 percent of doors in the township&quot;), sought to &quot;preserve the character&quot; of Wyckoff, hoped to work closely with township schools, and stated that, &quot;The suggestion is out there that we are...an extension of entrenched incumbents...[but] the incumbents had nothing to do with our running&quot;.

====2010====

In the June 2010 Republican primary, committeeman Rudy Boonstra, serving for the year as mayor, was challenged by Rev. Jeffrey Boucher, a pastor at Wyckoff&#x27;s Powerhouse Christian Church, for nomination as the party&#x27;s committee candidate in the general election. Boonstra touted his long history of volunteering and serving on committees in Wyckoff as well as his role in ongoing land-use agreements whereas Boucher pointed to his work growing Powerhouse and the &quot;vision&quot; a non-profit leader can bring to government. In April 2010, Boonstra formally protested Boucher&#x27;s nominating petition with the county superintendent of elections, pointing out that not every signature had been individually witnessed and that the certifier had not been a Wyckoff resident at the time of validating the petition; Boucher characterized the legal challenge as &quot;beneath him&quot; and an attempt to, &quot;...take the choice away from the people&quot;. Boonstra (with 1,020 votes) fended off Boucher (who earned 520 votes) in a primary that 34.77% of Wyckoff Republicans turned out for.

In October 2010, Republican Tom Madigan, a prolific local volunteer and 12-year Ramapo Indian Hills Board of Education member, was appointed to serve for the remaining one year of what had been Republican committeeman Dave Connolly&#x27;s term until his resignation. Connolly, appointed to the committee in 2004, was the longest serving member currently on the committee at the time of his departure. Connolly&#x27;s tenure included time as chairman of the finance committee and as the Environmental Commission liaison; he cited family priorities as his reason for resigning.

In the November 2010 election, Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra (with 3,691 votes) won re-election to a second term over Democratic challenger Henry Velez (who earned 2,086 votes). 34.77% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election. During the campaign, Boonstra stressed his experience, touted his fiscal conservatism (including having successfully refunded $300,000 in surplus library funds to taxpayers), supported open-space preservation (specifically pointing to Russell Farms and Maple Lake), opposed high-density COAH housing, pledged to align future projects like the Christian Health Care Center and ShopRite with Wyckoff&#x27;s &quot;small town charm&quot;, and advocated for pursuing grants to be used for township parks and recreation improvements; Velez promoted the proposed Christian Health Care Center as a &quot;win-win&quot; that provided open space as well as high-density senior housing, promised to address traffic and road safety issues, and expressed concern over Wyckoff&#x27;s affordability — especially for seniors and individuals on a fixed income.

====2011====

In the November 2011 election, Democratic committeeman Brian Scanlan and a Republican ticket of committeeman Tom Madigan and Zoning Board chairman Doug Christie competed for two seats on the committee. Scanlan (with 2,589 votes) won re-election to his second term and Christie (with 2,179) won his first, denying Tom Madigan (who earned 1,921 votes) re-election. 37.61% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

During the campaign, Scanlan promoted his efforts to limit the municipal tax increase to 1.2% annually, supported shared services, touted his initiatives that included having Wyckoff participate in state sustainability programs and passing an ordinance allowing outdoor dining, and &quot;strongly&quot; endorsed the renewal of the Open Space Trust Fund via ballot measure. The Republicans stressed their fiscal conservatism as well as advocated for shared services; supported the Fair School Funding Plan (in opposition to New Jersey&#x27;s equity-focused school funding formula), which they claimed would have, &quot;...increas[ed] Wyckoff&#x27;s state education aid from 2 percent to over 15 percent&quot;; and criticized how, &quot;New Jersey Democrats forced Council on Affordable Housing mandates,&quot; which they pledged to, &quot;...vigorously oppose...[to] fight to maintain Wyckoff&#x27;s small-town charm&quot;. Madigan had appeared in court in October 2011 over allegations that he slapped a 17-year-old at a Ramapo High School football game in 2010; in November 2011 (after the election) Madigan was found guilty of simple assault, but a state superior court judge overturned this ruling in April 2012.

====2012====

In May 2012, former committeeman Tom Madigan was appointed to a one-year position on the township&#x27;s zoning board. Committeeman Brian Scanlan, the lone Democrat serving at the time, was left out of appointment discussions despite being the liaison to the zoning board. Scanlan criticized &quot;the absence of process&quot; in the decision and suggested (while praising Madigan&#x27;s record of volunteerism), &quot;I would have liked to have cast a wider net in terms of filling this appointment,&quot; such as considering interested candidates who held post-graduate degrees in city planning; committeemen Doug Christie and Kevin Rooney defended Madigan by pointing to his &quot;diligence&quot; and how he, &quot;understands the community...what we try to achieve here&quot;.

In June 2012, Wyckoff received bids for its annual tree and leaf removal services that, in light of a busy season for tree companies, were (at the lowest) more than double the cost of the previous year. Afterwards, Republican committeeman Kevin Rooney (alongside Scott Fisher, head of the Wyckoff Department of Public Works) spearheaded a successful effort for the township to purchase its own tree-service machinery and, thereafter, run the operation internally via the DPW. Democratic committeeman Brian Scanlan, who helped arrange funding for the deal as a member of the finance committee, estimated that the initial investment would pay for itself over two years; Rooney speculated that with further investment in the program Wyckoff taxpayers could collectively save $100,000.

In October 2012, the Township Committee passed an ordinance penalizing &quot;objectionable public displays of behavior&quot; with a $500 fine and up to 90-days imprisonment in an effort to preserve Wyckoff&#x27;s &quot;small-town charm&quot;. Some residents criticized the ordinance as vague, an overstep, and/or apt for litigation; township attorney Robert Landel, meanwhile, defended it, noting that most, &quot;...undesirable behavior is handled as a disorderly persons offense,&quot; and the ordinance, &quot;...is one more vehicle to write a summons&quot;.

In the November 2012 election, Republican committeeman Kevin Rooney and political newcomer Haakon Jepsen, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, ran as a ticket against Democratic challenger and Wyckoff public school teacher Eileen Avia for two seats on the committee; Republican mayor Chris DePhillips decided not to run for re-election. When asked by the Wyckoff Suburban News what the &quot;single most important issue facing residents&quot; was, the Republicans replied that keeping taxes low was their main concern, saying, &quot;Wyckoff has a winning fiscal record thanks to its long legacy of Republican leadership,&quot; and claiming they had the &quot;vision&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; necessary to maintain Wyckoff&#x27;s history of, &quot;...some of the lowest taxes and highest property values in Bergen County&quot;; Avia also raised property taxes as the most important issue in the election, though she went on to caution against, &quot;...attempting to reign in property taxes with overdevelopment,&quot; as she argued it could endanger Wyckoff&#x27;s &quot;small town feel&quot;, natural environment, and traffic safety as well as intensify trends she viewed as encapsulated in, &quot;Overbuilding...[having] transformed our town center into a vast, paved lanscape with no aesthetic merit&quot;. Jepsen additionally ran on &quot;tapping into&quot; Wyckoff&#x27;s culture through programs and events and enhancing communication between Wykoffians and the committee, while Avia broached affordability issues for senior citizens, emphasized shared services and trimming the school budget, and supported increased police funding as well as, specifically, televised committee meetings. Rooney (with 5,129 votes) and Jepsen (with 4,721) defeated Avia (who earned 3,578 votes). 73.76% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

====2013====

In June 2013, the Committee tabled an ordinance proposed by Democratic committeeman Brian Scanlan that would have banned smoking in public areas (such as parks, outside municipal buildings like firehouses and the library, and in municipal outdoor recreation areas) and also would have codified Board of Education policies prohibiting smoking outside schools. Some residents argued that the proposed ordinance was an overreach, both legally and in principle; the Committee decided the proposal would create an &quot;unjustified burden&quot; for adults while Republican committeeman Haakon Jepsen led criticism of the proposal amongst officials, saying, &quot;The more I looked at it, the less I liked it,&quot; and Republican committeeman Kevin Rooney added, &quot;Who are we trying to protect?&quot;. In July 2013, a slightly different ordinance was reintroduced and, in August, passed — with its changes being the exclusion of parking lots and roadways into parks from the ban&#x27;s purview as well as the addition of the newly-public Russell Farms Community Park and Larkin House properties.

In the November 2013 election, Republican Committeeman Rudy Boonstra ran unopposed for re-election to his third term. He received 3,498 votes, with 44.61% of Wyckoff voters turning out for the election.

Committeeman Kevin J. Rooney won the 2013 version of the Food Network series &quot;Chopped&quot;, donating his $10,000 winnings to Oasis—A Haven for Women and Children based in Paterson.

====2014====

In the November 2014 election, Democratic committeeman Brian Scanlan (with 3,204 votes) and Republican mayor Doug Christie (with 2,808) won re-election (to their third and second terms, respectively) over Republican challenger — a member of the zoning board and owner of a Wyckoff small business, Yudin&#x27;s Appliances — Susan Yudin (who earned 2,394 votes). 46.55% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

Scanlan campaigned on many of the same issues that he had raised in the 2011 race, but in 2014 he additionally touted how he was the first committee member to refuse the position&#x27;s stipend, declined entry into the offered state pension plan, and turned down PBA cards. Yudin advocated for including a woman&#x27;s perspective on the all-male committee and, after being defeated, vowed to, &quot;&#x27;throw my hat in the ring&#x27; again&quot;.

====2015====

In June 2015, Wyckoff Board of Education and Zoning Board member John Carolan was appointed to the Township Committee following Republican committeeman Doug Christie&#x27;s May 2015 resignation due to moving out of town.

In June 2015, The Pulis Field Recreation Complex, an outdoor artificial turf field located behind the Wyckoff YMCA, was opened; its funding came from donations and fundraisers but mostly from the Wyckoff YMCA itself. Recently resigned committeeman Doug Christie declared that the committee&#x27;s work to construct the field was his proudest accomplishment, saying, &quot;...when I became mayor in 2013, I brought everyone together and it started to happen&quot;. In September 2015, the township committee unanimously approved allocating $300,000 from the Municipal Open Space Fund to light the complex. Given these upgrades, residents of the nearby 55-plus community, Spring Meadow, voiced concerns about noise and light pollution as well as traffic congestion; the president of the Wyckoff Environmental Commission, Harriet Shugarman, suggested that while, &quot;...open space funds can be used on recreation, she hoped it would be used in the future to preserve open space&quot;. In March 2018, the township committee renamed one field in the complex (previously called Pulis Field 3) to Ben Landel Memorial Field in honor of a Wyckoff 18 year old (and son of Robert Landel, the township attorney) who died in January following a nine-month battle with an aggressive cancer, NUT midline carcinoma.

In the June 2015 Republican primaries, mayor Kevin Rooney and 2014 candidate Susan Yudin ran unopposed for nomination as the party&#x27;s general election Township Committee ticket; Republican committeeman Haakon Jepsen decided not to run for a second term. Former Republican committeeman Tom Madigan, meanwhile, gathered signatures for a petition to run as an independent in the November competition. Yudin launched a failed effort to invalidate this petition (and thereby remove Madigan from the general election ballot), alleging, in a number of suits that eventually reached state superior court, that Madigan had not personally witnessed each signature. Upon Yudin&#x27;s motion being denied, Madigan characterized her actions as amounting to a, &quot;...baseless claim that she should be permitted to run unopposed,&quot; and stated that because, &quot;...Yudin had a high-priced Bergen County Republican Organization lawyer while I was my own counsel,&quot; the suit&#x27;s failure was, &quot;...a win for the little guy&quot;.

In the November 2015 general election, Susan Yudin and mayor Kevin Rooney as Republicans and Tom Madigan as an independent competed for two three-year terms while Republican committeeman John Carolan ran unopposed for election to the remaining two years of the term he been appointed to in June. Rooney (with 1,996 votes) and Madigan (with 1,735) won re-election and election over Yudin (who earned 1,295 votes); John Carolan also won election, earning 1,792 votes, while 26.99% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

When asked by the media what the most important issue facing Wyckoff was, Carolan responded that maintaining fiscally-conservative local government and using his position to nurture a positive community through &quot;...programs that advocate outstanding schools, wellness, acceptance, and recreation,&quot; were most critical; Madigan brought up taming property taxes (the increase in which he blamed, partially, on the township receiving little state aid) through shared services and relying on local volunteers; Rooney cited an impetus to face &quot;increasing challenges from...unfunded state and county mandates, COAH housing obligations, increased traffic...and [decaying] infrastructure,&quot; while championing Wyckoff&#x27;s sense of community; and Yudin raised keeping taxes low as her primary objective, which she believed could be achieved through, &quot;...more transparency in [local] government,&quot; such as, &quot;Televising meetings of the Township Committee and land use boards, advertising for open positions in township jobs and vacancies on boards...[banning] nepotism in township jobs, and rotating the position of mayor among all Township Committee members&quot;.

====2016====

In the November 2016 election, Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra ran unopposed for his fourth term and earned 5,665 votes. 76.43% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

====2017====

At the January 2017 reorganization meeting, the Committee selected Republican Rudy Boonstra to act as mayor for the year, passing over Democrat Brian Scanlan despite his never having been selected (though he was entering his ninth year on the body) and the fact that he had served as deputy mayor in 2016 (a role which, in seven of the prior 10 years, resulted in the serving member being chosen as mayor the following year). According to local media, skipping over Scanlan for the position was part of continued efforts by, &quot;The committee&#x27;s four Republican members...to relegate Scanlan to minor committees and subordinate roles,&quot; and resulted in a year of residential protests, including Wyckoffians submitting letters-to-the-editor to patch.com and The Record.

Eventually, in July 2017, Wyckoff resident Steve Joern submitted a petition (with over 900 Wyckoffians&#x27; signatures) to the township committee that proposed a ballot question be added to the November election which would have asked residents if a nonpartisan subcommittee should be established to explore alternative methods for selecting the mayor, &quot;...including a direct election...by the voters of Wyckoff&quot;. In August, the committee voted to deny the ballot question&#x27;s addition but, in response, immediately created a subcommittee of Scanlan and independent committeeman Tom Madigan to investigate Wyckoff&#x27;s electoral options. After one of the three scheduled subcommittee meetings transpired and the mayor-selection process had become a local election issue, Scanlan stated, &quot;It&#x27;s clear to me that [the Republicans] don&#x27;t want to consider any alternatives to the current system,&quot; while Madigan retorted, &quot;Brian Scanlan obviously is not putting his partisanship aside&quot;.

In January 2018, the Madigan-Scanlan subcommittee released its report, making three recommendations — the most crucial of which proposed eliminating the deputy mayor position and the expectations it sets. The subcommittee agreed that fundamentally changing the township-government structure to a different one appropriate for Wyckoff&#x27;s size would grant too much power to the mayor and/or town manager; Scanlan, however, included his hopes for non-partisan elections in the report and suggested passing an ordinance to have the mayoral selection tied to which committee member had received the most votes in the previous election, whereas Madigan praised the current form of government, suggesting it incubated sufficiently bipartisan elections.

Also at the January 2017 reorganization meeting, the Committee appointed Republican Timothy Shanley to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that had been held by committeeman Kevin Rooney until he resigned from office to fill the vacant Assembly seat that had been held by Scott Rumana.

In the November 2017 election, four candidates — Republican candidate Hayley Rooney (the wife of former-committeeman and then-assemblyman Kevin Rooney) and committeeman John Carolan as well as Democratic newcomer Melissa Rubenstein and committeeman Brian Scanlan — ran for two three-year terms on the committee, whereas Republican committeeman Tim Shanley and Democratic challenger Carla Pappalardo competed for the remaining one year of the term Shanley had been appointed to in January; the three Democrats ran under the slogan &quot;One Wyckoff&quot;. Scanlan (with 3,340 votes) was elected to his fourth term while Rubenstein (with 2,893) defeated Carolan (who earned 2,809 votes) and Rooney (who earned 2,788); provisional ballots had to be counted because of how close Rubenstein and Carolan&#x27;s vote totals were. Meanwhile, Shanley (with 2,983 votes) defeated Pappalardo (who earned 2,894). 49.72% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

The township&#x27;s election procedures emerged as campaign issues in 2017, as Scanlan (despite sitting on a subcommittee responsible for delivering a report on the subject in December) and Pappalardo called for Wyckoff to change its government from partisan to non-partisan as well as for having residents directly elect the mayor; the opposing ticket and other local Republicans criticized changing the township government in any way, arguing that Bergen County towns with non-partisan governments (such as Ridgewood and Hackensack) are &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, have a high tax rate, and are &quot;some of the worst run towns in New Jersey&quot;. The Democrats additionally supported videotaping committee meetings while Rubenstein individually advocated for full-day kindergarten throughout the township. The Record characterized the competition for the partisan balance of power on the committee as &quot;a noisy contest&quot; while mayor Rudy Boonstra said, &quot;...passions [were] running...high&quot;. Democrats saw wins throughout the state in 2017, but Rubenstein and Pappalardo claimed the party&#x27;s success in Wyckoff had &quot;more to do with&quot; Scanlan and his legacy; Rubenstein called her win a &quot;Brian victory&quot; while Pappalardo said that Wyckoff is, &quot;...still a Republican stronghold. Brian was the engine, and I was the caboose&quot;; Scanlan, instead, believed Democrats&#x27; local gains were a backlash against, &quot;...partisanship at the national level&quot;.

====2018====

At the January 2018 reorganization meeting, committeeman Brian Scanlan was unanimously chosen as Wyckoff&#x27;s first Democratic mayor and no deputy mayor was selected. Rubenstein, Scanlan&#x27;s running mate, was also sworn in, becoming the second Democrat in over 80 years, second woman, and first Jewish person to serve on the committee.

During the 2018 election cycle, three candidates — incumbent Republican Tim Shanley and incumbent Tom Madigan (who, after running as an independent in 2015, now filed as a Republican) as well as Democratic challenger Carla Pappalardo — ran for two seats on the township committee. In November, Shanley (with 5,107 votes) was elected to his first full term and Madigan (with 4,667) was re-elected to his second consecutive term, defeating Pappalardo (who earned 3,705 votes). 68.61% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

Pappalardo was endorsed by Congressman and Wyckoff-resident Josh Gottheimer, mayor Brian Scanlan, and Wyckoff-resident Steve Joern, who launched a petition to rethink the township&#x27;s electoral processes in 2017; in his endorsement, Joern wrote that, &quot;...if Carla Pappalardo is elected...she will help move [the petition&#x27;s goals] forward...she will respond to the many voices in Wyckoff asking to be heard, including on the mayoral vote issue&quot;.

In a letter-to-the-editor submitted to patch.com, Pappalardo stated that her platform consisted of efficient spending, improved water quality, and increased committee transparency through televised meetings — which she claimed her opponents opposed — as well as through ending &quot;political board appointments&quot; and &quot;nepotism&quot;; in the letter Pappalardo also said, &quot;If elected, I look forward to working closely with Rudy Boonstra, Tim Shanley, Melissa Rubenstein, and Brian Scanlan and creating a high functioning team&quot;. This prompted Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra to compose his own letter-to-the-editor where he responded, &quot;I feel her statement...is a bit presumptuous as we do not know each other...[and] she has not attended one Township Committee meeting this year,&quot; going further to allege that, &quot;...at a recent Ramapo Indian Hills Board Of Education meeting...she referred to Wyckoff as, &#x27;a cheap-a** Dutch town&#x27;,&quot; which he interpreted, &quot;...as an ethnic slur aimed at me and members of my family who have served Wyckoff well for decades in numerous capacities&quot;.

====2019====

In April 2019 the Township Committee approved the 2019 municipal budget, which included $307,150 in funding that was partially dedicated to establishing the technology necessary to record future meetings and make them available online.

In May 2019, Committeewoman Melissa Rubenstein, who had been elected in 2017 as a Democrat, switched her party affiliation to Republican.

In June 2019, a controversy emerged over whether Wyckoff should fly the gay pride flag at town hall. Republican Mayor Tom Madigan denied calls from residents and local activists, including a petition with over 1000 signatures and a 100-person rally, citing concerns that flying the flag could create a public forum where the town could be forced to recognize any cause. A year later, in June 2020, Republican Mayor Tim Shanley led the township committee in flying the pride flag on a pole near the library on the same municipal lot as town hall; Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra abstained from the flag-raising ceremony, and Shanley accused Madigan, now a committeeman, of saying he &quot;wanted no ceremony,&quot; and &quot;to strike &#x27;proudly&#x27; from the resolution supporting the cause when we passed it this year&quot;.

In the November 2019 election, Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra (with 2,530 votes) won re-election to his fifth term over Democratic challenger David Mangot (who earned 1,415 votes). 30.71% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

Democratic committeeman Brian Scanlan resigned on election day in November 2019 with a year remaining in his fourth term; he cited a desire to work on a national climate change agenda, reflecting the environmental causes he had championed during his tenure. Mayor Tom Madigan said of the resignation that he was &quot;surprised&quot; and &quot;disappointed&quot; because he believed Scanlan announced on election day &quot;to upstage both local candidates&quot;.

In December 2019, Beth Fischer was chosen to fill Scanlan&#x27;s seat for the remaining one year of what had been his term; this was the first time two women served simultaneously on Wyckoff&#x27;s township committee (the other being Melissa Rubenstein), and Fischer (who was, at the time, commissioner of the Wyckoff Environmental Commission) pledged to carry on Scanlan&#x27;s legacy of environmental activism.

====2020====

In November 2020, Republican Peter Melchionne won election to his first term and Republican committeewoman Melissa Rubenstein won re-election to her second term (with 6,269 and 6,342 votes, respectively) over the Democratic slate — Lisa Eidel and committeewoman Beth Fischer (who earned 4,548 and 4,717 votes).

When campaigning, Fischer touted her history of volunteerism, commitment to environmental issues, and an effective first year on the committee; Eidel asserted a need for differing perspectives on the committee (especially in light of Rubenstein&#x27;s party switch) and to focus on urban planning; Melchionne claimed, &quot;Our opponents want to change Wyckoff the town we call home&quot; and promised, instead, to improve and maintain fundamental aspects of the township like local businesses, recreation, and safety; and Rubenstein similarly stated that, &quot;Our opponents believe that Wyckoff needs to change&quot; and she named utilities quality and reliability as her chief concern. Additionally, Eidel received attention for her social advocacy, including playing a leading role in pushing Wyckoff to fly the gay pride flag and speaking at a June 2020 &quot;rally for equality&quot; that was organized after a local Chinese restaurant was vandalized with racially-charged graffiti; at the rally, Eidel stated, &quot;I&#x27;m a gay woman with two Black sons in a white community...if I don&#x27;t stand up to the fact that there&#x27;s racism in this town, who is going to?&quot;. Fischer was the only committee member to attend the rally, and Eidel alleged that Republican mayor Tim Shanley had been asked twice by organizers to speak at the event — but that he failed to answer.

Upon Melchionne&#x27;s taking office in January 2021, Wyckoff had an all-Republican township committee for the first time since 2009.

====2021====

In August 2021 the township committee voted to move Wyckoff Board of Education elections from November to April, claiming that, in part because April elections would allow residents a direct vote on the school budget, the move would increase Board of Education transparency and accountability. The Board President criticized the committee&#x27;s vote as a &quot;highly political&quot; decision that would &quot;adversely affect the quality of education in Wyckoff&quot;, and others cited concerns about lower voter turnout in April elections. In September 2021, the Wyckoff Board of Education voted to move the election back to November.

In September 2021, former chairman of the Bergen County Republican Organization Committee Bob Yudin launched a write-in campaign against Republican township committeeman Tom Madigan. Yudin argued that Madigan&#x27;s role in moving the Wyckoff Board of Education elections from November to April was &quot;a blatant attempt to reduce the voter turnout so Madigan and his minions will have a better chance to put their people into office&quot;, and he also attacked Madigan&#x27;s character by citing a dismissed 2010 complaint that charged him with slapping a 17-year-old.

In November 2021, Madigan (with 4,130 votes) was re-elected to his third consecutive term and Republican committeeman Tim Shanley (with 5,292) won re-election to his second while 1,291 write-in votes were cast in opposition. 51.91% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election and no Democrats ran.

====2022====

In the November 2022 election, Republican committeeman Rudy Boonstra ran unopposed for his sixth term and earned 4,867 votes. 55.64% of Wyckoff voters turned out for the election.

====2023====

In January 2023, Scott Fisher, the former manager of the township&#x27;s public works department, was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Melissa Rubenstein until she resigned from office the previous month.

At the 2023 Ramapo Indian Hills Board of Education reorganization meeting, Republican committeeman Tom Madigan was called upon by board president Judith Sullivan; he stated that the newly constituted parents&#x27; rights majority on the Board was, &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; and that, &quot;...voters will be &#x27;well served&#x27;&quot;.

In the November 2023 election, Republican committeeman Scott Fisher (with 3,094 votes) was elected to his first full term on Wyckoff&#x27;s township committee while fellow Republican committeeman Peter Melchionne (with 3,039) was re-elected to his second. 34.81% of Wyckoff turned out for the election and both candidates ran unopposed.

====2024====

In January 2024, Roger Lane was unanimously approved to replace Scott Fisher on the township committee (through the November 2024 election) following Fisher&#x27;s resignation &quot;due to recent family matters&quot; earlier in the month. Lane had previously served on the Ramapo Indian Hills Board of Education from 1999 to 2002 and was a New Milford councilman, and later mayor, throughout the 1980s.

Throughout spring 2024, Wyckoff Republicans campaigned in the lead up to a competitive June primary determining who would represent the party in the November township committee races — one race for two new three-year terms on the township committee and another to decide who would serve out the remaining two years of what had been Scott Fisher&#x27;s term. In the two-seat contest, incumbent committeeman and former mayor Tim Shanley ran as a slate with Drita McNamara (head of the District 40 Republican committee and chairwoman of Wyckoff&#x27;s delegation within the Bergen County Republican Organization) against the team of incumbent committeeman and former mayor Tom Madigan and Wyckoff Republican Club vice president Mae Bogdansky, whose husband was a member of the Ramapo Indian Hills Board of Education at the time. In the latter race, Christopher Joachim, a longtime Wyckoff volunteer firefighter, joined Shanley and McNamara&#x27;s ticket to run against Roger Lane, who had served on the committee since his appointment in January, as he campaigned alongside Madigan and Bogdansky.

The Shanley, McNamara, and Joachim team was endorsed by the Bergen County Republican Organization and appeared on ballots&#x27; first column (the &quot;party line&quot; that tends to boost candidates) whereas Madigan, Bogdansky, and Lane organized alternatively as &quot;Republicans for Wyckoff&quot; and appeared on the second column, having been endorsed by Wyckoff mayor Pete Melchionne and committeeman Rudy Boonstra. The Record speculated that the local party split, especially between Madigan and Shanley who previously ran together in 2018 and 2021, was connected to cultural divides and potential &quot;Concern about officials blurring the line that traditionally separates education and municipal government&quot; — pointing to how Madigan and Bogdansky actively supported parents&#x27; rights board of education members, frequently speaking at meetings, and how Madigan campaigned, in his words, as a &quot;believer in family values.&quot; During an interview with radio station New Jersey 101.5, Bogdansky said of divisions amongst Wyckoff Republicans that their opponents and local allies were, &quot;...running under the platform of bringing the community together, yet they&#x27;re not doing it...we have this little swamp growing...but we&#x27;re gonna drain it really quick.&quot; Shanley&#x27;s slate advocated for more-fiscally-conservative municipal borrowing and debt management plus increased communication between the committee and Wyckoff residents, ultimately framing their message as, &quot;...keep[ing] the traditions of Wyckoff that have united us, and...bring[ing] us back to our roots and toward a better more unified tomorrow,&quot; while Madigan&#x27;s ticket focused on increased school and pedestrian safety as well as support for first responders, replying to their opponent&#x27;s statement that: &quot;To say Wyckoff needs change or has lost values is insulting. The spirit of Wyckoff is strong...Our slate stands proud of Wyckoff&#x27;s rich history.&quot;

In the June 2024 primary, Madigan (with 1,171 votes) and Bogdansky (with 1,167) defeated Shanley (who earned 950 votes) and McNamara (who earned 894), while Lane (with 1,140 votes) bested Joachim (who earned 934 votes).

<text>Bass River Township is a township at the southeastern tip of Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township bears a shoreline fronting both the Bass River and the Great Bay. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,355, a decrease of 88 (−6.1%) from the 2010 census count of 1,443, which in turn had reflected a decline of 67 (−4.4%) from the 1,510 counted in the 2000 census. The township and all of Burlington County is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. Bass River is traversed by the Garden State Parkway.

Bass River was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 30, 1864, from portions of Little Egg Harbor Township and Washington Township.

<text>Evesham Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a suburb of Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-most populous city. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 46,826, an increase of 1,288 (+2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 45,538, which in turn reflected an increase of 3,263 (+7.7%) from the 42,275 counted in the 2000 census. Colloquially, the area is referred to as Marlton, the name of a community within the township.

The township is part of the South Jersey region of the state and, along with all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
The area now known as Evesham Township was originally settled by Quakers in 1672. The township&#x27;s name may have been inspired by the town of Evesham in England or possibly by a prominent English settler, Thomas Eves.

On November 6, 1688, Evesham Township was established as &#x27;Eversham&#x27; in the Province of West Jersey, preceding the formation of the county itself. The extra &quot;R&quot; in the name was later dropped. It was officially incorporated as part of New Jersey&#x27;s first 104 townships through the Township Act of 1798, enacted by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798.

Over time, portions of the township were sectioned off to form separate townships: Washington Township was formed on November 19, 1802, Medford Township on March 1, 1847, and Mount Laurel Township on March 7, 1872. The township was considerably larger than its present-day borders, initially encompassing what are now known as Mount Laurel, Medford, Lumberton, Hainesport, Shamong, and Washington Townships. Geographically, the South Branch of the Rancocas on the east and Cropwell Creek on the west originally bounded this area.

The township was incorporated in 1692, becoming one of the initial thirteen townships in Burlington County. Following subsequent separations, Evesham Township was divided for the final time in 1872, when the northern part of the township was designated as Mount Laurel Township.

Evesham Township is often referred to as Marlton, a name that is used interchangeably, originating from the census-designated place within the township. The moniker &#x27;Marlton&#x27; traces its origins to the early 19th century and is derived from &quot;marl,&quot; a naturally occurring mixture of green clay with shell remnants, which was used as a fertilizer. The extraction of marl, a significant economic activity, catalyzed the first &quot;building boom&quot; in the 1830s and 1840s. Local marl mining continued until 1930.

Recognized as a village in 1758, Marlton was officially named in 1845. That same year, both the &quot;Evesham&quot; Post Office and the &quot;Evesham&quot; Baptist Church adopted the &quot;Marlton&quot; name. To this day, most maps and directional signs use &#x27;Marlton&#x27; rather than &#x27;Evesham&#x27;. The historical village, Olde Marlton, largely remains intact and is recognized as a locally regulated Historic District. The township instituted full-time police services in 1966.

Until the 1950s, Evesham Township retained much of its original character. However, developers began purchasing farms and creating the township&#x27;s first housing developments, eliminating significant farmland by the present day.

In 1955, the United States Army opened the PH-32 Nike Ajax facility on a on Tomlinson Mill Road. This facility served as one of twelve defense installations protecting Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from potential aerial attacks during the Cold War. The base was decommissioned in the mid-1960s and subsequently served various purposes, including acting as a civil defense center. By the mid-1990s, the site had been repurposed into a housing development.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 29.59 square miles (76.62 km2), including 29.16 square miles (75.51 km2) of land and 0.43 square miles (1.11 km2) of water (1.45%).

Marlton is an historic community, census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated area within Evesham Township with 10,260 residents (as of Census 2010) that covers of the township. &quot;Marlton&quot; is often used in place of the township&#x27;s name, often referring to locations beyond the CDP&#x27;s boundaries.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names partially or completely within the township include Berlin Heights, Cambridge Park, Cropwell, Crowfoot, Donlontown, Elmwood Road, Evans Corner, Evesboro, Gibbs Mill, Milford, Pine Grove and Tomlinsons Mill.

The township borders the municipalities of Mount Laurel and Medford in Burlington County; and Berlin Township, Cherry Hill, Voorhees Township and Waterford Township in Camden County.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes parts of Burlington County, along with areas in Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The township had first switched to the Council-Manager Plan B of the Faulkner Act on July 1, 1969 to replace the township committee government.

The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the four-member Township Council, all elected at-large in elections held every other year. The Mayor is elected directly by the voters. Members are elected in partisan elections to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with two council seats up for vote in even-numbered years as part of the November general election. In 2009, a change was approved to shift municipal elections from May to November and from non-partisan to partisan, with officials citing low May turnout and costs estimated at $50,000 to oversee the municipal elections.

, the Mayor of Evesham Township is Democrat Jaclyn Veasy, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Evesham Township Council are Deputy Mayor Ginamarie A.

On March 6, 2010, Democratic Mayor Randy Brown announced he was switching parties to become a Republican, citing philosophical disagreements. That same year, he endorsed Jon Runyan, a Republican for Congress.

In November 2010, the Republican slate swept the township&#x27;s first partisan elections, with Mayor Randy Brown and Councilmember Debbie Hackman winning re-election along with newcomer Steve Zeuli.

Deputy Mayor Joe Howarth resigned from the council in December 2011 in advance of taking a seat on the Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders, with his council seat filled until November 2012 chosen from among prospective candidates selected by the local Republican committee. In January 2012, Ken D&#x27;Andrea was selected to fill Howarth&#x27;s vacancy. Robert DiEnna was chosen in September 2013 to fill the vacancy of Kurt Croft following his resignation.

In 2011, the circle, which handled 90,000 vehicles a day and was the site of as many as 175 accidents a year, was replaced by a grade-separated interchange that allows Route 73 to pass over Route 70.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit provides bus service in the township on the 406 route that runs between Berlin and Philadelphia.

The Atco station, in Waterford Township just south of the township&#x27;s border, provides New Jersey Transit train service to the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia and the Atlantic City Rail Terminal in Atlantic City on the Atlantic City Line.

<text>Hainesport Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,035, a decline of 75 (-1.2%) from the 2010 census enumeration of 6,110, in turn reflecting an increase of 1,984 (+48.1%) from the 4,126 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
The Lenape Native Americans who settled on the banks of the Rancocas Creek in what is present-day Hainesport called the area Sandhickney. The first European settlers were Quakers who arrived in 1677.

The town was known as Long Bridge around the time of the American Revolutionary War. The name came from the long, wooden bridge that spanned the Rancocas Creek. In 1778, the township was the site of a skirmish in which American rebels fired upon Hessian soldiers after they were halted by the dismantling of this bridge.

The settlement became known as Haines&#x27; Port when Barclay Haines bought property in the area and established a pier near his home on the Rancocas Creek in 1848. By 1850, the name was shortened to Hainesport. Hainesport Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 12, 1924, from portions of Lumberton.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 6.79 square miles (17.59 km2), including 6.47 square miles (16.76 km2) of land and 0.32 square miles (0.83 km2) of water (4.71%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Clermont, Creekview, Franklin Estates, The Glen at Mason&#x27;s Creek, Hainesport Chase, Lakeside at Creekview, Mason&#x27;s Woods, Oakdale, Rancocas Heights, Sage Run and Union Mills.

The township borders Lumberton, Mount Laurel, Mount Holly and Westampton (across the Rancocas Creek north branch).

==Government==

===Local government===
Mansfield Township is governed under the Township form of government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Township Committee is comprised of five members who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. Legislative and executive powers of the township are exercised by the Township Committee as a whole, with the mayor presiding over meetings and voting as a member of the committee.

, members of the Mansfield Township Committee are Mayor Marcial Mojena (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2024; term as mayor ends 2024), Deputy Mayor Brian Sisz (R, 2024), Tim Boyd (R, 2025), Valerie Jennings (R, 2026), and Kelly Stobie (R, 2026).

====Local elections====
In 2020, independent candidates Dan Golenda and Bob Tallon ran a successful write-in campaign against incumbent Republicans Janice DiGiuseppe and her running mate Efthimios &quot;Paul&quot; Tsiknakis, winning 4,812 total votes versus 4,262. This was in response to a public outcry of Mansfield losing an affordable housing litigation suit, and the then-committee voting several actively-farmed parcels as &quot;redevelopment&quot; to cover financial issues in the township, which started a warehousing boom in the community. The following year 2021, Marcial Mojena (R) and Paul &#x27;Brian&#x27; Sisz (R) ran a similarly successful &quot;No More Warehouses&quot; campaign. In 2022, the committee adopted an ordinance to remove warehousing as a permitted use in all zones of the township, until the impact from the currently approved warehouses in the township could be evaluated.

Janice A. DiGiuseppe resigned in August 2015, citing personal reasons for leaving office after five years. The following month, the council selected Laverne Cholewa from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacancy. In November 2015, Cholewa was elected to serve the two years remaining on the term of office previously held by DiGiuseppe.

In 2023, Republicans Valerie Jennings and Kelly Stobie were elected, returning the Township Committee to 5-0 Republican control.

====2013 revaluation issues====
After a property revaluation was completed in 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the local school districts, the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.

===Federal, state and county representation===

<doc id="136920" wikidata="Q3015360" url="?curid=136920" title="Medford, New Jersey">
<text>Medford is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 24,497, an increase of 1,464 (+6.4%) from the 2010 census count of 23,033, which in turn reflected an increase of 780 (+3.5%) from the 22,253 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Medford was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1847, from portions of Evesham Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Portions of the township were taken to form Shamong Township (February 19, 1852), Lumberton (March 14, 1860), and Medford Lakes (May 17, 1939). The township is part of the South Jersey region of the state.

==History==
The area now known as Medford first saw European settlement when Samuel Coles purchased of land in 1670. Shortly thereafter, families such as the Braddock, Prickett, Stratton, Branin, and Wilkins relocated to the area, many of whom have descendants residing in Medford today. Initially known as Upper Evesham, the area gradually developed from scattered homesteads into a small village. Several structures and roads built between the initial land sale and the American Revolutionary War, including Oliphant&#x27;s Mill, Christopher&#x27;s Mill, and the Shamong Trail (now Stokes Road), still exist today.

In 1820, the area officially adopted the name Medford of Upper Evesham with the establishment of a post office. This name was proposed by Mark Reeve, a developer who had recently visited Medford, Massachusetts. On March 1, 1847, Medford Township was formally separated from Evesham Township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature. The first township meeting took place at the Cross Roads (now the intersection of County Route 541 and Church Road) on March 9, 1847, which remained the seat of township government for several years. Over time, the boundaries of Medford Township were altered, with portions taken to form Shamong Township in 1852 and Lumberton in 1860. The borders remained unchanged until 1939, when Medford Lakes was incorporated.

By 1825, a thriving glass-making industry had emerged in Medford, beginning with a furnace that produced window panes. By 1850, William Porter operated a glass factory on a triangular property bordered by South Main Street, Mill Street, and Trimble Street. The factory, which operated under names such as Medford Glass Works and Star Glass throughout the 1880s, employed approximately 250 workers at its peak. It fostered a &quot;company town&quot; atmosphere, providing housing for owners, managers, and workers, as well as a company store where workers could exchange scrip for food and necessities. Glass-making operations ceased around 1925, and the factory was demolished by the mid-1940s. Today, nearly 30 workers&#x27; homes are preserved on Trimble Street and Mill Street, along with the owners&#x27; and managers&#x27; residence at 126 South Main Street and the former company store at 132 South Main Street.

Dr. James Still (1812–1882), a self-taught African-American physician known as &quot;the Black Doctor of the Pines,&quot; lived and practiced in Medford. Although his home was demolished in 1932, his office building was preserved when the State of New Jersey acquired it in 2006. It now serves as the Dr. James Still Historic Office Site and Education Center.

Medford&#x27;s location along the Camden and Atlantic Railroad facilitated trade and contributed to rapid growth in the years following the American Civil War. By the 1920s, however, the railroad line had been dismantled, and the milling industry began to decline. Despite these changes, Medford continued to grow, largely due to its proximity to Philadelphia and Camden County, attracting families seeking a more rural lifestyle away from urban areas.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 39.81 square miles (103.10 km2), including 38.80 square miles (100.49 km2) of land and 1.01 square miles (2.61 km2) of water (2.53%). Unincorporated communities, localities, and place names located partially or completely within the township include Birchwood Lakes, Braddocks Mill, Chairville, Christopher Mills, Crossroads, Fairview, Kirbys Mill, Medford Lakes in the Pines, Melrose, Oak Knoll, Oakanickon, Oliphants Mills, Pipers Corners, Reeves, Taunton, Taunton Lake, and Wilkins.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Burlington County, along with areas in Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, and Ocean counties.

==History==
Howell lies in the Blue Creek Valley that stretches north-south between four mountain ranges, Promontory Mountains, south, North Promontory Mountains, west, West Hills, northeast, and Blue Spring Hills, southeast. The northeast Great Salt Lake lies to the south of Howell, and north of Howell finds Interstate 84, roughly the area known to locals as Blue Creek. Nomadic Shoshone Indians used the area to travel between the Great Salt Lake and areas to the north.

Charles Crocker, a California developer and business man oversaw development of the First transcontinental railroad, which passed through Promontory, about south of Howell. The Golden Spike was driven near Promontory (at Lampo) in 1869. Crocker formed the Promontory Land and Livestock Company in this time period, which had land holdings that stretched from the Great Salt Lake north to Idaho, and west to Nevada. The area was used for cattle ranching, with headquarters in Promontory, Howell, and the Dilly Ranch. The company disbanded in 1909.

In 1909 the newly created Promontory-Curlew Land Company purchased the Promontory Land and Livestock Company&#x27;s Utah and Idaho land holdings. Howell is named after Utah Congressman Joseph Howell who was involved with the Promontory-Curlew Land Company.

In 1910 Nephi Nessen purchased from the Promontory-Curlew Land Company, and established the first private and permanent residence in Howell. Nessen was born in Logan, Utah in 1867, the son of Danish immigrants and converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who crossed the plains from the east as part of a Handcart company. Other settler families included Andersen, Baxter, Cravens, Gunnell, Bailey, Carlsen, Douglas, Fonnesbeck, Rock, Wood, Allen, Barber, and Maughn.

The Bar M Ranch was headquartered near what is now the town center. A school was opened in 1910 in a Bar M Ranch building. In 1911, a new school was opened (pictured above), which has now been converted into a community center. In 1980, a modern school was built for kindergarten through third grades, but closed in 2008.

In 1904, the Blue Creek Reservoir was built on Blue Creek, northwest of Howell. However, the reservoir is now located almost entirely within the town limits

==Transportation==
While I-84 only passes through the northeastern corner of the town, SR-83 heads south from the interstate to pass through the town (and continues on to Corinne).

<doc id="136923" wikidata="Q1089412" url="?curid=136923" title="Medford Lakes, New Jersey">
<text>Medford Lakes is a borough in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,264, an increase of 118 (+2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 4,146, which in turn reflected a decline of 27 (−0.6%) from the 4,173 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Medford Lakes was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 17, 1939, from portions of Medford Township. The borough was named for Medford Township, which was named by a developer for Medford, Massachusetts.

The borough&#x27;s 22 lakes and surrounding lake communities are within the boundaries of the New Jersey Pinelands Commission. The Medford Lakes Colony, a community association, manages the lakes and other recreational facilities. More than 10% of the borough&#x27;s homes are log cabins.

==History==
Before European colonization, the area now known as Medford Lakes was primarily inhabited by the Lenni-Lenape tribe, who utilized the region&#x27;s abundant natural resources, including its water bodies and forests, for survival and shelter.

European influence began in the 17th century when the English took control from the Dutch, but the first permanent European settlement was not established until the 18th century. At that time, the region, characterized by fertile soil and vast forests, was sparsely populated and primarily used for farming and lumbering.

During the American Revolutionary War, Charles Read&#x27;s Aetna Furnace played a significant role, utilizing local bog iron to manufacture cannonballs for the Continental Army. Additionally, John Haines erected a saw and grist mill, contributing to the early industrial life of what would later become Medford Lakes.

The 19th century saw the area&#x27;s natural resources fueling the Industrial Revolution, turning Medford Lakes into an industrial center. Extraction of iron ore continued, and forges were established along the waterways. The population increased substantially during this period.

The Medford Lakes Development Company was founded in 1927, and the following year, the Vaughn and Sons Lumber Company built the Colony Club Pavilion on land donated by the Development Company. The company began importing large quantities of cedar logs, which were fashioned into log cabins. These cabins, with their excellent insulation properties, became the architectural hallmark of the community. Paired with sizeable stone fireplaces for the colder months, these cabins expanded the resort season, turning Medford Lakes into a sought-after retreat for Philadelphians and New Yorkers.

In 1931, St. Mary of the Lakes Catholic Church, a single-story log cabin structure, was built and later added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

Medford Lakes was officially incorporated as a borough on May 17, 1939, from portions of Medford Township. Since incorporation, the borough has worked to maintain the community&#x27;s unique log cabin character, even as it has expanded and modernized.

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Medford Lakes&#x27; population surged, transitioning from a summer resort to a year-round residential community.

On July 12, 2004, the borough suffered substantial damage due to flooding, caused by 7.26 inches of rainfall over 14 hours. This led to the breaking of several dams, including the Quogue Dam and the Lower and Upper Aetna Lake Dams, causing water levels to rise beyond 500-year flood elevations on portions of Ballinger Run.

Since 1931, the Canoe Carnival, an event featuring hand-crafted floats each supported by a maximum of two canoes, has taken place on Lower Aetna Lake during the first week of August. Spectators gather along the lake to view this aquatic spectacle, after which a winner, as well as a king, queen, and court, are announced.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.293 square miles (3.348 km2), including 1.162 square miles (3.008 km2) of which is land and 0.131 square miles (0.340 km2) of which is water (10.15%). The borough is an independent municipality surrounded entirely by Medford Township, making it part one of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

Medford Lakes is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. All of the borough is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Burlington County, along with areas in Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

<text>Mantua ( or ) is a town on the eastern edge of Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population of the town was 1,090 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Mantua was settled in the mid-19th century when members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were sent by Lorenzo Snow to the valley to grow flax. The first group arrived in Mantua in 1863 (although a sign at the main entry route states &quot;Founded 1864&quot;), and were all émigrés from Denmark led by Hans Jens Jensen. Snow was from Mantua, Ohio, and the town was named after the Ohio community in his honor. Due to Danish pronunciation the town&#x27;s pronunciation was changed to (&quot;man-Away&quot;) unlike Ohio&#x27;s (&quot;man-tooway&quot;) Prior to receiving its current name, the community was called Box Elder Valley, Copenhagen, Flaxville, Geneva, Hunsaker Valley, Little Copenhagen, and Little Valley.

== Geography ==
Mantua lies at the head of Box Elder Canyon on the northern, western, and southern sides of the Mantua Reservoir. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and (13.21%) is water.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Mantua has a dry summer continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dsa&quot; on climate maps.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 791 people, 218 households, and 189 families in the town. The population density was 162.5 people per square mile (62.7/km2). There were 231 housing units at an average density of 47.5 per square mile (18.3/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 96.33% White, 0.63% African American, 0.51% Native American, 0.25% Asian, 0.51% from other races, and 1.77% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.88% of the population.

There were 218 households, out of which 52.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 79.4% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 13.3% were non-families. 12.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.63 and the average family size was 4.01.

The town population contained 38.2% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 23.3% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $60,234, and the median income for a family was $61,964. Males had a median income of $42,100 versus $26,875 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,798. About 0.5% of families and 1.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.1% of those under age 18 and 3.4% of those age 65 or over.

== Mantua Reservoir ==
There are several natural springs in the valley that feed into the reservoir. At the south end of the valley is Maple Spring. Its water flows northward into the reservoir via Maple Creek. At the west base of the Little Knoll on the east side of the reservoir is a spring that is pumped into the lake. Further north is another spring flowing from the east mountain. North of town at the base of Round Hill is the north spring that runs south. On the west of town is Halling Springs which runs south east into the northern end of the reservoir. Brigham City as of 2020 diverts most of this water into culverts for fresh drinking water, leaving barely enough water in the creek to water livestock on its way to the reservoir. In 1959–60, Brigham City (located at the mouth of Box Elder Canyon) obtained land at the center of the valley, and raised an earthen dam on Big Creek and a dike around most of the perimeter to create Mantua Reservoir – also known as Brigham City Reservoir. Brigham City continues to own the reservoir and adjoining land, and operates the reservoir. The reservoir is open to public access, including ice fishing during cold seasons.

== Government ==
Mantua is considered to be a speed trap. In 1997, its two police officers issued over 1,300 speeding tickets, amounting to fines of approximately $60,000, or more than half of the city&#x27;s total yearly revenue. In 2014, it issued over 2,100 traffic tickets, amounting to approximately $220,000 in fines, or more than one-third of total yearly revenue. The sole full-time police officer (and later mayor) objected to the term &quot;speed trap&quot; as he said he did not hide his truck, and fatal accidents had decreased since he began patrolling. Most tickets are issued along the town&#x27;s section of combined US Highway 89/91. However, a state legislator countered that reduced speed limits, installed barriers, and rumble strips have reduced traffic fatalities, calling into question the justification for such a large ratio (compared to number of residents) of issued traffic tickets in the area.

In January 2020, Mantua again came under fire for unethical revenue sources, as they were issuing parking tickets on land not owned by the city, and with signage knowingly being installed wrong. They had also increased their budget for parking fines 24% over the previous year. When asked about this, the city claimed that it loses money on parking tickets which is in contrast to the rest of the state. Brigham City owns the land which the tickets were written on, and the Mantua Police Department was operating with unapproved Brigham City employees telling them when to issue citations.

In 2021, the town prosecutor filed Class C misdemeanor charges against about a dozen residents for failing to license their dogs even though the dogs had died. The police chief had signed the summons in which he stated that there was evidence of the violation, but was unable to produce it for the trial. The town council subsequently changed the ordinance to make failure to obtains a dog license an infraction rather than a criminal misdemeanor, bringing the town into compliance with Utah state law, which permits a misdemeanor only for repeated offenses or in situations that are a threat to public health or safety.

<text>Perry is a city in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 4,512 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Land in the area now known as Perry was first claimed in 1851 by Orrin Porter Rockwell and his brother Merritt, at a place now called Porter Spring. However, they only laid claim to the land and did not build a residence. Settlement by LDS pioneers began in 1853, when William Plummer Tippets built a cabin at the settlement known as &quot;Three Mile Creek&quot;, there being a creek three miles south of Box Elder (now Brigham City). Another settlement known as &quot;Welsh Settlement&quot; was midway between Three Mile Creek and Box Elder, which joined with Three Mile Creek in 1869. In 1898 the community was renamed Perry after Gustavus Adolphus Perry and his family, who were among the early settlers.

In 1854 Gustavus Adolphus Perry was made LDS branch president at the location. It had various branch presidents from then until 1877. In 1877 it was made a ward with Orrin Alonzo Perry as bishop. In 1930 there were 341 inhabitants in Perry. It still only had enough Latter-day Saints for one ward. In the spring of 2008 the Perry Utah Stake was created by a division of the Willard Utah Stake. This stake consists of nine wards, but one of the wards in the Willard Stake is a Perry Ward as well.

In June 1896 a partially completed reservoir at the mouth of Three Mile Creek Canyon (now Perry Canyon) overflowed, flooding much of the town, destroying homes and covering farms with mud and gravel. A second flood in 1923 caused less damage.

== History ==

Curlew Valley, named after the curlew snipe that nests there, extends from Snowville, Utah, to the Idaho towns of Stone and Holbrook. The first recorded settlers were Peter Skene Ogden&#x27;s large party of trappers that camped on Deep Creek December 27, 1828.

Some of the discharged members of the Mormon Battalion, on their way home from California to Salt Lake City on September 18, 1848, camped on Deep Creek and also in a cave east called Hollow Rock.

The beginning of Deep Creek is a large spring at Holbrook which runs through the center of the valley and has never varied even in dry years. About southwest is Rocky Ford, where the pioneers were able to pass on solid rock.

In 1869, Joseph William Robbins, Thomas Showell, and William M. Harris settled at the Curlew Sinks, west of here, where Deep Creek sinks into the ground. The old pioneer trail and the stage line went through their ranch.

The first townsite in the Curlew Valley was Snowville. Settled at the direction of Brigham Young, the community was named in honor of Lorenzo Snow, an apostle who became President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1898 to 1901.
==Cemetery==

The Snowville Cemetery is located at 750 North 600 West in Snowville, Utah. The earliest burial was of William O&#x27;Donald, who died on May 27, 1869. As of 2004, there are 540 burials on owned by the town of Snowville. Two unknown soldiers are buried in the cemetery as well as William Robbins, the first settler of the valley and a veteran of the American Civil War.

<text>Tremonton is a city in Box Elder County, Utah. The population was 9,894 at the time of the 2020 census. As of 2024, Tremonton has an estimated population of 13,713 and is one of the fastest growing municipalities in the state of Utah (2024 estimate annual growth rate: 7.33%).

==History==
Although the first settlers came to the Tremonton area in 1888, it remained largely uninhabited until just before 1900, when land agents started promoting the Bear River Valley as a place for Midwestern farmers to relocate. Small groups from Nebraska and Illinois began to arrive in 1898. These settlers were a diverse blend of Protestant faiths, in contrast to their mostly Mormon neighbors. Then an Apostolic Christian Church group came in 1901–1904. The main body was from Tremont, Illinois, joined by a few families from Ohio and Kansas. Mostly of German descent, this group was referred to as the &quot;German colony&quot;.

When a townsite was laid out in 1903, the new town was named &quot;Tremont&quot; at the request of the German colony. Within four years, the post office had it renamed &quot;Tremonton&quot; due to confusion with the central Utah town of Fremont. Around 1907 the congregation was caught up in a larger schism of the Apostolic Church. Some moved back to the Midwest, and the German colony came to an end. But the church left a permanent mark in the name of Tremonton.

==Geography==
Tremonton lies in the Bear River Valley in northeastern Box Elder County. The Malad River flows through the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Tremonton is located near the junction of Interstate 15 and Interstate 84.

<text>Willard (Shoshoni: &quot;Sogo-timp-bow ya)&quot; is a city in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,978 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Willard is located in southeastern Box Elder County and is bordered by the city of Perry to the north and the unincorporated community of South Willard to the south. The east edge of the city is bordered by Cache National Forest in the Wasatch Range, and the west side extends into Willard Bay, a freshwater reservoir built out of the Great Salt Lake.

==History==
In 1851, several companies of Mormon settlers were sent north from Salt Lake City to a northern bay of the Great Salt Lake called Bear River Bay. In 1957 the US Corps of Engineers built a fresh water lake which is now called Willard Bay. A company of nineteen located on North Willow Creek, south of the site where Brigham City would be established. Two years later, the infant community relocated two miles further south, and a fort wall was built due to the possibility of attacks by the Shohone and their allies. Willard&#x27;s first settlers were mostly of Welsh, English, Scottish and Dutch descent. Most were farmers, but some were merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths and school teachers. Historically, the economy of Willard centered on agriculture, with fruit crops being the major product. Gravel excavation and worked stone have also been a significant source of income.

Henry G. Sherwood surveyed North Willow Creek in 1851. The community was renamed Willard in honor of Willard Richards (1804-1854, a recently deceased Apostle of the LDS Church and counselor to Brigham Young, in 1859. Willard received its charter as a city in 1870.

Gifted stonemason Shadrack Jones took advantage of local rock cliffs and the alluvial fan exposed as ancient Lake Bonneville receded. Between 1862 and 1883, he mined the local stone and built single-family homes. Over thirty still stand and many are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as contributing buildings in the Willard Historic District.

<text>Amalga ( ) is a town in Cache County, Utah, United States. The population was 482 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho (partial) Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Many of the town&#x27;s population are dairy farmers, with many families owning their own herds. The town contains the Cache Valley Cheese plant. Nearby Smithfield shares its post office and library with the town.

==History==
Amalga was settled by Mormon settler Hans Jorgensen in 1869. Other settlers began arriving in 1891. By March 22, 1891, when the Alto Branch of the LDS Church was organized, the town had a schoolhouse that was used for social gatherings and church meetings.

In 1916, the Amalgamated Sugar Company agreed to build a factory in town to process sugar beets, and the town name became Amalga. A spur line was established by the Utah Idaho Central Railroad, and a large hotel opened. The factory, built by Dyer Construction Company, was built by the 1917 season for $900,000.

Coinciding with the organization of the city, the Amalga Ward of the LDS Church was established on March 10, 1918, choosing its name from the Amalgamated Sugar Company.

The factory was shut down in 1929 due to the sugar beet blight. The equipment was dismantled and reassembled in Sacramento, California. The hotel was torn down, as were the workers&#x27; houses. The railroad was also removed, and sugar beets were shipped by truck to Smithfield, then taken to a factory in Lewiston for processing. The warehouse and land was sold to the &quot;Tueller brothers&quot; in late 1937.

In 1941, the Cache Valley Dairy Association purchased the former sugar beet plant to allow the co-op to process their own milk into Swiss cheese. The co-op hired Edwin Gossner to produce the cheese, which he did from 1942 until 1966, when he left to form Gossner Foods in west Logan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.5 square miles (9.1 km2), of which 3.4 square miles (8.7 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (4.26%) is water. Most of the water is in a single swamp north of the cheese factory.

==Schools==

Some of the earliest buildings built in Benson were for educational purposes. They were small log buildings of just one room, and later other rooms were added to some of them. These buildings were only temporary structures where the basic three &quot;R&#x27;s&quot; were taught, and were later replaced by more permanent structures.
In 1894 a brick school house was built in the east part of Benson called the Riverside School. It had two classrooms, with three grades taught in each room. At the Riverside School, the teacher, Mary Griffith, was paid $30 a month in 1896. In 1901 a janitor was hired for nine weeks for $4.50. One ton of coal cost $4.25. John Mathews bought the log building that was on the Riverside location and spent many hours directing cantatas.

In 1897 a new brick school house was built in the west part of Benson. This school was built on a spot of land overlooking the Bear River. At first there were eight grades of school taught in two rooms. Later, as more children were enrolled, there were only grades one through six. The Benson Elementary School is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After the construction of these school buildings, church was held in them for a time. These two schools served the educational needs of the first six grades until 1935 when a new modern school was built. This school was used for three decades. In 1968 it closed its doors, and the Cache County School Board felt it best to consolidate some of the smaller schools in the county to provide a wider curriculum while saving money at the same time. In the fall of 1969, all school-age children were transported by bus to other schools. Kindergarten to sixth grade went to Summit Elementary in Smithfield. Seventh to ninth grade went to Richmond North Cache Junior High and tenth through twelfth grades to Sky View High School in Smithfield.

<text>Clarkston is a town in Cache County, Utah, United States. The population was 749 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. The community celebration is held in June each year and is known as The Pony Express Days.

Clarkston is noted for being the last home of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. He is buried in Clarkston, and every other year a pageant commemorates his life. The pageant was discontinued in 2018.

Many of it residents enjoy the local wildlife which includes mule deer, sharp-tailed grouse, and pheasant.

==History==
The townsite of Clarkston was laid out in 1864. It was named for Israel Justus Clark, who was an early settler and the first branch president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Clarkston.
The settlers originally settled east of modern-day Clarkston in a spot known as the flat. Due to water quality concerns and sickness, they moved the town to a higher elevation and closer to City Creek and other springs. They also experimented in dry farming, mainly north of town. There was trouble with the native Americans, and in 1866 the settlement was abandoned for a short time. Eventually, an agreement was made between the settlers and Indian John, a chief under the Washakie.
A Latter-day Saint ward was organized in Clarkston in the fall of 1867 with William F. Rigby as bishop. A brick meetinghouse was built in 1910. In 1930 Clarkston had a population of 570. Among the first settlers were Israel J. Clark, James Myler, William Ricks, Michael Poulsen, Johannis Dahle, Gideon Harmison, David Cook, John Griffiths, John Griffin, John Godfrey, Samuel Whitney, Ole S. Jensen and their families; also the Thompson and Hansen families, A. W. Heggie, a Mr. Parker, Paul Paulson, Andrew McCombs, Simon Smith, Isaac Cook, A. H. Atkinson, and others.
The existence of the Clarkston settlement was threatened in 1869 when a majority of the settlers, due mainly to discouragement because of the severe winters and heavy drifting snow, decided to move to the present site of Newton, Utah. But a few people decided to stay in Clarkston, and some who had left returned, and the settlement became a permanent one. There was a controversy over retaining the name Clarkston for the original settlement or transferring it to the &quot;New Town.&quot;

<text>Hyde Park is a city in north-central Cache County, Utah, United States. The population was 5,234 at the 2020 census.
 It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The first settlers were Latter-day Saints who moved from Lehi in 1860. Hyde Park was officially organized by Ezra T. Benson on July 1, 1860. The settlement was named in honor of William Hyde, one of the first settlers to arrive in the area on April 23, 1860. The name choice also evoked Hyde Park in London, England which was the homeland of many early settlers. It was at this same meeting that Hyde was also appointed as Bishop of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hyde Park. Hyde served as branch president from 1860–1872 and then as bishop from 1872–1874, when he died.

Hyde Park was surveyed in 1864 and homes on city lots began to replace the earlier fort-style dwellings. The first post office was established on June 15, 1864 and the first town elections were held on September 7, 1864. The first school and church meetings were held in a one-room log structure built in the summer of 1863. As the community grew, church meetings were moved to the new, larger Rock Meeting House constructed in 1866. Early settlers also had to deal with the problem of bringing water to the area for their crops. The first irrigation canal was built in the summer of 1860 and was known as the “Old Ditch.” A second canal known as the Logan-Richmond Canal was constructed in 1865 to help with the increasing demand for water.

In 1874, a census of Hyde Park showed a population of 445 individuals. Hyde Park was incorporated on January 16, 1892 with Charles G. Hyde as president of the board of trustees.

In 1930 the population of Hyde Park was 757.

<text>Logan is a city in Cache County, Utah, United States. The 2020 census recorded the population at 52,778. Logan is the county seat of Cache County and the principal city of the Logan metropolitan area, which includes Cache County and Franklin County, Idaho. The Logan metropolitan area contained 147,908 people as of the 2020 census. Logan has the main campus of Utah State University.

==History==
The town of Logan was founded in 1859 by settlers Brigham Young sent to survey for the site of a fort near the banks of the Logan River. They named their new community &quot;Logan&quot; for Ephraim Logan, an early fur trapper in the area. Logan was incorporated on January 17, 1866. Brigham Young College was founded here on August 6, 1877 (and closed in 1926), and Utah State University, then called the Agricultural College of Utah, was founded in 1888.

Brigham Young College, a college run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was in Logan from 1878 to 1926. Its library and its papers were given to Utah State University when it ceased operating.

Logan&#x27;s growth reflects settlement and postwar booms along with other changes incidental to conditions in the West. Logan grew to about 20,000 in the mid-1960s, and according to census estimates, exceeded 50,000 in 2015.

==Geography==
Logan is in northern Utah, north of Ogden, on the Logan River. It is about north of Salt Lake City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and , or 3.16%, is water.

The city lies near the eastern edge of Cache Valley on the western slopes of the Bear River Mountains. Mount Logan rises to an elevation of immediately to the east, and south of Logan Canyon. The eastern portions of the city are atop shelf-like &quot;benches&quot;, late Pleistocene sedimentary deposits created by the glacially fed Logan River feeding into the northern stretches of Lake Bonneville, building a &quot;Gilbert-type&quot; river delta over several thousand years. The Logan River later cut down through these sedimentary deposits after the draining of Lake Bonneville about 14,500 years ago. This created a low-lying area with very steep slopes that reach into the rest of town and to the Logan River bottomlands. West of Logan lie flatlands that contain both farmland and marshes. North and south of Logan are rapidly growing residential suburbs.

===Climate===
Logan has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;) with very warm and usually dry summers and cold winters with moderate snowfall. Precipitation tends to be heaviest in the spring. Like other areas in northern Utah, during mid-winter, high-pressure systems often form over Cache Valley, leading to strong temperature inversions that trap cold air and pollutants and allow thick smog to accumulate in the valley about three percent of the time. This reduces the air quality to unhealthy levels and can result in the worst air pollution levels in the U.S.

==Demographics==
During the 2020 census, there were 52,778 people. The population was counted at 48,174 in the 2010 census. The racial makeup of the city in 2010 was 83.9% White, 1.0% African American, 1.0% Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 8.0% from other races, and 2.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.9% of the population.

As of the 2000 Census there were 13,902 households counted in Logan, out of which 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.1% were married couples living together, 7.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.0% were non-families. 17.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.2.

In the city, the population was spread out, with
*23.4% under the age of 18
*34.3% from 18 to 24
*25.5% from 25 to 44
*9.7% from 45 to 64

<text>Providence is a city in Cache County, Utah, United States. The population was 8,218 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Providence lies south of Logan on former State Route 238. Its 1990 census population was 3,344. Situated immediately east of the confluence of Spring Creek with the Logan River, the town lies astride a delta at the mouth of Providence Canyon and beneath Big Baldy Mountain. The settlement was located on Spring Creek to take advantage of water, arable land, timber resources, and existing trails.

As directed by LDS President Brigham Young, on July 24, 1855, Captain Briant Stringham, Simon Baker, Andrew Moffat, and Brigham Young Jr., located headquarters for the Elkhorn Cattle Ranch on a spring of water near the west bank of the Blacksmith Fork River, immediately southwest of the present site of Providence. Subsequently, in the early spring of 1857, Samuel, Joseph, Aboile, and Nephi Campbell, and John Dunn, crossed the mountains from North Ogden into Cache Valley, seeking a new place to settle. To them, the town they called &quot;Ogden&#x27;s Hole&quot; was becoming too crowded. They pitched camp at the present site of Providence, at a spring and pond where a creek from a canyon in the Bear River Range entered the alluvial lowland. To assess the fertility of the soil, the explorers broke sod and plowed a long furrow.

Plans were made for the immediate resettlement from North Ogden to Cache Valley of the Campbell and other families, but the move was interrupted by the approach of the U.S. Army with orders to force a military occupation of Utah Territory. The Weber County settlers evacuated their homes and moved south for temporary sanctuary on the &quot;Provo bottoms&quot;, and the Weber County brigade of the Nauvoo Legion passed through Cache Valley to conduct a defensive reconnoiter of the Bear River region. A number of these men subsequently returned to settle in Providence.

Settlers finally came to Spring Creek on April 20, 1859. Arriving first were Ira Rice, a 65-year-old War of 1812 veteran from Massachusetts, and a 35-year-old Welsh coal miner, Hopkin Mathews, accompanied by his teenage daughter Elizabeth. They were joined by the English-speaking Bowen, Busenbark, Campbell, Clark, Clifford, Dees, Dunn, Durfey, Gates, Hall, Lane, Maddison, Rammell, Thompson, Williams, and Wright families, plus the Gassman, Lau, and Theurer families, whose native tongue was German.

Douglas fir logs were cut and dragged from Spring Creek Canyon to build cabins. The houses faced one another across a narrow road, which could be closed with wagons at each end to make a fort. On April 25, 1859, Peter Maughan visited Spring Creek to establish a religious organization. He chose Samuel Campbell as presiding elder. The first indoor meetings were held in a log meeting-and-schoolhouse erected by John Maddison and William Fife. By August there were 16 families living at the fort; the following month, a child (Hannah Priscilla Thompson) was born at Spring Creek.

On November 14, 1859, LDS apostles Orson Hyde and Ezra T. Benson organized the Providence Ward. Hyde chose the name: &quot;Spring Creek settlement being situated in an elbow of the mountains and appearing to us somewhat of a providential place, we named Providence.&quot; Robert Williams was ordained as bishop. Two years later, when a U.S. post office was established in Providence, Williams was also named postmaster.

In 1860 John Theurer persuaded a number of fellow Swiss LDS converts (whose last names were Alder, Fuhriman, Kresie, Loosli, Naef, Stucki, and Trauber) to come to Spring Creek with its alpine setting. The Swiss tradition of community sauerkraut dinners continues to the present day in Providence. The village became a mix of Yankees, English, and Swiss, united by a common religious persuasion. As Providence was situated astride a Shoshoni trail from a winter camp on the Bear River to Bear Lake via Blacksmith Fork Canyon, church authorities advised that a more substantial fort be erected. A six-foot-high, two-and-one-half-foot-thick rock wall was built to enclose both the log houses and an open commons area.

On November 23, 1862, in the foothills just outside Providence, a two-hour skirmish was fought by 60 soldiers under the command of Major Edward McGarry of the U.S. Second Cavalry against 30 or 40 Shoshone under Chief Bear Hunter. The objective was to recover livestock and a ten-year-old white boy taken during the Utter Party Massacre on the Oregon Trail in August 1860. Three Shoshone people were killed and five others, including Chief Bear Hunter, were captured. An exchange of the captives was made for the boy, Reuben Van Orman, who had been held for two years.

In 1864 the town was laid out into square blocks, each divided into six lots of approximately one and one-third acres. East of Main Street the lots face north–south; they face east–west on the western side of town. The log structures, including the meeting/school building, were relocated from the fort onto the lots under the supervision of Bishop William Budge. On September 4, 1871, James Martineau completed his detailed official survey of Providence City. The cemetery was moved from the south end of town to a hill north of town. Construction was completed in 1871 on a rock meetinghouse and on a rock schoolhouse in 1877. The schoolhouse was replaced by a new building with a bell tower in 1904.

For more than a hundred years, the major activity of most of the people of Providence was farming. Irrigation canals were dug from the Spring Creek and from the Blacksmith Fork and Logan rivers. The livestock industry included the raising of beef cattle (1859), honey bees (1866), horses (1870), dairy cattle (1874), poultry (1918), and foxes (1928). The horticulture industry included growing grain and alfalfa; apple, cherry, pear, and prune orchards; and peas, beans, and sugar beets. Beginning in 1886 Joseph Alastor Smith established Edgewood Hall as a nursery and dairy operation on the bench overlooking Providence. After its 28-room manor burned to the ground on Labor Day of 1935, the estate was acquired by Wall Street financier and Logan native L. Boyd Hatch. An elegant formal estate was created by Hatch, but he sold out in 1953 to cattleman Theron Bringhurst.

The commercial activities of Providence included private mercantile shops of Rice, Hargraves, and Theurer plus a ZCMI Co-op store (1869–1912). Many years after the Co-op structure burned, Watkins and Sons Printing established a business in a remodeled and expanded facility. Other enterprises included molasses mills, a sawmill, lime kilns, brickyards, blacksmith shops, and an early automobile service station. The sugar factory of David Eccles and Charles Nibley began refining sugar beets in Providence in 1901 and operated for 25 years. Millions of tons of limestone for this and other refineries in the Pacific Northwest were quarried from Providence Canyon. The Utah Idaho Central Railroad Company extended its electric interurban line from Logan and established a depot in Providence in 1912. The railroad hauled limestone, farm produce, and passengers throughout Cache Valley as well as to Corinne, Ogden, and beyond via a connection with the Oregon Short Line Railroad company. Accompanying the UIC were electric lights, the telegraph, and the telephone. The last railroad train ran through town in 1947.

With the coming of statehood to Utah and with the population exceeding 1,000 in the 1890s, Providence was organized as a town corporation. In 1897 Hopkin Mathews became town board president. Providence became a third-class city on 19 July 1929, with James Hansen elected mayor.

Commencing with its first subdivision in 1962, Providence changed at an accelerating pace from a farming community into a &quot;bedroom&quot; suburb of Logan. Fields began to give way to developer tracts of individually owned, single-family houses on small lots. Although there is a spattering of home enterprises, most commercial activities have disappeared from Providence. A major employer of Providence citizens is Utah State University, which at its founding in 1888 seriously considered the Providence bench for its location. Other residents commute to Thiokol Corporation facilities or Hill Air Force Base as well as to smaller business firms and institutions in and around Logan.

<text>Richmond is a city in Cache County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,733 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Logan metropolitan area.

==History==
Agrippa Cooper was the first settler in Richmond in the mid-1850s. In 1859, surveyors visited the Richmond area and determined it to be a suitable area for living, with abundant water that could be used for farming and milling, and land that was fertile for growing crops. Within a few years log cabins, dugouts, and a log fort had been built. In 1860, a sawmill and a schoolhouse were erected. The city was settled mainly by Mormon pioneers, such as Thomas Levi Whittle, John Bair, Stillman Pond, Goudy E. Hogan, and Marriner W. Merrill.

The city was likely named in honor of LDS apostle Charles C. Rich, who had been the Apostle who traveled to the American Falls area of California in 1850 to call the first ten Latter-day Saint missionaries (including Whittle) to serve in Hawaii. Other factors involved in selecting the name may also have been the rich local soil or that Richmond, London was the hometown of some of its English settlers.

In 1860, LDS Church President Brigham Young visited the settlement of Richmond to council and direct the settlement. The Native Americans in the Cache Valley were becoming hostile to many of the Mormon pioneers, and many violent battles had already been fought. Young counseled the settlers to &quot;Move your families and wagons close together, then, if you are disturbed, you are like a hive of bees, and everyone is ready and knows at once what to do.&quot; This led the settlers to build a fort named &quot;Fort Richmond&quot;.

Richmond was incorporated in 1868.

In 1912, an election was held about adding a Carnegie library. The Richmond Carnegie Library was built on Main Street in 1914.

The town&#x27;s first two creameries—Cache Valley Dairy and Union Creamery—each produced up to of milk per day in 1902.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Summit Creek&quot; (due to its location on that creek), Smithfield was founded in 1857 by brothers Robert and John Thornley and their cousin Seth Langton, who were sent north from Salt Lake City by LDS Church President Brigham Young to found a settlement on Summit Creek. After a preliminary scouting, Robert returned with his new wife Annie Brighton. The first winter was spent in a wagon box. By the next summer, with more settlers arriving, a small fort was built on the edge of the creek, one cabin of which remains. As the settlement grew, John Glover Smith was named as bishop to lead the church congregation, and the town took his name. In December 1902, the sizable Smithfield Tabernacle was completed. By 1917 the town had planted trees on both sides of its Main Street and had acquired a Carnegie library and a Rotary club. Dependent for many years on dairying, a Del Monte canning factory, and the sugar beet industry, the town is now essentially a bedroom community for Logan and its Utah State University.

==History==

East Carbon City began in the fall of 1942 when the U.S. government – through the Defense Plant Corporation – awarded a contract to the W.E. Ryberg-Strong-Grant Corporation of Springville, Utah to develop the town at a planned cost of $5 million, to house coal miners working in the mines of the Geneva Steel mill and their families. It was originally named &quot;Drager&quot;, after W.L. Drager, chief engineer for the Defense Plant Corporation, who was raised in Utah and later moved to Washington, D.C.

On September 9, 1942, the Post Office moved into its new building, and during the ceremonies, Postmistress Agnes Scow announced the U.S Post Office Department would not allow the name of Drager. It contended that Drager was too similar to the name Draper (another Utah community) and would create confusion and delays in mail delivery. A selected group of citizens gathered in the school auditorium to discuss a new name from the proposals of &quot;Dragerville&quot;, &quot;Dragervale&quot; or &quot;Drager Town&quot; offered by the Post Office Department. &quot;Dragerton&quot;, a derivative of &quot;Drager-town&quot;, was selected.

Dragerton was purchased in the spring of 1947 by the Geneva Steel Company, which had by then become a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, for $1,553,000. The former government town had now become a company town. There were 605 modern buildings.

In 1959, with the area near its peak population, the Carbon School District built a high school in the area. The school was placed on land within the Sunnyside city limits that bordered Dragerton. The land was donated by Kaiser Steel, a local mining company. In 1958, during an assembly at East Carbon Junior High School, a vote was taken to give the new high school a name and mascot. The name selected was East Carbon High School, and the mascot was a Viking. The school colors were blue, white and red.

When the town was incorporated in 1973, the name was officially changed to &quot;East Carbon City&quot;, matching the high school name.

In 2005, the high school was closed and demolished before the beginning of the new school year. Bruin Point Elementary School was built the following year and is the only school serving the area of East Carbon.

==Columbia==
As part of East Carbon&#x27;s incorporation, the nearby town of Columbia (approximately 4 miles to the southeast) became part of the new city. However, the area is still referred to as &quot;Columbia&quot; by residents.

<text>Helper is a city in Carbon County, Utah, United States, approximately southeast of Salt Lake City and northwest of the city of Price. The population was 2,201 at the 2010 census.

The city is located along the Price River and U.S. Route 6/U.S. Route 191, a shortcut between Provo and Interstate 70, on the way from Salt Lake City to Grand Junction, Colorado. It is the location of the Western Mining and Railroad Museum, a tourist attraction that also contains household and commercial artifacts illustrating late 19th and early 20th-century living conditions.

==History==
With the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW) in 1881–82, Helper began to develop as a population center. By 1887 the D&amp;RGW had erected some twenty-seven frame residences, with more built later in the year. The railroad planned to make Helper a freight terminal after the rail lines were changed from narrow to standard gauge. The changeover process began in 1889 and was completed in 1891. In 1892, Helper designated the division point between the eastern and western D&amp;RGW terminals in Grand Junction, Colorado, and Ogden, Utah, respectively, and a new depot, hotel, and other buildings were constructed.

On April 21, 1897, Butch Cassidy and Elzy Lay robbed the Pleasant Valley Coal Company in nearby Castle Gate; they stayed in Helper the day before. It was said that Butch Cassidy later came back to Helper for occasional visits.

Adjacent to Helper is Spring Glen. It was first established in 1880, with Teancum Pratt being one of the first settlers. A Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized there in 1885 with Francis Marion Ewell as president. It was made a ward in 1889. As of 1930, less than 20% of the population in Spring Glen were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Helper&#x27;s growth proceeded in a slow but deliberate fashion bearing little resemblance to booming metal-mining towns. The first amenities offered to the few settlers and numerous railroad workers included three saloons, one grocery store, and one clothing establishment. A school was built in 1891. By 1895 the D&amp;RGW buildings and shops at Helper were lighted by electricity, and two reservoirs for water had been constructed.

Ethnic diversity was destined to become a chief characteristic of Helper. Industrial expansion, coal mining, and railroading required a great amount of unskilled labor. In 1894 the railroad&#x27;s passenger department established an immigration bureau to advertise Utah Territory. This move coincided with the influx of numerous immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and Asia.

Chinese laborers were brought in early to work the Carbon County mines and railroads. By the late 1890s, Italians and Austrians (primarily Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians) began to arrive. In 1900 Helper&#x27;s population was listed at 385 people. Sixteen different nationality groups were represented. &quot;Merchant&quot; and &quot;laborer&quot; comprised most of the occupations for these early immigrants.

After the unsuccessful coal miners&#x27; strike of 1903–04, Italians, blacklisted from the mines at nearby Castle Gate, ventured into Helper to establish businesses and farms along the Price River. The influx of strikers into Helper accelerated its growth, with the newly established farms offering needed agricultural products.

The twentieth century was launched in Carbon County (which had been formed in 1894 from Emery County) in a shroud of uncertainty, largely due to the strike situation. Greek and Japanese immigrants were brought in to break the strike, and thus new ethnic groups came onto the scene. Helper, along with Price, was fast becoming the center of the Carbon County coalfields, providing service functions to the outlying camps. A 1903–04 business directory listed sixteen separate businesses in Helper; by 1912–13, the number had grown to twenty-nine, with a population of about 850. Helper townsite was regularly organized and incorporated in 1907 with a president of the town board and members of the board serving the community.

By 1914–15 there were 71 businesses listed for Helper, with 84 in 1918–19 and 157 in 1924–25. Many of Helper&#x27;s business enterprises were associated with specific ethnic groups, but this fact illustrated the business opportunities available in the town, enabling immigrants to &quot;break the ranks of labor.&quot; Italian and Chinese-owned businesses were joined in the 1910s and 1920s by Slavic, Greek, and Japanese establishments. Specialty shops, cafes, coffeehouses, saloons, theaters, general mercantile, and various service-oriented businesses formed Helper&#x27;s commercial district. Some ventures, such as the Mutual Mercantile Company, were joint operations between ethnic groups.

Ethnic identities, inter- and intra-group rivalries, new waves of immigration, and Helper&#x27;s position as a neutral ground for labor influenced the town&#x27;s social landscape. Helper became known as the area &quot;hub&quot; because it was nestled among various mining camps, and it served as a city of refuge where strikers and union organizers, as well as national guardsmen, could congregate during tense times. Customs and lifestyles associated with various ethnic groups continued; however, through interaction, many eventually were changed and modified in the Helper environment.

While the Great Depression hit the entire county, Helper&#x27;s position as a railroad center provided some stability. Helper&#x27;s city hall was built in 1927, and a civic auditorium was constructed in 1936. The D&amp;RGW developed &quot;bridge traffic,&quot; acquiring trade from other major roads that wanted transcontinental connections.

Coal production increased during World War II and continued strong through the 1960s, with significant periods of uncertainty and temporary decline. Not all of the communities surrounding Helper were able to weather these difficult periods of economic instability, and the town is within a few miles of a large number of former coal mining settlements that were abandoned between the 1930s and 1970s and are now ghost towns. These towns include Castle Gate, Coal City, Consumers, National, Peerless, Rains, Royal, and Standardville, as well as Mutual.

Helper was named the top western town for 2006 by the &quot;True West Magazine&quot;, in the January/February 2007 issue.

===Power plant closure===
The approach of the compliance date of April 16, 2015, for enhanced EPA controls on the emission of mercury resulted in a decision by Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of PacifiCorp, to close down the Carbon power plant in Helper on April 15, 2015. It had been in operation since 1954.

===Name===
Helper is situated at the mouth of Price Canyon, alongside the Price River, on the eastern side of the Wasatch Plateau in Central Utah. Trains traveling westward from the Price side to the Salt Lake City side of the plateau required additional &quot;helper&quot; engines in order to make the steep (2.4% grade) climb up Price Canyon to the town of Soldier Summit. The town was named after these helper engines, which the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad stationed in the city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land, along the Price River.

===Climate===
Helper has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;).
