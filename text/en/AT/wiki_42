<text>In chemistry, a hydride is formally the anion of hydrogen (H−), a hydrogen ion with two electrons. In modern usage, this is typically only used for ionic bonds, but it is sometimes (and more frequently in the past) been applied to all compounds containing covalently bound H atoms. In this broad and potentially archaic sense, water (H2O) is a hydride of oxygen, ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen, etc. In covalent compounds, it implies hydrogen is attached to a less electronegative element. In such cases, the H centre has nucleophilic character, which contrasts with the protic character of acids. The hydride anion is very rarely observed.

Almost all of the elements form binary compounds with hydrogen, the exceptions being He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Pm, Os, Ir, Rn, Fr, and Ra. Exotic molecules such as positronium hydride have also been made.

==Bonds==
Bonds between hydrogen and the other elements range from being highly ionic to somewhat covalent. Some hydrides, e.g. boron hydrides, do not conform to classical electron counting rules and the bonding is described in terms of multi-centered bonds, whereas the interstitial hydrides often involve metallic bonding. Hydrides can be discrete molecules, oligomers or polymers, ionic solids, chemisorbed monolayers, bulk metals (interstitial), or other materials. While hydrides traditionally react as Lewis bases or reducing agents, some metal hydrides behave as hydrogen-atom donors and act as acids.

==Applications==


*Hydrides such as sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) and super hydride, are commonly used as reducing agents in chemical synthesis. The hydride adds to an electrophilic center, typically unsaturated carbon.
*Hydrides such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride are used as strong bases in organic synthesis. The hydride reacts with the weak Bronsted acid releasing H2.
*Hydrides such as calcium hydride are used as desiccants, i.e. drying agents, to remove trace water from organic solvents. The hydride reacts with water forming hydrogen and hydroxide salt. The dry solvent can then be distilled or vacuum transferred from the &quot;solvent pot&quot;.
*Hydrides are important in storage battery technologies such as nickel-metal hydride battery. Various metal hydrides have been examined for use as a means of hydrogen storage for fuel cell-powered electric cars and other purposed aspects of a hydrogen economy.

* Hydride complexes are catalysts and catalytic intermediates in a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic cycles. Important examples include hydrogenation, hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, hydrodesulfurization catalysts. Even certain enzymes, the hydrogenase, operate via hydride intermediates. The energy carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reacts as a hydride donor or hydride equivalent.

== Hydride ion ==

Free hydride anions exist only under extreme conditions and are not invoked for homogeneous solution. Instead, many compounds have hydrogen centres with hydridic character.

Aside from electride, the hydride ion is the simplest possible anion, consisting of two electrons and a proton. Hydrogen has a relatively low electron affinity, 72.77 kJ/mol and reacts exothermically with protons as a powerful Lewis base. 
:&lt;chem&gt;H- + H+ -&gt; H2&lt;/chem&gt;
The low electron affinity of hydrogen and the strength of the H–H bond () means that the hydride ion would also be a strong reducing agent
:&lt;chem&gt;H2 + 2e- &lt;=&gt; 2H-&lt;/chem&gt;

== Types of hydrides ==
According to the general definition, every element of the periodic table (except some noble gases) forms one or more hydrides. These substances have been classified into three main types according to the nature of their bonding:
*&quot;Ionic hydrides&quot;, which have significant ionic bonding character.
*&quot;Covalent hydrides&quot;, which include the hydrocarbons and many other compounds which covalently bond to hydrogen atoms.
*&quot;Interstitial hydrides&quot;, which may be described as having metallic bonding.
While these divisions have not been used universally, they are still useful to understand differences in hydrides.

=== Ionic hydrides ===
These are stoichiometric compounds of hydrogen. Ionic or saline hydrides are composed of hydride bound to an electropositive metal, generally an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. The divalent lanthanides such as europium and ytterbium form compounds similar to those of heavier alkaline earth metals. In these materials the hydride is viewed as a pseudohalide. Saline hydrides are insoluble in conventional solvents, reflecting their non-molecular structures. Ionic hydrides are used as bases and, occasionally, as reducing reagents in organic synthesis.

:C6H5C(O)CH3 + KH → C6H5C(O)CH2K + H2

Typical solvents for such reactions are ethers. Water and other protic solvents cannot serve as a medium for ionic hydrides because the hydride ion is a stronger base than hydroxide and most hydroxyl anions. Hydrogen gas is liberated in a typical acid-base reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;NaH + H2O -&gt; H2_{(g)}{} + NaOH&lt;/chem&gt;
:Δ&quot;H&quot; = −83.6 kJ/mol, Δ&quot;G&quot; = −109.0 kJ/mol

Often alkali metal hydrides react with metal halides. Lithium aluminium hydride (often abbreviated as LAH) arises from reactions of lithium hydride with aluminium chloride.
:4 LiH + AlCl3 → LiAlH4 + 3 LiCl

===Covalent hydrides===
According to some definitions, covalent hydrides cover all other compounds containing hydrogen. Some definitions limit hydrides to hydrogen centres that formally react as hydrides, i.e. are nucleophilic, and hydrogen atoms bound to metal centers. These hydrides are formed by all the true non-metals (except zero group elements) and the elements like Al, Ga, Sn, Pb, Bi, Po, etc., which are normally metallic in nature, i.e., this class includes the hydrides of p-block elements. In these substances the hydride bond is formally a covalent bond much like the bond made by a proton in a weak acid. This category includes hydrides that exist as discrete molecules, polymers or oligomers, and hydrogen that has been chem-adsorbed to a surface. A particularly important segment of covalent hydrides are complex metal hydrides, powerful soluble hydrides commonly used in synthetic procedures.

Molecular hydrides often involve additional ligands; for example, diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) consists of two aluminum centers bridged by hydride ligands. Hydrides that are soluble in common solvents are widely used in organic synthesis. Particularly common are sodium borohydride () and lithium aluminium hydride and hindered reagents such as DIBAL.

===Interstitial hydrides or metallic hydrides===

Interstitial hydrides most commonly exist within metals or alloys. They are traditionally termed &quot;compounds&quot; even though they do not strictly conform to the definition of a compound, more closely resembling common alloys such as steel. In such hydrides, hydrogen can exist as either atomic or diatomic entities. Mechanical or thermal processing, such as bending, striking, or annealing, may cause the hydrogen to precipitate out of solution by degassing. Their bonding is generally considered metallic. Such bulk transition metals form interstitial binary hydrides when exposed to hydrogen. These systems are usually non-stoichiometric, with variable amounts of hydrogen atoms in the lattice. In materials engineering, the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement results from the formation of interstitial hydrides. Hydrides of this type form according to either one of two main mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the adsorption of dihydrogen, succeeded by the cleaving of the H-H bond, the delocalisation of the hydrogen&#x27;s electrons, and finally the diffusion of the protons into the metal lattice. The other main mechanism involves the electrolytic reduction of ionised hydrogen on the surface of the metal lattice, also followed by the diffusion of the protons into the lattice. The second mechanism is responsible for the observed temporary volume expansion of certain electrodes used in electrolytic experiments.

Palladium absorbs up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen at room temperatures, forming palladium hydride. This material has been discussed as a means to carry hydrogen for vehicular fuel cells. Interstitial hydrides show certain promise as a way for safe hydrogen storage. Neutron diffraction studies have shown that hydrogen atoms randomly occupy the octahedral interstices in the metal lattice (in an fcc lattice there is one octahedral hole per metal atom). The limit of absorption at normal pressures is PdH0.7, indicating that approximately 70% of the octahedral holes are occupied.

Many interstitial hydrides have been developed that readily absorb and discharge hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. They are usually based on intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys. However, their application is still limited, as they are capable of storing only about 2 weight percent of hydrogen, insufficient for automotive applications.
===Transition metal hydride complexes===

Transition metal hydrides include compounds that can be classified as &quot;covalent hydrides&quot;. Some are even classified as interstitial hydrides and other bridging hydrides. Classical transition metal hydride feature a single bond between the hydrogen centre and the transition metal. Some transition metal hydrides are acidic, e.g., and . The anions potassium nonahydridorhenate and are examples from the growing collection of known molecular homoleptic metal hydrides. As pseudohalides, hydride ligands are capable of bonding with positively polarized hydrogen centres. This interaction, called dihydrogen bonding, is similar to hydrogen bonding, which exists between positively polarized protons and electronegative atoms with open lone pairs.

=== Protides ===
Hydrides containing protium are known as &quot;protides&quot;.

===Deuterides===
Hydrides containing deuterium are known as &quot;deuterides&quot;. Some deuterides, such as LiD, are important fusion fuels in thermonuclear weapons and useful moderators in nuclear reactors.

=== Tritides ===
Hydrides containing tritium are known as &quot;tritides.&quot;

===Mixed anion compounds===
Mixed anion compounds exist that contain hydride with other anions. These include boride hydrides, carbohydrides, hydridonitrides, oxyhydrides and others.

==Appendix on nomenclature==
&quot;Protide&quot;, &quot;deuteride&quot; and &quot;tritide&quot; are used to describe ions or compounds that contain enriched hydrogen-1, deuterium or tritium, respectively.

In the classic meaning, hydride refers to any compound hydrogen forms with other elements, ranging over groups 1–16 (the binary compounds of hydrogen). The following is a list of the nomenclature for the hydride derivatives of main group compounds according to this definition:
*alkali and alkaline earth metals: metal hydride
*boron: borane, BH3
*aluminium: alumane, AlH3
*gallium: gallane, GaH3
*indium: indigane, InH3
*thallium: thallane, TlH3
*carbon: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and all hydrocarbons
*silicon: silane
*germanium: germane
*tin: stannane
*lead: plumbane
*nitrogen: ammonia (&quot;azane&quot; when substituted), hydrazine
*phosphorus: phosphine (note &quot;phosphane&quot; is the IUPAC recommended name)
*arsenic: arsine (note &quot;arsane&quot; is the IUPAC recommended name)
*antimony: stibine (note &quot;stibane&quot; is the IUPAC recommended name)
*bismuth: bismuthine (note &quot;bismuthane&quot; is the IUPAC recommended name)
*helium: helium hydride (only exists as an ion)

According to the convention above, the following are &quot;hydrogen compounds&quot; and not &quot;hydrides&quot;:
*oxygen: water (&quot;oxidane&quot; when substituted; synonym: hydrogen oxide), hydrogen peroxide
*sulfur: hydrogen sulfide (&quot;sulfane&quot; when substituted)
*selenium: hydrogen selenide (&quot;selane&quot; when substituted)
*tellurium: hydrogen telluride (&quot;tellane&quot; when substituted)
*polonium: hydrogen polonide (&quot;polane&quot; when substituted)
*halogens: hydrogen halides

Examples:
*nickel hydride: used in NiMH batteries
*palladium hydride: electrodes in cold fusion experiments
*lithium aluminium hydride: a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry
*sodium borohydride: selective specialty reducing agent, hydrogen storage in fuel cells
*sodium hydride: a powerful base used in organic chemistry
*diborane: reducing agent, rocket fuel, semiconductor dopant, catalyst, used in organic synthesis; also borane, pentaborane and decaborane
*arsine: used for doping semiconductors
*stibine: used in semiconductor industry
*phosphine: used for fumigation
*silane: many industrial uses, e.g. manufacture of composite materials and water repellents
*ammonia: coolant, fuel, fertilizer, many other industrial uses
*hydrogen sulfide: component of natural gas, important source of sulfur
*Chemically, even water and hydrocarbons could be considered hydrides.

All metalloid hydrides are highly flammable. All solid non-metallic hydrides except ice are highly flammable. But when hydrogen combines with halogens it produces acids rather than hydrides, and they are not flammable.

===Precedence convention===
According to IUPAC convention, by precedence (stylized electronegativity), hydrogen falls between group 15 and group 16 elements. Therefore, we have NH3, &quot;nitrogen hydride&quot; (ammonia), versus H2O, &quot;hydrogen oxide&quot; (water). This convention is sometimes broken for polonium, which on the grounds of polonium&#x27;s metallicity is often referred to as &quot;polonium hydride&quot; instead of the expected &quot;hydrogen polonide&quot;.

<doc id="142103" wikidata="Q311455" url="?curid=142103" title="William II, Prince of Orange">
<text>William II (Dutch: &quot;Willem II&quot;; 27 May 1626 – 6 November 1650) was sovereign Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel and Groningen in the United Provinces of the Netherlands from 14 March 1647 until his death three years later on 6 November 1650. His death marked the beginning of the First Stadtholderless Period, leading to the rise of Johan De Witt, who stayed in power for the next 22 years.

His only child, William III, reigned as King of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1689, following the Glorious Revolution. His son William also became Stadtholder of the Five Dutch Provinces in 1672, marking the end of the formentioned Stadtholderless Period.

==Early life and childhood (1626-1640)==

William II (or Willem II), Prince of Orange, was born on 27 May 1626, as the first legitimate child and elder son of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and his wife Amalia of Solms-Braunfels. Frederick Henry was the youngest son of William the Silent (stadtholder 1559–1584); his older half brother Maurits of Nassau was Stadtholder (1585–1625); Frederick Henry was stadtholder from 1625 to 1647. Frederick Henry also had another half-brother, Philip William, who reigned as Prince of Orange (1584−1618). William had eight liveborn siblings, but his surviving siblings were Luise Henriette (1627−1667), Albertine Agnes (1634−1696), Henriette Catherine (1637−1708) and Maria (1642−1688). All of his surviving sisters married into German nobility. The stadtholders governed in conjunction with the States-General, an assembly of representatives from each of the seven provinces, but usually dominated by the largest and wealthiest province, Holland.

== Marriage to Mary, Princess Royal ==

=== First proposal to Princess Mary of England (1640) ===

In January 1640, William of Orange proposed to Mary, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of Charles I of England, Scotland, &amp; Ireland, by his wife Queen Henrietta Maria of France. The young princess was only 8-years old at the time. The offer of the House of Orange was at first rejected by King Charles I, who wanted to give his daughter in marriage to Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias, only son and heir of King Philip IV of Spain and also Mary&#x27;s maternal first cousin. A prerequisite for such a union was Mary&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism, but the princess, who at the request of her mother studied the basics of the Catholic religion, did not want to change her faith. As a result, Mary declined William&#x27;s hand in marriage.

=== Second proposal and eventual marriage (1641) ===
In late 1640–early 1641, King Charles I decided to renew negotiations with Prince Frederick Henry of Orange. On 10 February 1641, Charles announced to Parliament that the betrothal of his daughter was actually concluded and that it only remained to consider this union from a political point of view. Charles himself hoped that in case of emergency, the Prince of Orange would help him to maintain royal power in England.

A modest wedding ceremony took place on 2 May 1641 at the Chapel Royal in Whitehall Palace, London. William was not yet fifteen, while Mary was just nine at that time. Mary and William were congratulated by courtiers, and received several gifts; in addition, in honour of the couple, a volley of 120 guns was fired. Almost as soon as the ceremony ended, William returned to the Netherlands. In November 1643, the second marriage ceremony between the 17-year-old William and 12-year-old Mary took place in The Hague. The marriage was not consummated until 1644. In February 1644, Mary completely merged into the life of her husband&#x27;s court.

==Reign and later life (1647-1650)==

In 1647, his father, Frederick Henry died on 14 March, after a long illness (he suffered from gout and possibly some kind of Alzheimer&#x27;s in the last few years of his life), and William II succeeded to both his hereditary titles and his elective offices as stadtholder of six of the seven provinces: Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel and Groningen at the young age of 21. Soon after he became stadtholder, his wife Mary suffered a miscarriage, after which she couldn&#x27;t conceive for a few years.

The Netherlands at this time was engaged in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain for its independence. Under Frederick Henry, the Netherlands had largely won the war, and since 1646 had been negotiating with Spain on the terms for ending it.

The negotiators agreed to the Peace of Münster in 1648, but William opposed acceptance of the treaty, even though it recognized the independence of the (northern) Netherlands, because it left the southern Netherlands in the hands of the Spanish monarchy. A separate peace furthermore violated the alliance with France formed in 1635. However, the States of six provinces voted to accept it.

Secretly, William opened his own negotiations with France with the goal of extending his own territory under a more centralized government. In addition, he worked for the restoration of his exiled brother-in-law, Charles II, to the throne of England, William&#x27;s father-in-law Charles I had been executed months earlier.

In 1650 William II became involved in a bitter quarrel with the province of Holland and the powerful Regents of Amsterdam, Cornelis and Andries Bicker and their more diplomatic cousin Cornelis de Graeff. With the Peace of Münster, the Regents wanted to reduce the army, saving money. That would also diminish William&#x27;s authority. William imprisoned eight members of the States of Holland (including Jacob de Witt) in the castle of Loevestein. In addition, he sent his cousin, Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz with an army of 10,000 men to seize Amsterdam by force. Bad weather foiled this campaign, but Amsterdam did give in.

== Death ==

By early 1650, William&#x27;s consort Mary was pregnant again. William for most of his life enjoyed quite good health. However, in late October-early November, when the princess&#x27;s pregnancy was coming to an end, William fell ill with smallpox and died on 6 November (by the Julian Calendar), just after his attempt to capture Amsterdam from his political opponents. William served as stadtholder for only three years. His only son William was born eight days after his death (i.e. 14th November by the Gregorian Calendar, 4th November by the Julian Calendar). This was the beginning of the First Stadtholderless Period. His son succeeded him in 1672 as stadtholder and later, in 1689, also became King of England.

== Issue ==
On 2 May 1641, William II married Mary, Princess Royal, second surviving child and eldest daughter of King Charles I of England by his French consort Henrietta Maria of France. In 1643, they held a second marriage ceremony. From this union, William and Mary had the following offspring:

* miscarried child (1647)
* William Henry, later King William III of England &amp; Ireland, King William II of Scotland, and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic (4 November 1650 - 8 March 1702) married in 1677 to his maternal first cousin Mary II of England, Scotland &amp; Ireland, eldest daughter of William III&#x27;s maternal uncle, the future King James VII &amp; II by his first wife Anne Hyde; no issue.

==Arms==
William II used the following arms during his time as prince of Orange, Stadholder or Holland, etc., and Captain-General:

<doc id="142106" wikidata="Q1648321" url="?curid=142106" title="Zoidberg">
<text>Dr. John A. Zoidberg, often referred to mononymously as Zoidberg, is a fictional character from the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot; and is the series&#x27; comic relief. He is a Decapodian, a crustacean-like species of alien, who works as the staff doctor for &quot;Planet Express&quot;, despite his woeful understanding of human physiology and allusions to his questionable credentials. His character parodies the supposed wealth and automatic respect of modern doctors—for example, his incompetence at human medicine makes him extremely poor despite his profession, and he is implied to be frequently homeless when not at work.

Zoidberg is voiced by Billy West, who performs the character with a Yiddish-inflected accent inspired by actors George Jessel and Lou Jacobi.

==Character creation==
Zoidberg is named after an Apple II game that series writer David X. Cohen created in high school called &quot;Zoid&quot;, similar to the game &quot;Qix&quot;. The game was rejected by Broderbund. One of Cohen&#x27;s inspirations for the character of Dr. Zoidberg was the fact that &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Leonard McCoy, the ship&#x27;s doctor, frequently administered medical treatment to aliens such as Spock, so Cohen wished human characters in &quot;Futurama&quot; to be in the uneasy situation of being treated by an alien doctor.

During the first season, jokes surrounding Zoidberg usually focused on his poor understanding of human anatomy and his resulting incompetence as a doctor, and the fact that all of his co-workers hate him. His incompetence is aggravated by the fact that he believes himself to be an expert on human anatomy, and will blithely attempt to treat human patients as he would his own species. One of his running traits is his pronunciation of the word &quot;robot&quot;, pronouncing it rather than . His use of English grammar and idioms resembles the stereotypical speech of Jewish people living in the northeastern United States, and elements of Jewish humor, and playful reversals on it, are a theme. As the series progressed, writers gradually introduced the themes that Zoidberg is also poor, homeless, friendless, smelly, undignified, and repulsive—comically opposite the idea that a doctor stereotypically occupies a respectable, wealthy, and romantically desirable role. Regardless of these traits, Zoidberg is good-natured and means well, and will help the crew when the situation calls for it. Zoidberg also generally attempts to make himself look refined, successful, and important in front of others, though this illusion is quickly dashed when pointed out.

==Biography==
Zoidberg is the company doctor at Planet Express. Although he claims expertise in human medicine, particularly internal medicine, his knowledge of human anatomy and physiology is atrocious. He has been shown as unable to tell the difference between robots and humans (or human males and females), believes food is digested in the heart, and that humans have multiple mouths and a dorsal fin. His only knowledge of humans seems to come from television advertisements, although his skills as a physician generally vary: in &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulders&quot; he manages to successfully transplant Fry&#x27;s head onto Amy&#x27;s body after Fry&#x27;s body incurs massive trauma in a vehicular accident, that he caused, that requires extensive repair, but in &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot; he incorrectly declares Fry dead only for him to wake up a few seconds later. In &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, he performs several limb reattachments to moderate success. It may be assumed that advances in medical technology have made limb and head reattachment a simple process, as in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; head reattachment is shown to be little more than applying a paste to the area and placing the head back on (a process that works even if the head is on backwards, as shown). In &quot;Parasites Lost&quot;, due to his incompetence as a physician, he comes to the conclusion that Fry, who is frequently injured, is a hypochondriac, an accusation he makes when Fry sits before Zoidberg with a pipe through his chest. He claims to be an MD, but states, unconvincingly, in &quot;A Clone of My Own&quot; that he lost his medical degree in a volcano. However, he later states in &quot;The Duh-Vinci Code&quot; that his PhD is in art history (as opposed to medicine). Other intimations to his dubious medical training include the episode &quot;Teenage Mutant Leela&#x27;s Hurdles&quot;, in which he comments, &quot;I&#x27;m no robot doctor, but this machine guy could really use a lozenge.&quot; Although he is shown to be incompetent at treating humans, the episode &quot;The Tip of the Zoidberg&quot; shows he is a competent doctor for alien species, such as the Yeti. In the episode, Professor Farnsworth says he is an expert in alien physiology. There are also frequent mentions throughout the series that he has good medical knowledge regarding his own species, for example in the episode &quot;Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?&quot; he talks about fin rot, which is a real disease that affects fish.

Despite his career as a physician, Zoidberg is repeatedly identified as living in poverty, lonely and desperate for friendship and attention. The crew are often disgusted by his foul habits, such as squirting ink or eating from trash cans, though he is mostly oblivious to their true feelings about him, having referred to Hermes Conrad and Bender as friends. Dr. Zoidberg also seems outgoing and unaware of dangerous situations, for example when Roberto tries to escape the cops with a knife at Dr. Zoidberg’s throat, Roberto asks “Can’t a guy drop in on old friends?!?” To which Zoidberg replies “I’m good! And you?” Hermes seems to have the most intense dislike of Zoidberg, seeing him as even more expendable than the rest of the crew. However, when Fry reads Hermes&#x27; mind in &quot;Into the Wild Green Yonder&quot;, it is revealed that Hermes sees him as &quot;pathetic but lovable&quot;. In &quot;The Six Million Dollar Mon&quot;, after Hermes quits Planet Express and trades his own body parts for robot parts, a depressed Zoidberg recovers the discarded parts and sews them together to create a full-fledged ventriloquist dummy of Hermes, which he later uses to transplant Hermes&#x27; brain out of his robot body and back into his original body. After Hermes thanks him and admits that they had never been friends, Zoidberg callously calls out Hermes for his treatment of him, leaving Hermes impressed with this confrontation. Zoidberg briefly becomes a hero when he saves Earth from enslavement to his own kind in &quot;A Taste of Freedom&quot;. Fry and Professor Farnsworth are usually the only ones to refer to Zoidberg as a friend, and in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, Zoidberg says of Fry, &quot;He was the only one of you who never struck me!&quot; during the latter&#x27;s memorial. Zoidberg has ambitions to be a stand-up comedian, but he is entirely unsuccessful at this endeavor. In &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot;, his uncle, the silent hologram star Harold Zoid (a parody of Harold Lloyd), advises him to give up on comedy and finance a film whose script Zoid is writing.

The reason that the Professor continues to employ Zoidberg as the staff physician, despite his apparent incompetence, is revealed in the sixth-season episode, &quot;The Tip of the Zoidberg&quot;. The Professor is under the impression that he had been infected with the fatal disease hyper-malaria, contracted during a covert quasi-military mission. The Professor had asked Zoidberg to promise to kill him when the latent disease manifested itself, and Zoidberg agreed. In that episode it is also explained that Zoidberg is, in fact, a very competent physician &quot;for all other species except humans&quot;. Planet Express&#x27; main competitor, Mom, whom Zoidberg knows on a first name basis as &quot;Carol&quot;, states that Zoidberg is &quot;the best in the business&quot; when it comes to alien anatomy; &quot;at his price level&quot;. Unlike all of the other characters, Mom addresses Zoidberg with great respect and admiration. Mom tells Zoidberg that he could have been a millionaire with his own research lab if he had worked for her. Mom also asks Zoidberg why he has stayed with Farnsworth through the years; Zoidberg replied that it is because Farnsworth is his friend.

When frightened or fleeing from danger or trouble, Zoidberg makes a high-pitched whooping sound, similar to Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, or squirts ink at his attacker. It is revealed in &quot;The Cryonic Woman&quot; that Zoidberg has always dreamed of becoming a grandmother. &quot;A Taste of Freedom&quot; and &quot;&quot; indicate that Zoidberg harbored a childhood dream of working in show business as a comedian or song-and-dance man, but that his parents pushed him to become a doctor.

Zoidberg is depicted as being ignorant of human customs, and socially inept, to the point of inspiring great aggravation in others. In &quot;Where the Buggalo Roam&quot;, during his stay at the ranch of Amy Wong&#x27;s parents, he treats them as surrogate parents – to the point of calling them &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Pa&quot; – despite their obvious distaste for him, and abuses their hospitality until they throw him out.

Zoidberg&#x27;s race, the Decapodians—from the sandy, beach-like planet Decapod 10—are crustaceans, generally lobster-like in appearance, with lobster-like claws, mouth tentacles, a hard exoskeleton, a fleshy, boneless interior, a fin that appears atop their heads during mating season or extreme anger, an ink pouch, two stomachs (one saltwater and one freshwater), four hearts, gonopores, and a complex system of internal organs, &quot;most of which are either redundant or unnecessary.&quot; In &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;, he is not fazed when one of his hearts is removed by an alien autopsy team of human doctors, saying &quot;Take it, take it, I have four of them!&quot;. Zoidberg has been depicted as able to consume things not considered food by humans, such as fish bones, wood, and chess pieces. Decapodians are able to molt their shell, like a lobster, leaving behind a whole exoskeleton—a trait which Zoidberg has used to fake his own death on occasion. In the episode &quot;Bendin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, Zoidberg produces tie-dye blue pearls after consuming large amounts of dirt. Zoidberg also habitually eats clothing and once, an Earth flag. Given that he refers to clothes as food and considers them a kind of delicacy, it may be that Decapodians themselves consume clothes. In &quot;Möbius Dick&quot;, it is revealed that Zoidberg spontaneously grows hair in moments of extreme fright. 

Decapodians are semelparous, like the Pacific salmon. At one point in all Decapodians&#x27; lives, they enter a mating phase, or &quot;The Frenzy&quot; as they call it, which causes them to behave in a neurotic and manic way. During this chaotic time, their behavior is dictated by the tiny brain located in their rumps. They also develop incredible super strength, their head fin comes out for mating displays, their stink glands increase production and the males become saturated with male jelly as the females become engorged with eggs. In the episode &quot;Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?&quot;, it is indicated that once Decapodians mate, they die; Zoidberg was raised by a third figure, placed on equal footing as his biological parents.

The episode &quot;Teenage Mutant Leela&#x27;s Hurdles&quot; indicates that young Decapodians progress through various larval forms, including those resembling crustaceans, invertebrate, fish, coral, starfish, sea sponges, and clams, before reaching their humanoid adult forms. However, in the episode &quot;A Taste of Freedom&quot;, a young Zoidberg is seen with his typical humanoid form.

Dr. Zoidberg is also a skilled theremin player, and is the only person ever seen in the series to be &#x27;good&#x27; enough to receive a present from Robot Santa. He is an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters, and a talented hand-to-claw combatant; he severs Fry&#x27;s arm in an honor-duel (&quot;Claw-Plach&quot;) and eventually fights and defeats the dangerous robot Clamps.

Dr. Zoidberg finally finds happiness in the episode &quot;Stench and Stenchibility&quot;, when he meets and starts dating a flower merchant named Marianne, who suffers from anosmia. He performs a &quot;nose transplant&quot; to give her a sense of smell, though he is afraid that once she smells him, she will immediately reject him. Serendipitously, Marianne turns out to abhor the smell of flowers, instead preferring Zoidberg&#x27;s aroma. She becomes a waste collector and the two continue dating. Zoidberg had largely corrected his medical blind spot concerning human anatomy, as demonstrated by Marianne&#x27;s transplant and his earlier complete re-assembling of Hermes&#x27; body from cast-off parts.

<doc id="142110" wikidata="Q268821" url="?curid=142110" title="Princess Margriet of the Netherlands">
<text>Princess Margriet of the Netherlands (Margriet Francisca; born 19 January 1943) is the third daughter of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. As an aunt of the reigning monarch, King Willem-Alexander, she is a member of the Dutch Royal House and currently eighth and last in the line of succession to the throne.

Princess Margriet has often represented the monarch at official or semi-official events. Some of these functions have taken her back to Canada, the country where she was born &quot;de facto&quot;, and to events organised by the Dutch merchant navy of which she is a patron.

==Birth and Canada==

Margriet was born to Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. Her mother was heir presumptive to Queen Wilhelmina.

The Dutch royal family went into exile when the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940, and went to live in Canada. Margriet was born in Ottawa Civic Hospital, Ottawa. The maternity ward of the hospital was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government. This ensured that the newborn would not be born in Canada, and not be a British subject under the rule of &quot;jus soli&quot;. Instead, the child would only inherit Dutch citizenship from her mother under the principle of &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;, which is followed in Dutch nationality law. Thus, the child would be eligible to succeed to the throne of the Netherlands. This would have applied if the child had been male, and therefore heir apparent to Juliana, or if her two older sisters died without eligible children.

It is a common misconception that the Canadian government declared the maternity ward to be Dutch territory. That was not necessary, as Canada follows &quot;jus soli&quot;, while the Netherlands follows &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;. It was sufficient for Canada to disclaim the territory temporarily.

Princess Margriet was named after the &quot;marguerite&quot;, the flower worn during the war as a symbol of the resistance to Nazi Germany. She was christened at St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Ottawa, on 29 June 1943. Her godparents included US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Queen Mary (Queen dowager of the United Kingdom), Märtha, Crown Princess of Norway, and Martine Roell (lady-in-waiting to Princess Juliana in Canada).

Princess Margriet has continued to visit Canada over the years in an official capacity, as recently as 2017 (Stratford, Ontario and Goderich, Ontario) and 2022 (Ottawa).

==After the war==

It was not until August 1945, when the Netherlands had been liberated, that Princess Margriet first set foot on Dutch soil. Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard returned to Soestdijk Palace in Baarn, where the family had lived before the war.

While she was studying at Leiden University, Princess Margriet met her future husband, Pieter van Vollenhoven. Their engagement was announced on 10 March 1965, and they were married on 10 January 1967 in The Hague, in the St. James Church. It was decreed that any children from the marriage would be titled Prince/Princess of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, with the style of &quot;Highness&quot;, titles that would not be held by their descendants. Together, they had four sons:

* Prince &quot;Maurits&quot; Willem Pieter Hendrik of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born on 17 April 1968, Utrecht, Netherlands). He married &quot;Marilène&quot; (Marie-Helène) Angela van den Broek (born on 4 February 1970, Dieren, Rheden, Netherlands) on 30 May 1998. They have three children:
** Anastasia (&quot;Anna&quot;) Margriet Joséphine van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 15 April 2001).
** &quot;Lucas&quot; Maurits Pieter Henri van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 26 October 2002).
** &quot;Felicia&quot; Juliana Bénedicte Barbara van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 31 May 2005).
* Prince &quot;Bernhard&quot; Lucas Emmanuel of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born on 25 December 1969, Nijmegen, Netherlands). He married &quot;Annette&quot; Sekrève (born on 18 April 1972, The Hague, Netherlands) on 8 July 2000. They have three children:
** &quot;Isabella&quot; Lily Juliana van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 14 May 2002).
** &quot;Samuel&quot; Bernhard Louis van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 25 May 2004).
** &quot;Benjamin&quot; Pieter Floris van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 12 March 2008).
* Prince &quot;Pieter-Christiaan&quot; Michiel of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, (born on 22 March 1972, Nijmegen, Netherlands). He married &quot;Anita&quot; Theodora van Eijk (born on 27 October 1969, Neuchâtel, Switzerland) on 27 August 2005. They have two children:
** &quot;Emma&quot; Francisca Catharina van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 28 November 2006).
** &quot;Pieter&quot; Anton Maurits Erik van Vollenhoven, (born in The Hague on 19 November 2008).
* Prince &quot;Floris&quot; Frederik Martijn of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven, (born on 10 April 1975, Nijmegen, Netherlands). He married &quot;Aimée&quot; Leonie Allegonde Marie Söhngen (born on 18 October 1977, Amsterdam, Netherlands) on 20 October 2005. They have three children:
** &quot;Magali&quot; Margriet Eleonoor van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 9 October 2007).
** &quot;Eliane&quot; Sophia Carolina van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 5 July 2009).
** &quot;Willem-Jan&quot; Johannes Pieter Floris van Vollenhoven, (born in Amsterdam on 1 July 2013).

The Princess and her husband took up residence in the right wing of Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn. In 1975 the family moved to their present home, Het Loo, which they had built on the Palace grounds.

==Interests and activities==
Princess Margriet is particularly interested in health care and cultural causes. From 1987 to 2011 she was vice-president of the Dutch Red Cross, who set up the &quot;Princess Margriet Fund&quot; in her honour. She is a member of the board of the International Federation of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

From 1984 to 2007, Princess Margriet was president of the European Cultural Foundation, who set up the &quot;Princess Margriet Award for Cultural Diversity&quot; in acknowledgement of her work.

She is a member of the honorary board of the International Paralympic Committee.

<text>Enrico De Nicola, (; 9 November 1877 – 1 October 1959) was an Italian jurist, journalist, politician, statesman, and provisional head of state of republican Italy from 1946 to 1948. Afterwards, he became the first president of Italy on 1 January 1948.

==Biography==
Enrico De Nicola was born in Naples and became famous as a penal lawyer. He studied law at the University of Naples, graduating in 1896. As a Liberal he was elected a deputy for the first time in 1909 and, from 1913 to 1921, he filled minor governmental posts until the advent of fascism, when he retired from political life. He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in the Giolitti government (November 1913 — March 1914) and Under-Secretary of State for the Treasury in the Orlando cabinet (January–June 1919). On 26 June 1920, he was elected speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, holding office until January 1924. He was appointed senator by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1929, but he refused to take his seat and never took part in the workings of the Assembly.
He returned to his law practice, only taking an interest in politics again after the fall of Italian Fascism. After Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fall from power in 1943, king Victor Emmanuel tried to extricate the monarchy from its collaboration with the Fascist regime; De Nicola was perhaps the most influential mediator in the ensuing transition. The king&#x27;s son Umberto acquired a new title of &quot;Lieutenant-General of the Realm&quot; and took over most of the functions of the sovereign. Victor Emanuel later abdicated; Umberto became king as Umberto II and a Constitutional Referendum was held, won by republicans. A new Constituent Assembly was elected, and prime minister Alcide de Gasperi became acting head of state for a few weeks when Umberto II was exiled and left Italy. The Constituent Assembly then elected De Nicola Provisional Head of State on 28 June 1946, with 80% of the votes, at the first round of voting. Giulio Andreotti later recalled that De Nicola — a man of great modesty — was not sure whether to accept the nomination and underwent frequent changes of mind in the face of repeated insistence by all the major political leaders. Andreotti recalled that the journalist Manlio Lupinacci then issued an appeal to De Nicola in the pages of &quot;Il Giornale d&#x27;Italia&quot;: &quot;Your Excellency, please, decide to decide if you can accept to accept...&quot;

On 25 June 1947, De Nicola resigned from the post, citing health reasons, but the Constituent Assembly immediately re-elected him again the following day, having recognized in his act signs of nobility and humility. After the Italian Constitution took effect, he was formally named the &quot;President of the Italian Republic&quot; on 1 January 1948. He finally refused to be a candidate for the first constitutional election the following May, in which Luigi Einaudi was elected to the Quirinale, the formal seat of the Italian presidency.

In 1948, De Nicola became a senator for life as a former Head of State, and later was elected President of the Senate, and of the Constitutional Court.

He died at Torre del Greco, in the province of Naples, on 1 October 1959. He was unmarried and had no children.

==Honours==
 – Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity

 – Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1956)

==Political titles==
His other political titles included President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Temporary Chief of the Italian State and President of the Italian Senate.

<doc id="142123" wikidata="Q656660" url="?curid=142123" title="Plessy v. Ferguson">
<text>Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the facilities for each race were equal in quality, a doctrine that came to be known as &quot;separate but equal&quot;. The decision legitimized the many state &quot;Jim Crow laws&quot; re-establishing racial segregation that had been passed in the American South after the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877. Such legally enforced segregation in the South lasted into the 1960s.

The underlying case began in 1892 when Homer Plessy, a mixed-race man, deliberately boarded a whites-only train car in New Orleans. By boarding the whites-only car, Plessy violated Louisiana&#x27;s Separate Car Act of 1890, which required &quot;equal, but separate&quot; railroad accommodations for white and black passengers. Plessy was charged under the Act, and at his trial his lawyers argued that judge John Howard Ferguson should dismiss the charges on the grounds that the Act was unconstitutional. Ferguson denied the request, and the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld Ferguson&#x27;s ruling on appeal. Plessy then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In May 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision against Plessy, ruling that the Louisiana law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and stating that although the Fourteenth Amendment established the legal equality of whites and blacks, it did not and could not require the elimination of all &quot;distinctions based upon color&quot;. The Court rejected Plessy&#x27;s lawyers&#x27; arguments that the Louisiana law inherently implied that black people were inferior, and gave great deference to American state legislatures&#x27; inherent power to make laws regulating health, safety, and morals—the &quot;police power&quot;—and to determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter from the Court&#x27;s decision, writing that the U.S. Constitution &quot;is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens&quot;, and so the laws distinguishing races should have been found unconstitutional.

&quot;Plessy&quot; is widely regarded as one of the worst decisions in U.S. Supreme Court history. Despite its infamy, the decision has never been explicitly overruled. However, beginning in 1954 with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which held that the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine is unconstitutional in the context of public schools, a series of the Court&#x27;s later decisions have severely weakened &quot;Plessy&quot; to the point that it is considered to have been &quot;de facto&quot; overruled.

==Background==
===Legal background and incident===
In 1890, the Louisiana State Legislature passed a law called the Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodations for blacks and whites on Louisiana railroads. The law required passenger train officers to &quot;assign each passenger to the coach or compartment used for the race to which such passenger belongs&quot;. It also made it a misdemeanor for any passenger to &quot;insist on going into a coach or compartment to which by race he does not belong,&quot; punishable by either a $25 fine or up to 20 days in prison.

A group of prominent black, creole of color, and white creole New Orleans residents formed a civil rights group called the Comité des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens). The group was dedicated to repealing the Separate Car Act and fighting its implementation. The Comité eventually persuaded Homer Plessy, a man of mixed race who was an &quot;octoroon&quot; (person of seven-eighths white and one-eighth black ancestry), to participate in an orchestrated test case to challenge the Act. Plessy had been born a free man and was fair-skinned. However, under Louisiana law, he was classified as black, and thus required to sit in the &quot;colored&quot; car.

On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket at the Press Street Depot and boarded a &quot;Whites Only&quot; car of the East Louisiana Railroad in New Orleans, Louisiana, bound for Covington, Louisiana. The railroad company, which had opposed the law on the grounds that it would require the purchase of more railcars, had been previously informed of Plessy&#x27;s racial lineage, and the intent to challenge the law. Additionally, the Comité des Citoyens hired a private detective with arrest powers to detain Plessy, to ensure that he would be charged for violating the Separate Car Act, as opposed to vagrancy or some other offense. After Plessy took a seat in the whites-only railway car, he was asked to vacate it, and sit instead in the blacks-only car. Plessy refused and was arrested immediately by the detective. As planned, the train was stopped, and Plessy was taken off the train at Press and Royal streets. Plessy was remanded for trial in Orleans Parish.

===Trial===
Plessy petitioned the state district criminal court to throw out the case, &quot;State v. Homer Adolph Plessy&quot;, on the grounds that the state law requiring East Louisiana Railroad to segregate trains had denied him his rights under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, which provided for equal treatment under the law. However, the judge presiding over his case, John Howard Ferguson, ruled that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroad companies while they operated within state boundaries. Four days later, Plessy petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to stop his criminal trial.

===State appeal===
The Louisiana Supreme Court issued a temporary writ of prohibition while it reviewed Plessy&#x27;s case. In December 1892, the court upheld Judge Ferguson&#x27;s ruling, and denied Plessy&#x27;s attorneys&#x27; subsequent request for a rehearing. In speaking for the court&#x27;s decision that Ferguson&#x27;s judgment did not violate the 14th Amendment, Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Charles Erasmus Fenner cited a number of precedents, including two key cases from Northern states. The Massachusetts Supreme Court had ruled in 1849—before the 14th amendment—that segregated schools were constitutional. In answering the charge that segregation perpetuated race prejudice, the Massachusetts court famously stated: &quot;This prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and probably cannot be changed by law.&quot; The law itself was repealed five years later, but the precedent stood.

In a Pennsylvania law mandating separate railcars for different races the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated: &quot;To assert separateness is not to declare inferiority ... It is simply to say that following the order of Divine Providence, human authority ought not to compel these widely separated races to intermix.&quot;

===Supreme Court appeal===
Undaunted, the Committee appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Two legal briefs were submitted on Plessy&#x27;s behalf. One was signed by Albion W. Tourgée and James C. Walker and the other by Samuel F. Phillips and his legal partner F. D. McKenney. Oral arguments were held before the Supreme Court on April 13, 1896. Tourgée and Phillips appeared in the courtroom to speak on behalf of Plessy.
Tourgée built his case upon violation of Plessy&#x27;s rights under the 13th Amendment, prohibiting slavery, and the 14th Amendment, which states &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; Tourgée argued that the reputation of being a black man was &quot;property&quot;, which, by the law, implied the inferiority of African Americans as compared to whites. The state legal brief was prepared by Attorney General Milton Joseph Cunningham of Natchitoches and New Orleans. Cunningham was a staunch supporter of white supremacy, who according to a laudatory 1916 obituary &quot;worked so effectively [during Reconstruction] in restoring white supremacy in politics that he finally was arrested, with fifty-one other men of that community, and tried by federal officials.&quot;

==Decision==
On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision against Plessy that upheld the constitutionality of Louisiana&#x27;s train car segregation laws.

===Opinion of the Court===

Seven justices formed the Court&#x27;s majority and joined an opinion written by justice Henry Billings Brown. The Court first dismissed any claim that the Louisiana law violated the Thirteenth Amendment, which, in the majority&#x27;s opinion, did no more than ensure that black Americans had the basic level of legal equality needed to abolish slavery.

Next, the Court considered whether the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause, which reads: &quot;nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; The Court said that although the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to guarantee the legal equality of all races in the United States, it was not intended to prevent social or other types of discrimination.

The Court reasoned that laws requiring racial separation were within Louisiana&#x27;s police power: the core sovereign authority of U.S. states to pass laws on matters of &quot;health, safety, and morals&quot;. It held that as long as a law that classified and separated people by their race was a reasonable and good faith exercise of a state&#x27;s police power and was not designed to oppress a particular class, the law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. According to the Court, the question in any case that involved a racial segregation law was whether the law was reasonable, and the Court gave State legislatures broad discretion to determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed.

Plessy&#x27;s lawyers had argued that segregation laws inherently implied that black people were inferior, and therefore stigmatized them with a second-class status that violated the Equal Protection Clause. But the Court rejected this argument.

The Court rejected the notion that the law marked black Americans with &quot;a badge of inferiority&quot;, and said that racial prejudice could not be overcome by legislation.

===Harlan&#x27;s dissent===

Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter from the Court&#x27;s decision. Harlan strongly disagreed with the Court&#x27;s conclusion that the Louisiana railcar law did not imply that black people were inferior, and he accused the majority of being willfully ignorant on the issue.

To support his argument, Harlan pointed out that the Louisiana law contained an exception for &quot;nurses attending children of the other race&quot;. This exception allowed black women who were nannies to white children to be in the white-only train cars. Harlan said that this showed that the Louisiana law allowed black people to be in white-only cars only if it was obvious that they were &quot;social subordinates&quot; or &quot;domestics&quot;.

In a now-famous passage, Harlan forcefully argued that even though many white Americans of the late 19th century considered themselves superior to those of other races, the U.S. Constitution was &quot;color-blind&quot; regarding the law and civil rights. 

Harlan predicted the Court&#x27;s decision would eventually become as infamous as its 1857 decision &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, in which the Court had ruled that black Americans could not be citizens under the U.S. Constitution and that its legal protections and privileges could never apply to them.

==Aftermath==
After the Supreme Court ruling, Plessy&#x27;s criminal trial went ahead in Ferguson&#x27;s court in Louisiana on February 11, 1897. Plessy changed his plea to &quot;guilty&quot; of violating the Separate Car Act, which carried a $25 fine or 20 days in jail. He opted to pay the fine. The Comité des Citoyens disbanded shortly after the trial&#x27;s end.

==Significance==
&quot;Plessy&quot; legitimized state laws establishing &quot;racial&quot; segregation in the South and provided an impetus for further segregation laws. It also legitimized laws in the North requiring &quot;racial&quot; segregation, such as in the Boston school segregation case noted by Justice Brown in his majority opinion. Legislative achievements won during the Reconstruction Era were erased through means of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. The doctrine had been strengthened also by an 1875 Supreme Court decision that limited the federal government&#x27;s ability to intervene in state affairs, guaranteeing to Congress only the power &quot;to restrain states from acts of racial discrimination and segregation&quot;. The ruling basically granted states legislative immunity when dealing with questions of &quot;race&quot;, guaranteeing the states&#x27; right to implement racially separate institutions, requiring them only to be equal.

Despite the pretense of &quot;separate but equal&quot;, non-whites essentially always received inferior facilities and treatment, if they received them at all.
The prospect of greater state influence in matters of race worried numerous advocates of civil equality, including Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, who wrote in his &quot;Plessy&quot; dissent, &quot;we shall enter upon an era of constitutional law, when the rights of freedom and American citizenship cannot receive from the nation that efficient protection which heretofore was unhesitatingly accorded to slavery and the rights of the master.&quot; Harlan&#x27;s concerns about the encroachment on the 14th Amendment would prove well-founded; states proceeded to institute segregation-based laws that became known as the Jim Crow system. In addition, from 1890 to 1908, Southern states passed new or amended constitutions including provisions that effectively disenfranchised blacks and thousands of poor whites.

Some commentators, such as Gabriel J. Chin and Eric Maltz, have viewed Harlan&#x27;s &quot;Plessy&quot; dissent in a more critical light, and suggested it be viewed in context with his other decisions. Maltz has argued that &quot;modern commentators have often overstated Harlan&#x27;s distaste for race-based classifications&quot;, pointing to other aspects of decisions in which Harlan was involved. Both point to a passage of Harlan&#x27;s &quot;Plessy&quot; dissent as particularly troubling: There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a Chinaman can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risked their lives for the preservation of the Union... and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens, are yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by citizens of the white race.

New Orleans historian Keith Weldon Medley, author of &quot;We As Freemen: Plessy v. Ferguson, The Fight Against Legal Segregation&quot;, said the words in Justice Harlan&#x27;s &quot;Great Dissent&quot; were taken from papers filed with the court by &quot;The Citizen&#x27;s Committee&quot;.

The effect of the &quot;Plessy&quot; ruling was immediate; there were already significant differences in funding for the segregated school system, which continued into the 20th century; states consistently underfunded black schools, providing them with substandard buildings, textbooks, and supplies. States which had successfully integrated elements of their society abruptly adopted oppressive legislation that erased reconstruction era efforts. The principles of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; were affirmed in &quot;Lum v. Rice&quot; (1927), which upheld the right of a Mississippi public school for white children to exclude a Chinese American girl. Despite the laws enforcing compulsory education, and the lack of public schools for Chinese children in Lum&#x27;s area, the Supreme Court ruled that she had the choice to attend a private school. Jim Crow laws and practices spread northward in response to a second wave of African-American migration from the South to northern and midwestern cities. Some established de jure segregated educational facilities, separate public institutions such as hotels and restaurants, separate beaches among other public facilities, and restrictions on interracial marriage, but in other cases segregation in the North was related to unstated practices and operated on a de facto basis, although not by law, among numerous other facets of daily life.

The separate facilities and institutions accorded to the African-American community were consistently inferior to those provided to the White community. This contradicted the vague declaration of &quot;separate but equal&quot; issued after the &quot;Plessy&quot; decision. Since no state wrote the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine into a statute, there was no remedy, other than going back to the U.S. Supreme Court, if the separate facilities were not equal, and states faced no consequences if they underfunded services and facilities for non-whites.

From 1890 to 1908, state legislatures in the South disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites through rejecting them for voter registration and voting: making voter registration more difficult by providing more detailed records, such as proof of land ownership or literacy tests administered by white staff at poll stations. African-American community leaders, who had achieved brief political success during the Reconstruction era and even into the 1880s, lost gains made when their voters were excluded from the political system. Historian Rogers Smith noted on the subject that &quot;lawmakers frequently admitted, indeed boasted, that such measures as complex registration rules, literacy and property tests, poll taxes, white primaries, and grandfather clauses were designed to produce an electorate confined to a white race that declared itself supreme&quot;, notably rejecting the 14th and 15th Amendments to the American Constitution.

In &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public education was unconstitutional. While &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; was never explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court, it is effectively dead as a precedent; the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that segregation on interstate transport violated the Interstate Commerce Act in the 1955 case &quot;Keys v. Carolina Coach Co&quot;. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited legal segregation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voter registration and voting.

===Plessy and Ferguson Foundation===
In 2009, Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, descendants of participants on both sides of the 1896 Supreme Court case, announced the establishment of the Plessy and Ferguson Foundation for Education and Reconciliation. The foundation would work to create new ways to teach the history of civil rights through film, art, and public programs designed to create understanding of this historic case and its effect on the American conscience.

In 2009, a marker was placed at the corner of Press and Royal streets in New Orleans, where Plessy had been removed from his train.
===Pardon===
In 2021, the Louisiana Board of Pardons unanimously approved a posthumous pardon of Plessy, sending it to Governor John Bel Edwards for final approval. Edwards granted the pardon on January 5, 2022.

<doc id="142125" wikidata="Q438131" url="?curid=142125" title="Charles James Fox">
<text>Charles James Fox (24 January 1749 – 13 September 1806), styled &quot;The Honourable&quot; from 1762, was a British Whig politician and statesman whose parliamentary career spanned 38 years of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was the arch-rival of the Tory politician William Pitt the Younger; his father Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, a leading Whig of his day, had similarly been the great rival of Pitt&#x27;s famous father, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (&quot;Pitt the Elder&quot;).

Fox rose to prominence in the House of Commons as a forceful and eloquent speaker with a notorious and colourful private life, though at that time with rather conservative and conventional opinions. However, with the coming of the American War of Independence and the influence of the Whig Edmund Burke, Fox&#x27;s opinions evolved into some of the most radical to be aired in the British Parliament of his era.

Fox became a prominent and staunch opponent of King George III, whom he regarded as an aspiring tyrant. He supported the American Patriots and even dressed in the colours of George Washington&#x27;s army. Briefly serving as Britain&#x27;s first Foreign Secretary during the ministry of the Marquess of Rockingham in 1782, he returned to the post in a coalition government with his old enemy, Lord North, in 1783. However, the King forced Fox and North out of government before the end of the year and replaced them with the 24-year-old Pitt the Younger. Fox spent the following 22 years facing Pitt and the government from the opposition benches of the House of Commons.

Though Fox had little interest in the actual exercise of power and spent almost the entirety of his political career in opposition, he became noted as an anti-slavery campaigner, a supporter of the French Revolution and a leading parliamentary advocate of religious tolerance and individual liberty. His friendship with his mentor, Burke, and his parliamentary credibility were both casualties of Fox&#x27;s support for France during the French Revolutionary Wars, but Fox went on to attack Pitt&#x27;s wartime legislation and to defend the liberty of religious minorities and political radicals. After Pitt&#x27;s death in January 1806, Fox served briefly as Foreign Secretary in the &#x27;Ministry of All the Talents&#x27; of William Grenville before he died on 13 September 1806, aged 57.

==Early life: 1749–1758==
Fox was born in London on 24 January 1749, the second surviving son of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, and Lady Caroline Lennox, a daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond. Henry Fox (1705–1774) was an ally of Robert Walpole and rival of Pitt the Elder, and had amassed a considerable fortune by exploiting his position as Paymaster General of the Forces. Charles James Fox&#x27;s elder brother Stephen (1745–1774) became the 2nd Baron Holland, and his younger brother Henry (1755–1811) had a distinguished military career.

Fox was the darling of his father, who found Charles &quot;infinitely engaging &amp; clever &amp; pretty&quot; and, from the time that his son was three years old, apparently preferred his company at meals to that of anyone else. The stories of Charles&#x27;s over-indulgence by his doting father are legendary. It was said that Charles once expressed a great desire to break his father&#x27;s watch and was not restrained or punished when he duly smashed it on the floor. On another occasion, when Henry had promised his son that he could watch the demolition of a wall on his estate and found that it had already been destroyed, he ordered the workmen to rebuild the wall and demolish it again, with Charles watching.
Given &quot;carte blanche&quot; to choose his own education, Fox in 1758 attended a fashionable Wandsworth school run by a Monsieur Pampellonne, followed by Eton College, where he began to develop his lifelong love of classical literature. In later life he was said to have always carried a copy of Horace in his coat pocket. He was taken out of school by his father in 1761 to attend the coronation of George III, who would become one of his most bitter enemies, and once more in 1763 to travel to the Continent (where he visited Paris and Spa). On this trip Charles was given a substantial amount of money with which to learn to gamble by his father, who also arranged for him to lose his virginity, aged fourteen, to a Madame de Quallens. Fox returned to Eton later that year, &quot;attired in red-heeled shoes and Paris cut-velvet, adorned with a pigeon-wing hair style tinted with blue powder, and a newly acquired French accent&quot;, and was duly flogged by Dr. Barnard, the headmaster. Charles Fox was once known as a macaroni, despite him being a tad too overweight to look decent in his tight clothing. These three pursuits – gambling, womanising and the love of things and fashions foreign – would become, once inculcated in his adolescence, notorious habits of Fox&#x27;s later life.

Fox entered Hertford College, Oxford, in October 1764. His tutor there was William Newcome. By the standards of aristocratic students, he worked hard while at Oxford, especially at mathematics. However, he was rather contemptuous of Oxford&#x27;s &quot;nonsenses&quot;. He left without graduating in spring 1766, to tour Europe with his family. He went on several further expeditions to Europe, becoming well known in the great Parisian salons, meeting influential figures such as Voltaire, Jean-Jaques Rousseau, David Hume, Edward Gibbon, the duc d&#x27;Orléans and the Marquis de Lafayette, and becoming the co-owner of a number of racehorses with the duc de Lauzun.

== Early career: 1768–1774==
=== Member of Parliament ===
For the 1768 general election, Henry Fox bought his son a seat in Parliament for the West Sussex constituency of Midhurst, though Charles was still nineteen and technically ineligible for Parliament. Fox was to address the House of Commons some 254 times between 1768 and 1774 and rapidly gathered a reputation as a superb orator, but he had not yet developed the radical opinions for which he would become famous. Thus, he spent much of his early years unwittingly manufacturing ammunition for his later critics and their accusations of hypocrisy. A supporter of the Grafton and North ministries, Fox was prominent in the campaign to punish the radical John Wilkes for challenging the Commons. &quot;He thus opened his career by speaking in behalf of the Commons against the people and their elected representative.&quot; Consequently, both Fox and his brother Stephen were insulted and pelted with mud in the street by the pro-Wilkes London crowds.

Between 1770 and 1774, Fox&#x27;s seemingly promising career in the political establishment was spoiled. He was appointed to the Board of Admiralty by Lord North in February 1770, but on the 15th of the same month, he resigned due to his enthusiastic opposition to the government&#x27;s Royal Marriages Act, the provisions of which – incidentally – cast doubt on the legitimacy of his parents&#x27; marriage. On 28 December 1772, North appointed him to the board of the Treasury; in February 1774, Fox again surrendered his post, this time over the Government&#x27;s allegedly feeble response to the contemptuous printing and public distribution of copies of parliamentary debates. Behind these incidents lay his family&#x27;s resentment towards Lord North for refusing to elevate the Holland barony to an earldom. But the fact that such a young man could seemingly treat ministerial office so lightly was noted at court. In 1773 he was taken advantage of by the swindler Elizabeth Harriet Grieve. She had lent him £300 for which she got his name to use as a customer of her advice. Fox was promised that Grieve could arrange a marriage for him to a West Indian heiress named Miss Phipps. Fox was so taken in that he started to powder his eyebrows in order that he might appeal to her. Grieve was eventually sent to trial but the resulting scandal resulted in news stories, rhymes and a play at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. George III, also observing Fox&#x27;s licentious private behaviour, took it to be presumption and judged that Fox could not be trusted to take anything seriously.

After 1774, Fox began to reconsider his political position under the influence of Edmund Burke – who had sought out the promising young Whig and would become his mentor – and the unfolding events in America. He drifted from his rather non-ideological family-oriented politics into the orbit of the Rockingham Whig party.

During this period, Fox became possibly the most prominent and vituperative parliamentary critic of Lord North and the conduct of the American War. In 1775, he denounced North in the Commons as
=== American Revolution ===
Fox, who occasionally corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and had met Benjamin Franklin in Paris, correctly predicted that Britain had little practical hope of subduing the colonies and interpreted the American cause approvingly as a struggle for liberty against the oppressive policies of a despotic and unaccountable executive. It was at this time that Fox and his supporters took up the habit of dressing in buff and blue, the colours of the uniforms in Washington&#x27;s army. Fox&#x27;s friend, the Earl of Carlisle, observed that any setback for the British Government in America was &quot;a great cause of amusement to Charles.&quot; Even after the Battle of Long Island in 1776, Fox stated that

On 31 October the same year, Fox responded to the King&#x27;s address to Parliament with &quot;one of his finest and most animated orations, and with severity to the answered person&quot;, so much so that, when he sat down, no member of the Government would attempt to reply.

Fox shared a mutual antipathy with George III that profoundly shaped Fox&#x27;s political career. George III was among the most enthusiastic prosecutors of the American Revolutionary War. Fox became convinced, that George III was determined to challenge the authority of parliament and the balance of the constitution established in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to achieve a continental-style tyranny. George III in return thought that Fox had &quot;cast off every principle of common honour and honesty ... [a man who is] as contemptible as he is odious ... [and has an] aversion to all restraints.&quot; On 6 April 1780 John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton introduced a motion, asking that &quot;The influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished&quot;. It was passed by the Commons in a vote of 233 to 215. Fox thought that the motion is &quot;glorious&quot;, saying on 24 April that:
Fox, however, had not been present in the House of parliament for the beginning of the Dunning debate, as he had been occupied in the adjoining eleventh-century Westminster Hall, serving as chairman of a mass public meeting before a large banner that read &quot;Annual Parliaments and Equal Representation&quot;. This was the period when Fox, hardening against the influence of the British Crown, was embraced by the radical movement of the late eighteenth century. When the shocking Gordon riots exploded in London in June 1780, Fox, though deploring the violence of the crowd, declared that he would &quot;much rather be governed by a mob than a standing army.&quot; Later, in July, Fox was returned for the populous and prestigious parliamentary constituency of Westminster, with around 12,000 electors, and acquired the title &quot;Man of the People&quot;.

== Foreign Secretary: 1782–1783==
=== Fox-North Coalition===
When North finally resigned under the strains of office and the disastrous American War in March 1782, after Earl Cornwallis surrendered at the Battle of Yorktown, and was gingerly replaced with the new ministry of the Marquess of Rockingham, Fox was appointed Foreign Secretary. But Rockingham, after finally acknowledging the independence of the former Thirteen Colonies, died unexpectedly on 1 July. Fox refused to serve in the successor administration of the Earl of Shelburne, splitting the Whig party; Fox&#x27;s father had been convinced that Shelburne – a supporter of the elder Pitt – had thwarted his ministerial ambitions at the time of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Fox now found himself in common opposition to Shelburne with his old and bitter enemy, Lord North. Based on this single conjunction of interests and the fading memory of the happy co-operation of the early 1770s, the two men who had vilified one another throughout the American war together formed a coalition and forced their Government, with an overwhelming majority composed of North&#x27;s Tories and Fox&#x27;s opposition Whigs, on to the King.

The Fox-North Coalition came to power on 2 April 1783, in spite of the King&#x27;s resistance. It was the first time that George had been allowed no role in determining who should hold government office. On one occasion, Fox, who returned enthusiastically to the post of Foreign Secretary, ended an epistle to the King: &quot;Whenever Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to condescend even to hint your inclinations upon any subject, that it will be the study of Your Majesty&#x27;s Ministers to show how truly sensible they are of Your Majesty&#x27;s goodness.&quot; The King replied: &quot;No answer.&quot; George III seriously thought of abdicating at this time, after the comprehensive defeat of his American policy and the imposition of Fox and North, but refrained from doing so, mainly because of the thought of his succession by his son George, Prince of Wales, the notoriously extravagant womaniser, gambler and associate of Fox. Indeed, in many ways the King considered Fox his son&#x27;s tutor in debauchery. &quot;George III let it be widely broadcast that he held Fox principally responsible for the Prince&#x27;s many failings, not least a tendency to vomit in public.&quot;

===Constitutional crisis===

Happily for George, the unpopular coalition would not outlast the year. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, formally ending the American Revolutionary War. Fox proposed an East India Bill to place the government of the ailing and oppressive British East India Company, at that time in control of a considerable expanse of India, on a sounder footing with a board of governors responsible to Parliament and more resistant to Crown patronage. It passed the Commons by 153 to 80, but, when the King made it clear that any peer who voted in favour of the bill would be considered a personal enemy of the Crown, the Lords divided against Fox by 95 to 76. George III now felt justified in dismissing Fox and North from government and in nominating Pitt the Younger in their place, the King appointed the youngest British prime minister to date at twenty-four years of age. Fox used his parliamentary majority to oppose Pitt&#x27;s nomination, and every subsequent measure that he put before the House, until March 1784, when the King dissolved Parliament and, in the following 1784 British general election, Pitt was returned with a substantial majority.

In Fox&#x27;s own constituency of Westminster, the contest was particularly fierce. An energetic campaign in his favour was run by Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, allegedly a lover of Fox&#x27;s who was said to have won at least one vote for him by kissing a shoemaker with a rather romantic idea of what constituted a bribe. In the end, Fox was re-elected by a very slender margin, but legal challenges encouraged, to an extent, by Pitt and the King prevented a final declaration of the result for over a year. In the meantime, Fox sat for the Scottish pocket borough of Tain or Northern Burghs, for which he was qualified by being made an unlikely burgess of Kirkwall in Orkney. The experience of these years was crucial in Fox&#x27;s political formation. His suspicions had been confirmed. It seemed to him that George III had personally scuppered both the Rockingham-Shelburne and Fox-North governments, interfered in the legislative process and now dissolved Parliament when its composition inconvenienced him. Pitt, a man of little property and no party, seemed to Fox a blatant tool of the Crown.

However, the King and Pitt had great popular support, and many in the press and general population saw Fox as the trouble-maker challenging the composition of the constitution and the King&#x27;s remaining powers. He was often caricatured as Oliver Cromwell and Guy Fawkes during this period, as well as Satan.

== Opposition: 1783–1797==
One of Pitt&#x27;s first major actions as prime minister was, in 1785, to put a scheme of parliamentary reform before the Commons, proposing to rationalise somewhat the existing, decidedly unrepresentative, electoral system by eliminating thirty-six rotten boroughs and redistributing seats to represent London and the larger counties. Fox supported Pitt&#x27;s reforms, despite apparent political expediency, but they were defeated by 248 to 174. Reform would not be considered seriously by Parliament for another decade.

In 1787, the most dramatic political event of the decade came to pass in the form of the Impeachment of Warren Hastings, the Governor of Bengal until 1785, on charges of corruption and extortion. Fifteen of the eighteen Managers appointed to the trial were Foxites, one of them being Fox himself. Although the matter was really Burke&#x27;s area of expertise, Fox was, at first, enthusiastic. If the trial could demonstrate the misrule of British India by Hastings and the East India Company more widely, then Fox&#x27;s India Bill of 1784 – the point on which the Fox-North Coalition had been dismissed by the King – would be vindicated. The trial was also expedient for Fox in that it placed Pitt in an uncomfortable political position. The premier was forced to equivocate over the Hastings trial, because to oppose Hastings would have been to endanger the support of the King and the East India Company, while to support him openly would have alienated country gentlemen and principled supporters like Wilberforce. As the trial&#x27;s intricacies dragged on (it would be 1795 before Hastings was finally acquitted), Fox&#x27;s interest waned and the burden of managing the trial devolved increasingly on Burke.

===The Regency Crisis===

In late October 1788, George III descended into a bout of mental illness. He had declared that Pitt was &quot;a rascal&quot; and Fox &quot;his friend&quot;. The King was placed under restraint, and a rumour went round that Fox had poisoned him. Thus the opportunity revealed itself for the establishment of a regency under Fox&#x27;s friend and ally, the Prince of Wales, which would take the reins of government out of the hands of the incapacitated George III and allow the replacement of his &quot;minion&quot; Pitt with a Foxite ministry.

Fox, however, was incommunicado in Italy as the crisis broke; he had resolved not to read any newspapers while he was abroad, except the racing reports. Three weeks passed before he returned to Britain on 25 November 1788, and then he was taken seriously ill (partly due to the stress of his rapid journey across Europe). He would not recover entirely until December 1789. He again absented himself to Bath from 27 January to 21 February 1789.

When Fox did make it into Parliament, he seemed to make a serious political error. In the Commons on 10 December, he declared that it was the right of the Prince of Wales to install himself as regent immediately. It is said that Pitt, upon hearing this, slapped his thigh in an uncharacteristic display of emotion and declared that he would &quot;unwhig&quot; Fox for the rest of his life. Fox&#x27;s argument did indeed seem to contradict his lifelong championing of Parliament&#x27;s rights over the Crown. Pitt pointed out that the Prince of Wales had no more right to the throne than any other Briton, though he might well have a better claim to it as the King&#x27;s firstborn son. It was Parliament&#x27;s constitutional right to decide who the monarch could be.

There was more than naked thirst for power in Fox&#x27;s seemingly hypocritical Tory assertion. Fox believed that the King&#x27;s illness was permanent, and therefore that George III was, constitutionally speaking, dead. To challenge the Prince of Wales&#x27;s right to succeed him would be to challenge fundamental contemporary assumptions about property rights and primogeniture. Pitt, on the other hand, considered the King&#x27;s madness temporary (or, at least, hoped that it would be), and thus saw the throne not as vacant but as merely temporarily unoccupied.

While Fox drew up lists for his proposed Cabinet under the new Prince Regent, Pitt spun out the legalistic debates over the constitutionality of and precedents for instituting a regency, as well as the actual process of drawing up a Regency Bill and navigating it through Parliament. He negotiated a number of restrictions on the powers of the Prince of Wales as regent (which would later provide the basis of the Regency Act 1811), but the bill finally passed the Commons on 12 February. As the Lords too prepared to pass it, they learned that the King&#x27;s health was improving and decided to postpone further action. The king soon regained lucidity in time to prevent the establishment of his son&#x27;s regency and the elevation of Fox to the premiership, and, on 23 April, a service of thanksgiving was conducted at St Paul&#x27;s in honour of George III&#x27;s return to health. Fox&#x27;s opportunity had passed.

===French Revolution ===
Fox welcomed the French Revolution of 1789, interpreting it as a late Continental imitation of Britain&#x27;s Glorious Revolution of 1688. In response to the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, he famously declared, &quot;How much the greatest event it is that ever happened in the world! and how much the best!&quot; In April 1791, Fox told the Commons that he &quot;admired the new constitution of France, considered altogether, as the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty, which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity in any time or country.&quot; He was thus somewhat bemused by the reaction of his old Whig friend, Edmund Burke, to the dramatic events across the Channel. In his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;, Burke warned that the revolution was a violent rebellion against tradition and proper authority, motivated by Utopian, abstract ideas disconnected from reality, which would lead to anarchy and eventual dictatorship. Fox read the book and found it &quot;in very bad taste&quot; and &quot;favouring Tory principles&quot;, but avoided pressing the matter for a while to preserve his relationship with Burke. The more radical Whigs, like Sheridan, broke with Burke more readily at this point.

Fox instead turned his attention – despite the politically volatile situation – to repealing the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the liberties of Dissenters and Catholics. On 2 March 1790, Fox gave a long and eloquent speech to a packed House of Commons.

Pitt, in turn, came to the defence of the Acts as adopted
Burke, with fear of the radical upheaval in France foremost in his mind, took Pitt&#x27;s side in the debate, dismissing Nonconformists as &quot;men of factious and dangerous principles&quot;, to which Fox replied that Burke&#x27;s &quot;strange dereliction from his former principles ... filled him with grief and shame&quot;. Fox&#x27;s motion was defeated in the Commons by 294 votes to 105.

Later, Fox successfully supported the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, extending the rights of British Catholics. He explained his stance to his Roman Catholic friend, Charles Butler, declaring:

On the world stage of 1791, war with Great Britain was threatened more with Spain and Russia than revolutionary France. Fox opposed the bellicose stances of Pitt&#x27;s ministry in the Nootka Sound crisis and over the Russian occupation of the Turkish port of Ochakiv on the Black Sea. Fox contributed to the peaceful resolution of these entanglements and gained a new admirer in Catherine the Great, who bought a bust of Fox and placed it between Cicero and Demosthenes in her collection. On 18 April, Fox spoke in the Commons – together with William Wilberforce, Pitt and Burke – in favour of a measure to abolish the slave trade, but – despite their combined rhetorical talents – the vote went against them by a majority of 75.
On 6 May 1791, a tearful confrontation on the floor of the Commons finally shattered the quarter-century friendship of Fox and Burke, as the latter dramatically crossed the floor of the House to sit down next to Pitt, taking the support of a good deal of the more conservative Whigs with him. Officially, and rather irrelevantly, this happened during a debate on the particulars of a bill for the government of Canada. Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.

=== &quot;Pitt&#x27;s Terror&quot; ===
Fox continued to defend the French Revolution, even as its fruits began to collapse into war, repression and the Reign of Terror. Though there were few developments in France after 1792 that Fox could positively favour, Fox maintained that the old monarchical system still proved a greater threat to liberty than the new, degenerating experiment in France. Fox thought of revolutionary France as the lesser of two evils and emphasised the role of traditional despots in perverting the course of the revolution: he argued that Louis XVI and the French aristocracy had brought their fates upon themselves by abusing the constitution of 1791 and that the coalition of European autocrats, which was currently dispatching its armies against France&#x27;s borders, had driven the revolutionary government to desperate and bloody measures by exciting a profound national crisis. Fox was not surprised when Pitt and the King brought Britain into the war as well and would afterwards blame the pair and their prodigal European subsidies for the long-drawn-out continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1795, he wrote to his nephew, Lord Holland:
Rather ironically, while Fox was being denounced by many in Britain as a Jacobin traitor, across the Channel he featured on a 1798 list of the Britons to be transported after a successful French invasion of Britain. According to the document, Fox was a &quot;false patriot; having often insulted the French nation in his speeches, and particularly in 1786.&quot; According to one of his biographers, Fox&#x27;s &quot;loyalties were not national but were offered to people like himself at home or abroad&quot;. In 1805 Francis Horner wrote, &quot;I could name to you gentlemen, with good coats on, and good sense in their own affairs, who believe that Fox...is actually in the pay of France&quot;.

But Fox&#x27;s radical position soon became too extreme for many of his followers, particularly old Whig friends like the Duke of Portland, Earl Fitzwilliam and the Earl of Carlisle. Around July 1794 their fear of France outgrew their resentment towards Pitt for his actions in 1784, and they crossed the floor to the Government benches. Fox could not believe that they &quot;would disgrace&quot; themselves in such a way. After these defections, the Foxites could no longer constitute a credible parliamentary opposition, reduced, as they were, to some fifty MPs.

Fox, however, still insisted on challenging the repressive wartime legislation introduced by Pitt in the 1790s that would become known as &quot;Pitt&#x27;s Terror&quot;. In 1792, Fox had seen through the only piece of substantial legislation in his career, the Libel Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 60), which restored to juries the right to decide what was and was not libellous, in addition to whether a defendant was guilty. E. P. Thompson thought it &quot;Fox&#x27;s greatest service to the common people, passed at the eleventh hour before the tide turned toward repression.&quot; Indeed, the act was passed by Parliament on 21 May, the same day as a royal proclamation against seditious writings was issued, and more libel cases would be brought by the government in the following two years than had been in all the preceding years of the eighteenth century.

Fox spoke in opposition to the King&#x27;s Speech on 13 December 1793, but was defeated in the subsequent division by 290 to 50. He argued against war measures like the stationing of Hessian troops in Britain, the employment of royalist French émigrés in the British army and, most of all, Pitt&#x27;s suspension of habeas corpus in 1794. He told the Commons that:
In 1795, the King&#x27;s carriage was assaulted in the street, providing an excuse for Pitt to introduce the infamous Two Acts: the Seditious Meetings Act 1795, which prohibited unlicensed gatherings of over fifty people, and the Treasonable Practices Act, which greatly widened the legal definition of treason, making any assault on the constitution punishable by seven years&#x27; transportation. Fox spoke ten times in the debate on the acts. He argued that, according to the principles of the proposed legislation, Pitt should have been transported a decade before in 1785, when he had been advocating parliamentary reform. Fox warned the Commons that:

He argued that &quot;the best security for the due maintenance of the constitution was in the strict and incessant vigilance of the people over parliament itself. Meetings of the people, therefore, for the discussion of public objects were not merely legal, but laudable.&quot;

Parliament passed the acts. But Fox enjoyed a swell of extra-parliamentary support during the course of the controversy. A substantial petitioning movement arose in support of him, and on 16 November 1795, he addressed a public meeting of between two- and thirty-thousand people on the subject. However, this came to nothing in the long run. The Foxites were becoming disenchanted with the Commons, overwhelmingly dominated by Pitt, and began to denounce it to one another as unrepresentative.

== Political wilderness: 1797–1806==
=== Later life ===

By May 1797, an overwhelming majority – both in and outside of Parliament – had formed in support of Pitt&#x27;s war against France.

Fox&#x27;s following in Parliament had shrivelled to about 25, compared with around 55 in 1794 and at least 90 during the 1780s. Many of the Foxites purposefully seceded from Parliament in 1797; Fox himself retired for lengthy periods to his wife&#x27;s house in Surrey. The distance from the stress and noise of Westminster was an enormous psychological and spiritual relief to Fox, but still he defended his earlier principles: &quot;It is a great comfort to me to reflect how steadily I have opposed this war, for the miseries it seems likely to produce are without end.&quot;
On 1 May 1798, Fox proposed a toast to &quot;Our Sovereign, the Majesty of the People&quot;. The Duke of Norfolk had made the same toast in January at Fox&#x27;s birthday dinner and had been dismissed as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire as a result. Pitt thought of sending Fox to the Tower of London for the duration of the parliamentary session but instead removed him from the Privy Council. Fox believed that it was &quot;impossible to support the Revolution [of 1688] and the Brunswick Succession upon any other principle&quot; than the sovereignty of the people.

After Pitt&#x27;s resignation in February 1801, Fox had undertaken a partial return to politics. Having opposed the Addington ministry (though he approved of its negotiation of the Treaty of Amiens) as a Pitt-style tool of the King, Fox gravitated towards the Grenvillite faction, which shared his support for Catholic emancipation and composed the only parliamentary alternative to a coalition with the Pittites.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, Fox supported the French Republic against the monarchies that comprised the Second Coalition. Fox thought the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1799 that brought Napoleon to power &quot;a very bad beginning ... the manner of the thing [was] quite odious&quot;, but he was convinced that the French leader sincerely desired peace in order to consolidate his rule and rebuild his shattered country.

By July 1800, Fox had &quot;forgiven&quot; the means by which he had come into power and claimed Napoleon had &quot;surpassed...Alexander &amp; Caesar, not to mention the great advantage he has over them in the Cause he fights in&quot;. In October 1801, a preliminary peace agreement between Britain and France was published and Fox was delighted. In a speech to his constituents on 10 October Fox said, &quot;We have not, I acknowledge, obtained the objects for which the War was undertakenso much the betterI rejoice that we have not. I like the Peace the more on this very account&quot;. Many of his friends were shocked at such open language, but as Fox said in his reply to a remonstrance from Grey: &quot;...the truth is, I am gone something further in hate to the English Government than perhaps you and the rest of my friends are, and certainly further than can with prudence be avowed. The triumph of the French Government over the English does in fact afford me a degree of pleasure which it is very difficult to disguise&quot;.

After the subsequent Treaty of Amiens was signed in March 1802, Fox joined the thousands of English tourists flocking across the Channel to see the sights of the revolution. Fox and his retinue were kept under surveillance by officials from the British embassy during their trip of 20 July to 17 November. In Paris, he presented his wife for the first time in seven years of marriage, creating yet another stir back at court in London, and had three interviews with Napoleon, who – though he tried to flatter his most prominent British sympathiser – had to spend most of the time arguing about the freedom of the press and the perniciousness of a standing army.

Fox&#x27;s stay in France enabled him, through his connections with Talleyrand and Lafayette, to search the French archives for his planned history of the reign of James II, the Glorious Revolution and the reign of William III. Fox left the work unfinished at his death, however, and only covered the first year of James&#x27; reign (1685). It was posthumously published in 1808 as &quot;A History of the Early Part of the Reign of James II&quot;.

Fox confessed in December 1802 that he was &quot;obstinate&quot; in his belief that Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;wish is Peace, nay that he is afraid of war to the last degree&quot;. In March 1803 he believed that Napoleon&#x27;s belligerence towards Piedmont, Malta and Switzerland was regrettable but did not constitute a &quot;casus belli&quot;, writing to the Duchess of Devonshire &quot;if I am to shew a feeling for the wounded honour of the country you or somebody must shew me the wound, for the life of me I cannot find as single instance since the definitive treaty where the Govt. of France has behaved ill to &quot;us&quot;&quot;.

When war broke out again in May 1803, Fox blamed the Prime Minister Henry Addington for not standing up to the King. The British government had not left Napoleon &quot;any alternative but War or the most abject humiliation&quot; and that the war &quot;is entirely the fault of our Ministers and not of Bonaparte&quot;. Upon hearing of the spectacular French victories at Ulm and Austerlitz later in 1805, Fox commented: &quot;These are wonders indeed but they are not &quot;much&quot; more than I expected&quot;. When Pitt (who had taken over from Addington as premier in 1804) tried to persuade Prussia into an anti-French alliance, Prussia refused, to Fox&#x27;s delight.
He was a close friend and colleague of Samuel Whitbread and supported by Fox, Whitbread in 1805, led the campaign to have Viscount Melville removed from office; Melville resigned. However, The House of Lords found Melville not guilty and he was acquitted of all charges.

=== Final year ===
When Pitt died on 23 January 1806, Fox was the last remaining great political figure of the era and could no longer be denied a place in government. When Grenville formed a &quot;Ministry of All the Talents&quot; out of his supporters, the followers of Addington and the Foxites, Fox was once again offered the post of Foreign Secretary, which he accepted in February. Fox was convinced (as he had been since Napoleon&#x27;s accession) that France desired a lasting peace and that he was &quot;sure that two civil sentences from the Ministers would ensure Peace&quot;. Therefore, peace talks were speedily entered into by Fox and his old friend Talleyrand, now French foreign minister. The mood had completely changed by July, however, and Fox was forced to acknowledge that his assessment of Napoleon&#x27;s pacific intentions was wrong. Negotiations over Hanover, Naples, Sicily, and Malta faltered and Talleyrand vetoed Russian participation in the negotiations. King George believed this was a ploy to divide Britain and Russia as French interests would suffer if she had to deal with an Anglo-Russian alliance. Fox was forced to agree that the King&#x27;s belief was &quot;but too well founded&quot;.

In June, Lord Yarmouth was sent on a peace mission to Paris. Fox wrote to him: &quot;I feel my own Glory highly interested in such an event, but to make peace by acceding to worse terms than those first suggested...wd. be as repugnant to my own feelings as it wd. be to the Duty I owe to K. &amp; Country&quot;. Yarmouth confirmed that Russia was negotiating separately with France. Fox was appalled at what he called this &quot;extraordinary step&quot;. When Yarmouth reported successive new French demands, Fox replied that the British government &quot;continues ardently to wish for the Conclusion of Peace&quot;. In August, Lord Lauderdale was sent to join Yarmouth (with full negotiating powers), and he reported back to Fox of &quot;the complete system of Terror which prevails here&quot;. Fox&#x27;s French friends were too frightened to call on him.

 Fox&#x27;s biographer notes that these failed negotiations were &quot;a stunning experience&quot; for Fox, who had always insisted that France desired peace and that the war was the responsibility of King George and his fellow monarchs: &quot;All of this was being proved false...It was a tragic end to Fox&#x27;s career&quot;. To observers such as John Rickman, &quot;Charley Fox eats his former opinions daily and even ostentatiously showing himself the worse man, but the better minister of a corrupt government&quot;, and who further claimed that &quot;He should have died, for his fame, a little sooner; before Pitt&quot;.

Though the administration failed to achieve either Catholic emancipation or peace with France, Fox&#x27;s last great achievement would be the abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Though Fox was to die before abolition was enacted, he oversaw a Foreign Slave Trade Bill in spring 1806 that prohibited British subjects from contributing to the trading of slaves with the colonies of Britain&#x27;s wartime enemies, thus eliminating two-thirds of the slave trade passing through British ports.

On 10 June 1806, Fox offered a resolution for total abolition to Parliament: &quot;this House, conceiving the African slave trade to be contrary to the principles of justice, humanity, and sound policy, will, with all practicable expedition, proceed to take effectual measures for abolishing the said trade...&quot; The House of Commons voted 114 to 15 in favour and the Lords approved the motion on 24 June. Fox said that:
=== Death ===
Fox died – still in office – at Chiswick House, west of London, on 13 September 1806, not eight months after the younger Pitt. An autopsy revealed a hardened liver, thirty-five gallstones and around seven pints of transparent fluid in his abdomen. Fox left £10,000-worth of debts, though this was only a quarter of the £40,000 that the charitable public had to raise to pay off Pitt&#x27;s arrears. Although Fox had wanted to be buried near his home in Chertsey, his funeral took place in Westminster Abbey on 10 October 1806, the anniversary of his initial election for Westminster in 1780. Unlike Pitt&#x27;s, Fox&#x27;s funeral was a private affair, but the multitude that turned out to pay their respects were at least as large as those at his rival&#x27;s service.

== Private life ==

Fox&#x27;s private life (as far as it was private) was notorious, even in an age noted for the licentiousness of its upper classes. Fox was famed for his rakishness and his drinking; vices which were both indulged frequently and immoderately. Fox was also an inveterate gambler, once claiming that winning was the greatest pleasure in the world, and losing the second greatest. Between 1772 and 1774, Fox&#x27;s fathershortly before dyinghad to pay off £120,000 of Charles&#x27; debts; the equivalent of around £ million in . Fox was twice bankrupted between 1781 and 1784, and at one point his creditors confiscated his furniture. Fox&#x27;s finances were often &quot;more the subject of conversation than any other topic.&quot; By the end of his life, Fox had lost about £200,000 gambling.

In appearance, Fox was dark, corpulent and hairy, to the extent that when he was born his father compared him to a monkey. His round face was dominated by his luxuriant eyebrows, with the result that he was known among fellow Whigs as &#x27;the Eyebrow.&#x27; Though he became increasingly dishevelled and fat in middle age, the young Fox had been very fashionable; he had been the leader of the &#x27;Maccaroni&#x27; set of extravagant young followers of continental fashions. Fox liked riding horses and watching and playing cricket, but his impulsive nature and considerable bulk led to his often being run out between wickets.

Fox was frequently ridiculed – most famously by Gillray, for whom he served as a stock Jacobin villain. The King disliked Fox greatly, regarding him as beyond morality and the corrupter of his own eldest son, and the late eighteenth-century movements of Christian evangelism and middle-class &#x27;respectability&#x27; also frowned on his excesses. Fox was apparently not greatly bothered by these criticisms and kept a collection of his caricatures, which he found amusing. His friend, Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, said of him, since &quot;the respect of the world was not easily retrievable, he became so callous to what was said of him, as never to repress a single thought, or even temper a single expression when he was before the public.&quot; Particularly after 1794, Fox rarely consulted the opinions of anyone outside of his own circle of friends and supporters.

Fox was also regarded as a notorious womaniser. In 1784 or 1785, Fox met and fell in love with Elizabeth Armistead, a former courtesan and mistress of the Prince of Wales who had little interest in politics or Parliament. He married her in a private ceremony at Wyton in Huntingdonshire on 28 September 1795, but did not make the fact public until October 1802, and Elizabeth was never really accepted at court. Fox would increasingly spend time away from Parliament at Armistead&#x27;s rural villa, St. Ann&#x27;s Hill, near Chertsey in Surrey, where Armistead&#x27;s influence gradually moderated Fox&#x27;s wilder behaviour and together they would read, garden, explore the countryside and entertain friends. In his last days, the sceptical Fox allowed scriptural readings at his bedside in order to please his religious wife. She survived him by thirty-six years.

Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as an amiable figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, &quot;I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, and the more so from his having no pretensions to it&quot;. Selwyn also said that &quot;Charles, I am persuaded, would have no consideration on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I think that he has no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not&quot;. Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: &quot;The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart&quot;. Edward Gibbon remarked that &quot;Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood.&quot; Central to understanding Fox&#x27;s life was his view that &quot;friendship was the only real happiness in the world.&quot; For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks&#x27;s to Westminster. &quot;Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power.&quot; The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke&#x27;s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt&#x27;s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were &quot;the witty and wicked&quot; satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.

In a letter published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2020, Lord Lexden compared him to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saying that &quot;Johnson is an 18th Century figure in many ways&quot; and that the two leaders may be commended in similar ways.

==Legacy==
In the 19th century, liberals portrayed Fox as their hero, praising his courage, perseverance and eloquence. They celebrated his opposition to war in alliance with European despots against the people of France eager for their freedom, and they praised his fight for liberties at home. The liberals saluted his fights for parliamentary reform, Catholic Emancipation, intellectual freedom, and justice for the Dissenters. They were especially pleased with his fight for the abolition of the slave trade. More recent historians put Fox in the context of the 18th century, and emphasize the brilliance of his battles with Pitt. A statue of Fox stands, alongside other notable Parliamentarians, in St Stephen&#x27;s Hall in the Palace of Westminster.

While not wholly forgotten today Fox is no longer the famous hero he had been, and is less well remembered than Pitt. After 1794, the word &#x27;Whig&#x27; gave way to the word &quot;Foxite&quot; as the self-description of the members of the opposition to Pitt. In many ways, the Pittite-Foxite division of Parliament after the French Revolution established the basis for the ideological Conservative-Liberal divide of the nineteenth century. Fox and Pitt went down in parliamentary history as legendary political and oratorical opponents who would not be equalled until the days of Gladstone and Disraeli more than half a century later. Even Fox&#x27;s great rival was willing to acknowledge the old Whig&#x27;s talents. When, in 1790, the comte de Mirabeau disparaged Fox in Pitt&#x27;s presence, Pitt stopped him, saying, &quot;You have never seen the wizard within the magic circle.&quot;

The Fox Club was established in London in 1790 and held the first of its Fox dinners – annual events celebrating Fox&#x27;s birthday – in 1808; the last recorded dinner took place at Brooks&#x27;s in 1907. As Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey asked a Newcastle-upon-Tyne Fox dinner in 1819: &quot;What subject is there, whether of foreign or domestic interest, or that in the smallest degree affects our Constitution which does not immediately associate itself with the memory of Mr Fox?&quot; Fox&#x27;s name was invoked numerous times in debates by supporters of Catholic Emancipation and the Great Reform Act in the early nineteenth century. John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford kept a bust of Fox in his pantheon of Whig grandees at Woburn Abbey and erected a statue of him in Bloomsbury Square. Sarah Siddons kept a portrait of Fox in her dressing room. In 1811, the Prince of Wales took the oaths of office as regent with a bust of Fox at his side. Whig households would collect locks of Fox&#x27;s hair, books of his conflated speeches and busts in his likeness.

The town of Foxborough, Massachusetts, was named in honour of the staunch supporter of American independence. Fox is remembered in his home town of Chertsey by a bust on a high plinth (&quot;pictured left&quot;), erected in 2006 in a new development by the railway station. Fox is also commemorated in a termly dinner held in his honour at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Hertford College, Oxford, by students of English, history and the romance languages.

A statue of Fox by Edward Hodges Baily was erected in Westminster Hall in 1857.

Fox was the subject of the epigraph in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Pulitzer-prize winning book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;: &quot;He well knows what snares are spread about his path, from personal animosity…and possibly from popular delusion. But he has put to hazard his ease, his security, his interest, his power, even his…popularity. …He is traduced and abused for his supposed motives. He will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory: he will remember…that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph. …He may live long, he may do much. But here is the summit. He never can exceed what he does this day.&quot; — Edmund Burke&#x27;s eulogy of Charles James Fox for his attack upon the tyranny of the East India Company. House of Commons, 1 December 1783

<text>Niketas or Nicetas Choniates (; – 1217), whose actual surname was Akominatos (), was a Byzantine Greek historian and politician. He accompanied his brother Michael Akominatos to Constantinople from their birthplace Chonae (from which came his nickname, &quot;Choniates&quot; meaning &quot;person from Chonae&quot;). Nicetas wrote a history of the Eastern Roman Empire from 1118 to 1207.

==Life==

Nicetas Akominatos was born to wealthy parents around 1150 in Phrygia in the city of Chonae (near the modern Honaz in Turkey). Bishop Nicetas of Chonae baptized and named the infant; later he was called &quot;Choniates&quot; after his birthplace. When he was nine, his father dispatched him with his brother Michael to Constantinople to receive an education. Niketas&#x27; older brother greatly influenced him during the early stages of his life.

He initially secured a post in the civil service, and held important appointments under the Angelos emperors (among them that of Grand Logothete or Chancellor) and was governor of the theme of Philippopolis at a critical period. After the sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, he fled to Nicaea, where he settled at the court of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Lascaris, and devoted himself to literature. He died in 1217.

His theological work, &quot;Thesaurus Orthodoxae Fidei&quot;, although extant in a complete form in manuscripts, has been published only in part. It is one of the chief authorities for the heresies and heretical writers of the 12th century.

==Choniates in fiction==
Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;Baudolino&quot; is set partly at Constantinople during the Crusader conquest. The imaginary hero, Baudolino, saves Niketas during the sacking of Constantinople, and then proceeds to confide his life story to him.

Niketas is a major character in Alan Gordon&#x27;s murder mystery &quot;A Death in the Venetian Quarter&quot; (New York: St. Martin&#x27;s Minotaru, 2002).

<text>Saint Michael Choniates (or Acominatus; ; c. 1140 – 1220) was a Byzantine Greek writer and cleric, born at Chonae (the ancient Colossae). At an early age he studied at Constantinople and was the pupil of Eustathius of Thessalonica. Around 1175 he was appointed archbishop of Athens, a position which he retained until 1204. In 1204, he defended the Acropolis of Athens from attack by Leo Sgouros, holding out until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1205, to whom he surrendered the city. After the establishment of Latin control, he retired to the island of Ceos. Around 1217 he moved again to the monastery of Vodonitsa near Thermopylae, where he died on 4 July.

Though he is known to classical scholars as the last possessor of complete versions of Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Hecale&quot; and &quot;Aitia&quot;, he was a versatile writer, and composed homilies, speeches and poems, which, with his correspondence, throw considerable light upon the condition of Attica and Athens at the time. His memorial to Alexios III Angelos on the abuses of Byzantine administration, the poetical lament over the degeneracy of Athens and the monodies on his brother Nicetas and Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, deserve special mention.

It is believed that his daughter Constantina tutored, in Greek and science, John of Basingstoke, Archdeacon of Leicester known for his fluency in and advocacy of the Greek language. Michael&#x27;s pupil George Bardanes, who had accompanied him during his exile on Ceos, became a distinguished bishop in subsequent years.

<doc id="142131" wikidata="Q496327" url="?curid=142131" title="Hornbostel–Sachs">
<text>Hornbostel–Sachs or Sachs–Hornbostel is a system of musical instrument classification devised by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs, and first published in the in 1914. An English translation was published in the &quot;Galpin Society Journal&quot; in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying musical instruments by ethnomusicologists and organologists (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project.

Hornbostel and Sachs based their ideas on a system devised in the late 19th century by Victor-Charles Mahillon, the curator of musical instruments at Brussels Conservatory. Mahillon divided instruments into four broad categories according to the nature of the sound-producing material: an air column; string; membrane; and body of the instrument. From this basis, Hornbostel and Sachs expanded Mahillon&#x27;s system to make it possible to classify any instrument from any culture.

Formally, the Hornbostel–Sachs is modeled on the Dewey Decimal Classification for libraries. It has five top-level classifications, with several levels below those, adding up to over 300 basic categories in all.

==Idiophones (1)==
Idiophones primarily produce their sounds by means of the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air. In essence, this group includes all percussion instruments apart from drums, and some other instruments. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification, idiophones are first categorized according to the method used to play the instrument. The result is four main categories: struck idiophones (11), plucked idiophones (12), friction idiophones (13) and blown idiophones (14). These groups are subsequently divided through various criteria. In many cases these sub-categories are split in singular specimens and sets of instruments. The class of idiophones includes the xylophone, the marimba, the glockenspiel, and the glass harmonica.

===Struck idiophones (11)===

These idiophones are set in vibration by being struck, for example cymbals or xylophones.

====Directly struck idiophones (111)====
The player executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc. It is definitive that the player can apply clear, exact, individual strokes, and that the instrument itself is equipped for this kind of percussion.
* 111.1 Concussion idiophones or clappers – Two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other.
** 111.11 Concussion or stick clappers (clapstick).
** 111.12 Concussion plaques or plaque clappers (paiban).
** 111.13 Concussion troughs or trough clappers (devil chase).
** 111.14 Concussion vessels or vessel clappers (spoons).
*** 111.141 Castanets – Natural and hollowed-out vessel clappers.
*** 111.142 Cymbals – Vessel clappers with manufactured rim.
* 111.2 Percussion idiophones – The instrument is struck either with a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground).
** 111.21 Percussion sticks.
*** 111.211 Individual percussion sticks.
*** 111.212 Sets of percussion sticks in a range of different pitches combined into one instrument. – All xylophones, as long as their sounding components are not in two different planes.
** 111.22 Percussion plaques.
*** 111.221 Individual percussion plaques.
*** 111.222 Sets of percussion plaques – Examples are the lithophone and also most metallophones.
** 111.23 Percussion tubes.
*** 111.231 Individual percussion tubes.
*** 111.232 Sets of percussion tubes.
** 111.24 Percussion vessels.
*** 111.241 Gongs – The vibration is strongest near the vertex.
**** 111.241.1 Individual gongs.
**** 111.241.2 Sets of gongs.
*** 111.242 Bells – The vibration is weakest near the vertex.
**** 111.242.1 Individual bells.
***** 111.242.11 Resting bells whose opening faces upward (for example the standing bell)
***** 111.242.12 Hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.121 Hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.122 Hanging bells with internal strikers.
**** 111.242.2 Sets of bells or chimes.
***** 111.242.21 Sets of resting bells whose opening faces upward.
***** 111.242.22 Sets of hanging bells suspended from the apex.
****** 111.242.221 Sets of hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.222 Sets of hanging bells with internal strikers.
**111.3 Mixed sets of directly struck idiophones

====Indirectly struck idiophones (112)====
The player themself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.
* 112.1 Shaken Idiophones or rattles – The player makes a shaking motion
** 112.11 Suspension rattles – Perforated idiophones are mounted together, and shaken to strike against each other.
*** 112.111 Strung rattles – Rattling objects are strung in rows on a cord.
*** 112.112 Stick rattles – Rattling objects are strung on a bar or ring.
** 112.12 Frame rattles – Rattling objects are attached to a carrier against which they strike (flexatone).
*** 112.121 Pendant rattles.
*** 112.122 Sliding rattles.
** 112.13 Vessel rattles – Rattling objects enclosed in a vessel strike against each other or against the walls of the vessel, or usually against both.
* 112.2 Scraped Idiophones – The player causes a scraping movement directly or indirectly; a non-sonorous object moves along the notched surface of a sonorous object, to be alternately lifted off the teeth and flicked against them; or an elastic sonorous object moves along the surface of a notched non-sonorous object to cause a series of impacts. This group must not be confused with that of friction idiophones.
** 112.21 Scraped sticks.
*** 112.211 Scraped sticks without resonator.
*** 112.212 Scraped sticks with resonator.
** 112.22 Scraped tubes.
***112.221 Scraped tubes without resonator.
*** 112.222 Scraped tubes with resonator.
** 112.23 Scraped vessels.
***112.231 Scraped vessels without resonator.
*** 112.232 Scraped vessels with resonator.
** 112.24 Scraped wheels – cog rattles or Ratchet
***112.241 Scraped wheels without resonator.
***112.242 Scraped wheels with resonator.
* 112.3 Split idiophones – Instruments in the shape of two springy arms connected at one end and touching at the other: the arms are forced apart by a little stick, to jangle or vibrate on recoil.

===Plucked idiophones (12)===
Plucked idiophones, or lamellaphones, are idiophones set in vibration by being plucked; examples include the jaw harp or mbira. This group is sub-divided in the following two categories:

====In the form of a frame (121)====
The lamellae vibrate within a frame or hoop.
* 121.1 Clack idiophones or Cricri – The lamella is carved in the surface of a fruit shell, which serves as resonator.
* 121.2 Guimbardes and Jaw harps (i. e. &quot;kissed&quot; idiophones) – The lamella is mounted in a rod- or plaque-shaped frame and depends on the player&#x27;s mouth cavity for resonance.
** 121.21 Idioglot guimbardes – The lamella is cut through the frame of the instrument (kubing).
***121.211 Individual idioglot guimbardes.
*** 121.212 Sets of idioglot guimbardes
** 121.22 Heteroglot guimbardes – The lamella is attached to the frame (Western Jew&#x27;s harp, kouxian). Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p. 544), might support the suggestion that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that the supposed class 412.13 should count as these instead.
*** 121.221 Individual heteroglot guimbardes.
*** 121.222 Sets of heteroglot guimbardes
**121.23 Mixed sets of guimbardes

====In the form of a comb (122)====
The lamellae are tied to a board or cut out from a board like the teeth of a comb.
* 122.1 With laced on lamellae.
** 122.11 Without resonator.
** 122.12 With resonator.
* 122.2 With cut-out lamellae – Musical box
**122.21 Without resonator.
** 122.22 With resonator.
*122.3 Mixed sets of combs

====Mixed sets of lamellophones (123)====

===Friction idiophones (13)===

Instruments that are shaken, the membrane being vibrated by objects inside the drum (rattle drums).

===Plucked membranophones (22)===
Instruments with a string attached to the membrane, so that when the string is plucked, the membrane vibrates (plucked drums).&lt;br&gt;
Some commentators believe that instruments in this class ought instead to be regarded as chordophones (see below).

===Friction membranophones (23)===
Instruments in which the membrane vibrates as a result of friction. These are drums which are rubbed, rather than being struck.

====Friction drums with stick (231)====
Instruments in which the membrane is vibrated from a stick that is rubbed or used to rub the membrane
* 231.1 Instruments in which the stick is inserted in a hole in the membrane
** 231.11 Instruments in which the stick can not be moved and is subject to rubbing, causing friction on the membrane
** 231.12 Instruments in which the stick is semi-movable, and can be used to rub the membrane
** 231.13 Instruments in which the stick is freely movable, and is used to rub the membrane
* 231.2 Instruments in which the stick is tied upright to the membrane

====Friction drum with cord (232)====

====Hand friction drums (233)====
Instruments in which the membrane is rubbed by hand

===Singing membranes (kazoos) (24)===

This group includes kazoos, instruments which do not produce sound of their own, but modify other sounds by way of a vibrating membrane.

====Free kazoos (241)====
Instruments in which the membrane is vibrated by an unbroken column of wind, without a chamber

====Tube or vessel-kazoos (242)====
Instruments in which the membrane is placed in a box, tube or other container

===Unclassified membranophones (25)===

==Chordophones (3)==
Chordophones primarily produce their sounds by means of the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points. This group includes all instruments generally called string instruments in the west, as well as many (but not all) keyboard instruments, such as pianos and harpsichords.

===Simple chordophones or zithers (31)===
Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable, though it may result in quite a different sound being produced. They include the piano therefore, as well as other kinds of zithers such as the koto, and musical bows.

====Bar zithers (311)====

The string bearer is bar-shaped.
* 311.1 Musical bows – The string bearer is flexible (and curved)

===Unclassified chordophones (33)===

==Aerophones (4)==
Aerophones primarily produce their sounds by means of vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes.

===Free aerophones (41)===
Instruments in which the vibrating air is not contained within the instrument, for example, acme sirens or the bullroarer.

====Displacement free aerophones (411)====
The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip.

====Interruptive free aerophones (412)====
The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
* 412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds – The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a &#x27;cover,&#x27; i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed&#x27;s vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes though present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p. 544), might support the suggestion that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that such reeds should not really remain as aerophones, exiting for the lamellophones.

*** 412.131 Individual free reeds.
*** 412.132 Sets of free reeds – Accordion, harmonica, and reed pipes of the pipe organ.

Mixed sets of free aerophones (414)

===Non-free aerophones (wind instruments proper) (42)===
The vibrating air is contained within the instrument. This group includes most of the instruments called wind instruments in the west, such as the flute or French horn, as well as many other kinds of instruments such as conch shells.

====Edge-blown aerophones or flutes (421)====
The player makes a ribbon-shaped flow of air with their lips (421.1), or their breath is directed through a duct against an edge (421.2).

====Mixed sets of wind instruments (424)====

===Mixed sets of aerophones (43)===

==Electrophones (5)==

* 51. Instruments having electric action (e.g. pipe organ with electrically controlled solenoid air valves);
* 52. Instruments having electrical amplification, such as the Neo-Bechstein piano of 1931, which had 18 microphones built into it;
* 53. &quot;Radioelectric instruments&quot;: instruments in which sound is produced by electrical means.

The fifth top-level group, the electrophones category, was added by Sachs in 1940, to describe instruments involving electricity. Sachs broke down his 5th category into 3 subcategories: 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments; 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments; 53= instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators, such as theremins or synthesizers, which he called radioelectric instruments. Francis William Galpin provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs–Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;A Textbook of European Musical Instruments&quot;, he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation (&quot;by oscillation&quot;, &quot;electro-magnetic&quot;, and &quot;electro-static&quot;), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method. Sachs himself proposed subcategories 51, 52, and 53, on pages 447–467 of his 1940 book &quot;The History of Musical Instruments&quot;.

Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p. 544), suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus it has been more recently proposed that, for example, the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, etc.

==Application of the system==
Beyond the top three groups are several further levels of classification, so that the xylophone, for example, is in the group labeled 111.212 (periods are usually added after every third digit to make long numbers easier to read). A long classification number does not necessarily indicate the instrument is a complicated one. The valveless bugle, for instance, has the classification number 423.121.22, even though it is generally regarded as a relatively simple instrument. The numbers in the bugle&#x27;s classification indicate the following:
* 4 – an aerophone
* 42 – the vibrating air is enclosed within the instrument
* 423 – the player&#x27;s lips cause the air to vibrate directly (as opposed to an instrument with a reed like a clarinet, or an edge-blown instrument, like a flute)
* 423.1 – the player&#x27;s lips are the only means of changing the instrument&#x27;s pitch (that is, there are no valves as on a trumpet)
* 423.12 – the instrument is tubular, rather than being a conch-type instrument
* 423.121 – the player blows into the end of the tube, as opposed to the side of the tube
* 423.121.2 – the tube is bent or folded, as opposed to straight
* 423.121.22 – the instrument has a mouthpiece

423.121.22 does not uniquely identify the bugle, but rather identifies the bugle as a certain kind of instrument which has much in common with other instruments in the same class. Another instrument classified as 423.121.22 is the bronze lur, an instrument dating back to the Bronze Age.

==Suffixes and composite instruments==
After the number described above, a number of suffixes may be appended. An 8 indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a 9 indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, there are a number of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are plucked with fingers or plectrum, or played with a bow.

There are ways to classify instruments with this system even if they have elements from more than one group. Such instruments may have particularly long classification numbers with colons and hyphens used as well as numbers. Hornbostel and Sachs themselves cite the case of various bagpipes where some of the pipes are single reed (like a clarinet) and others are double reed (like the oboe). A number of similar composite instruments exist.

<text>Camden is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. The population was 5,232 at the 2020 census. The population of the town more than triples during the summer months, due to tourists and summer residents. Camden is a summer colony in the Mid-Coast region of Maine. Similar to Bar Harbor, Nantucket and North Haven, Camden is well known for its summer community of wealthy Northeasterners, mostly from Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia.

==History==

The Penobscot Nation have lived in the area for thousands of years. They called it Megunticook, meaning &quot;great swells of the sea&quot;, a reference to the silhouette of the Camden Hills (more visibly seen on a bright night). 

Although part of the Waldo Patent, Europeans did not attempt to colonize it until after the French and Indian War, around 1771–1772. They were led by James Richards, who built a home at the mouth of the Megunticook River. Others soon followed, squatting on Penobscot land and attempting to farm the broken and often mountainous terrain. An early home in the area was the Conway House, a Cape Cod style home built in 1770. In 1962, it was purchased and renovated into a history museum.

When Castine was held by the British in 1779 after the military loss of the Penobscot expedition, Camden became a rendezvous point and encampment for the Americans, who were commanded by Major George Ulmer. During a raid, the British burned a sawmill. 

On February 17, 1791, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated Megunticook Plantation as Camden, named after Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, a member of the British Parliament and proponent of civil liberties. During the War of 1812, a battery was built atop Mount Battie near the village. It had both a 12- and 18-pounder gun, but no gunner qualified to operate them. Nevertheless, the fort&#x27;s appearance of readiness kept the British at bay.

When peace returned, Camden grew rapidly. The Megunticook River provided excellent water power sites for mills. In addition to sawmills and gristmills, by 1858 the town had carriage factories, sash and blind factories and blacksmith shops. There were six shipyards, launching ten to twelve vessels annually. By 1886, the town also made foundry products, railroad cars, woolens and paper mill feltings, anchors, wedges, plugs and treenails, planking, powder kegs, excelsior, mattresses, powder, tinware, oakum, wool rolls, boots and shoes, leather, flour and meal, corn brooms and barrels. Camden was second only to nearby Rockland in the lucrative manufacture of lime, excavated at quarries and processed in kilns before being shipped to various ports around the United States until 1891, when Rockport was set off as a separate town. As the 19th century came to an end, Camden was very much a shipbuilding town with the H.M. Bean Yard launching the largest four-masted schooner &quot;Charlotte A. Maxwell&quot; and the first six-master ever built-the &quot;George W. Wells&quot;.

In the 1880s, sportsmen and &quot;rusticators,&quot; began to discover the natural beauty of Camden during the summer and autumn, becoming seasonal residents. Sarah Orne Jewett&#x27;s stories of nostalgia for the sea, Camden&#x27;s scenery, fine old homes of sea captains, and the paintings of Fitz Hugh Lane, Frederick Church, and Childe Hassam evoked a romantic vision of Maine and induced many to come to stay at the Bayview House Hotel, Ocean House, and Mrs. Hosmer&#x27;s Boarding House. In 1880, Edwin Dillingham built the first purpose-built summer cottages in Camden on Dillingham Point. Thereafter, the summer colony at Camden quickly grew to include some of the wealthiest, most prominent families in the country. These new summer residents from Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and even Chicago, built large, rambling Shingle Style &quot;cottages&quot; along High Street, Bay View Street and on Beauchamp Point to rival those in Bar Harbor. The summer people arrived on the Boston Boats or on the Maine Central Railroad at Rockland. Local residents, who had formerly gone to sea to earn a living, found jobs as caretakers, gardeners, cooks and carpenters to the rich and powerful.

In November 1892, a fire fed by a strong easterly wind-burned the business district to the ground. Immediately, Camden businessmen drew together to make the investment required to build 12 large brick buildings, including the Camden Opera House and, controversially, the Masonic Temple (now the Lord Camden Inn). The Great Fire, as it became known, did not discourage increasing numbers of affluent summer people from making Camden their summer enclave. Indeed, in 1897 a road was built to the top of Mt. Battie, one of the two mountains rising above the town, and an inn was erected at the summit. In 1898, a group of wealthy summer residents from Philadelphia established the Megunticook Golf Club on Beauchamp Point. And in 1901, the Whitehall Inn opened on High Street in an old mansion built by a sea captain, catering to a well-to-do clientele. Around the turn of the century families such as Curtis, Bok, Keep, Gribbel, Dillingham and Borland not only built estates but their donations resulted in the public library, the amphitheatre, which was designed by Fletcher Steele, the Camden Harbor Park, which was designed by the Olmsted Brothers, the Village Green, and the Camden Opera House.

===Camden Yacht Club===
The Philadelphia publishing tycoon, Cyrus Curtis, maintained a summer home and several yachts in Camden. Given the many other private yachts of the upper class that filled Camden Harbor as well, Curtis decided in 1912 to establish and build the Camden Yacht Club. In 2006, as part of the club&#x27;s centennial celebrations, the Club published &#x27;From steam to sail : 100 years of the Camden Yacht Club&quot; Yachting continues to thrive in Camden, particularly during the summer months, with the HAJ Boat racing fleet at the Yacht Club with the younger sailors in their turnabouts. In 1936 the cruise schooner business was started by Captain Frank Swift and the windjammer fleet continues to this day.

===Music and culture===
Music and cultural interests have long flourished in Camden. In 1912, Edna St. Vincent Millay read &quot;Renascence,&quot; a poem she wrote from the top of Mt. Battie, to the guests at the Whitehall Inn, one of whom offered to pay her tuition to Vassar. After graduating from Vassar, she went on to write poetry and plays that made her one of the most famous women in America and an inspiration for the Roaring Twenties, winning the Pulitzer Prize. 

The French harpist, composer and conductor, Carlos Salzedo, founded the internationally renowned Salzedo Summer Harp Colony in Camden and each summer held a Harp Festival in the amphitheater beside the library. Camden/Rockport also is home to Bay Chamber Concerts. Theatre productions at the Opera House and Shakespeare in the Amphitheatre enriched the lives of residents and summer visitors for generations. 

In the 1950s, artists and writers of significant reputation began moving to Camden and neighboring Rockport, where local artists organized Maine Coast Artists. Wayne Doolittle began publishing Down East Magazine in 1954, and in 1956 &quot;Carousel&quot; was filmed in Camden, followed by &quot;Peyton Place&quot; in 1957, because the quaint, old town with its picturesque harbor and scenery, looked like the picture-perfect American town. Since then Camden&#x27;s setting has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood with Steven King&#x27;s &quot;Thinner&quot; and &quot;Casper&quot; in 1995, Todd Field&#x27;s &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; in 2001, and with the soap opera &quot;Passions&quot; using Camden for shots depicting the fictional town Harmony.

The town is home to a summer Shakespeare festival, the Camden Shakespeare Company, which performs in an amphitheater behind the town library. During the second weekend of February, the annual U.S. National Toboggan Championships are held at the town-owned Camden Snow Bowl. This nationally known race started as a lark for something to do during the long Maine winters, and more than 20 years later is one of New England&#x27;s premier cold-weather events. The iced chute is long, and the four-man teams attain speeds of up to an hour. Most racers arrive in costume, and 100% percent of race revenue is used to offset operating expenses for this recreation area.

Camden is the location of the 2001 HGTV Dream Home.

The Points North Institute, located in Camden and Rockport, Maine, is organizing the annual Camden International Film Festival (&quot;CIFF&quot;) founded in 2005. It focuses exclusively on documentary film and building community among the professional filmmakers. The &quot;Points North Forum&quot; was launched in 2009 to provide debates about documentary developments on a par with peers. Over the following years more than 50 funders, broadcasters, distributors and producers have been participating annually. Further on, in 2015 as a partnership with Tribeca Film Institute the Camden/TFI Retreat was started, a week-long educational program. Additionally was introduced: the Shortform Editing Residency, the North Star Fellowship, Points North 1:1 Meetings, and the 4th World Indigenous Media Lab.

==In popular culture==
*The 2001 Best Picture Academy Award nominated film &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; had scenes that were shot in Camden. Specifically, the historic welcome arch, the bar where Tom Wilkinson&#x27;s character goes looking for his son&#x27;s friend, the Camden Harbor Park and Amphitheatre where Sissy Spacek&#x27;s character directs the Balkan Girl&#x27;s Chorus in an outdoor concert, the exterior of the bar where her son&#x27;s killer is working, and the shots of the town at dawn from the summit of Mount Battie for the film&#x27;s finale
* The majority of the 1995 film &quot;Casper&quot; was filmed in Camden, though the story takes place in Friendship. The production crew chose Camden, citing it to be &quot;more authentic&quot;. In the film, Friendship is home to a fictional Art Nouveau mansion called Whipstaff Manor, which is haunted by four ghosts. However Whipstaff Manor is not a real mansion located on the sea front of Camden. The lower exterior and interior of the mansion was built on a set.
* Other movies shot in Camden include &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937), &quot;Carousel&quot; (1957) and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957) and &quot;Head Above Water&quot; (1996).

<doc id="142142" wikidata="Q14775294" url="?curid=142142" title="Motion picture content rating system">
<text>A motion picture content rating system classifies films based on their suitability for audiences due to their treatment of issues such as sex, violence, or substance abuse, their use of profanity, or other matters typically deemed unsuitable for children or adolescents. Most countries have some form of rating system that issues determinations variously known as &quot;certifications&quot;, &quot;classifications&quot;, &quot;certificates&quot;, or &quot;ratings&quot;. Age recommendations, of either an advisory or restrictive capacity, are often applied in lieu of censorship; in some jurisdictions movie theaters may have a legal obligation to enforce restrictive ratings.

In some countries such as Australia, Canada, and Singapore, an official government body decides on ratings; in other countries such as Denmark, Japan, and the United States, it is done by industry committees with little if any official government status. In most countries, however, films that are considered morally offensive have been censored, restricted, or banned. Even if the film rating system has no legal consequences, and a film has not explicitly been restricted or banned, there are usually laws forbidding certain films, or forbidding minors to view them. The influence of specific factors in deciding a rating varies from country to country.

Other factors may or may not influence the classification process, such as being set within a non-fictional historical context, whether the film glorifies violence or drug use, whether said violence or drug use is carried out by the protagonist, with whom the viewer should empathize, or by the antagonist. In Germany, for example, films depicting explicit war violence in a real war context (such as the Second World War) are handled more leniently than films with purely fictional settings.

A film may be produced with a particular rating in mind. It may be re-edited if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid a higher rating than intended. A film may also be re-edited to produce a different version for other countries.

==Comparison table==
A comparison of current film rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific &quot;criteria&quot; used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country to another. Therefore, the color codes and age ranges are not directly comparable from one country to another.

Key:

*  White  – &quot;No restrictions: Suitable for all ages / Aimed at young audiences / Exempt / Not rated / No applicable rating&quot;.
*  Yellow  – &quot;Advisory: Parental guidance is suggested for designated age range&quot;.
*  Purple  – &quot;Strong advisory: Not recommended for a younger audience but not restricted&quot;.
*  Red  – &quot;Restricted: Parental accompaniment required for younger audiences&quot;.
*  Black  – &quot;Prohibitive: Exclusively for older audience / Restricted to licensed premises / Purchase age-restricted / Banned&quot;.


==Argentina==

Through its Advisory Commission of Cinematographic Exhibition (&quot;Comisión Asesora de Exhibición Cinematográfica&quot;) the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts (INCAA) issues ratings for films based on the following categories:

*ATP: For all public.
*+13: Suitable for 13-year-olds and over. Children under the age of 13 are admitted if accompanied by an adult.
*+16: Suitable for 16-year-olds and over.
*+18: Suitable for 18-year-olds and over.
*C: Suitable for 18-year-olds and over. Restricted to specially licensed venues.

== Australia ==
The Classification Board and Classification Review Board are government-funded organisations which classify all films that are released for public exhibition.
* Advisory categories
** Check the Classification (CTC) - &quot;Message for unclassified films and computer games&quot; The film or computer game has been assessed and approved for advertising. You should check the classification closer to the release date. Advertising relating to unclassified films and games must display the CTC message - this includes posters, trailers, internet posts, and any other type of advertising. Once the content is classified, the classification marking should replace the CTC marking on all advertising material.
** General (G) – &quot;General&quot;. The content is very mild in impact. The G classification is suitable for everyone.
** Parental Guidance (PG) – &quot;Parental guidance recommended&quot;. The content is mild in impact. It is not recommended for viewing or playing by persons under 15 without guidance from parents or guardians.
** Mature (M) – &quot;Recommended for mature audiences&quot;. The content is moderate in impact. Children under 15 may legally access this material because it is an advisory category. However, M classified films and computer games may include classifiable elements such as violence and nudity of moderate impact that are not recommended for children under 15 years. 
* Restricted categories
** Mature Accompanied (MA 15+) – &quot;Not suitable for people under 15. Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian&quot;. The content is strong in impact.
** Restricted (R 18+) – &quot;Restricted to 18 years and over&quot;. The content is high in impact. Despite this category being legally restricted, in Queensland the restriction is not applicable to persons under 2.
* Adult film categories
** Restricted (X 18+) – &quot;Restricted to 18 years and over&quot;. This classification is a special and legally restricted category which contains only sexually explicit content. That is, material which shows actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity between consenting adults. X 18+ films are only available for sale or hire in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
** Refused Classification (RC) – &quot;Refused Classification&quot;. Banned from sale or hire in the country and cannot be legally imported. Films are rated RC if their content is very high in impact and exceeds the guidelines.

Films intended to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification provided they do not contain material that would result in an &quot;M&quot; rating or higher if submitted for classification.

==Austria==

Motion pictures are rated by the Austrian Board of Media Classification (ABMC) for the Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur). The recommendations made by the ABMC are generally not legally binding and there are nine sets of state laws on the cinema sector with different age provisions. The only exception is in the case of &quot;16&quot; rated films, since under Austrian law there is a legal age restriction on certain types of content i.e. discrimination, sexual abuse, glorification of violence etc. In addition to the ABMC&#x27;s age recommendations, in the state of Vienna children under the age of 6 are only permitted to attend public film performances if they are accompanied.

The AMBC issues age recommendation from the following categories:

*Unrestricted – Released for all age groups.
*6+ – Released for children from age 6.
*8+ - Released from children from age 8.
*10+ – Released for children from age 10.
*12+ – Released for children from age 12.
*14+ – Released from age 14.
*16+ – Released from age 16. Restricted classification.

==Bahamas==
The Bahamas Plays and Films Control Board classifies films in the Bahamas. Upon completion of the examination the Board will classify the film in accordance with the following ratings:

* A - Suitable for all ages.
* B - Suitable for adults; persons under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult.
* T - Suitable for persons 15 and over, persons under 15 years are not admitted whether accompanied by an adult or not.
* C - Suitable for adults only, persons under 18 years are not admitted whether accompanied by an adult or not.
* D - Unsuitable for public viewing.

==Barbados==
In Barbados, films are classified by the Film Censorship Board (FCB):

* GA – General Audience; Suitable for all ages.
* PG – Parental Guidance.
* PG13 – Parental Guidance 13; suitable for 13 years and older.
* R – Suitable for 18 years and older.
* A – Adult Only; No-one under 18 admitted.

==Belgium==

On 8 January 2020, Belgium adopted the Dutch Kijkwijzer classification system. Belgium had previously used a basic two-tier system, in place since 1 September 1920. Until January 2020, classifications for films publicly exhibited in Belgium were issued by the Inter-Community Commission for Film Rating (; ). Films were prohibited to minors under the age of 16 unless passed by the commission. There is no mandatory rating system for video formats but 90% of video distribution abides by the voluntary Belgium Video Federation. It was basically the same as the system for theatrical exhibition, but also provided a &quot;12&quot; rating. Under Kijkwijzer, the distributor fills out a questionnaire about the content of the film and an age category is automatically assigned. The new system is fully advisory, and carries no mandatory restrictions. In the French and German-speaking communities, the system is known as &quot;Cinecheck&quot;.
The age categories are as follows:

* AL/TOUS: All ages.
* 6: From 6 years.
* 9: From 9 years.
* 12: From 12 years.
* 14: From 14 years.
* 16: From 16 years.
* 18: From 18 years.

==Brazil==
All films that are exhibited in public or released on a home video format in Brazil must be submitted for classification to the advisory rating (&quot;Classificação Indicativa&quot;, abbreviated ClassInd), which is run by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice (&quot;Ministério da Justiça&quot;). Under 10s must always be accompanied by an adult guardian, even for films rated L. Anyone below the film&#x27;s minimum age can watch it if accompanied or allowed by the parent or guardian who is at least 18 years old, except for those rated 18, which can only be allowed for teenagers aged 16+. Unlike many countries, the ClassInd does not have any legal right to ban, demand cuts or refuse to rate any film.

The ClassInd uses the following system:
* ER: Especialmente recomendado para crianças (Especially recommended for children)
* L: Livre (General)
* 10: Não recomendado para menores de 10 anos (Not recommended for minors under 10)
* 12: Não recomendado para menores de 12 anos (Not recommended for minors under 12)
* 14: Não recomendado para menores de 14 anos (Not recommended for minors under 14)
* 16: Não recomendado para menores de 16 anos (Not recommended for minors under 16)
* 18: Não recomendado para menores de 18 anos (Not recommended for minors under 18)

There are also operational descriptions of attenuating and aggravating elements that can interfere on the final rating.

==Bulgaria==

The Bulgarian film rating system is defined in the Film Industry Act of 2003 and administered by the National Film Rating Committee. Since then, two more restrictive ratings (C+ and D+) have been added to the system:

* A – Recommended for children.
* B – No age restrictions. 
* C – Not recommended for children under 12. No persons under 12 shall be admitted unless accompanied by an adult.
* C+ – Not recommended for children under 14. No persons under 14 shall be admitted unless accompanied by an adult.
* D+ – Not recommended for children under 16. No persons under 16 shall be admitted unless accompanied by an adult.
* D – Prohibited for persons under 16.
* X – Prohibited for persons under 18, for licensed venues only.

==Cambodia==

In Cambodia, the Department of Movies and Promotion of Culture at the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts (MCFA) classifies films for exhibition in cinemas and on home media under the following age categories:

* G – General audience.
* NC15 – Permitted for persons aged 15 and over.
* R18 – Permitted for persons aged 18 and over (only permitted to be shown in cinemas)

==Canada==
Film ratings in Canada are a provincial responsibility, and each province has its own legislation, rules and regulations regarding rating, exhibition and admission. Ratings are required for theatrical exhibition, but not all provinces require classification for home video. In the past there was a wide range of rating categories and practices in the various provinces; however, the seven rating systems—with the exception of Quebec—now all use categories and logos derived from the Canadian Home Video Rating System (CHVRS).

===Classifications used outside Quebec===
The categories are mostly identical to the CHVRS with a few minor variations. In the provinces that require classification of video formats, supply of 14A and 18A films is restricted to customers above those ages. In the case of theatre exhibition, children are admitted to 14A if accompanied by an adult. In British Columbia, Saskatchewan (administered by the British Columbia Film Classification Office), Alberta and Ontario children are also admitted to 18A films if accompanied. However, children under the age of 14 are prohibited to view 18A films in the Manitoba and Maritime provinces even if accompanied by an adult. The Maritimes and British Columbia (along with Saskatchewan) also provide an &quot;A&quot; classification for adult content. Some provinces, such as Nova Scotia, reserve the right to prohibit films altogether.

In general, the categories are:
* G – Suitable for viewing by all ages.
* PG – Parental guidance advised.
**Not Recommended For Young Children – The film may be inappropriate for young children. “Young Children” would be persons age 8 and under.
*14A – Suitable for people 14 years of age or older. Those under 14 should view with an adult. No rental or purchase by those under 14. Parents cautioned. (Formerly &quot;Adult Accompaniment (14)&quot; in the Maritimes)
**Not Recommended For Children – “Children” would be persons age 13 and under. Films with this advisory may include scenes that reflect a more mature situation, such as drug use or abuse.
* 18A – Suitable for people 18 years of age or older. Those under 18 should view with an adult. Additionally, in certain provinces there is a mandatory age restriction of 14 years. No rental or purchase by those under 18. Parents strongly cautioned.
* R – Restricted to 18 years and over. No rental or purchase by those under 18. Content not suitable for minors.
* A – Adult. Film is not suitable for viewers under 18 years of age. (Formerly &quot;Explicit Material (XXX)&quot; in the Maritimes)
* E – Exempt.

===Classifications used in Quebec===
In Quebec, the provincial Ministry of Culture and Communications (and until 2017 the &quot;Régie du cinéma&quot;) rates all films and videos; its purview devolves from the &quot;Cinema Act&quot; (chapter C-18.1). In some cases the Ministry may refuse to provide a classification, effectively banning the film. Educational and sports films are exempt from classification.

* G: Visa général (General Rating) – May be viewed, rented or purchased by persons of all ages. If a film carrying a &quot;G&quot; rating might offend the sensibilities of a child under 8 years of age, &quot;Not suitable for young children&quot; is appended to the classification.
* 13+: 13 ans et plus (13 years and over) – May be viewed, rented or purchased only by persons 13 years of age or over. Children under 13 may be admitted only if accompanied by an adult.
* 16+: 16 ans et plus (16 years and over) – May be viewed, rented or purchased only by persons 16 years of age or over.
* 18+: 18 ans et plus (18 years and over) – May be viewed, rented or purchased only by persons 18 years of age or over. If a film contains real and explicit sexual activity &quot;Explicit sexuality&quot; is appended to the classification, and in the retail video industry storeowners are required to place the film in a room reserved for adults.

==Chile==

Films are classified by the Council of Cinematographic Classification (&quot;Consejo de Calificación Cinematográfica&quot;) which is a central agency under the Ministry of Education. In 2002 legislation was enacted which reversed the ban on all 1,090 films that had previously been banned in Chile.

The current age ratings (enacted in 2002) are:

*Todo Espectador – All spectators.
**Inconveniente para menores de 7 años – Not recommended for children younger than 7 years of age. (Only applied on TE)
*Mayores de 14 años – 14 years old and over.
*Mayores de 18 años – 18 years old and over.
**Contenido pornográfico – Pornographic content.
**Contenido excesivamente violento – Excessively violent content.
*Contenido educativo – Educational content.

Minors are allowed to watch cinematographic productions rated in an immediately higher category than their age if accompanied by any of their parents, guardians, or their teachers within the framework of their educational activities. This rule does not apply to films with pornographic or excessively violent content. Furthermore, films with pornographic content may only be exhibited at venues licensed for that purpose.

==Colombia==

In 2005, the Ministry of Culture issued its new rating system. The classifications are:

* T: For general audiences.
* 7: Advisory.
* 12: Advisory.
* 15: Restricted.
* 18: Restricted.
* X: Pornographic content.
* Prohibited: Contains elements that incite or advocate crime.

==Cook Islands==

In the Cook Islands, publications such as films, TV shows and video games are classified by the Cook Islands Censorship Office in accordance with the Film and Censorship Act 1985. The following four classifications are used:
* G (general)
* PG (parental guidance) 
* MA (mature audiences)
* R18 (restricted to adults)

The Censorship Office does not define the age for a &quot;mature audience&quot;, but its television code—which uses the same ratings—defines a child as &quot;under 15 years&quot;.

==Costa Rica==

In Costa Rica, films are classified by the Ministry of Justice and Peace: 
* TP (Todo Público): All public
* TP7 (Todo público, advertencia personas menores de 7 años acompañadas de una persona adulta): All public (parental guidance is recommended for children under 7)
* TP12 (Todo público, personas con edad inferior a 12 años, acompañadas de una persona adulta): All public (children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult)
* M12 (Mayores de 12 años): Over 12 years old
* M15 (Mayores de 15 años): Over 15 years old
* M18 (Mayores de 18 años): Over 18 years old
* Material Cinematográfico recomendado (Recommended cinematographic material): Films and documentaries that, due to their content and various themes they present, are recommended for their cultural value.

==Denmark==

In Denmark, the Media Council for Children and Young People currently rates films. Films do not have to be submitted for a rating and in such instances must be labelled a &quot;15&quot; (restricted to people aged 15 and above). Children aged 7 and above may attend any performance—including those restricted to older audiences—if they are accompanied by an adult.

* A – Suitable for a general audience.
* 7 – Not recommended for children under 7.
* 11 – For ages 11 and up.
* 15 – For ages 15 and up.
* F – Exempt from classification.

==Estonia==

Film classification in Estonia is regulated by the Child Welfare Act.

* PERE – Family Film.
* L – Allowed to all.
* MS-6 – Not recommended for under 6.
* MS-12 – Not recommended for under 12.
* K-12 – Prohibited for under 12 unless accompanied by an adult.
* K-14 – Prohibited for under 14 unless accompanied by an adult.
* K-16 – Prohibited for under 16 unless accompanied by an adult.

==Fiji==

In Fiji, films are classified by the Fijian Censors Board:
* G - approved for general exhibition
* Y - approved for exhibition to viewers of the age of 13 and over
* A - approved for exhibition to adults only (18 and over)
* R - approved for restricted public exhibition subject to conditions imposed by the censor

==Finland==

Films in Finland are classified by the National Audiovisual Institute.

The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK) has a film ratings system under which films are classified. All the ratings contain the phrase &quot;gemäß §14 JuSchG&quot; (in accordance with §14 of the Youth Protection Law), signifying that they are legally binding for minors. Cinemas may legally exhibit films without a classification but minors are prohibited from such screenings.

Films with this rating may be sold without any age restriction provided they do not contain any material &quot;evidently harmful to the development of children and youths&quot;.

The FSK rating also limits the time of the day in which the movie may be aired on free-to-air TV stations to a time frame between 22:00 (FSK 16) or 23:00 (FSK 18) and 6:00. Stations are permitted to broadcast films not approved for audiences under 12 at their own discretion.

==Italy==
In Italy the rating system of the films is currently disciplined by the Decreto legislativo n° 203 of 7 December 2017. For commercial release, distributors are requested to classify their films based on the age of the audience. Their decision is verified by a commission of the Ministry of Culture, composed of members of the film industry and experts in education and animal rights. Since 2021, the commission is no longer allowed to ban a film or demand edits. Films are classified into one of the following categories:

*T (&quot;): no age restriction.
*6+ (&quot;): not suitable for children under 6.
*10+ (&quot;): not suitable for children under 10.
*14+ (&quot;): released to ages 14 and older; children who are at least 12 may be admitted with adult accompaniment.
*18+ (&quot;&quot;): released to ages 18 and older; children who are at least 16 may be admitted with adult accompaniment.

The classification only applies to commercial releases in theaters, and the law does not require classification of home media. Before 2021, films aimed to be shown in theatres were classified for all ages (T) or prohibited for children under 14 or 18 by the Commission for Film Review. The Commission could also ask for some scenes to be cut or ban the distribution of the film. The &quot;6+&quot; classification was introduced in 2021, while the &quot;10+&quot; classification was adopted in 2025.

==Malaysia==
Historically, film censorship in Malaysia was carried out by police under the Theatre Ordinance 1908. In 1954 the Film Censorship Board (LPF) was created to censor films distributed across Malaysia in accordance with the Cinematograph Films Act 1952, and later the Film Censorship Act 2002. Malaysia&#x27;s motion picture rating system was introduced in 1953, initially classifying films either for General Audiences (&quot;Tontonan Umum&quot;) or For Adults Only (&quot;Untuk Orang Dewasa Sahaja&quot;), and in 1996 these classifications were changed to &quot;U&quot; and four different &quot;18&quot; categories (which were amalgamated back into a single classification in 2010). In 2008, the &quot;PG13&quot; classification was introduced, which admitted children under the age of 13 if accompanied by an adult (&quot;PG13&quot; underwent a cosmetic change to &quot;P13&quot; in 2012). In February 2023, the &quot;P13&quot; classification was split in two—a &quot;P12&quot; classification (effectively the same as &quot;P13&quot; but with a slightly lower age threshold) and a prohibitive &quot;13&quot; classification, which bars admission to children under the age of 13. A prohibitive &quot;16&quot; classification was also introduced, barring audiences under the age of 16.

Upon viewing the board will assign one of three categories to the film:

* &quot;Lulus Bersih&quot; (Passed Clean [i.e. without cuts])
* &quot;Lulus Dengan Pengubahan&quot; (Passed with Edits/Cuts)
* &quot;Tidak Diluluskan Untuk Tayangan&quot; (Not Approved for Screening)

Should a film be approved, the Board then assigns the film a classification. As of 2023 the ratings are:

*U (&quot;Umum&quot;) - Suitable for all ages.
*P12 (&quot;Penjaga&quot;) – Parental guidance required for audiences under the age of 12.
*13 – For audiences aged 13 years old and above.

*18 – For audiences aged 18 years old and above.

==Netherlands==

In the Netherlands, the Kijkwijzer system is used, which is executed by the Netherlands Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media (NICAM). Kijkwijzer is an advisory system for parents, but Dutch law also has a legal provision for public spaces, including cinemas. Children under the specified age limits are only admitted to films carrying an age limit of 6, 9, 12, or 14 if accompanied by an adult. In the case of &quot;16&quot; and &quot;18&quot; rated films, admission is legally prohibited for children under 16 years of age in both categories (a person aged 16 or 17 may rent, see or be admitted to &quot;18&quot; rated films) per section 240a of the Dutch Criminal Code.
* AL: All ages.
* 6: Potentially harmful to children under 6 years.
* 9: Potentially harmful to children under 9 years.

* Sexual Content (Seks)
* Discrimination (Discriminatie)
* Drug and/or Alcohol abuse (Drugs- en/of alcoholmisbruik)
* Bad Language (Grof taalgebruik)
* Dangerous Challenges and Stunts (Gevaarlijk gedrag)

Mostly, these icons are used along with other symbols, displaying if a film contains violence, sexual content, frightening scenes, drug or alcohol abuse, discrimination, coarse language or dangerous challenges and stunts. These symbols are also used in television channels broadcasting under license issued in the Netherlands (independent from country for which the channel are dedicated).

==New Zealand==
The &quot;Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993&quot; gives the Office of Film and Literature Classification the power to classify publications into three categories: unrestricted, restricted, or &quot;objectionable&quot; (banned). With a few exceptions, films, videos, DVDs and restricted computer games must carry a label before being offered for supply or exhibited to the public.

In 2017 the Office of Film and Literature Classification created a special RP18 rating for online content in response to the Netflix television series, &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;.

* G: Anyone can be shown or sold this.
* PG: Films and games with a PG label can be sold, hired, or shown to anyone. The PG label means guidance from a parent or guardian is recommended for younger viewers.

* RP13: Restricted to persons 13 years and over unless accompanied by a Parent/Guardian.

==Saudi Arabia==

Film classification in Saudi Arabia is administered by the General Authority of Media Regulation (Gmedia; formerly known as the General Commission for Audiovisual Media or GCAM), after the reintroduction of film theatres in the country, as of 2017. GCAM (now Gmedia) officially approved a system in 2018, and revised it in 2022 to incorporate a &quot;PG15&quot; rating, which has later officially replaced the &quot;R12&quot; rating. The classifications are: 

*G: General – For the general public.
*PG: Parental Guidance – Adult supervision recommended for children under the age of 12.
*PG12: Parental Guidance 12 – Adult supervision required for children under the age of 12.
*PG15: Parental Guidance 15 – Adult supervision required for children under the age of 15.
*R15: Audiences under the age of 15 are prohibited.
*R18: Audiences under the age of 18 are prohibited.

==Singapore==

Film classification in Singapore was introduced on 1 July 1991 and comes under the jurisdiction of the Board of Film Censors (BFC), currently part of the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). There were three ratings originally: G (General), PG (Parental Guidance) and R (Restricted to 18 years and above). Prior to then films were either approved or effectively banned. Since then, there have been several alterations to the ratings over the years. In September 1991, a Restricted (Artistic) (R(A)) rating was introduced to replace the previous R-rating so as to allow the screening of certain art-house films which would otherwise have been banned without said rating, with an increased age restriction set at 21 years of age. The R(A) rating has since been replaced by NC16 (No Children under 16), M18 (Mature 18) and R21 (Restricted 21). A PG13 (Parental Guidance 13) rating, introduced in 2011, is the latest rating to be introduced. The G, PG and PG13 ratings are advisory while NC16, M18 and R21 carry age restrictions. Video ratings are mostly the same as the cinema ratings, except only go up to M18. Some titles, such as documentaries, children&#x27;s programmes and sports programmes may be exempt from classification on video, but all titles must be classified for public theatrical exhibition. 
The categories are:
*G: General – Suitable for all ages.
*PG: Parental Guidance – Suitable for all but parents should guide their young.
*PG13: Parental Guidance 13 – Suitable for persons aged 13 and above but parental guidance is advised for children below 13.
*NC16: No Children Under 16 – Suitable for persons aged 16 and above.
*M18: Mature 18 – Suitable for persons aged 18 and above.
*R21: Restricted 21 – Suitable for adults aged 21 and above (restricted to licensed cinemas).
In exceptional cases, a film may be refused classification if it either exceeds the permissible limits of the R21 classification, contains any material that undermines or is likely to undermine public order, or is likely to be prejudicial to national interest.

==South Korea==


The Korea Media Rating Board (영상물등급위원회) in Busan administers South Korea&#x27;s film classification system. There are four general purpose ratings, comprising an &quot;All&quot; category for films that are suitable for all ages, and three age-restrictive categories: 12, 15 and 19. Children below the ages of 12 and 15 are admitted to 12- and 15-rated films respectively, if accompanied by an adult. The 19-rating replaced the 18-rating on May 1st 2024; this change was retrospective, meaning that all films which were previously rated 18 had their former ratings withdrawn and uprated to 19. As with the previous classification minors are prohibited. A &quot;restrictive&quot; rating also exists which confines exhibition to specially licensed venues. The KMBR divides licensed films into the following categories:

* ALL (전체관람가) – Film suitable for all ages.
* 12 (12세이상관람가) – Film intended for audiences 12 and over. Underage audiences accompanied by a parent or guardian are allowed.
* 15 (15세이상관람가) – Film intended for audiences 15 and over. Underage audiences accompanied by a parent or guardian are allowed.
* 19 (청소년관람불가) – No one under 19 is allowed to watch this film.
* Restricted Screening (제한상영가) – Film needs a certain restriction in screening or advertisement as it is considered a highly bad influence to universal human dignity, social value, good customs or national emotion due to excessive expression of nudity, violence, social behavior, etc. (technically not an age restriction but films with this rating may only be screened at &quot;adults only&quot; theatres, with the age of majority set at 19).

Classification ratings are determined by the following:
* Theme (주제) - The effect on the formation emotions, values of group of age as well as the ability to understand and accept the theme.
* Sex and Nudity (선정성) - Level of exposure of human body as well as caress, sexual intercourse and other sexual activities.
* Violence (폭력성) - Level of damage to human body and oppression through torture and blood battles, pain, indignity and sexual violence.
* Language (대사) - Level and frequency of vulgar language and slangs.
* Horror (공포) - Level of psychological shock resulting from tension, stimuli and threat.
* Drugs (약물) - Level of drugs use and promotion or glamorization of such activities.
* Imitative Behavior (모방위험) - Level of imitation, encouragement and stimulus to perform the expressed act of murder, drug, suicide, school violence and out casting and use of weapons.

==Spain==

All films to be commercially released in Spain in any medium must be submitted to the ICAA (Instituto de Cinematografía y Artes Audiovisuales - Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts Institute). Classifications are advisory except for X-rated films, which are restricted to specially licensed venues. A supplementary classification, &quot;Especialmente Recomendada para la Infancia&quot; (Especially recommended for children), is sometimes appended to the lowest two classifications. Another supplementary classification, &quot;Especialmente recomendada para el fomento de la igualdad de género&quot; (Especially recommended for the promotion of gender equality), is sometimes appended to any of the classifications except the last one.

* A(i) – General admission.
* 7(i) – Not recommended for audiences under 7.
* 12 – Not recommended for audiences under 12.
* 16 – Not recommended for audiences under 16.
* 18 – Not recommended for audiences under 18.
* X – Prohibited for audiences under 18 (may only be shown in premises where adult films are screened).

==Sweden==

The Swedish Media Council (&quot;Statens medieråd&quot;) is a government agency with the aims to reduce the risk of harmful media influences among minors and to empower minors as conscious media users. The classification bestowed on a film should not be viewed as recommendations on the suitability for children, as the law the council operates under (SFS 2010:1882) only mandates them to assess the relative risk to children&#x27;s well-being. It is not a legal requirement to submit a film to the Media Council. The councils classification only applies to public exhibition, and the law does not require classification of home media.

The following categories are used:

* Btl (&quot;Barntillåten&quot;) – All ages.
* 7 – Children under the age of 7, who are accompanied by an adult, are admitted to films that have been passed for children from the age of 7.
* 11 – Children over the age of 7, who are accompanied by an adult, are admitted to films that have been passed for children from the age of 11.
* Not Approved/15 – Children over the age of 11, who are accompanied by an adult, are admitted to films with a 15-year limit.

==Switzerland==

Switzerland has adopted Germany&#x27;s Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK). Under Swiss law, however, children up to two years younger than the age recommendations will be admitted if accompanied by a person invested with parental authority.

==Taiwan==
From 1994 until 2015, the Government Information Office (GIO) classified films into four categories (General Audience/Protected/Parental Guidance/Restricted) pursuant to its issued ( in traditional Chinese): The &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; rating previously prohibited viewing by children under the age of 12 and required adolescents aged 12–17 to be accompanied by an adult. In 2015, the &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; rating was further divided into two categories: one that prohibits children under the age of 12 and one that prohibits adolescents under the age of 15.
*0+: 普遍級(普) (General Audience) – Viewing is permitted for audiences of all ages.
*6+: 保護級(護) (Protected) – Viewing is not permitted for children under 6; children between 6 and 11 shall be accompanied and given guidance by parents, teachers, seniors, adult relatives or friends.
*12+: 輔導十二歲級(輔12) (Parental Guidance 12) – Viewing is not permitted for children under 12.
*15+: 輔導十五歲級(輔15) (Parental Guidance 15) – Viewing is not permitted for those under 15.
*18+: 限制級(限) (Restricted) – Viewing is not permitted for those under 18.

==Thailand==

A motion picture rating system was proposed in the Film and Video Act of 2007, and was passed on December 20, 2007 by the Thai military-appointed National Legislative Assembly, replacing laws which had been in place since 1930. The draft law was met with resistance from the film industry and independent filmmakers. Activists had hoped for a less-restrictive approach; however, films are still subject to censorship, or can be banned from release altogether if the film is deemed to &quot;undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or might impact national security or the pride of the nation&quot;.
The ratings were put into effect in August 2009. They are as follows:

* P – Educational.
* G – General audience.
* 13 – Suitable for viewers aged 13 years and over.
* 15 – Suitable for viewers aged 15 years and over.
* 18 – Suitable for viewers aged 18 years and over.
* 20 – Content is unsuitable for viewers aged under 20.
* Banned – Films that are not allowed to screen publicly in Thailand.

==Turkey==

In Turkey, movies to be shown in cinemas are rated by the Evaluation and Classification Board of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. All films to be made commercially available must be classified, except in the case of educational films which are labeled as &quot;for educational purposes&quot; instead. The board also has the power to refuse classification in extreme cases (producers and distributors can submit an edited version of a movie to the board but edited versions may also be rejected if still deemed inappropriate); in this case, the movie will be banned with the exception of special artistic activities like fairs, festivals, feasts and carnivals.

* Genel İzleyici Kitlesi – General audience.
* 6A – Viewers under the age of 6 may watch with accompanying family members.
* 6+ – Restricted to viewers aged 6 and over.
* 10A – Viewers under the age of 10 may watch with accompanying family members.
* 10+ – Restricted to viewers aged 10 and over.
* 13A – Viewers under the age of 13 may watch with accompanying family members.
* 13+ – Restricted to viewers aged 13 and over.
* 16+ – Restricted to viewers aged 16 and over.
* 18+ – Restricted to viewers aged 18 and over.

Under this rating system, content may be assigned multiple ratings, with one signifying a minimum age of attendance, and the other signifying the minimum age of unaccompanied attendance. In addition to the age ratings, content is also assessed for violence/horror, sexuality and negative examples i.e. drugs, vulgar and slang language.

==Ukraine==

The Ukrainian State Film Agency is the central executive body of cinematography in Ukraine. The Ratings issued by the Derzhkino are:

*DA: ДА (Дитяча аудиторія): Film aimed for children. They contain no violence or obscenity.
*ZA: ЗА (Загальна аудиторія): Suitable for all.
*12: Suitable for children aged 12 and older; those under 12 may be admitted if accompanied by an adult as parents may find upsetting to them.
*16: Not allowed for viewing by persons under 16 years of age.
*18: Not allowed for viewing by persons under 18 years of age. Additionally, &quot;18&quot; rated features may only be screened in theatres after 18:00, and they may be broadcast on television only after 22:00.
*Denied: Відмовлено: Refused a classification by the Derzhkino. Content may not be shown, advertised, or distributed anywhere in Ukraine.
**Films can be rejected if they promote war, violence, cruelty, and fascism aimed at eliminating Ukraine&#x27;s independence.

==United Arab Emirates==

The United Arab Emirates has had a form of an age rating system for theatrical films since circa early 1980s, established under the federal 1980 Press and Publications Law, and originally authorised by the Ministry of Information and Culture (1972–2006). The National Media Council, established in 2006 when the ministry was eventually dissolved, would continue practising categorising films by perceiving content until February 2018, when it officially re-established the film age rating system under new guidelines, whilst also introducing new age rating systems for video games and print publications.

In June 2021, the Ministry of Culture and Youth launched the Media Regulatory Office to execute a number of functions and tasks previously under the National Media Council, following a restructure of the federal U.A.E. government that was approved in July 2020. This made the Media Regulatory Office the current authority for age ratings in the U.A.E. as of June 2021.

As of December 2021, the following are the official classifications used for films in the U.A.E.:
*G – For public viewing, suitable for all age groups.
*PG – For public viewing, with adult supervision.
*PG13 – Persons below 13 allowed with adult supervisions.
*PG15 – Persons below 15 allowed with adult supervisions.
*15+ – Ages 15 and above only.
*18+ – Ages 18 and above only.
*21+ – Ages 21 and above only. Films that receive this classification are legally restricted to its age group, but are authorised for commercial exhibition guaranteed without edits.

==United Kingdom==

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classifies films to be publicly exhibited in the United Kingdom, although statutory powers remain with local councils which can overrule any of the BBFC&#x27;s decisions. Since 1984, the BBFC also classifies films made commercially available through a home video format. If the BBFC refuses a classification this effectively amounts to a ban (although local councils retain the legal right to overturn it in the case of cinema exhibition). The BBFC&#x27;s regulatory powers do not extend to the Internet, so a film they have banned on physical media can still be made available via streaming media/video on demand. Videos designed to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification; exempt films may be marked as &quot;E&quot;, but this is not an official label.
The current BBFC system is:
* U (Universal – Suitable for all) – A U-rated film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over.
* PG (Parental Guidance) – General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG-rated film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older.
* 12A / 12 (Suitable for 12 years and over) – Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that is not generally suitable for children aged under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A-rated film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult. No one younger than 12 may rent or buy a 12 rated video work.
* 15 (Suitable only for 15 years and older) – No-one under 15 is allowed to see a 15-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent a 15-rated video.
* 18 (Suitable only for adults) – No-one under 18 is allowed to see an 18-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent an 18-rated video. 
* R18 (To be shown only in specially licensed cinemas, or supplied only in licensed sex shops, and to adults only) – The R18 category is a special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults. Films may only be shown to adults in specially licensed cinemas, and video works may be supplied to adults only in licensed sex shops. R18-rated video works may not be supplied by mail order.

Older video works still in circulation may still carry the deprecated Uc label, classifying the work as &quot;Especially suitable for pre-school children&quot;.

==United States==
In the United States, film classification is a voluntary process with the ratings issued by the Motion Picture Association (MPA) via the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA). The system was established in 1968, but the version listed below is the most recent revision, having been in effect since 1996. An unrated film is often informally denoted by &quot;NR&quot; in newspapers and so forth.

* G (General Audiences) – All ages admitted.
* PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) – Some material may not be suitable for children.
* PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned) – Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.
* R (Restricted) – Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
* NC-17 (Adults Only) – No one 17 and under admitted.

The current ratings are:

<doc id="142150" wikidata="Q1457443" url="?curid=142150" title="Wild Mood Swings">
<text>Wild Mood Swings is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 6 May 1996 by Fiction Records. The album charted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, staying on chart for six weeks, and charted at number 12 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Four singles were released from the album, the first being &quot;The 13th&quot;, released in 22 April 1996, followed by &quot;Mint Car&quot; released on 17 June, &quot;Strange Attraction&quot; released in United States on 8 October and &quot;Gone!&quot; released in Europe on 2 December 1996.

The album saw the band explore various styles, similar to their double album &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; (1987), incorporating jangle pop, with Mint Car and Return, jazz, with Gone, mariachi, with The 13th, and as the title suggests the album exhibits various different moods, from lighter poppier songs to introspective, darker material, often paired next to one another, which &quot;NME&quot; described as, &quot;rather like a compilation album, with all the disjointedness that implies.&quot;

== Background ==
&quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; was an album which saw various different changes towards the way the band approached recording their songs, such as the prominent use of computers and music software like Cubase, as well as live strings and brass instrumentation. It was also the first album released since drummer Boris Williams left the band, due to personal reasons in 1994, while guitarist Porl Thompson also left the group in 1993 to look after his children and joined English rock band Page and Plant.

Smith felt at the time that the previous line-up that had made &quot;Wish&quot; (1992) had &quot;really done as much as we could. In some ways, in the back of my mind, I was slightly unsure as to what we could achieve, because we all knew each other so well. So the fact that it all kind of fell apart was a good thing. It was one of those haphazard, serendipitous things that worked in our favour.&quot;However, Smith found it difficult to replace Boris Williams as he felt he was &quot;a phenomenally good drummer,&quot; and found &quot;replacing him was the most difficult thing. Not only did we have to find someone who would fit, who would get on with us and understand what the Cure is about, [he] also had to be as good a drummer as Boris, and it took months finding someone.&quot; Jason Cooper replaced Williams on drums in 1995, answering to a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; advertisement made by the band anonymously. Perry Bamonte replaced Porl Thompson as the group&#x27;s secondary guitarist, leaving Roger O&#x27;Donnell, who returned after being absent in the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Wish&quot;, to fulfil keyboard parts.

The album marked the first time the band did not work with David M. Allen as a producer since &quot;Japanese Whispers&quot; (1983). Robert Smith said of his departure, &quot;I thought that it was time to have a change from working with Dave Allen. I was worried that nothing new was going to happen. We&#x27;ve never really needed anyone to help on the creative or artistic side, but I thought it would be best to get someone in who was younger and didn&#x27;t have any preconceptions about the group.&quot;

The track &quot;Club America&quot;, is inspired by a summer trip in 1994 that Smith had to New York in with Perry Bamonte, &quot;I wanted to watch the football matches, the World Cup. So Depeche Mode were playing, and Perry&#x27;s brother Daryl, who now works for us, but who was working for them at the time, and I just went out with them in New York...&quot; Smith then went clubbing with the band and admitted to playing &quot;up to it then and awful lot more than I should have, and on the plane home, I wrote the song, because I was trying to, like, explain it away to myself. It&#x27;s ironic, you know. I&#x27;ve had this photo taken with these celebrities, and I was there, and I did that, and I was full of self loathing! And that song is not anti-the girl in the &quot;canary feather dress,&quot; it&#x27;s actually anti-me because I was part of it.&quot; Rolling Stone noted Smith&#x27;s put-on deeper voice on the song, citing borrowed &quot;vocal tricks&quot; from David Bowie and Iggy Pop, while also describing the sound as &quot;upbeat&quot; and that its sound invoked the &quot;jaded thrills of nightclubbing in the American fun house.&quot;Meanwhile, &quot;Spin&quot; felt the song resembled English rock band Happy Mondays, due to it replicating their psychedelic sound and &quot;NME&quot; compared it unfavourably to Tin Machine.

The song &quot;Treasure&quot; is inspired by the Christina Rossetti poem &quot;Remember&quot;. Smith felt that the most personal songs on the album were &quot;Want&quot; and &quot;Bare&quot;.

=== Recording ===
The band settled in St. Catherine&#x27;s Court, a Tudor house which was owned by actress Jane Seymour at the time, and were the first band to record there, since she began renting it out as a film set and recording studio since 1992.Other bands and musicians who would record there include Radiohead, for their acclaimed album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), Robbie Williams and New Order. The band themselves would return there for the initial 1998 sessions of the follow up album &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; (2000).

Alongside many other changes to the band&#x27;s working methods, they opted to use live brass instruments and string quartets in their songs. something which had previously not occurred in their recording processes, featuring on tracks such as &quot;This Is a Lie&quot; which started out as a song based around an acoustic guitar by Perry Bamonte, Smith recalled, &quot;when I started playing around with it, it evolved into a string piece on the keyboard. I always had in mind that we&#x27;d be using strings, right from the very outset. In that way, the house helped — there was an instant atmosphere for any string quartet walking into that room.&quot; The band chose Audrey Riley&#x27;s string quartet for the album as Smith felt she was &quot;very aware of recording for contemporary pop&quot; and that he had difficulties with previous musicians.

Smith noted the extensive use of people outside of the band, &quot;we’ve used an Indian orchestra and a jazz quartet and a string quartet and Mexican trumpet players,”... &quot;Everything on the album is real. In the past, I would have tried to keep it in the family, so to speak, and tried to attain a realistic sound through emulation or simulation. Now I feel much more comfortable having people around who are really good musicians.&quot;

The whole band were given much more input on the songs, allowing their ideas to be tested for inclusion &quot;no matter how silly it was&quot;. Smith felt at the time, &quot;It was the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had making a record, actually; it was brilliant. And that&#x27;s why it took quite a long time, &#x27;cause no one wanted it to stop. It was really good fun. We were paying for ourselves to live together in a house and make music, so why should we stop? Why should we go home?&quot;The mastering of the album was complete at Metropolis Studios, London with Robert Smith alongside Ian Cooper, who was suggested to Smith by producer Flood. This made for the first time Smith would be directly involved with the mastering process, which was to due to his frustration towards being absent on the band&#x27;s previous albums&#x27; mastering.

=== Sleeve Design and Art Direction ===
The album art features a toy clown, this toy motif would become a recurring theme for all of the related sleeve designs, such as the sleeve art for the singles released for the album. Bassist Simon Gallup discussed the origin to the cover and motif in a contemporary interview, &quot;Robert had this catalogue of toys from Germany. He sent away for these different types of metal toys. They&#x27;re actually really sharp on the edges and bizarre things like these cars you wind up. The clown is really quite frightening. When we were recording, we had all these toys put over our amps and things. We thought they were such bizarre images that we tried to incorporate them into the record sleeve.&quot;

The band&#x27;s website featured St Catherine&#x27;s Court, which was titled &quot;The Cure&#x27;s House&quot;.This also came with an interactive game that gave all of the band members rooms.

== Reception ==
&quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; received a mixed response from critics. A favourable review came from &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, which described the album as &quot;a potent and sweeping dissertation on melancholy and tentative dreams denied,&quot; calling it &quot;consistently compelling.&quot; However, the album was the lowest-selling Cure album in 12 years, and it marked the beginning of a downward trend in the Cure&#x27;s future album sales. 

When Simon Gallup was asked in a contemporary interview if he was looking forward to touring considering the album&#x27;s mixed reception, he responded &quot;Reviews really don&#x27;t bother us. We feel very much at home now that the British press hate us once again. We found it a bit disconcerting when we released &quot;Wish&quot; and we were suddenly the British journalists&#x27; favourite band&quot;

In a retrospective interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Smith said of the album&#x27;s poor reception, &quot;The album suffers from being too long. And it&#x27;s disjointed. I was trying to write in different styles, and wanted us to sound like different bands, almost going after the &quot;Kiss Me&quot; idea. But, because we’d lost Boris [Williams], and before Jason [Cooper] settled in, we had a different drummer every week. I would often forget the name of the person who was drumming.&quot;... Smith felt that after &quot;Wish&quot; he &quot;got that sense of fun back. And it shows in the album; there are some pretty demented songs on there. But it was a shame, because it got slagged when it came out. Fans hated it as well. It’s the only time I&#x27;ve been hugely disappointed.&quot; He believed that fans were unsatisfied with the lead single &quot;The 13th&quot; due to its &quot;sort of crackpot salsa feel.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the album&#x27;s variety, commenting: &quot;After the relatively straightforward pop of &quot;Wish&quot;, the Cure moved back toward stranger, edgier territory with &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;... As the title suggests, there&#x27;s a vast array of textures and emotions on &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;, from the woozy mariachi lounge horns of &#x27;The 13th&#x27; to the perfect pop of &#x27;Mint Car&#x27; and the monolithic dirge of &#x27;Want.&#x27;&quot; He praised the album&#x27;s variety saying that the band &quot;explore some simpler territory, from contemplative acoustic numbers tinged with strings to swooning neo-psychedelia.&quot; He concluded &quot;but the variety of sounds and strength of performance offers enough surprises to make Wild Mood Swings more than just another Cure record.&quot;

Chris Gerard of Metro Weekly gave a retrospective review on the album with a mixed perspective. &quot;There is no disputing the power of the album’s opener, though&quot;, praising the song &quot;Want&quot; which he believes to be one of the band&#x27;s strongest work. &quot;Starting with a swirling guitar riff and then building slowly in intensity as it goes, “Want” is another in a long line of powerhouse opening tracks on Cure albums.&quot; He also felt that the single choices were poor and led to the album&#x27;s poor reception. However he believed that &quot;certain B-Sides would&#x27;ve provided a much better collection of songs with the exclusion of some album tracks&quot;, and concluded that the album &quot;didn’t have to be the commercial and critical disaster that it turned out to be. The core of a great album is there — it’s just a matter of joining the right dots.&quot;

Michael Gallucci of Diffuser FM gave an unenthusiastic review, saying &quot;A tired, and often bored, mood drifts through &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;. It&#x27;s not even the gloom-and-doom lethargy we usually get from the band. Rather, Smith and the group can&#x27;t muster much enthusiasm for the songs&quot;, while also saying &quot;The few times the band sparks to life are the few times it seems to latch onto a groove: &#x27;Strange Attraction&#x27;, &#x27;Mint Car&#x27;, &#x27;Gone!&#x27;.&quot;

Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the first two tracks on the album, saying &quot;When he’s inspired, however, Smith can still make the journey along the tracks of his tears entirely compelling “Want,” which opens the album, renders emotional desolation in gripping terms, making the most of Smith’s ability to conjure a haunting atmosphere from a simple, endlessly repeated guitar figure.&quot;, but felt that the album &quot;recedes into generic Cure styles&quot; and concluded &quot;On &quot;Wild Mood Swings,&quot; Smith seems too trapped within his own obsessions to know when he’s merely expressed them and when he’s transformed them into art. It can sometimes be a thin line, but Smith has walked it before with far more satisfying results.&quot;

James Hannaham of &quot;Spin&quot; observed, &quot;Smith and the Cure remain fixated on cheap thrills throughout &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot;. They try on degraded versions of rock genre as deftly as they put on their makeup and lipstick.&quot; and felt, &quot;Smith&#x27;s three-note hooks never sounded less catchy, and the occasional arena-rock pretensions the band displays don&#x27;t exactly hit home.&quot; concluding, &quot;&quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; is the album you&#x27;d expect from the Cure if they&#x27;d suddenly become filthy rich, got drunk and high all the time, and had a midlife crisis.&quot;

Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; praised the album&#x27;s sound, giving it three out of four stars, &quot;a fun and deliberately trashy celebration of life&#x27;s pleasures. &quot;On Want&quot;, he expresses uncorked desire for &quot;more fun, more pain, more flesh, more stars,&quot; and Mint Car finds him chirping happily about romance. &quot;Moods&quot; do shift wildly, from a salsa-flavored &quot;The 13th&quot;, horn-pumped &quot;Return&quot; and zippy &quot;Gone!&quot; to trademark Cure downers like &quot;Bare and Numb&quot;. The album is uneven, but highlights outweigh the low points on this bipolar flight of fancy.&quot;

<text>WLS (890 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Chicago, Illinois. Owned by Cumulus Media, through licensee Radio License Holdings LLC, the station airs a talk radio format. WLS studios are in the NBC Tower on North Columbus Drive in the city&#x27;s Streeterville neighborhood. The station&#x27;s programming is also available in the Chicago metropolitan area via a simulcast on the HD2 digital subchannel of sister station WLS-FM. The station formerly broadcast in C-QUAM AM stereo.

Its transmitter site is located on the southwestern edge of Tinley Park, Illinois in Will County. WLS is a Class A station broadcasting on the clear-channel frequency of 890 kHz with 50,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna fed by a Nautel NX-50 transmitter, with a Harris DX-50 serving as a backup transmitter. Both transmitters run in MDCL (Modulation Dependent Carrier Level) mode to improve efficiency. The station&#x27;s daytime groundwave service contour covers portions of five states. At night, its signal routinely reaches 38 states via skywave.

WLS participates as an Emergency Alert System primary entry point, serving northern Illinois and western Indiana.

== Programming ==
Weekdays on WLS, two local talk show hosts are heard: Steve Cochran is in morning drive time. And Brett Gogoel hosts an hour on the markets and an hour on local news topics in late afternoons. The rest of the weekday schedule is nationally syndicated conservative talk shows from co-owned Westwood One: &quot;The Chris Plante Show, The Dan Bongino Show, The Ben Shapiro Show, The Mark Levin Show, The Michael Knowles Show, Red Eye Radio&quot; and &quot;America in the Morning&quot;.

Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, technology, travel and cars. Syndicated weekend programs include &quot;The Kim Komando Show&quot; and &quot;The Larry Kudlow Show&quot;, as well as repeats of weekday shows. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. Most hours on nights and weekends begin with an update from ABC News Radio.

==History==
===Summary===
Founded in 1924 by Sears, Roebuck and Company—with the call sign an abbreviation for Sears&#x27; &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Store&quot; slogan—WLS spent its early years as the radio outlet of the &quot;Prairie Farmer&quot; magazine. From 1928 until 1954, WLS shared their assigned frequency and overall broadcast operations with Blue Network-owned WENR until the Blue Network&#x27;s successor, the American Broadcasting Company, merged WENR into WLS and eventually purchased it outright. The station&#x27;s contemporary hit radio era from 1960 until 1989 saw WLS at a creative and ratings pinnacle headlined by personalities Dick Biondi, Larry Lujack, John Records Landecker and Bob Sirott. Since 1989, WLS has been a full-time talk radio outlet.

===Establishment by Sears===
In the 1920s, Sears, Roebuck and Company was a major retail and mail order company. To get farmers and people in rural communities to buy radio sets from its catalogs, Sears initially bought time on radio stations. It later decided to establish its own station. Just before the permanent station was ready, Sears began broadcasts on March 21, 1924, as WBBX with noon programs using the WMAQ studios.

Sears broadcast test transmissions from its own studios on April 9, 10 and 11, 1924, using the call sign WES (for &quot;World&#x27;s Economy Store&quot;). Sears originally operated its station at the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters on Chicago&#x27;s West Side, which is also where the company&#x27;s mail order business was located. On April 12, 1924, the station commenced officially, using the call letters WLS (for &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Store&quot;), and broadcasting from its new studios in the Sherman House Hotel in downtown Chicago. The station&#x27;s transmitter was originally located outside Crete, Illinois. On April 19, the station aired its first &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;. Harriet Lee was a WLS staff singer as part of the &quot;Harmony Team&quot; in the late 1920s. The popular contralto singer also played &quot;Aunt May&quot; on the &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; show.

The station shared time on the frequency with WCBD until the November 11, 1928, implementation of the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40, at which point WLS began sharing time as a &quot;clear channel&quot; station with WENR.

===Prairie Farmer ownership===

Sears opened the station in 1924 as a service to farmers and subsequently sold it to the &quot;Prairie Farmer&quot; magazine in 1928. The station moved to the Prairie Farmer Building on West Washington in Chicago, where it remained for 32 years. For a few months after ABC&#x27;s 1960 purchase of it and the format change, the &quot;bright new sound&quot; that began in May 1960 was broadcast from the Prairie Farmer Building. WLS didn&#x27;t make the move to downtown Michigan Avenue&#x27;s Stone Container Building, located at 360 North Michigan Avenue, until October of that year. Thirty years later, it would move once more, to 190 North State in downtown Chicago. It was the scene of the &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;, which featured Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, and George Gobel, and which was second only to the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; (itself a local &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; spinoff) in presenting country music and humor.

The station also experimented successfully in many forms of news broadcasting, including weather and crop reports. Its most famous news broadcast was the eyewitness report of the Hindenburg disaster by Herbert Morrison. Morrison and engineer Charles Nehlsen had been sent to New Jersey by WLS to cover the arrival of the Hindenburg for delayed broadcast. Their recordings aired the next day on May 7, 1937, the first time that recordings of a news event were ever broadcast.

In the fall of 1937, the station was one of several Chicago radio stations to donate airtime to Chicago Public Schools for a pioneering program in which the school district provided elementary school students with distance education amid a polio outbreak-related school closure.

===Blue Network affiliation===

Starting in the 1930s, WLS was an affiliate of the Blue Network of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and as such aired the popular &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and &quot;Lum and Abner&quot; comedy programs (both produced at the studios of Chicago&#x27;s NBC-owned stations, WENR and WMAQ) during their early years. When the Federal Communications Commission forced NBC to sell the Blue Network, WLS maintained its affiliation with the network under its new identity, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Under this affiliation, some programs from the network that were not commercially sponsored or which were scheduled to cross the time that WLS and WENR shifted its use of the same frequency (such as baseball or football games) were transferred to air on a third Blue Network/ABC affiliate in Chicago, WCFL. Blue/ABC network broadcasts of addresses by labor leaders were also shifted away from WLS and WENR to WCFL, which was owned at the time by the Chicago Federation of Labor.

In 1931, the station&#x27;s power was increased from 5,000 watts to 50,000 watts, and the station began sharing the transmitter of WENR near Downers Grove, Illinois. In 1938, the station&#x27;s transmitter was moved to Tinley Park, Illinois.
Changes were made regarding AM frequencies in 1941 as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA); this moved WENR and WLS from 870 to 890 kHz.


===ABC ownership===
WENR and WLS shared their common frequency on a time-sharing arrangement until 1954, when ABC (then known as American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres) bought a 50 percent interest in WLS and combined the stations under the WLS call sign.
In November 1959, ABC announced its purchase of &quot;Prairie Farmer&quot; and its half of WLS, giving ABC full ownership of the station.

===Musicradio era===

On May 2, 1960, at 6 am, WLS went with a full-time Top 40 format. Mort Crowley was the first disc jockey under the new format, and the first song played was &quot;Alley-Oop&quot; by The Hollywood Argyles, four weeks before it debuted on the Hot 100. The station&#x27;s jingles were sung by the Anita Kerr Singers.

Ralph Beaudin was the station&#x27;s president and general manager, and oversaw the station&#x27;s transformation into a Top 40 station. Sam Holman was the station&#x27;s program director and an afternoon DJ. Beaudin and Holman were both brought in from KQV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ed Grennan, an announcer on the station since 1959, was retained as a DJ under the new format. Star disc jockey Dick Biondi, a 1998 inductee into the National Radio Hall of Fame, was brought in from WEBR in Buffalo, New York. Biondi remained on the station until 1963. Other DJs who were brought in for the station&#x27;s new format included Bob Hale from WIRL in Peoria, Illinois, Gene Taylor from WOKY in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Mort Crowley from WADO in New York City, and Jim Dunbar from WDSU in New Orleans, Louisiana.

In October 1960, Art Roberts joined the station as a DJ, having previously worked at WKBW in Buffalo, New York. Clark Weber joined the station as a DJ, remaining with the station until 1969. In 1963, Ron &quot;Ringo&quot; Riley joined the station as a DJ, having previously worked at WHK in Cleveland, Ohio. Dex Card joined the station in 1964, and hosted the Silver Dollar Survey countdown until 1967, the longest of the show&#x27;s hosts. In 1967, Larry Lujack joined WLS as a DJ, four months after he had started at the station&#x27;s top competitor WCFL. Lujack returned to WCFL in 1972, but rejoined WLS in 1976, remaining with the station until 1987. In 1968, a mid-twenty-something Chuck Buell was recruited as the youngest on-air radio personality for a major market contemporary hit music station to date to host the early evening 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. show. An equally young Kris Eric Stevens soon followed a few months later to follow for the 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. show. In 1972, John Records Landecker joined WLS, remaining with the station until 1981. Landecker returned to WLS in 1986, and remained with the station until its format was changed in 1989. Tommy Edwards joined the station as production director in 1972, becoming program director one year later, and later becoming a mid-day DJ. Bob Sirott joined WLS in June 1973, remaining with the station until December 1979.

Other DJs on WLS during its top 40 era included Joel Sebastian, Gary Gears, J. J. Jefferies, Jerry Kay, Yvonne Daniels, Brant Miller, Tom Kent, Steve King, Jeff Davis, and Fred Winston. Some of the production directors responsible for the sound of WLS were Ray Van Steen, Hal Widsten, Jim Hampton, Bill Price and Tommy Edwards.

In the 1960s, WLS was a major force in introducing new music and recording artists. The first US airplay of a record by The Beatles (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;) was on Dick Biondi&#x27;s show on February 8, 1963.

WLS was voted by broadcasters nationally as &quot;Radio Station of the Year&quot; in 1967, 1968 and 1969. John Rook was named &quot;Program Director of the Year&quot; in 1968 and 1969 as WLS was estimated attracting 4.2 million listeners weekly by Pulse research.
WLS also produced the weekly Silver Dollar Survey from October 14, 1960, to December 22, 1967, broken by the Silver Beatle Survey on February 21, 1964, and the Super Summer Survey from May 5, 1967, to August 25, 1967. The survey nominally contained 40 current song listings, except for occasional weeks when it contained fewer current listings, usually 20, plus a special listing of some of the greatest oldies. From September 18, 1964, through December 25, 1964, the survey consisted of the top 30 pop hits, followed by the top 10 R&amp;B hits. Thereafter, the survey changed its name numerous times (89 WLS Hit Parade, 89 WLS Chicagoland Hit Parade, WLS Musicradio 89, etc.). Starting with the July 20, 1970, survey, the number of listings dropped from 40 to 30, then varying from 25 to 40 starting June 26, 1972, then dropping to 15 by March 9, 1974, then increasing to a high of 45 by the end of 1975. No &quot;take home&quot; surveys were printed from March 13, 1972, through July 16, 1973 (these were limited to one poster-size weekly survey displayed at record shops). The year-end listing was the 20 greatest hits of the year for each year from 1963 through 1966, increased to 89 from 1967 onward.
Like many AM radio stations of the seventies, WLS edited many of the songs they played into a more &quot;radio-friendly&quot; or &quot;radio edit&quot; (a term still used today) format, usually 3–4 minutes in length. Other special editions of some Top 40 songs exclusively made for their broadcasting were done by the musicians themselves or sometimes by the WLS audio engineers. An example of these included Reunion&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)&quot;. Reunion changed the song&#x27;s lyrics from &quot;Life is a rock but the radio rolled me&quot; to &quot;Life is a rock/WLS rolled me&quot;. A similar version was made for competitor WCFL. Another &quot;WLS-only&quot; version was a combination of Captain and Tennille&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; and &quot;Por Amor Viviremos&quot;, which featured alternating English and Spanish vocals.

By the mid-1970s, WLS became conservative about introducing new songs, and many record promoters referred to the station as the &quot;World&#x27;s Last Station&quot; to add new releases for airplay, usually only after the songs had reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. However, in 1974, the station started playing the track &quot;Lady&quot; by the Chicago band Styx from an older album of theirs, resulting in other stations around the country adding the song and making the track Styx&#x27; first national Top 40 hit.

During the 1970s WLS ran a Sunday night music interview program called &quot;Musicpeople&quot;.

In 1984, Steve Dahl and Garry Meier&#x27;s program was moved to WLS from WLS-FM, over the objections of the duo, who attempted to have their contract declared invalid. Nevertheless, Dahl and Meier drew higher ratings on WLS than they had on WLS-FM. Dahl and Meier left WLS in 1986, returning to WLUP.

Well into the 1980s, WLS continued as a mainstream Top 40 formatted station. However, beginning in 1985, the station would begin to undergo major changes. In January 1985, the station began airing &quot;Sex Talk&quot; on Sunday nights, hosted by Phyllis Levy, a sex therapist. By 1987, WLS was airing adult contemporary music, liberally laced with oldies and standards, with talk programming at night. During the 1980s, Les Grobstein was hired as the first and only full-time Sports Director of WLS and broke the story of Cubs manager Lee Elia&#x27;s famous tirade on April 29, 1983, after a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, which included 54 profanities.

===Talkradio era===

In June 1989, WLS announced it was going all-talk by the end of the summer. Rumors were that the change was to happen September 1. Air personalities were becoming more talk-intensive anyway and midday talk was added as well. But quietly, with no warning, on August 23, 1989, at 7 pm, WLS stopped playing music altogether. Phil Duncan was the last DJ to play music on WLS, and as Duncan finished up his show, a voice in the back of the studio (that of then-WYTZ DJ Steven Craig) was heard saying &quot;Goodnight!&quot; (Craig unknowingly (and unofficially) became the last live voice on Musicradio WLS.) Appropriately, the last song was &quot;Just You &#x27;n&#x27; Me&quot; by Chicago. WLS then became a talk station, with Sally Jesse Raphael as its first host. In the beginning of the talk format, WLS featured high-rated talk talents from around the country, such as Bob Lassiter from Tampa Bay, Stacy Taylor from San Diego and the station&#x27;s biggest hit, Rush Limbaugh out of New York. After a few years, however, Lassiter, Taylor and some of their other national hosts were dropped in favor of more local hosts. Jay Marvin also had several stints on WLS, where he was one of the few liberal voices on its political talk shows, which had mostly conservative viewpoints. The station served as the &quot;flagship&quot; broadcast outlet for the Sunday night, national political talk show, &quot;Beyond the Beltway with Bruce DuMont&quot;.

By 1992, WLS had such low ratings that ABC&#x27;s national management was planning on flipping the station to a satellite-fed country format (management went so far as to distribute an all-staff memo and hosts being told they were about to be let go). However, in what was described as an &quot;eleventh hour decision&quot;, ABC canceled the planned format change due to convincing from local management. Throughout the 1990s, ratings began to grow, with the station occasionally ranked in the Top 10.

On Memorial Day, 2007, WLS took a cue from sister station WABC and ran a special day of musical programming, &quot;The Big 89 Rewind&quot;, featuring live visits from Larry Lujack, Tommy Edwards, Fred Winston, Chris Shebel, Jeff Davis, John Records Landecker, Tom Kent, and other DJs, sounders, and airchecks from the Musicradio era. The broadcasts re-aired on Independence Day 2007, and there was a new Rewind in 2008.

===Cumulus ownership===

ABC-owned radio stations which were not affiliated with ESPN Radio or Radio Disney, including WLS, were sold to Citadel Broadcasting on June 12, 2007, with Citadel licensing the name ABC Radio for 2 years after the sale. Citadel was acquired by Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

Cumulus Media terminated its affiliation with overnight radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; on many of its stations, including WLS. In the spring of 2012, it began airing its own &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;.

Longtime morning show hosts Don and Roma Wade retired in December 2012. They had been off the air since October due to Don Wade&#x27;s cancer treatments. On September 6, 2013, Don Wade died of a brain tumor.

Cumulus radio stations made a break with ABC at the end of 2014, when they no longer carried ABC News Radio. WLS and most Cumulus news/talk stations began running Westwood One News on January 1, 2015. (Westwood One is a Cumulus subsidiary.) This lasted until August 30, 2020, when Westwood One shuttered its news service, and as of August 31, 2020, the station is once again affiliated with ABC News Radio.

In January 2017, WLS and WLS-FM moved from its 190 N. State Street studios to its new studios in NBC Tower on North Columbus Drive in Streeterville. In addition, the station became the new affiliate of NBC News Radio. On January 2, 2017, the station added the on-air team of Bob Sirott and Marianne Murciano from WGN (AM); the former marking his return to WLS for the first time since 1980. However, Sirott and Murciano were cut from the station&#x27;s lineup, beginning January 1, 2018.

====Sports====
On June 23, 2015, WLS announced that the station had picked up broadcasting rights for Chicago White Sox baseball starting with the 2016 season. In addition, WLS had also picked up broadcasting rights for Chicago Bulls basketball, beginning with the 2016-17 NBA season. Due to Cumulus&#x27;s January 2018 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the carriage rights were terminated in the filing. The Bulls moved to WSCR, taking effect immediately at the start of February, while the White Sox shifted to WGN several weeks later.

In the 2015–16 season, WLS carried Notre Dame Fighting Irish college football and basketball games. In 2016, Notre Dame moved to WMVP.

In 2023, WLS became the home for NASCAR, as the Chicago affiliate station for the Motor Racing Network, airing NASCAR Cup Series races, as well as both of the first NASCAR Chicago Street Races, The Loop 121 Xfinity Race and The Grant Park 220 Cup Race.

In 2023, WLS also became the affiliate station for the Chicago Fire MLS team.

<text>The East Lancashire Railway is a heritage railway line in North West England which runs between Heywood, Greater Manchester and Rawtenstall in Lancashire. There are intermediate stations at Bury Bolton Street, , Summerseat and Ramsbottom, with the line crossing the border into Rossendale serving Irwell Vale and Rawtenstall. Before closure, the line terminated at Bacup.

The heritage line is now just over long and has a mainline connection with the national railway network at Castleton, just beyond Heywood. The ELR is planning to extend the running line to Castleton in the future.

== Overview ==
Passenger services between Bury and Rawtenstall were withdrawn by British Rail on 3 June 1972. Coal services to Rawtenstall ended in 1980 and formal closure of the line followed in 1982. The East Lancashire Railway Trust reopened the line on 25 July 1987. The initial service operated between Bury and Ramsbottom, via Summerseat. In 1991, the service was extended northwards from Ramsbottom to reach Rawtenstall, via Irwell Vale. However, two original stations on the line, closed to passengers by BR in 1972, have not reopened, Ewood Bridge &amp; Edenfield and Stubbins. The latter was the junction of the lines to Accrington and Rossendale although there were no platforms serving these lines.

Rawtenstall is the practical northern limit of the line, as the formation on towards Bacup has been lost immediately north of the station.
In September 2003, an eastbound extension from Bury to Heywood was re-opened. To reach Heywood, the extension had to cross over the Manchester Metrolink line to Bury, at the site of the former Bury Knowsley Street station. This necessitated the construction of a new intersection bridge, with steeply graded approaches of 1 in 36 and 1 in 41 nicknamed The Ski Jump.

On 13 October 2016, the new station was officially opened by the Mayor of Bury, where locomotive no. 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; pulled the first train to stop at the station with a bagpipe rendition of &#x27;Scotland the Brave&#x27; signalling its arrival.

The remainder of the extension includes a long section at 1 in 85, rising towards Heywood, as the preserved railway line climbs out of the Irwell valley.

The railway is open every weekend of the year, holding a number of themed events and galas throughout the year, which include steam and diesel events, and also offers driver experience courses. The Day Out with Thomas events made a return to the railway after a two-year absence, following fresh negotiations, having previously been unable to reach an agreement in 2009 with HIT Entertainment, the owners of the Thomas brand. While Thomas was absent, the ELR operated Family Engines Big Day Out events featuring alternative engines with faces, such as Jimmy the Jinty.

The railway is run by volunteer members from the East Lancashire Railway Preservation Society (ELRPS). The railway is well known for its collection of diesel locomotives which reside on the railway, along with over 140 carriages, wagons and utility vehicles. Although the ELR does offer a local residents&#x27; discount card, and many residents do use the trains at weekends, it does not claim to offer a true commuter service either in levels of services or fares.

== Volunteer dismissal controversy ==
In April 2023, the railway was subject to national press coverage for dismissing a female volunteer following her complaint about misogynistic behaviour and discriminatory treatment. The volunteer had been shortlisted as Inspirational Woman of the Year at the 2023 Railway Awards ceremony hosted by the Heritage Railway Association for her work as a heritage railway steam locomotive fireman with Llangollen Railway. The volunteer stated, &quot;the actions of the ELR are the very reason why culture needs to change&quot;. The company denied unfair treatment.

== Reinstatement proposals ==

The heritage line is now just over long and has a mainline connection with the national railway network at Castleton, just beyond Heywood. The ELR is planning to extend the running line to Castleton in the future, with a new cross platform interchange being the preferred option.

 options for providing an interchange station at Castleton between East Lancashire Railway and National Rail services were being explored. Plans for the station were supported by Rochdale Borough Council, which hoped to fund it by adjacent land development.

In 2019, the CityMetric website published a &quot;fantasy&quot; tram link expansion proposal to create an orbital extension to the Manchester Metrolink tram system, which would include part of the current East Lancashire Railway route between Bury and Heywood.

In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

As part of the Government&#x27;s &#x27;Restoring Your Railway&#x27; fund, the route between Rochdale railway station and Bury Bolton Street ELR station was identified as a route for re-opening. As of 23 May 2020, the bid had made it past the first stage of the &#x27;ideas fund&#x27;.

== Cultural references ==
In October 2014, Ramsbottom Station and the adjacent level crossing on Bridge Street was featured in the 2017 movie &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;, which was the scene for an emotional peak in the movie, starring Sigourney Weaver in a Volvo estate car waiting for a BR DMU, in Rail Blue livery, to pass through the crossing.

In the 1990s, the railway was featured in the 1991 film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; and in the finale of ITV&#x27;s comedy series &quot;The Grimleys&quot;, named &quot;The Grimley Curse&quot; set in 1978. In 2007, during the finale of BBC One&#x27;s award-winning drama series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, set in 1973, a class 47 was used for scenes of an armed robbery at Brooksbottom Tunnel.

The railway also featured in an episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, transmitted on August Bank Holiday 2010, when Hayley and Roy Cropper travelled to their wedding aboard an ELR train of Mark 1 coaches hauled by LMS &quot;Black 5&quot; No. 44871, which carried 45407&#x27;s Lancashire Fusilier nameplates for the occasion. The line also starred in the BBC television film &quot;Eric and Ernie&quot;, aired on New Year&#x27;s Day 2011, about the early career of the British comedy act Morecambe and Wise. Bury Bolton Street station was featured, along with a train of Mark 1 coaches hauled by LMS &quot;Black 5&quot; No. 44871. In 2014, the railway was featured in a week of episodes of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; (broadcast 3–7 November) which featured a crash involving BR Class 14 no. D9531 &quot;Ernest&quot;.

==Locomotives and multiple units==

The ELR is home to a mixed collection of small to large designs, some of which are main-line certified. These often visit other heritage lines or can be found operating mainline excursions, especially during the summer season (March–October).

<text>The Severn Valley Railway is a standard gauge heritage railway in Shropshire and Worcestershire, England, named after the company that originally built the railway over which it now operates. The heritage line runs from Bridgnorth to Kidderminster, following the course of the River Severn along the Severn Valley for much of its route, and crossing the river on the historic Victoria Bridge.

Train services are hauled by a mixture of steam and heritage diesel locomotives. The railway hosts numerous special events throughout the year, including both steam and diesel galas.

==History==
===Commercial history===
The Severn Valley Railway was built between 1858 and 1862, and linked Hartlebury, near Droitwich Spa, with Shrewsbury, a distance of . Important stations on the line were , , and within Worcestershire; and , , , , , , , and in Shropshire.

Although the railway was built by the original Severn Valley Railway Company, it was operated from opening on 1 February 1862 by the West Midland Railway which was absorbed into the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 August 1863. As one of the many branch lines on the GWR&#x27;s extensive network, it was subsequently referred to in GWR timetables as the Severn Valley Branch.

In 1878, the GWR opened a link line between Bewdley and Kidderminster. This meant trains could run direct from the Black Country to areas of Shropshire. Most Kidderminster to Bewdley trains continued through the Wyre Forest line (dismantled in the 1960s and now forming part of National Cycle Route 45) to Tenbury Wells or Woofferton.

At Buildwas Junction (now the site of the former Ironbridge Power Station near what is now Telford) Severn Valley trains connected with services from Wellington to Much Wenlock and Craven Arms.

The line was originally planned as double-track, but was built and operated as a single-track railway. Prior to preservation, the Severn Valley line was never financially successful. Freight traffic, mostly agricultural, and coal traffic from the collieries of Alveley and Highley were the principal sources of revenue. Passenger numbers began to fall after the First World War, particularly at the large intermediate stations of Stourport, Bewdley, and Bridgnorth, with measures such as the opening of halts in the 1930s to attract more local custom having only limited impact. However, the line was strategically useful in the Second World War as an alternative diversionary route around the West Midlands.

After nationalisation in 1948, passenger traffic continued to dwindle. Although the Severn Valley Branch was closed during the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, it was already scheduled for closure prior to the publication of Beeching&#x27;s report, &#x27;The Reshaping of British Railways&#x27;, on 27 March 1963. British Railways had announced in January 1962 that the Severn Valley Branch was under review, and the British Transport Commission published closure proposal notices on 1 October 1962 in advance of a meeting of the West Midlands Transport Users Consultative Committee, which took place at Bridgnorth Town Hall on 8 November 1962. Objections to the proposed closure were unsuccessful and the line between Shrewsbury and Bewdley was closed to passenger services on 9 September 1963, and to through freight services on 30 November 1963. Following closure, the track north of Bridgnorth was dismantled. After 1963, the line from Bewdley was retained to serve Alveley Colliery until 1969, while a sparse passenger service continued to link Bewdley with Kidderminster and Hartlebury, until this too ceased in January 1970. Freight traffic between the British Sugar Corporation&#x27;s Foley Park factory and Kidderminster continued until 1982.

For much of its working life, the Severn Valley line was operated by the Great Western Railway and subsequently the Western Region of British Railways. Today, the Severn Valley Railway operates almost exclusively as a heritage passenger railway.

===Heritage railway===
The Severn Valley Railway Society was formed in July 1965 by a group of members who wished to preserve a section of the line which had closed in 1963. BR agreed to an offer of £25,000 for the miles of the line between Bridgnorth and Alveley Colliery in February 1966 and the Society paid an initial deposit of £2,500 in February 1967. Obtaining a Light Railway Order required a limited company to be formed, with a new Severn Valley Railway Company being incorporated in May 1967. Even at that early date, the objective of the company was to &quot;preserve, retain and restore the standard-gauge railway extending from Bridgnorth to Kidderminster via Bewdley&quot;.

The Light Railway Order was granted in May 1970, allowing regular services to begin between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade; the balance of the £25,000 purchase price being paid to BR on 24 June 1970.

The end of coal trains from the colliery in 1969 allowed SVR to acquire a further miles of the line from Hampton Loade to Foley Park in 1972, the purchase price of £74,000 (£ in ) being raised by the flotation of a public company initially under the chairmanship of Sir Gerald Nabarro MP (the line was partly in his former Kidderminster constituency). The share issue took place, but after SVR volunteers discovered he planned to sell the Bridgnorth railway station site for hotel and housing development and bring business friends from outside onto the board, it led to a threatened strike by the railway&#x27;s volunteer staff and his proposals were thrown out at a heated AGM. Nabarro stood down as chairman in March 1973, being succeeded by Viscount Garnock, and resigned from the board of directors in May 1973. Services were extended to Bewdley in May 1974.

Following the end of freight traffic from the British Sugar factory at Foley Park in 1982, the SVR purchased the final section of the line to Kidderminster at a cost of £75,000 (£ in ). The SVR also rented the former Comberton Hill goods yard at Kidderminster from BR, on which a new station would be built. This was achieved in time for services to Kidderminster to begin on 30 July 1984.

Major developments on the SVR since 1984 have included the commissioning of a newly constructed signal box at Kidderminster in 1987, the opening of a new boiler shop at Bridgnorth in 1990, the purchase of the freehold of Kidderminster Town station in 1994, the opening of a new carriage shed at Kidderminster in 2003, the completion of the east wing and canopy of Kidderminster Station in 2006, and the opening of the Engine House Museum at Highley in 2008. 2010 marked the Severn Valley railway&#x27;s 40th anniversary since opening in 1970 and the 175th anniversary of the formation of the Great Western Railway. 2015 marked the 50th anniversary since the birth of the Severn Valley Railway on 6 July 1965. Special events were staged during both years to mark these anniversaries.

==Preservation==
===Operations===
SVR trains usually operate over the approximately line between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, calling at all stations. The &quot;halts&quot; (Northwood Halt and Country Park Halt) are request stops. Passengers may use these halts during daylight hours only.

In past years services included the &quot;Severn Valley Limited&quot; and &quot;Severn Valley Venturer&quot; dining car trains, and diesel-hauled &quot;Sunset Special&quot; fish-and-chip trains. the &quot;Severn Valley Limited&quot; has been reintroduced on selected dates; the other services do not feature in the timetable.

Many special gala days are held, often with visiting engines and rolling stock from other heritage lines; these and other attractions have seen visitor numbers increase and exceed 250,000 per year.

The SVR&#x27;s rail connection to the National Rail network at Kidderminster permits various track maintenance, weed killing, track measurement and occasional through charter trains to operate from various parts of the country to Bridgnorth. An example of these visitors was that of the &quot;Venice-Simplon Orient Express&quot;″s Northern Belle in 2006. Two direct trains to from Bridgnorth operated by Chiltern Railways ran in 2009, one on 15 August and one on 28 November. Some trackwork revisions have been completed at Kidderminster to improve ingress of incoming excursions.

The railway operated two revenue-earning freight trains in May 2007 which carried 6-metre-long pipes from Kidderminster to the Severn Trent water handling plant at Trimpley operated by EWS. Carriage by road of such long pipes would have been difficult due to the narrow roads in the immediate area of Trimpley. 

In March 2021, the railway acted as a testing ground for the first of the rebuilt Class 69 mainline locomotives.

The SVR announced in September 2023 that it had signed a partnership agreement with Network Rail which will allow the railway to obtain professional skills, advice and redundant railway materials from the mainline to assist with operations.

====Miniature railways====
The Coalyard Miniature Railway also operates passenger trips, and is based at Kidderminster Town station. The Paddock Railway is a 32mm gauge (1:19 scale) model railway which operates most Sundays at Hampton Loade railway station. Both of these railways are operated by volunteers.

===Major infrastructure damage—summer 2007===
On the evening of 19 June 2007, during violent thunderstorms that struck the area, the railway suffered major damage, more extensive than at any other time in its history. Between Bridgnorth Outer Home signal and Northwood Halt, numerous landslides occurred, with several sections of the line around Fisherman&#x27;s Crossing and Highley being left suspended in mid-air. A portion of track by Oldbury viaduct was also washed away. Many cuttings were filled with debris, while at , the Up Starter signal and the embankment it used to stand on were washed away due to the torrent of water that had flowed down station road and on to the track. The chalets below the embankment were also washed away. At Hampton Loade, the access road to the railway station – and indeed the only road to the village – was also washed away.

A dozen other heritage railways pledged to help the stricken SVR, including Mid Hants Railway, Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, West Somerset Railway, Avon Valley Railway, Dean Forest Railway, Great Central Railway, North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Bluebell Railway.

It was announced on 22 June 2007 that an emergency appeal would be started within days to raise funds for the repair bill. The total cost of the damage was revised upwards as a result of further damage and a massive potential slip in the Northwood Lane area following more rain and flooding in late July. The final repair bill was put at approximately £3.7{{nbsp}}million; this was funded by an initial grant from the European Regional Development Fund of £750,000, a grant from Advantage West Midlands of £500,000, £250,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £1{{nbsp}}million from the SVR&#x27;s insurers (£500,000 for embankments, £350,000 for structures, signalling and track, and £150,000 specifically for Borle Viaduct), a further grant of £377,000 from the ERDF, £560,000 from the public appeal and the balance from SVR reserves.

These events damaged the summer tourist trade to the railway, the towns served, and the area as a whole. A noticeable impact to Bridgnorth&#x27;s tourism was also felt. A spokesman announced on 22 June that the line was expected to reopen between Bewdley and Arley by the end of July and the section between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade to be up and running by the end of August; however it became apparent in early July 2007 that these reopenings would be delayed by as much as a month, later extended by up to three months. On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already saturated ground, and in at least ten of these spots damage was so serious that major engineering work was required before reconstruction could get under way. It was also said later that the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.

The Bridgnorth to Hampton Loade section eventually re-opened on 9 February 2008 for the school half-term. The first passenger train to Hampton Loade since 19 June 2007 departed on time at 10:30, comprising five LMS coaches hauled by 45xx Class no. 4566. The train featured the headboard carried by the first reopening train from Bridgnorth to Hampton Loade in 1970.{{cn|date=February 2025|reason= removed}} Although other drainage work enhancements remained to be completed, the line between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth reopened fully to the public on Good Friday, 21 March 2008. The work increased to 144 the number of culverts under the line, where previously there were 44 before the 2007 floods.

===2025 landslip===
On 30 January 2025, a landslip occurred on an embankment carrying the line between Hampton Loade and Bridgnorth stations, just north of Sterns. This made the section of line unusable. Although the railway stated it intends to repair the damage and resume service on the full length of the line, there is no timescale for doing this. An appeal was launched to raise funds for the work.

===Signalling===
With the exception of the connection at Kidderminster to Network Rail metals (which uses a colour light signal) the whole railway is signalled using Great Western style lower quadrant signals, of both metal and wooden pole/arm types. (Exceptionally, the down starter at Highley has a rare concrete post). Each station (not including halts) has a signal box, with Bewdley having two boxes (North and South), due to the size of the layout there (Bewdley originally being a junction station).

All sections between Bridgnorth and Bewdley North operate using the Tyer&#x27;s Electric Train Token. Both Arley and Hampton Loade signal boxes can be switched out when not required by the service, reducing wear on the mechanics and reducing the number of signalmen required to operate the line. The SVR trains new signalmen. Arley yard may be accessed with the signal box switched out due to the presence of an intermediate token instrument, which also enables a train to depart from or terminate in the yard when the box is switched out.

Bridgnorth also has a ground frame at the northern end of the layout allowing movements from the Hollybush siding (which also serves as the headshunt for locomotives running round their trains) into and out of the Boiler Shop. An Annett&#x27;s key which unlocks the frame may be obtained by a member of staff when released by a lever in Bridgnorth box.

The Engineer&#x27;s siding at Eardington is controlled by a ground frame. No intermediate token instrument is provided, with the Highley-Bridgnorth token directly unlocking the two lever frame. This means that Hampton Loade signal box must be switched out when Eardington siding has to be used, and also that a train cannot terminate or depart from there – unless the token is taken by road between Eardington and Highley or Bridgnorth signal box.

Between Bewdley North and Bewdley South the double track section through platforms 1 &amp; 2 is signalled with absolute block. The single track through platform 3 is signalled with direction lever. The line furthest from the main station buildings, known as the Rock siding, is a double-ended siding.

The single line section between Bewdley South and Kidderminster is track circuited throughout and is signalled using acceptance lever. as the preserved SVR passes through the 480 yard long Bewdley Tunnel.

Most of the signal boxes on the line bear original cast iron GWR name plates, with the sole exception being at Bridgnorth which has a replica. The SVR Kidderminster&#x27;s name plate was recovered from another signal box that formerly stood on the up end of the down platform at Kidderminster station (Network Rail). The lever frame from the same signal box was reused at Arley, which has an LNWR signal box, originally from Yorton after the original was demolished. The replica name plate at Bridgnorth is made of fibre glass, although it is not known if it was moulded from the original or even if the original still exists.

With the exception of the three request halts (Eardington, Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley&#x27;s passing loop lacks a platform and facing point locks on points to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not pass using this loop. It is used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings.
A short section of multiple track exists between Bewdley South and Bewdley North signal boxes.

Kidderminster Town station is not an original station. It was created by the SVR, based upon the original GWR station at Ross-on-Wye (1892). Various projects have been carried out by volunteers and contractors to add to the general GWR ambience. Major projects include the porte cochère to the front of the station, the ornamental crestings on the two towers and the canopy over the concourse which was completed in 2006, along with the final, east, wing of the station.

Plans for a significant redevelopment of Bridgnorth station were approved by Shropshire Council in August 2016.

===Former stations===
A list of the former stations on the Severn Valley Railway, most of which were closed with the Severn Valley line in 1963, after 101 years in use, and never preserved by the current heritage railway due to a multitude of factors, including the lifting of track.

Between Hartlebury and Bewdley:

*Stourport-on-Severn (1862–1970)
*Burlish Halt, towards the north of Stourport at Burlish Crossing (1930–1970)

Between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth:

*Foley Park Halt (1905–1970)
*Rifle Range Halt (1905–1920)
*Alveley Halt (1944-1963)

North of Bridgnorth:

==Extensions to the railway==
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}

===Northwards===
Extending the preserved railway north from Bridgnorth was mooted by groups within the SVR as early as the mid-1970s, but the first plan was dismissed as impossible by the then Board of the SVR. For many years the SVR official website confirmed that &#x27;the railway land north of Bridgnorth has been long since sold, and there is now no possibility of Severn Valley trains reaching Ironbridge and Shrewsbury ever again&#x27;. In 2002 the Board reported that third party enquiries into the possibility of EU funding to restore rail communication between Bridgnorth and Ironbridge had resulted in press reports that the SVR wished to extend to Ironbridge; the Board agreed that it would monitor developments and would welcome seeing the results of any feasibility study.

In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line between Shrewsbury and Ironbridge which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments).

In March 2021 an independent group, the Ironbridge Railway Trust (IRT), announced that they had made a bid to the government&#x27;s &#x27;Restoring Your Railway Ideas Fund&#x27; (RYR) to examine re-opening the line between Buildwas and Bridgnorth as a public railway, following the original route of the original Severn Valley branch wherever possible. The IRT application named both the Severn Valley Railway and Telford Steam Railway among the stakeholders, noting that the SVR had expressed an interest in understanding the outputs of the proposed RYR study although no discussions on operational engagement had been held, while the TSR had expressed caution about IRT&#x27;s concept and proposed a Power Station-Ironbridge tram scheme, but was willing to work together going forward. The bid was considered in the third Ideas Fund round but was not one of the successful bids.

===Westwards===
The former Tenbury Line trackbed is substantially intact as far as Newnham Bridge station before it is hemmed in by modern development. However, several underbridges are missing, including the substantial Dowles Viaduct over the river Severn, a span over the Bewdley to Bridgnorth road and a brick span at Cleobury. Added to this are the same problems relating to land ownership, realignments of roads at former bridge sites and probable lack of custom at the Newnham Bridge end.

===Eastwards===
No extension eastwards towards Wolverhampton was ever built, although several schemes were proposed. These included:
*An act of Parliament{{which|date=August 2024}} for construction of the Bridgnorth, Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Railway which received royal assent in June 1866. Money could not be raised and the powers lapsed.{{sfn|Marshall|1989|pp=114–120}} 
*The Wolverhampton and Bridgnorth Light Railway which was to be built under the terms of the Light Railways Act 1896. The route, which was planned by civil engineer WB Myers-Beswick, would have run from junctions with the GWR and LNWR at Priestfield to join the SVR south of Bridgnorth with a separate station in Bridgnorth Low Town.{{sfn|Marshall|1989|pp=114–120}} Further details{{where|date=December 2017}} show the line of the proposed railway bordered the lane between Sutton Mill and Sutton Farm, Dog Kennel and land owned by a Henry Cavendish Cavendish{{who|date=December 2017}} and Bridgnorth Rural District Council.
*The Great Western Railway Act 1905 of 11 July 1905 which granted powers for construction of a line from near Oxley viaduct via Wombourne to join the Severn Valley Line at two junctions 1 mile and 1½ miles south of Bridgnorth. These powers were again granted in the Great Western Railway (Additional Powers) Act 1924 but although the Wombourne branch was completed in 1925, the connection to Bridgnorth was abandoned.{{sfn|Marshall|1989|pp=114–120}} There is thought{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to be some evidence of such a spur from the Severn Valley Line immediately south of Crossing Cottage near Eardington.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Southwards===
The SVR owns the trackbed of the former Bewdley to Hartlebury section through Mount Pleasant Tunnel to a point 302 yards beyond its southern portal, approximately mid-way to the former location of Burlish Crossing.{{sfn|Marshall|1989|p=184}} In late 2015 the railway announced that Rail Safety Solutions had taken a lease on the portion as far as Mount Pleasant Tunnel, which they will use to provide training to Network Rail apprentices.

Between Burlish and Stourport station, the alignment of the former Bewdley to Hartlebury section has been redeveloped for housing. However, from the Hartlebury direction the trackbed is intact as a bridleway from Mitton (the eastern throat of the original station), with only a span over the A449 Worcester to Kidderminster main road missing. The abutments are intact. Almost all of the trackbed is in council ownership, and in 2007 they expressed an interest in reopening as a commuter line.

==Rolling stock==
{{main|List of rolling stock preserved on the Severn Valley Railway}}
The railway can call on a large fleet to operate its services. Only a small &#x27;core&#x27; group of vehicles actually belong to the railway company itself; the remainder are owned by an associated groups, such as the Great Western (Severn Valley Railway) Association, or individuals. The SVR is also the base of the West Midland Group, which focuses on DMU preservation. Locomotives and vehicles from the railway are now only infrequently used on excursions on the National Rail network, but in the past have operated across Great Britain.

==Maintenance facilities==
===Locomotive works===
The main locomotive works are located at Bridgnorth. For health and safety reasons it is not normally open to the public, but guided tours and open days are arranged from time to time. 
The works facilities include lifting jacks, a Noble and Lund wheel lathe, a wheel drop recovered from Leicester MPD, and a boiler shop with overhead crane. Works to improve natural illumination, waterproof the shed more effectively, and fit the southern end with roller-shutter doors were completed in early 2009, and a further upgrade completed in 2022 included the installation of an overhead crane, replacement of the roof, and a number of environmental initiatives such as conversion to LED lighting.

===Traction maintenance depot===
Diesel locomotives are maintained at the traction maintenance depot at Kidderminster. A three-road diesel depot building was opened in 2016, with facilities including a pit and an overhead crane.

===Carriage works===
Although carriage repair and restoration is carried out at a number of locations on the railway, the main carriage repair works is located in the former goods shed at Kidderminster which lies adjacent to the main Birmingham to Worcester line. As well as having a machine shop and fabrication equipment to carry out a full range of body and bogie repairs, the carriage works is also able to calibrate and adjust dynamo voltage regulators and to thoroughly overhaul and test vacuum brake equipment.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} As with the locomotive works, for health and safety reasons it is not normally open to the public.

===The Engine House===

The Engine House, built on land adjacent to Highley station, provides covered accommodation for locomotives currently out of service, as well as space for displays of other rolling stock and an education/interpretation centre.

==== Construction and opening ====
The land on which the Engine House stands was originally the sidings for Highley Colliery and was later used as the &quot;Landsale Yard&quot; for Alveley Colliery. The SVR had planned to use the area for a facility to store and display locomotives that did not hold current operational certificates as early as 1973.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=90}} After the opportunity arose to obtain matching Heritage Lottery funding alongside grants from the European Regional Development Fund and Advantage West Midlands, the land was acquired by the SVR in August 2001. Planning permission for development was granted in 2004.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=90}}

The planned opening in mid-2007 was delayed by the flood damage at Highley in June of that year (see {{section link||Major infrastructure damage—summer 2007}}). It eventually opened to the public on 20 March 2008, on the same day that full line services resumed between Bridgnorth and Kidderminster.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=93}} An official opening was held on 28 April 2009, attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, Algernon Heber-Percy. A second dedication, along with that of the newly constructed footbridge at Highley station, was performed on 21 October 2009 by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who had been unable to attend the first ceremony due to illness.{{sfn|Vanns|2017|p=94}}

==In television and film==
*The 1976 BBC television adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; short story &quot;The Signalman&quot; was filmed around the cutting on the Kidderminster side of the Bewdley Tunnel. A replica signal box was constructed in the cutting, while interior scenes were filmed in the actual signal box at Highley.
*Portions of &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; (1976) were filmed on the railway.
*Scenes between Bewdley and Hampton Loade stations were filmed for the Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Candleshoe&quot; (screened 1977), starring David Niven and Jodie Foster, were shot in 1976. GWR No. 4566 was featured in the movie.
*The 1977 television film version of &quot;Silver Blaze&quot; used the railway.
*The 1978 film version of &quot;The Thirty Nine Steps&quot; was partly filmed on the railway—specifically, the scenes where Hannay (Robert Powell) hangs from Victoria Bridge. The scene is supposed to be set in Scotland.
*The BBC TV children&#x27;s series &quot;God&#x27;s Wonderful Railway&quot; (1980) was filmed on the SVR.
*Another BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;The Box of Delights&quot; (1984) was filmed along the line; station scenes featured both Bewdley and Arley.{{cn|date=February 2025|reason=Unreliable source removed}}
*In the 2005 film, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; GWR Manor no. 7802 &quot;Bradley Manor&quot; appeared with the train that brought the Pevensies to the nearest station to the Professor&#x27;s house.
*Victoria Bridge appears briefly in the 2011 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; when Holmes pushes Dr Watson&#x27;s wife, Mary, off a train as it goes over a bridge.
*Bewdley and Kidderminster, locomotive 42968, and the rake of LNER coaches featured in sequences of &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot;, a five-part dramatisation by Stephen Poliakoff, filmed in February 2012 and aired in February 2013.
*In 2019, a portion of the Netflix original film &quot;Enola Holmes&quot; was filmed on the Severn Valley Railway.

<text>The Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway (E&amp;BASR) is a heritage railway in North Yorkshire, England, formed in 1979 and opened in 1981.

The preserved railway was part of the former Midland Railway route from Skipton to Ilkley which was closed down by British Railways in 1965 over 15 years before the reopening of part of the line.

The E&amp;BASR currently runs for a total distance of from Embsay via Draughton Sidings, Holywell and Stoneacre Loop to Bolton Abbey station and carries around 100,000 passengers a year.

The long-term objectives of the railway are extensions of the line in both directions, eastwards to the West Yorkshire village of Addingham and southwest towards the North Yorkshire market town of Skipton.

==Overview==

The rolling stock on the line consists of 20 ex-industrial locomotives, the oldest of which was built in 1908, three diesel-multiple units, and ten other diesel locomotives. The railway hold an annual gala Branchline Weekend.

Embsay railway station was built in 1888. Bolton Abbey village is named after the nearby 12th century Bolton Priory, belonging to the Dukes of Devonshire.

The route was formerly part of the Midland Railway line that connected Skipton and Ilkley via Addingham. The line was shut down by British Railways in 1965 and was left to fall in disrepair. Around 14 years after closure, a group of volunteers put forward a plan in 1979 to reopen the line as a preservation route. This plan went ahead and Embsay railway station was refurbished throughout the second half of the 1970s and reopened in 1981.

To the west of Embsay station, a run-round loop for locomotives was built near the site of the former Embsay Junction, which was disconnected when the line closed.

By 1987 further extensions brought the line to a newly constructed halt at Holywell and later to Stoneacre Loop. Bolton Abbey railway station finally reopened in 1998, bringing the current total of over 4 miles in length.

==Expansion plans==

=== Extension to Addingham and Ilkley ===

As the original line stretched from the North Yorkshire market town of Skipton to the West Yorkshire spa town of Ilkley, there was talk of extending the re-opened track to cover the original extent prior to its closure by British Railways in 1965.

Taking the line to Addingham and re-opening is often mentioned as a potential project but the line&#x27;s owners have stated that they intend to consolidate the current route instead.

An extension to Addingham would be a huge project, and would involve a near-doubling of the line&#x27;s current length. Previous extensions have been built in small sections over a long period of time, so a re-opening of the line to Addingham would be many years off.

Reports suggest Sustrans are interested in converting the route into a cycle path, but would provide formation space for a single track allowing any extension to be built.

The Addingham extension could start off as an extension to a possible halt &quot;Wharfe Riverside&quot; located near the hamlet of Bolton Bridge), before Addingham could be considered officially.

The embankment supporting Addingham railway station, goods yard and depot was removed and replaced in the 1980s with a housing development, with the bridge and abutments over the main road demolished at around the same time.

There are plans to rebuild one of the bridge abutments at the end of the surviving embankment to the north as part of the Addingham Project which also involves constructing a replica LMS style station, goods yard and depot on the extra land next to and at the edge of the embankment.

These would be over the main road from the now defunct former station and goods depot. Funds would need to be collected for 10 to 15 years before any project of this extent could be realised.

Much of the route between Addingham and Ilkley has been re-developed since abandonment. Cuttings have been filled in and Ilkley viaduct was demolished in 1973, six years before the E&amp;BASR re-opened.

The Skipton platforms at Ilkley station now form the station&#x27;s car park, and there has been significant building development in Ilkley town centre on the former trackbed. Therefore, it is unlikely that this section will be reinstated as preserving the whole line between Ilkley and Skipton was considered too expensive.

=== Connection to Skipton station ===

There is currently no link between the Heritage line and the Network Rail branch line to Swinden Quarry (the former Yorkshire Dales Railway), the points at this site having been dismantled. Re-instating this link would allow trains to serve station, and would potentially offer greater access to the railway.

The platforms at Skipton (5 &amp; 6) that served the Ilkley route were made redundant in 1965. If this link were reinstated these platforms would require a rebuild as they have been disused for a very long time.

In 1982 there were plans to extend the line to Skipton, as a special DMU service was running at the time. Because British Rail still used the section between the two stations for its operations to Swinden Quarry (this section of the old branch line to Grassington was and is still part of the rail network), plans were dropped, stating that operating as far as Skipton whilst sharing the line with the goods operation was too problematic.

Network Rail has carried out a survey for the reinstatement of the connecting points between the Heritage line at Embsay and the freight line to Rylstone, and the reinstatement of the two platforms 5 and 6 at Skipton. The cost has been estimated to be between £1.1 million and £2.6 million. If funding is made available, then the line could be extended. JMP Consulting has been commissioned to develop a business case for the project.

== Media appearances ==

The railway was also the filming location of an episode of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (also a Yorkshire Television programme). In the episode, Embsay station was made to look like the fictional Hotten station. Many of the well-known characters from the show were at the filming. The episode was filmed in December 2004.

== The route of the EBASR ==



The line runs through the countryside of the Yorkshire Dales in the county council area of North Yorkshire.

The railway has helped and supported the surrounding area (and local economy) to regenerate and provide brand new attractions, boosting both trade and tourism.

*&quot;Skipton platforms 5 &amp; 6 (proposed)&quot;. One of two long-term objectives (since 2000), the proposed northern terminus of the line to interchange with Northern train services on the nearby Airedale Line.

:Haw Bank Tunnel. The 220yd long railway tunnel, located en route between Skipton station and Embsay Junction.

:Embsay Junction. Located close to Embsay station and connects to the Rylstone line (section of the former Grassington Branch).

*Embsay. Re-opened in 1981, restored to its former LMS condition. The current terminus of the line. Facilities include booking office, waiting room, toilets and souvenir shop.
*&quot;Draughton (proposed)&quot;. In the old days of the Midland (later LMS) Railway, there were once plans to build a little halt called Draughton, at the siding, &quot;marking where it was to be built but never had&quot;.
*Holywell. Opened in 1987 to view Craven Fault.

:Stoneacre. Former run-round loop en route along the line, now used as a passing loop for use during two train operation.

*Bolton Abbey. Current terminus of the line. Facilities include booking office, waiting room, toilets, a souvenir shop and tearoom
*&quot;Addingham (proposed)&quot;. One of two long-term objectives. The original railway station and goods site have long since been demolished and redeveloped, although the trackbed between Bolton Abbey and Addingham still exists.

<text>Bolton Abbey Estate in Wharfedale, North Yorkshire, England, takes its name from a 12th-century Augustinian monastery of canons regular, now known as Bolton Priory. The priory, which was closed in the 1539 Dissolution of the Monasteries ordered by King Henry VIII, is in the Yorkshire Dales, which lies next to the village of Bolton Abbey.

The estate is open to visitors, and includes many miles of all-weather walking routes. The Embsay &amp; Bolton Abbey Steam Railway terminates at Bolton Abbey station one and a half miles/2.5 km from Bolton Priory.

==Bolton Priory==
The monastery was founded at Embsay in 1120. Led by a prior, Bolton Abbey was technically a priory, despite its name. It was founded in 1154 by the Augustinian order, on the banks of the River Wharfe. The land at Bolton, as well as other resources, were given to the order by Lady Alice de Romille of Skipton Castle in 1154. In the early 14th century Scottish raiders caused the temporary abandonment of the site and serious structural damage to the priory. The seal of the priory featured the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Child and the phrase &quot;sigillum sancte Marie de Bolton&quot;.

The nave of the abbey church was in use as a parish church from about 1170 onwards, and survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Building work was still going on at the abbey when the Dissolution of the Monasteries resulted in the termination of the priory in January 1540. The east end remains in ruins. A tower, begun in 1520, was left half-standing, and its base was later given a bell-turret and converted into an entrance porch. Most of the remaining church is in the Gothic style of architecture, but more work was done in the Victorian era, including windows by August Pugin. It still functions as a church today, holding services on Sundays and religious holidays.

Bolton Abbey churchyard contains the war grave of a Royal Flying Corps officer of the First World War. The churchyard also has the grave of cricketer Fred Trueman.

The Domesday Book lists Bolton Abbey as the caput manor of a multiple estate including 77 carucates of ploughland (around 9240 acres/3850 ha) belonging to Edwin, Earl of Mercia. The estate then comprised Bolton Abbey, Halton East, Embsay, Draughton; Skibeden, Skipton, Low Snaygill, Thorlby; Addingham, Beamsley, Holme, Gargrave; Stainton, Otterburn, Scosthrop, Malham, Anley; Coniston Cold, Hellifield and Hanlith. They were all laid waste in the Harrying of the North after the defeat of the rebellion of Edwin, Earl of Mercia and classified as the &quot;Clamores&quot; (disputed land) of Yorkshire until around 1090, when they were transferred to Robert de Romille, who moved its administrative centre to Skipton Castle. The Romille line died out around 1310, and Edward II granted the estates to Robert Clifford.

In 1748 Baroness Clifford married William Cavendish and Bolton Abbey Estate thereafter belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire, until a trust was set up by the 11th Duke of Devonshire turning it over to the Chatsworth Settlement Trustees to steward.

Today, the 33,000 acre (134 km2) estate contains six areas designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including Strid Wood, an ancient woodland (mainly oak), which contains the length of the River Wharfe known as The Strid, and a marine fossil quarry. The estate encompasses 8 miles (13 km) of river, 84 farms, 84 buildings of architectural interest, and four Grade I listed buildings; and is currently home to 27 businesses from tearooms to bookshops. The iconic stepping stones cross the River Wharfe near the Abbey ruins. The estate includes extensive grouse moors, including Barden Moor on the west side of Wharfedale and Barden Fell on the east side of the dale. There is also a pheasant shoot. Apart from people employed within these businesses, the estate employs about 120 staff to work on the upkeep of the estate. Much of the estate is open to the public. A charge is made for car parking.

The Dales Way passes through the estate on a permissive path. Barden Moor and Barden Fell, which includes the prominent crag of Simon&#x27;s Seat, are on access land, and permissive paths, including a route called the Valley of Desolation, lead up to the moors. Access to the moors may be closed to the public during the shooting season.

Bolton Abbey Hall, originally the gatehouse of the priory, was converted into a house by the Cavendish family. The hall is a Grade II* listed building.

As well as Bolton Abbey, the Cavendish family also own the Chatsworth (Derbyshire, England) and Lismore Castle (Waterford, in the Republic of Ireland) estates.

In the early nineteenth century, a cow known as the Craven Heifer was bred on the Bolton Abbey estate. Weighing 312 stones (1.98 tonnes), and measuring 11 ft 4ins in length and over 7 ft in height, she remains to this day Britain&#x27;s largest ever cow.

==The Priory Church==
The Priory Church of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert, Bolton Abbey, is an active Church of England church, serving the village and parish of Bolton Abbey, with a full calendar of liturgical events, and a full-time rector who lives in the adjacent Rectory. The current church is the surviving part of the otherwise ruined 12th-century Augustinian religious community originally known as Bolton. It is situated in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, within the Bolton Abbey estate.

== Bolton Abbey in culture ==

The views and setting of the priory&#x27;s remains have been immortalised in painting and poetry.

Most notably a painting by Edwin Landseer and several watercolours by J. M. W. Turner one of which, &quot;Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire&quot; (1809), is held at the British Museum.
The young Brontë sisters are believed to have visited the estate while Landseer was in residence.
(Researching for his painting &quot;Bolton Abbey in Olden Times&quot;, the young authors were escorted on an exclusive guided tour by an unnamed &#x27;E&#x27;.) The following year Charlotte Brontë exhibited a drawing &#x27;Bolton Abbey&#x27; alongside stars of the day at the Royal Northern Festival of Arts, Leeds. When first discovered by Jane Sellars and Christine Alexander in 1994, it was thought based on Turner&#x27;s view of 1809, but further research, and detail of a drifting heron relates the drawing more closely to Landseer&#x27;s oil-sketch of the same scene, which shows a heron drifting toward Charlotte&#x27;s reciprocal bird, as if to embrace. Landseer&#x27;s sketch was never exhibited or reproduced, it reiterates therefore that the Brontës met the influential artist in 1833. William Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;The White Doe of Rylstone&quot; was inspired by a visit to Bolton Abbey in 1807.
*In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Lady Anna&quot; (1874), an excursion is made to Wharfedale, and a dramatic incident takes place on the banks of the river that encircles the Abbey.
*Characters played by Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts picnic at Bolton Abbey in the 1963 film &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;.
*In episode 6 of the BBC series &quot;The Trip&quot;, Bolton Abbey is visited.
*A blurred photo of the Abbey is used for the cover of &quot;Faith&quot; by The Cure, an album from 1981, with the picture taken by Andy Vella.
*The 1985 music video for the Love and Rockets song &quot;If There&#x27;s A Heaven Above&quot; was filmed at Bolton Abbey.
*The BBC Television series &quot;Gunpowder&quot; (2017) used Bolton Abbey as a location.

<text>The Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway is a minimum-gauge heritage railway in Cumbria, England. The line runs from Ravenglass to Dalegarth Station near Boot in the valley of Eskdale, in the Lake District. At Ravenglass the line ends at Ravenglass railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line.


Intermediate stations and halts are at Muncaster Mill, Miteside, Murthwaite, Irton Road, The Green, Fisherground and Beckfoot. The railway is owned by a private company and supported by a preservation society. The oldest locomotive is &quot;River Irt&quot;, parts of which date from 1894, while the newest is the diesel-hydraulic &quot;Douglas Ferreira&quot;, built in 2005.

The line is known locally as &quot;La&#x27;al Ratty&quot; and its gauge predecessor as &quot;Owd Ratty&quot;.

Nearby attractions include: the Roman Bath House at Ravenglass; the Hardknott Roman Fort, known to the Romans as &quot;Mediobogdum&quot;, at the foot of Hardknott Pass; the watermills at Boot and Muncaster; and Muncaster Castle, the home of the Pennington family since 1208.

==History==

===Original railway===
The original Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway was a line opened on 24 May 1875 to transport hematite iron ore from three mines near and around the village of Boot to the Furness Railway standard gauge line at Ravenglass. There has previously been a dispute about the gauge the railway was built to. It is shown as 3 feet in records but is quoted as in some books such as the &quot;ABC of Narrow Gauge Railways&quot;. This figure was believed for many years until the present company discovered a sleeper from before the line closed, with spacings between holes made by track spikes confirming the gauge was the wider one. The confusion probably stems from the fact that the line was built under the condition that it was &quot;of a gauge not less than 2&#x27; 9&quot; &quot;.

Following requests from the residents of the Eskdale valley for a passenger service, the railway was upgraded to meet the minimum standards of the Board of Trade, and the first passenger trains ran in November 1876. It was the first public narrow-gauge railway in England. However, the cost of upgrading the line for passengers left the railway company with substantial debts which it was unable to pay off. The company was forced to declare itself bankrupt in 1877, although trains continued to run under the control of a series of receivers. Nonetheless, in 1880 a tramway was built connecting the line near Beckfoot railway station to newly opened mines across the River Esk at Gill Force. All but one of the iron ore mines closed within 10 years of the railway opening, and there was not enough traffic from other sources (local goods and passengers from the villages and farms of the valley) to sustain the railway. The railway &quot;struggled on&quot; by carrying granite from local quarries and became popular with summer tourists. The Summer 1898 Furness Railway timetable shows five weekday trains along the line with three on Sundays.

In 1905, a passenger train was derailed at Murthwaite due to a combination of a defective locomotive and defective track. By 1908 the track-work was in such poor condition, it was declared unsafe for passengers by the Board of Trade. The railway closed to passengers that year. Goods trains continued to run whilst attempts were made to raise money to rebuild the railway. These attempts failed, and the railway closed completely in April 1913.

===Conversion to 15 inch gauge===
In 1915, the abandoned railway was taken over by the model maker Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke and his business partner Robert Proctor-Mitchel. They began converting the line to the gauge that it is today. The first train operated over the regauged line on 28 August 1915, running initially to Muncaster Mill. By 1917, the entire line had been converted and trains were running along the whole length to Boot. However, the gradients on the final section of the line proved to be too steep for the smaller locos, and the railway was cut back to Beckfoot in 1918. Initially, services were operated using the Bassett-Lowke-built, 1/4 scale 4-4-2 &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;. This was later joined by another Bassett-Lowke loco, &quot;Colossus&quot; (a 4-6-2 version of &#x27;Sans Pareil&#x27;), as well as 2 locos and rolling stock from Sir Arthur Heywood&#x27;s Duffield Bank line, following Sir Arthur&#x27;s death in 1916. These were the 0-6-0 tank engine &quot;Ella&quot;, and the 0-8-0 tank engine &quot;Muriel&quot;, whose frames and running gear were later rebuilt as &quot;River Irt&quot;. Another Heywood loco, an 0-4-0 tank engine called &quot;Katie&quot;, was acquired from the Eaton Hall Railway in Cheshire, whilst another 4-6-2 tender loco, &quot;Sir Aubrey Brocklebank&quot;, was constructed for the railway, and named after the railway&#x27;s financial backer, a wealthy shipping owner who lived nearby at Irton Hall.

As well as passengers, the line transported goods and mail to and from the valley. In 1922 a granite quarry was opened at Beckfoot, and the railway was used to transport the granite between Beckfoot Quarry and a crushing plant at Murthwaite. From 1929, the track between Murthwaite and Ravenglass was converted to dual gauge, with track straddling the gauge rails. A diesel locomotive was obtained in 1929 to work this section.

===Brocklebank ownership===

In the mid-1920s, the railway was taken over by Sir Aubrey Brocklebank, who also owned the quarry at Beckfoot. Under his ownership the line went through a number of changes. By 1926, the line had been extended along the route of the former Gill Force Tramway to its present terminus at Dalegarth Station. Large sections of the line were relaid with surplus rails from World War I light railways, and the railway was realigned in several places to remove some of the steepest gradients and sharper curves.

The station at Ravenglass was rebuilt to better handle the increasing number of passengers, and new steam and diesel locomotives were purchased to work the line, including &quot;River Esk&quot; (built in 1923), whilst the older locos were withdrawn and either rebuilt (in the case of &quot;Muriel&quot; into &quot;River Irt&quot;), or used to build new locos (in the case of the first &quot;River Mite&quot;). Following Sir Aubrey&#x27;s death in 1929, control of the railway passed into the hands of his business partners, who lacked the local interest that Sir Aubrey had, and no further investment was made, other than what was needed for essential maintenance.

When World War II broke out in 1939, passenger trains were suspended for the duration of the conflict, and the steam locos were mothballed. Granite trains continued to run to support the war effort. In 1946, passenger trains began to run again using one of the diesels, with &quot;River Irt&quot; returning to service in 1947. &quot;River Esk&quot; did not return to service until the early 1950s, whilst the first &quot;River Mite&quot; had been permanently withdrawn and dismantled.

In 1949, the last of Sir Aubrey&#x27;s business partners died, and the railway was sold to the Keswick Granite Company, who wanted to gain control of the quarrying side of the business. However, due to the lack of investment since the 1920s, much of the equipment in the quarry and crushing plant was worn out and in need of replacement. Rather than make the required investment, Keswick Granite chose to close the quarry in 1953, but kept the passenger trains running in the summer months. From 1958 attempts were made to sell the line as a going concern, but the asking price was too high. Finally in 1960, Keswick Granite announced that the railway would be sold by auction in September of that year. It was also announced that if a buyer could not be found for the line as a whole, then the railway would be closed and sold off as 60 separate lots.

===Preservation===
Locals and railway enthusiasts formed Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway Preservation Society to save the line, with financial backing by Sir Wavell Wakefield, Member of Parliament (MP) for Marylebone and owner of the Ullswater Steamers, and Colin Gilbert, a stockbroker. These efforts were successful, and at the auction in September 1960, the society made the winning bid and saved the railway from closure. Control of the railway passed to a new private company, with the backing of the preservation society, an arrangement that is still in place.

When the new owners took control of the railway in 1961, the railway was in poor condition, suffering from the lack of investment since the late 1920s. There were only two steam locomotives, &quot;River Esk&quot; and &quot;River Irt&quot;, both of which were well worn and in need of overhauls. To allow for an expanded timetable, the preservation society raised funds to build a third steam locomotive. &quot;River Mite&quot; () entered service in 1967 and, although owned by the society, has been on permanent loan to the company ever since. The two existing steam locos would be rebuilt with new boilers and tenders in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1968, the death of Colin Gilbert led to the railway company becoming the property of Sir Wavell Wakefield, who by that stage had become Lord Wakefield of Kendal. In the early 1970s it became apparent that, with passengers rising, another locomotive was required. This time the company constructed the locomotive itself. &quot;Northern Rock&quot; (2-6-2) was complete in time for centenary celebrations in 1976. A further addition was made in 1980 when the company constructed the B-B diesel locomotive &quot;Lady Wakefield&quot;.

Other significant locomotives include &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;, built in 1900 as a -gauge tank locomotive before being donated to the R&amp;ER by a member and converted to -gauge, later converted again from tank to tender configuration; &quot;Synolda&quot;, (renamed &quot;Prince Charles&quot;) a twin to the original loco &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;, built in 1912, saved from Belle Vue Zoo in 1978 and now in the railway museum; &quot;Shelagh of Eskdale&quot;, a diesel built in 1969 incorporating parts of the Heywood loco &quot;Ella&quot;; &quot;Perkins&quot;, a rebuilt locomotive, which started as a quarry shunter before being rebuilt into the steam-outlined &quot;Passenger Tractor&quot; and then again in 1984 into its current guise; &quot;Douglas Ferreira&quot;, a B-B diesel loco constructed in 2005 and named after the general manager of the R&amp;ER from 1961 to 1994. The most recent addition to the loco fleet is &quot;Whillan Beck&quot;, a 4-6-2 tender loco built by Krauss in Munich in 1929, which entered service at Ravenglass in 2018.

Since the 1960s, the condition of the railway has been significantly improved and visitors have increased. Most of the work to rebuild the railway was overseen by Douglas Ferreira, who was the general manager between 1961 and 1994. Today, there are 120,000 passengers each year with up to 16 trains daily in summer. Trains run most of the year; the railway is only closed in January.

In October 1998, the railway&#x27;s engines &quot;River Mite&quot;, &quot;Northern Rock&quot;, and &quot;Cyril&quot; were taken to Germany for a period of excursions on the Dresden Park Railway, a former Pioniereisenbahn in Dresden. Whilst in Dresden, the locomotives ran with two of that lines Krauss &amp; Co. built locomotives dating from 1925. In 2016, the R&amp;ER was able to purchase a sister engine, built by Krauss &amp; Co. in 1929 for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 in Seville, Spain. Since its arrival in Cumbria, this locomotive has been named &quot;Whillan Beck&quot;.

In early 2020, the railway was forced to temporarily suspend all trains due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent UK-wide lockdown. This was the first time since the Second World War that passenger trains had been forcibly suspended for such a prolonged period. Following the relaxation of lockdown restrictions in July 2020, passenger trains resumed on 30 July.

===Gilbert&#x27;s Cutting===
After passing Spout House Farm the line reaches Gilbert&#x27;s Cutting. Until 1964, trains were forced to follow a sharp curve along a contour in order to avoid steep gradients. Using &quot;opencast gelignite&quot; to blast through the rock, the cutting was constructed to a 300-foot radius ten feet wide at rail level with steep sides exposing Eskdale pink granite on the inside curve. Its construction alleviated the sharp curve at Holling Head of 145 foot radius which caused excessive wear and tear on the locos and track. 3,000 tons of rock and earth was removed and about 700 feet of track was re-laid. By diverting the line through the new cutting the length of the line was reduced by feet making the total length 6.91 miles.

On Friday 27 March 1964, the 11:20am train from Ravenglass hauled by River Irt and driven by the managing director of the Railway Company Colin Gilbert, stopped at the Western entrance to the cutting. Mr Patrick Satow, the Chairman of the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway Preservation Society, who was travelling in the cab with Mr Gilbert and Mr Postlethwaite the landowner, cut the ribbon and formally named the cutting &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s Cutting&quot; in honour of Colin Gilbert.

==Present operations==

Today, the railway is a popular visitor attraction in the Lake District, with the majority of its annual passenger numbers coming during the summer months. The entire single journey takes 40 minutes from end-to-end. Passengers can choose between open and covered seating, with some saloon coaches being fitted with heaters for the winter months. Disabled passengers and cycles can also be conveyed by the trains. The locomotives are scale models of mainline locomotives and are air-braked at 50 psi. There are over a hundred regular volunteers that help with the running of the railways, which include guarding the trains, carriage shunting and selling tickets at the major intermediate stations along the route.

===Signalling system===
The railway uses the &quot;Radio Control Train Order&quot; signalling system. Outside Ravenglass station, the line is single track with passing loops at Miteside, Irton Road and Fisherground. Trains operate by radio communication between drivers and at Ravenglass signal box. At passing loops and the terminus station, drivers contact the controller, using &quot;RANDER&quot; reporting numbers (even numbers for up trains, and odd for down), to indicate that the train is within the loop and is clear of the preceding single track. To leave the loop, the driver contacts control to gain authorisation to enter the next single track section. No semaphore signals are used outside Ravenglass station. Points at passing loops are weighted with direction indicators, meaning that no human intervention is required and the points reset themselves automatically after the passage of a train when entering the points from a trailing direction when the points are set for the other rail line.

Elements of the operation were used by British Rail to cut costs on remote lines. What became known as Radio Electronic Token Block signalling shared features with the Ratty, such as centralised control, automatic points at loops, and on-train equipment rather than fixed equipment at remote locations.

On peak days in the summer months, two trains depart each end of the line per hour. Capacity on the railway allows for a service run at 20-minute intervals.

===Ownership===
The railway company is in common ownership with the Ullswater &#x27;Steamers&#x27;, a company that operates lake cruises on Ullswater in the north-eastern part of the Lake District. Both companies form part of the Lake District Estates group, which also owns various tourist oriented properties in the area, and is controlled by Lord Wakefield&#x27;s descendants.

==Stations on the route==

== The line in fiction ==
The Arlesdale Railway in The Railway Series by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry is based on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway. In &quot;Small Railway Engines&quot; (1967), Awdry relates part of a holiday he spent visiting the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway with the Rev. Edwin Boston; the two appear in the book as the Thin Clergyman and the Fat Clergyman, respectively. The Arlesdale Railway was also the focus point in &quot;Jock the New Engine&quot;, with an incident that was inspired by an accident that happened on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, when &quot;Perkins&quot; crashed in the back of the shed, and with cameos in other books.

The fictional railway&#x27;s locomotives are each based on Ravenglass locomotives: &quot;Bert&quot;, &quot;Rex&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot; and &quot;Jock&quot; are the steam locomotives &quot;River Irt&quot;, &quot;River Esk&quot;, &quot;River Mite&quot; and &quot;Northern Rock&quot;, while the Sudrian diesels &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Sigrid of Arlesdale&quot; and &quot;Blister&quot; 1 &amp; 2 are the Cumbrians &quot;Perkins&quot;, &quot;Shelagh of Eskdale&quot; and &quot;Cyril&quot;. The Arlesdale Railway stations are also visibly based on the Ravenglass ones: Arlesburgh is Ravenglass, Ffarquhar Road is Muncaster Mill, Marthwaite is Irton Road, Arlesdale Green is Eskdale Green and Arlesdale is Dalegarth. &quot;Bert&quot;, &quot;Rex&quot; and &quot;Mike&quot; first appeared in the Thomas &amp; Friends TV Series in the special &quot;Sodor&#x27;s Legend of the Lost Treasure&quot; and later appeared in Season 20.

The line features in &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; by Richard Adams; the canine protagonists evade the force of paratroopers searching for them by riding from Eskdale to Ravenglass on an empty train.

In the first two instalments in the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise of theme park simulation series, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, the model for the basic &quot;miniature railway&quot; ride is based on the engine &quot;No 10 Northern Rock&quot;.

<text>The Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway (KWVR) is a heritage railway in the Worth Valley, West Yorkshire, England, which runs from Keighley to Oxenhope. It connects to the National Rail network at Keighley railway station.

==History==
===Inception and building of the branch===
In 1861, John McLandsborough, a civil engineer, visited Haworth to pay tribute to Charlotte Brontë but was surprised to find that it was not served by a railway. He proposed a branch running from the Midland Railway&#x27;s station at to Oxenhope. The line would serve three small towns and 15 mills along its length.

A meeting of local gentlemen was told that the line would cost £36,000 to build (). A total of 3,134 shares worth £10 each were issued at this meeting, along with the election of directors, bankers, solicitors and engineers. J McLandsborough, the original proposer of the line (who dealt predominantly with water and sewerage engineering, but had experience of building the Otley and Ilkley Railway) was appointed acting engineer; whilst J. S. Crossley of the Midland Railway was appointed consultant engineer.

The railway was incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1862 and the first sod was cut on Shrove Tuesday, 9 February 1864 by Isaac Holden, the chairman of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway.

The railway was built as single track but with a trackbed wide enough to allow upgrading to double track for expansion. Although the work was estimated to take approximately one year, delays including buying land for the line, a cow eating the plans near Oakworth and engineering problems meant the work took nearly two years to complete. In particular the southern tunnel to Ingrow West had quicksand oozing through bore holes that required additional piles to be driven down to the bedrock to support and stabilise the tunnel. Unfortunately the work damaged the foundation to the Wesley Place Methodist Church resulting in the church receiving £1,980 from the railway company.

Tracklaying was completed in 1866, having started at each end and joined in the middle. The line was tested with a locomotive from Ilkley, which took nearly two hours to get from Keighley to Oxenhope, but just 13 minutes to get back. Before opening, violent storms struck the line in November of that year.

The opening ceremony was held on Saturday 13 April 1867. Unfortunately, the train got stuck on Keighley bank and again between Oakworth and Haworth, necessitating splitting it before carrying on with the journey. Finally, on 15 April 1867, public passenger services on the Worth Valley commenced.

===Operation===
The line was operated by the Midland Railway, who owned most of the rail network in the area, and was eventually bought by the Midland in part due to interest from the rival railway company, the Great Northern. Upon sale of the railway, the mill owners made a profit, which was unusual for many lines of that type, as (for strategic reasons) the Midland wanted to prevent the GN from taking over its territory. After becoming part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 during Grouping, ownership passed to British Railways (BR) following nationalisation in 1948.

===Rebuilding===
On 6 November 1892 the deviation line between Haworth and Oakworth through Mytholmes Tunnel was opened and the original route abandoned. The Midland had intended to double the entire route as the traffic was so heavy. However, due to national political developments, in particular a dispute on rates between the Railway Companies&#x27; Association and the Government, the railway companies were urged by the Association to cease all but essential capital expenditure. Consequently, although the Parliamentary Bill to double the track had been turned into an Act, the Midland decided not to double the whole route, but did undertake the necessary work on the section to avoid the trestle viaduct at Vale Mill. This is why that part of the line today looks so different from the rest of the route. The need for the deviation was to avoid a large wooden trestle viaduct that crossed a mill pond, as the locals believed the viaduct was unsafe, and supposedly many alighted at Oakworth and continued on foot to Haworth to avoid crossing the viaduct. The original trestle viaduct can be seen in a picture hanging in the booking hall of Oakworth station.

The need to increase capacity for the heavy traffic remained, so at the turn of the century, the Midland installed a passing loop at Oakworth and signalling at Haworth which gave virtually as much flexibility for dealing with the traffic as would have been the case had the line been doubled.

===Closure===
British Railways operated the last scheduled passenger train on Saturday 30 December 1961 and with no Sunday service the passenger service was deemed withdrawn from Monday 1 January 1962. Freight trains continued to run to Oxenhope until 18 June 1962. On 23 June 1962 the new formed Keighley and Worth Valley Railway Preservation Society chartered a special passenger train which ran from Bradford to Oxenhope and return. After this train the section between Oxenhope and Ingrow Junction was completely closed.

===Reopening===

A preservation society was formed in 1962 of rail enthusiasts and local people which bought the line from BR and reopened it on 29 June 1968 as a heritage railway. The first train to leave Keighley for Oxenhope on that date was the only train to operate anywhere on the network due to a national train strike. The line is now a major tourist attraction operated by 500+ volunteers and roughly 10 paid staff. It carries more than 100,000 passengers a year.

The KWVR is the only complete heritage railway in the UK to be preserved and operating. It has its link to the main line which is in regular use for all types of traffic, including public passenger trains and it operates the whole railway as last used by British Railways.

===Operation as a preserved line===
On 10 July 2008, the Duke of Kent visited the railway following the 40th anniversary of its reopening. While at the railway, the Duke travelled in the carriage and on the locomotive footplate of a specially prepared &quot;Royal Train&quot;, consisting of tank locomotive &quot;41241&quot;, an LMS Class 2MT, pulling a single carriage, &quot;The Old Gentleman&#x27;s Saloon&quot;, as featured in &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, which is a former North Eastern Railway directors Saloon.

===Commuter use===

On weekends, in particular Saturday mornings, local residents who live in Oxenhope, Haworth, Oakworth and Ingrow catch the early morning diesel service to Keighley, returning later on steam hauled services. During the weekday outside of the summer months, locals instead use the local bus services.

As a privately owned heritage railway, the line does not specifically serve commuters; however, a study by Ove Arup &amp; Partners funded by Metro looked at the feasibility of a daily commuter service between Oxenhope and Keighley in 2009. After the first stage of the study was released, Metro stated concerns about a lack of funding and available rolling stock, meaning that services are unlikely to run in the short to medium term.

Another study undertaken in 2011 on behalf of the Worth Valley Joint Transport Committee found that running up to four commuter trains each way in the morning and evening is feasible.

Furthermore, there are a variety of wagons used by the civil engineering department, largely at either Oakworth or Ingrow West.

== Use in film, media and television ==

The line and its stations has been used in numerous period film and television productions including the film &quot;The Railway Children&quot;.

In the 1960s (shortly before the preserved line re-opened), an ITV advertisement on chocolate cookie biscuits, featuring Ronnie Corbett, was filmed along the line and at Mytholmes Tunnel (between Oakworth and Haworth). A steam train carries (at the front end) out of the tunnel a shocked Corbett holding onto the handrail of the engine. The locomotive used was Pug 51218.

In 1970 the line was featured in the British drama film &quot;The Railway Children&quot;. The line was then one of only a few heritage railways in the UK and was the only one at the time which had a tunnel (this was one of the most important locations needed for the film). The tunnel used is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers. Locomotives that were chosen for the film included a Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0T No. 31 Hamburg, GWR 5700 0-6-0PT No. 5775, Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway 0-6-0 No. 957 &amp; GNR N2 0-6-2T No. 1744. Railway locations used in the film included Mytholmes Tunnel near Haworth, the location for the paper chase scene was also shot at Mytholmes, as well as the one in which the children wave the girls&#x27; petticoats in the air to warn the train about a landslide. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass where the children waved to the trains are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel.

In 1976, The KWVR and Haworth railway station appeared in the premiere episode of a Granada TV sitcom called &quot;Yanks Go Home&quot; (set in 1942), in which a group of US Army Air Force pilots arrive by train and alight at the station (Haworth) and are stationed in a small Northern town in Lancashire, North-West of England, during the Second World War.

In 1979, an episode of the long-running BBC sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; was filmed partly along the Worth Valley route, in which the three main characters Compo, Clegg &amp; Foggy visit and then to attempt to stop a runaway steam train having pulled the brake on purpose (and then only to drive upwards and downwards). The locomotive used was Pannier 5775 in its London Transport guise as L89.

In 1981 a scene from Alan Parker&#x27;s film, &quot;Pink Floyd - The Wall&quot; was filmed at the entrance to the Mytholmes Tunnel, and others at the line&#x27;s stations.

The railway was used in the filming of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, a 2013 BBC television drama about Birmingham criminals just after the First World War. The same year, scenes were filmed for the dramatisation of &quot;The Great Train Robbery: A Coppers Tale&quot;, with locations in West Yorkshire acting as Cheddington&#x27;s Aylesbury bound platform.

In 2014, Keighley station was featured extensively in the feature-film &#x27;Testament of Youth&#x27;, as were the interiors of some of the railway&#x27;s vintage coaches.

In 2015, the railway was used for numerous scenes in the 2016 film &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;.

The steam-hauled train seen in &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (2020 TV series) was filmed on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway line; Keighley station stands in for a Glasgow station in the first episode, and Oakworth station appears in both the first and second episodes.

According to Screen Yorkshire, other productions that filmed scenes on the railway include &quot;the new Netflix mini-series The English Game, as well as ... Testament of Youth, Brideshead Revisited ... and Agatha Christie&#x27;s 2018 The ABC Murders. In the 2019 Keira Knightley movie Official Secrets, the railway depicted Cheltenham Spa station&quot;.

In January 2022, trainspotter Francis Bourgeois was featured in the second chapter of a partnership between Gucci and The North Face. In the photographs and a promotional short film by Highsnobiety, he plays the part of a train conductor. The film, &quot;Full Steam Ahead with Francis Bourgeois,&quot; features Oakworth station on the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, and 2MT locomotive No. 78022. The film won the award for &quot;best fashion film&quot; at Berlin Fashion Film Festival 2022.

<doc id="142161" wikidata="Q969970" url="?curid=142161" title="The Railway Children">
<text>The Railway Children is a children&#x27;s book by Edith Nesbit, originally serialised in &quot;The London Magazine&quot; during 1905 and published in book form in the same year. It has been adapted for the screen several times, of which the 1970 film version is the best known.

==Setting and synopsis==

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; credits Oswald Barron, who had a deep affection for Nesbit, with having provided the plot. The setting is thought to be inspired by Edith&#x27;s walks to Grove Park nature reserve, close to where she lived on Baring Road. Grove Park station, near the reserve, now has a mural commemorating this connection. Alternatively, there is evidence that the inspiration came from Strines, a village near Marple in Greater Manchester.

The story concerns a family who move from London to &quot;The Three Chimneys&quot;, a house near a railway, after the father, who works at the Foreign Office, is imprisoned after being falsely accused of spying. The children, Roberta (nicknamed &quot;Bobbie&quot;), Peter and Phyllis, befriend an old gentleman who regularly takes the 9:15am train near their home; he is eventually able to help prove their father&#x27;s innocence and the family is reunited. Before Father is freed, the family takes care of a Russian exile, Mr. Szczepansky, who came to England looking for his family (later located) and Jim, the grandson of the Old Gentleman, who suffers a broken leg in a tunnel. 
The theme of an innocent man being falsely imprisoned for espionage and finally vindicated might have been influenced by the Dreyfus Affair, which was a prominent worldwide news item a few years before the book was written. The Russian exile, persecuted by the Tsars for writing &quot;a beautiful book about poor people and how to help them&quot; and subsequently helped by the children, was most likely an amalgam of the real-life dissidents Sergius Stepniak and Peter Kropotkin who were both friends of the author.

The book refers to the then current Russo-Japanese War and to attitudes taken by British people to the war. This dates the setting to the spring, summer and early autumn of 1905.

It also contains an early description of the trainspotting hobby in ch. 3: Yes,&#x27; said the Porter, &#x27;I knowed a young gent as used to take down the numbers of every single one he seed; in a green note-book with silver corners it was, owing to his father being very well-to-do in the wholesale stationery.&#x27; Peter felt that he could take down numbers, too, even if he was not the son of a wholesale stationer.&quot;

==Characters==
*Father: A high-ranking civil servant, very intelligent and hard-working, and a devoted husband and father. He is wrongfully imprisoned for espionage, but is eventually exonerated. 
*Mother: A talented poet and writer of children&#x27;s stories. She is devoted to her family, and she is always ready to help others in need. She is also a homely type.
*Roberta: Nicknamed &quot;Bobbie&quot;, she is the oldest and most mature of the three children, and the closest in personality to their mother. She has a lot of qualities that help people a lot.

==Adaptations==
The story has been adapted for the screen six times to date, including four television series, a feature film, and a made-for-television film.

===BBC radio dramatisations===
It was serialised in five episodes, first broadcast in 1940 as part of &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. 

In 1991 it was adapted for Radio 5 by Marcy Kahan and produced by John Taylor, starring Paul Copley, Timothy Bateson and Victoria Carling.

===BBC television series===
The story has been adapted as a television series four times by the BBC. The first of these, in 1951, was in 8 episodes of 30 minutes each. A second adaptation was then produced, which re-used some of the film from the original series but also contained new material with slight cast changes. This had 4 episodes of 60 minutes each. The supporting/background orchestral music used in these early programmes was the very lyrical second Dance from the Symphonic Dances by Edvard Grieg.

The BBC again revisited the story with an 8-episode series in 1957 and a 7-episode series in 1968. The 1968 adaptation was placed 96th in the BFI&#x27;s 100 Greatest British Television Programmes poll of 2000. It starred Jenny Agutter as Roberta and Gillian Bailey as Phyllis. Of all the BBC TV adaptations, only the 1968 version is known to be extant; the rest are lost.

===Film===

After the successful BBC dramatisation of 1968, the film rights were bought by the actor Lionel Jeffries, who wrote and directed the film, released in 1970. Jenny Agutter and Dinah Sheridan starred in the film. The music was composed, arranged and conducted by Johnny Douglas.

===2000 version===

In October 1999, ITV made a new adaptation, as a made-for-television film. This time Jenny Agutter played the role of the mother. Others in the movie include Jemima Rooper, Jack Blumenau and JJ Feild. The railway filmed was the Bluebell Railway using some of the Railway&#x27;s steam engines and rolling stock and NBR C Class &quot;Maude&quot;, from the Bo&#x27;ness and Kinneil Railway.

===Radio sequel===
In 2021 BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;The Saving of Albert Perks&quot;, a monologue by Bernard Cribbins in which the now adult Roberta returns to Oakworth with two Jewish refugee children who have escaped Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport.

===Film sequel===
2022 saw the release of &quot;The Railway Children Return&quot;, set in 1944. Jenny Agutter returns as an older Bobbie, now living in Oakworth with her daughter (played by Sheridan Smith) and her grandson, who take in a trio of children who have been evacuated. In the course of the film, Bobbie mentions that Peter is dead and buried in a nearby graveyard, and Phyllis is referenced in a manner that leaves it open if she&#x27;s dead or simply elsewhere.

===Stage versions===
In 2005 the stage musical was first presented at Sevenoaks Playhouse in Kent, UK, with a cast including Are You Being Served? star Nicholas Smith as the Old Gentleman, Paul Henry from Crossroads as Perks and West End star Susannah Fellows as Mother. Music is by Richard John and book and lyrics by Julian Woolford.

A new stage adaptation written by Mike Kenny and directed by Damian Cruden was staged in 2008 and 2009 at the National Railway Museum, York. The adaptation starred Sarah Quintrell, Colin Tarrant and Marshall Lancaster (2008 only), and featured a Stirling Single steam locomotive (GNR 4-2-2 No. 1 of 1870) which, while not actually in steam, entered the stage on the tracks originally leading into the York Goods Station, in which the &#x27;Station Hall&#x27; section of the museum is now situated. The stage was constructed inside the large tent outside the Goods Station, which is usually reserved for some of the working locomotives of the museum. The project was set up by York Theatre Royal, and involved its younger members (Youth Theatre) in the production. This adaptation then transferred for two seasons to two disused platforms at Waterloo International railway station.

A Toronto production in 2011 was staged at Roundhouse Park, home of John Street Roundhouse National Historic Site by Mirvish Productions. A temporary 1,000-seat theatre was built at the base of the CN Tower, around the railway tracks—with the audience seated on either side—and it featured the vintage British steam locomotive No. 563 of the LSWR T3 class of 1893, shipped across specially for the occasion and then used in the subsequent 2014 production at King&#x27;s Cross, London, which ran until 2017. 

The production at Waterloo won an Olivier Award for best entertainment in 2011.

The stage adaptation, produced by the National Railway Museum and York Theatre Royal, reopened in December 2014 in a new theatre behind London&#x27;s Kings Cross station and closed on 8 January 2017. As with the Toronto production, this used LSWR T3 class No. 563. No.563 was later restored for full operational use by the Swanage Railway and returned to steam there in October 2023.

==Allegations of plagiarism==
In 2011, Nesbit was accused of lifting the plot of the book from &quot;The House by the Railway&quot; written by Ada J. Graves. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that the Graves book had been published in 1896, nine years before &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, but not all sources agree on this finding. The magazine &quot;Tor.com&quot; stated that the earlier news report was incorrect, as both books had been released in the same year, 1906.

==In popular culture==
A 200-metre footpath in Grove Park, Greater London is named &quot;Railway Children Walk&quot; to commemorate Nesbit&#x27;s novel of the same name. The footpath is part of the Downham estate and connects Baring Road to Reigate Road, with a nature reserve adjoining from which the railway lines can be viewed. Baring Road joins Grove Park to Lee. A similar path is also located in Oxenhope.

In the last episode of the first season of British crime series &quot;Happy Valley&quot; (2014) a schoolteacher is reading part of the ending of &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, after which a schoolboy wants to find his father, though the latter has been warned of as being a criminal.

<doc id="142163" wikidata="Q384570" url="?curid=142163" title="Haworth">
<text>Haworth ( , , ) is a village in West Yorkshire, England, in the Pennines south-west of Keighley, 8 miles (13 km) north of Halifax, west of Bradford and east of Colne in Lancashire. The surrounding areas include Oakworth and Oxenhope. Nearby villages include Cross Roads, Stanbury and Lumbfoot.

Haworth is a tourist destination known for its association with the Brontë sisters and the preserved heritage Keighley and Worth Valley Railway.

==History==
Haworth is first mentioned as a settlement in 1209. The name may refer to a &quot;hedged enclosure&quot; or &quot;hawthorn enclosure&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Howorth&quot; on a 1771 map.

In 1850, local parish priest Patrick Brontë invited Benjamin Herschel Babbage to investigate the village&#x27;s high early mortality rate, which had led to all but one of his six children, including the writers Emily and Anne Brontë, dying by the age of 31. Babbage&#x27;s inspection uncovered deeply unsanitary conditions, including there being no sewers, excrement flowing down Haworth&#x27;s streets, waste from slaughterhouses and pigsties being held for months in fenced-in areas, overcrowded and poorly-ventilated housing, and a poorly-oxygenated and overcrowded graveyard that filtered into the village&#x27;s water supply. These conditions contributed to an average life expectancy of 25.8 years and 41.6% of the village&#x27;s residents dying before the age of 6. This report was presented to the General Board of Health and prompted work to improve conditions in the village.

==Governance==
Haworth is part of the civil parish of Haworth and Stanbury, from 1 April 1999 to 1 April 2023 it was in Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury, which is part of the Bradford metropolitan district in West Yorkshire.

Haworth was a township and chapelry in the parish of Bradford, and from 1866 it was a civil parish that was abolished on 1 April 1938. Haworth became an urban district in 1894, on 1 April 1938 the district was abolished and merged with the Municipal Borough of Keighley which it was part of until 1974.
In 1931 the parish had a population of 5911.

==Geography==
Haworth is in the Worth Valley amid the Pennines. It is north of London, west of York and west of Bradford.
==Economy==

Tourism now accounts for much of the local economy, though the River Worth flowing through the village powered large textile mills providing much employment and later the major attractions being the heritage railway and Brontë Parsonage Museum.
In Haworth, there are tea rooms, souvenir and antiquarian bookshops, restaurants, pubs and hotels, including the Black Bull, where Branwell Brontë&#x27;s decline into alcoholism and opium addiction allegedly began. Haworth is a base for exploring Brontë Country, while still being close to the major cities of Bradford and Leeds.

On 22 November 2002, Haworth was granted Fairtrade Village status. On 21 October 2005, Haworth Fairtrade officially signed an agreement to twin with Machu Picchu in Peru.

==Culture==

Haworth&#x27;s traditional events were an annual service at Haworth Spa and the rushbearing. Spa Sunday died out in the early 20th century and the rushbearing ceremony has not been held for many years. A modern event organised by the Haworth Traders&#x27; Association is &quot;Scroggling the Holly&quot;, which takes place in November. Bands and Morris men lead a procession of children in Victorian costume following the Holly Queen up the cobblestones to a crowning ceremony on the church steps. She unlocks the church gates to invite the spirit of Christmas into Haworth. Father Christmas arrives bringing glad tidings.

The first Haworth Arts Festival took place in 2000 and was repeated in 2001. It was revived in 2005 as a festival combining performing and visual arts and street performance. The festival has community involvement and uses local professional and semi-professional musicians, artists and performers and a larger name to headline each year. It has provided a stage for John Cooper Clarke and John Shuttleworth. The festival has expanded across the Worth Valley outside Haworth and is held on the first weekend in September.

Haworth Band is one of the oldest secular musical organisations in the Keighley area. Historic records indicate that there was a brass band at nearby Ponden in 1854 with a body of excellent performers. It was founded by John Heaton, who lived at Ponden. The band played at a celebration in Haworth at the conclusion of the Crimean War. &quot;Over the years the world of brass band music went from strength to strength, during which time the Haworth Band went with it.&quot;

Every year the village hosts a 1940s weekend where locals and visitors don wartime attire for a host of nostalgic events.

From 1971 to 1988, 25 and 27 Main Street housed the Haworth Pottery, where Anne Shaw produced hand-thrown domestic stoneware derived from the arts &amp; crafts tradition. She exhibited widely in the UK and USA in public and private exhibitions and received an arts association award for her ceramic sculptures. Her husband, Robert Shaw, depicted life (and prominent residents) in the village in the 1970s and 80s, in two collections of satires, &quot;The Wrath Valley Anthology&quot;, 1981, and &quot;Grindley&#x27;s Bairns&quot;, 1988, praised by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

==Community facilities==
On 13 January 2009, it was announced that a permanent library would be established in the village, replacing the mobile service which visits the village once a week. Haworth last had its own library in 1978. The library is yet to be established.

==Landmarks==
The Brontë Way leads past Lower Laithe Reservoir, Stanbury, to the Brontë waterfalls, the Brontë Bridge and the Brontë Stone Chair, in which (it is said) the sisters took turns to sit and write their first stories. It then leads out of the valley and up on the moors to Ponden Hall (reputedly &quot;Thrushcross Grange&quot; in Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;) and Top Withens, a desolate ruin which was reputedly the setting for the farmstead &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Top Withens can also be reached by a shorter walking route departing from the nearby village of Stanbury.

==Transport==
Haworth is served by Keighley Bus Company rural bus service which provides links to the main local town of Keighley and the local villages of Oxenhope, Stanbury and Oakworth. There is also a service to Hebden Bridge. Evening and Sunday services are partly paid for by Metro. Overall there are approximately three buses every hour between Haworth and Keighley, with one per hour to each of Stanbury, Oakworth, and Oxenhope (continuing to Hebden Bridge).

Central North Street Car Park Haworth, formerly Changegate Car Park, has been subject of a Channel 4 television documentary &quot;The Yorkshire Clamper&quot;, regarding their tactics.

Haworth is also served by Haworth railway station on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, a preserved heritage railway.

==Education==
Haworth Primary School on Rawdon Road is the only school in the village and takes children from age 3 to 11. Children from 12 to 18 attend secondary schools outside the village at Beckfoot Oakbank in Keighley and Parkside School in Cullingworth.

==Religious sites==

St Michael and All Angels&#x27; Church is situated on Church Street, next to the parsonage. It is part of the Church of England Deanery of Craven.

Baptists in the area met in a barn at the bottom of Brow Road in 1785. They subsequently moved to Hall Green Baptist Church at the junction of Bridgehouse Lane and Sun Street.

==Sport==
Haworth Cricket Club was established in 1887 as Haworth Wesleyan Cricket Club and were members of the English Cricket Board. They had a permanent ground north-west of the village centre, but the club was closed down in 2015. Haworth West End Cricket Club was formed in 1900 as the Haworth West Lane Baptist Cricket Club.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the village.

==Notable people==

The Brontë sisters were born in Thornton near Bradford, but wrote most of their novels while living at Haworth Parsonage when their father was the parson at the Church of St. Michael and All Angels. In the 19th century, the village and surrounding settlements were largely industrialised, which put it at odds with the popular portrayal in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which only bore resemblance to the upper moorland that Emily Brontë was accustomed to. The Parsonage is now a museum owned and maintained by the Brontë Society.

==Filmography==
Haworth and Haworth railway station have been used as settings for numerous period films and TV series, including &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (starring Jenny Agutter), &quot;Yanks&quot; (starring Richard Gere and Vanessa Redgrave), and Alan Parker&#x27;s film version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; (starring Bob Geldof). It also featured in &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot; with George Costigan; &quot;Wild Child&quot; (starring Emma Roberts), and &quot;The Souk&quot; (a high-class vintage shop) was depicted as a charity shop.

In 2016 the BBC drama &quot;To Walk Invisible&quot; was shot in and around Haworth and included a full-scale replica of the Brontë Parsonage, Old School Rooms and Haworth Church at the time of the Brontës on nearby Penistone Hill.

<text>Imperial Earth is a science fiction novel by British writer Sir Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1975 by Gollancz Books. The plot follows the protagonist, Duncan Makenzie, on a trip to Earth from his home on Titan, in large part as a diplomatic visit to the U.S. for its quincentennial in 2276, but also to have a clone of himself produced. The book was published in time for the U.S. bicentennial in 1976.

==Plot summary==

Duncan Makenzie is the latest generation of the &#x27;first family&#x27; of Titan, a colonised moon of Saturn. Originally settled by his grandfather Malcolm Makenzie in the early 23rd century, Titan&#x27;s economy has flourished based on the harvest and sale of hydrogen mined from the atmosphere, which is used to fuel the fusion engines of interplanetary spacecraft.

As the plot opens in 2276, a number of factors are combining to make a diplomatic visit to the &#x27;mother world&#x27; of Earth a necessity. Firstly, the forthcoming 500th anniversary of US Independence, which is bringing in colonists from the entire Solar System, obviously needs a suitable representative from Titan. Secondly, the Makenzie family carry a fatal damaged gene that means any normal continuation of the family line is impossible—so both Duncan and his &quot;father&quot; Colin are clones of his &quot;grandfather&quot; Malcolm. Human cloning is a mature technology but is even at this time ethically controversial. And thirdly, technological advances in spacecraft drive systems — specifically the &#x27;asymptotic drive&#x27; which improves the specific impulse and thrust by orders of magnitude — means that Titan&#x27;s whole economy is under threat as the demand for hydrogen is about to collapse.

The human aspects of the tale center mainly on the intense infatuation (largely unrequited but not unconsummated) that the two main male characters, Duncan and Karl Helmer, develop for the vividly characterized Catherine Linden Ellerman (Calindy), a visitor to Titan from Earth in their youth, and its lifelong consequences.

A number of other sub-plots suggest some sort of greater mystery, but remain unexplored. The book ends with him returning home with his new &quot;child&quot; Malcolm (who is a clone of his dead friend Karl), leaving the other plot threads dangling.

== Editions ==

The original UK hardcover edition () has the subtitle &quot;A Fantasy of Love and Discord&quot; and has 38 chapters and &quot;Acknowledgments and Notes&quot;. The later US hardcover edition adds a quote from Ernest Hemingway, has 43 chapters, drops the subtitle, and expands the Acknowledgements and Notes. The later US paperback edition also features an &quot;Additional Note&quot; about a possible biological error in the plot.

<doc id="142170" wikidata="Q1639743" url="?curid=142170" title="Man overboard rescue turn">
<text>A man overboard rescue turn (or person overboard) is a shiphandling manoeuvre usually implemented immediately upon learning of a person having gone overboard into the sea. To bring a vessel closer to the person&#x27;s location, implementations of the principles described are: the Anderson turn (or single turn), the quick turn (also known as the Q-turn or the figure eight turn), the Williamson turn, and the Scharnow turn. 

The choice of manoeuvre is dependent on several factors, including:

* Location of the casualty
* Whether the casualty is seen going overboard immediately or if their missing is delayed
* Whether the ship is using engines or using sails
* The space available for the vessel to steer
* The training of the crew involved.

Ideally, in any man overboard scenario, the casualty should be approached with the vessel downwind of the persons position, with the vessel moving upwind.

The man overboard rescue turn is often carried out as part of regular drills on merchant ships as a requirement of the SOLAS Convention.

==Anderson (single) turn==
The Anderson turn (also known as a single turn) is a manoeuvre commonly used to bring a ship or boat with engines back to a point it previously passed through, often for the purpose of recovering a casualty in the quickest time possible. 

The Anderson turn is most appropriate when the point to be reached remains clearly visible. For other situations, a Scharnow turn or a Williamson turn might be more appropriate. Both require more time to return to the target point.

An Anderson turn consists of 1.) putting the rudder hard over to the side of the casualty, 2.) deviating 250 degrees from the original course, 3.) placing the rudder amidships and maintaining speed throughout the turn, 4.) stopping the vessel when the casualty is approximately 15 degrees off the bow. 

Ideally, if dealing with a man overboard, the vessel should always be manoeuvred upwind of the person. The vessel engines should be stopped with the person well forward of the propellers to prevent injury.

==Quick turn==
For Sailing ships, the quick turn is the traditional response to a man overboard emergency on a sailboat. Despite other approaches, it is still a robust strategy and can be the best method, depending on the situation. Certainly when the crew is shorthanded, or when the vessel is in heavy weather, the quick turn method has a lot of merit because it avoids a jibe. The quick turn is essentially a figure eight. On a sailboat it consists of the following steps:

# Change course to a beam reach and hold for 15 seconds
# Head into the wind and tack, leave the jib fluttering
# Veer off until the boat is at a broad reach
# Turn upwind until the vessel is pointing at the victim; at this point the vessel should be on a close reach.
# Slacken the mainsail until the vessel comes to a stop with the victim in the lee side of the boat.

==Williamson turn==

The Williamson turn is an alternative manoeuvre used to bring a ship or boat under power back to a point it previously passed through, often for the purpose of recovering a casualty at sea. It was named for John Williamson, USNR, who used it in 1943 to recover a man who had fallen overboard. However, according to &quot;Uncommon Carriers&quot; by John McPhee, the maneuver was originally called the &quot;Butakov pipe&quot; and was used in the Russo-Japanese War as a way of keeping guns at the same distance from an enemy. It was also used by U.S. Navy nuclear submarines to clear their sonar dead zones.

The Williamson turn is the most preferred maneuver by navigating officers onboard ship as it can be used in any condition of visibility and weather. The suitability of the turn depends on the situation:

* Immediate Action Situation: Not as quick as the single turn in an immediate action situation and take the ship further away from the casualty, but it is effective.
* Delayed Action Situation: Mostly it will take the ship to the casualty
* Person Missing Situation: Recommended as it will bring the vessel to its reciprocal course.

A Williamson turn generally consists of:

# Placing the rudder full over to the side of the casualty
# Deviating 60 degrees from the original course and then shifting the rudder full over to the opposite side
# When the heading is approximately 20 degrees short of the reciprocal course, the rudder should be placed amidships and the vessel steadied up
# The engines should be stopped in the water with the person alongside, well forward of the propellers.

As Williamson turns can be used in any situation, they may be incorporated in a marine Safety Management System (SMS). The SMS may include a drill matrix, requiring that the ship&#x27;s company conduct man overboard drills and Williamson turn drills at regular intervals such as every three months.

==Scharnow turn==
The Scharnow turn is a manoeuvre used to bring a ship or boat back to a point it previously passed through and was developed by and named for Ulrich Scharnow. The primary advantage of the Scharnow turn is that after the turn has been completed, the vessel will be proceeding on a reciprocal course in its own wake.
The Scharnow turn is most appropriate when the point to be reached is significantly further astern than the vessel&#x27;s turning radius. For other situations, an Anderson turn or a Williamson turn might be more appropriate.

Generally, a Scharnow turn involves 1.) placing the rudder hard over in any direction, 2.) deviating 240 degrees from the original course and then placing the rudder hard over to the opposite, 3.) when the heading is 20 degrees from the reciprocal course, the rudder should be placed amidships and engines stopped to bring the vessel alongside the casualty.

<text>Have I Got News for You (HIGNFY) is a British television panel show, produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC, which premiered on 28 September 1990. 

The programme focuses on two teams, one usually captained by Ian Hislop and one by Paul Merton, each plus a guest panelist, answering questions on various news stories on the week prior to an episode&#x27;s broadcast. However, the programme&#x27;s format focuses more on the topical discussions on the subject of the news stories related to questions, and the satirical humour derived from these by the teams. This style of presentation had a profound impact on panel shows in British TV comedy, making it one of the genre&#x27;s key standard-bearers.

The programme aired on BBC Two for its first ten years, before moving to BBC One in 2000. While the standard episodes are broadcast on Fridays, since 2003 extended versions of each episode, initially titled Have I Got a Little Bit More News for You and later simply Have I Got a Bit More News for You, have been broadcast, originally the following Saturdays on BBC Two, later moved to Mondays on BBC One and returned to BBC Two in 2021. Repeats of older episodes are named Have I Got Old News for You or Have I Got a Bit More Old News for You. Currently, only episodes from series 65 onward are available on BBC iPlayer. 

Until 2002, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; was hosted by Angus Deayton, who was sacked following reports in national newspapers of several scandals about his private life. Since then, the programme has been hosted by a different celebrity each week; many of them add their own comedy.

The programme has gained widespread acclaim for its contribution to British television and comedy, receiving multiple awards at the British Comedy Awards including Best New Comedy Programme in 1991, Best Entertainment Series in 1992, Best Comedy Gameshow in 1999 and the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. It also received the 2016 BAFTA Television Award for Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme.

==History==
&quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; was initially conceived as a pilot for the BBC called &quot;John Lloyd&#x27;s Newsround&quot;. The BBC had commissioned Hat Trick Productions to make a television show which was like a more topical version of Hat Trick&#x27;s &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; (developed by future &quot;Mock the Week&quot; creators Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson), but it was decided that the show would follow a template more in keeping with Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. Hat Trick hired a producer with a track record in radio comedy, John Lloyd, and filmed a pilot with a title which aped long-running Children&#x27;s BBC programme &quot;John Craven&#x27;s Newsround&quot;.

After filming the pilot, John Lloyd decided not to proceed as chairman, and the job fell to comedian Angus Deayton, after try-outs with future &quot;News Quiz&quot; host Sandi Toksvig and a pre-fame Chris Evans in the main role. The team captains – Ian Hislop, editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot; and a staff writer for &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, and Paul Merton, comedian and &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; cast member – returned from the pilot.

Since its first broadcast on 28 September 1990, the BBC has commissioned two series each year, the number of episodes being divided between the Spring series, broadcast from April to June, and the Autumn series, shown from October to December. The Autumn series takes a week&#x27;s break to make room for the Children in Need special.
For the first ten years of its existence, the programme was shown on BBC Two. Hislop has been the longest-serving member of the three on the programme since its premiere. He has not missed a single episode. Merton took a break during the 11th series in 1996, saying he had become &quot;very tired&quot; of the show and thought it had become &quot;stuck in a rut&quot;. In his absence, his role was assigned to a guest team captain each episode, with Merton himself returning for one episode as a guest on Hislop&#x27;s team. Merton returned for the following series as team captain, deeming that his absence had given the programme the &quot;shot in the arm&quot; it needed and that it had been &quot;better ever since&quot;.

By 2000, the BBC made a decision to relocate its late evening news bulletin from nine o&#x27;clock to ten o&#x27;clock, after ITV moved their long-running ten o&#x27;clock bulletin to eleven o&#x27;clock. The resulting move caused a gap in its schedule that needed filling; &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; was moved to BBC One and given access to a broader audience in October that year. In 2002, Deayton was caught using illegal drugs and soliciting sex with a prostitute – a fact that he was ridiculed for on the programme, after it became headlines – putting his private life under scrutiny by news media outlets. Further scandal effectively forced the BBC to terminate Deayton&#x27;s contract with them two episodes into the programme&#x27;s 24th series.

At short notice, Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton&#x27;s departure, with a series of guest hosts appearing for the remainder of the series, including Anne Robinson, Boris Johnson, and Jeremy Clarkson. Despite an initial search for a permanent successor to Deayton, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million, leading to it becoming a permanent feature in the programme&#x27;s format in June 2003.

Between 1990 and its spring season in 2018, the programme was recorded at The London Studios, the former home of London Weekend Television; it briefly was recorded at BBC Television Centre for a 2001 Election special, the Friday after the elections were completed. From the 2018 autumn series, recording was conducted at Elstree Studios, although the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom in 2020 impacted production of series during that time. The spring series saw Hislop, Merton, and the celebrities for each episode filming episodes virtually from their own homes, against a superimposed CGI recreation of the studio. 

The 2020 autumn, 2021 spring, and 2021 autumn series were filmed at Riverside Studios in London under safety measures to prevent the spread of infection, which included socially distancing panellists and host with screens while on set. Initially audience numbers were reduced – half those attending each recording being allowed in the studio, and the other half watching the recording in the studio&#x27;s cinema – but upon the British government implementing a second lockdown, all remaining episodes in the series were recorded with a virtual audience. After the easing of restrictions filming continued to take place at Riverside Studios.

==Format==
Episodes are usually set to around 30 minutes in length and are edited from the footage taken from a longer recording session the day before an episode is broadcast. The time frame given is used to allow the programme to retain the topical elements that an episode will feature, while allowing for any potentially defamatory material to be cut by the BBC&#x27;s team of lawyers to avoid legal issues. The focus on each episode is on four panellists – the show&#x27;s two regulars, and two guests – split between two teams, answering questions related to topical items in the news that occurred within the previous week, but the format often forgoes this aspect and the scoring system in favour of the panellists&#x27; witty exchanges, jokes, and satirical discussions on the question&#x27;s relevant news item.

Each episode consists of a general format that is largely unchanged since the programme first premiered. All begin with an introduction by the host, who gives out a set of satirical, fictional comedic news stories that are often accompanied with a video clip from news programmes or general public recordings to provide the joke, followed by introductions of the episode&#x27;s guest panellists. After this, the episode focuses on four rounds that generally follow the same arrangement:

* Round 1 – dubbed the &quot;Film Round&quot; – begins after the introductions and sees each team being shown a collection of video clips – all featuring no sounds – consisting of news reports, archive footage and dramatized scenes, and must detail the news story that they have relevance to. The item in question tends to be a major news story, and avoids any notable pieces that consist of tragic events such as terrorist attacks that would be deemed offensive to use for comedic purposes. The round usually includes additional questions and sometimes a bonus round for comedic purposes. On some occasions the round has had some deviations in arrangement, such as a team being given a series of audio clips with no pictures and identifying the news item it was focused on.
* Round 2 focuses on discussions and questions on other news items. Between 1990 and 2004, the questions focused on newspaper headlines that panellists had to identify the story it was linked to. After 2004, the round focused on images that would be revealed to panellists in different manners, which they had to reveal the story about – in this arrangement, the programme frequently made use of props and graphic effects to reveal such images, with the round being labelled per the manner the picture was revealed, and include: &quot;Jigsaw of News&quot; – image revealed in jigsaw pieces; the &quot;One-Armed Bandit of News&quot; – picture revealed on slot machine reels, with the host pulling a lever to spin them; and the &quot;Strengthometer of News&quot; – host uses a mallet to hit a high striker pad, with the meter stopping at an image that is then enlarged.
* Round 3 focuses on panellists given four personalities, characters and/or objects, in which they must define the link that connects three of these, and point out the item that is the odd one out in this regard. The number of &quot;odd one outs&quot; that are given in the round vary depending on what production staff arrange, but usually consist of a single question.
* Round 4 focuses on a headline from newspapers and a guest publication, in which a choice selection of words is blanked out, and the panellists must suggest what these could be. More often than not, the panellists never give the right answer, and the round is mainly focused on what comedic line could be spun from the headline, based on what words are left visible. For example, a comedian could fill in the blank for the following – &quot;Church may be forced to sell _____&quot; – with something that would be considered highly unlikely and bizarre to read about.

After the rounds are completed, the host then gives out the scores, denoting which team is the winner. If time permits, the episode may feature a bonus round called the &quot;Caption Competition&quot;, in which panellists are given a single or two pictures to make amusing captions to. The episode always concludes with the host making an additional set of satirical, fictional comedic news stories, accompanied by a picture to provide the joke; in rare cases, a video clip is used.

A repeat with a running time of 40 minutes, titled &quot;Have I Got a Bit More News for You&quot;, is often aired on the weekend, and features additional content cut from the original episode, and can often include scenes and outtakes made during the show before the opening credits or after the ending credits.

===Participants===

The format of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; is derived from the comedy that can be generated by each guest that participates in the programme, whether as a panellist or as a host. Although the show features a variety of comedians, it has also included politicians, television personalities, actors and news media personalities, several of whom have appeared more than once. As of 16 October 2020, Alexander Armstrong had appeared most often, mainly as guest host and also as a panellist, while Andy Hamilton had appeared most often as a guest panellist.

On rare occasions, the programme has had a participant cancel or otherwise be unable to appear. Production staff try to find a replacement, but this is often challenging at short notice. For an episode in 1993, nobody could find a suitable replacement for Roy Hattersley (then an MP, having recently stepped down as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party) after he pulled out at the last minute; he had cancelled on two prior occasions. He was replaced by a tub of lard; the programme&#x27;s host compared Hattersley to the tub of lard, claiming that &quot;they possessed the same qualities and were liable to give similar performances&quot;.

Accounts vary as to how much panellists are paid to appear on the show. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Parliamentary register of interests showed him earning £1,500 for a claimed four hours&#x27; work, while Nick Clegg was paid £15,000 to host an episode.

==Episodes==
==Criticism, controversy and litigation==
Throughout its broadcast history, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; has drawn considerable criticism from guests, politicians and viewers about its content, sometimes ending in court.

* In 1994, an episode included a joke about Ian and Kevin Maxwell, who were awaiting trial. The joke purported to be about a crackdown by the BBC on references to the Maxwells, before ending on the line &quot;these two heartless, scheming bastards&quot;. The nature of the joke became the subject of a case in the High Court against the BBC and Hat Trick Productions, which found both guilty of contempt of court and fined each of them £10,000.
* In January 1998, BBC Worldwide and Hat Trick Productions successfully defended a libel case brought by Conservative MP Rupert Allason, after a book based on the autumn series, titled &quot;Have I Got 1997 for You&quot;, contained a remark about the politician being &quot;a conniving little shit&quot;.
* In November 1998, producers ridiculed a BBC edict restricting reporting about Peter Mandelson by mocking it throughout filming of an episode that was broadcast without any elements being edited out. The programme continued to ridicule, ignore and flout the reporting edict – alongside several other shows – before the BBC relaxed it two years later.
* In April 2003, three-time guest panellist Stephen Fry announced that he was boycotting the show following the sacking of Angus Deayton. Fry described Deayton&#x27;s disposal as &quot;greasy, miserable, British and pathetic&quot;.
* In November 2007, Ann Widdecombe criticised the programme for the involvement of Jimmy Carr as Hislop&#x27;s teammate, vowing not to appear again after admitting she nearly &quot;walked out&quot; because of the comedian&#x27;s risqué material during recording. 
* The following week, Will Self, a frequent guest, announced he would not return. His reasons focused on the programme becoming more &quot;like any other pseudo-panel contest, where funny fellows sit behind desks cracking jokes&quot;, criticising the BBC for cutting a joke he made despite the fact it was well-received by the audience.
* In April 2013, the programme received more than 100 complaints for an episode that involved discussions on a news article on Scottish independence. The focus of the complaints was on comments deemed to promote anti-Scottish sentiment, made by Hislop and by guest host Ray Winstone, who joked that the Scottish economy relied chiefly on exporting &quot;oil, whisky, tartan and tramps&quot; and encouraged the audience to vote for &quot;...them to bugger off&quot;.
* In April 2018, producers received backlash from several female comedians over the lack of gender equality, following comments made by Hislop and Merton during an interview for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, in regard to how production staff approached several prominent women for the role of guest host.
* In May 2019, the BBC had to postpone an episode as it featured Heidi Allen, then leader of the political party Change UK, who was standing in that month&#x27;s European elections; it was broadcast the following month.

==Home media==
The series has seen many releases on VHS and DVD, mainly consisting of straight-to-video compilations from other seasons. They were all released by Hat Trick through Video Collection International/2Entertain, under license from the BBC.
* &quot;Have I Got News for You, Volume 1&quot; (1993) was a compilation that contained clips from the first five series plus the complete 1992 election night special. It was also released on Video CD.
* &quot;Have I Got Unbroadcastable News for You&quot; (1995) consisted of a special straight-to-video episode of the series featuring guests Eddie Izzard, Richard Wilson, and a surprise appearance from Germaine Greer.
* &quot;Classic Battles &amp; Bust-Ups&quot; (1996) featured three full-length episodes featuring the Tub of Lard, Paula Yates and Germaine Greer, among others.
* &quot;Have I Got News for You: The Official Pirate Video&quot; (1997) was another special straight-to-video episode, featuring guests Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey.
* &quot;The Very Best of Have I Got News for You&quot; (2002) was a compilation release of highlights from the first 12 years of the show, from the beginning up until the episode made after Deayton hit the tabloids. The main feature is three hours long, with the DVD release also containing many extras, including, among other things, a running commentary of the main feature by Merton and Hislop. Other extra content featured includes a clip of Terry Wogan on fellow Hat Trick series &quot;Room 101&quot; nominating the programme as one of his pet hates, alongside interviews with political figures (taken from the Channel 4 Politics Awards) revealing their opinions on the series.
* &quot;Have I Got News for You: The Best of the Guest Presenters&quot; (2003) is another compilation release. The main feature included several episodes from the series, including a half-hour cut of Boris Johnson&#x27;s first guest-hosted episode. Episodes with Martin Clunes, William Hague and Bruce Forsyth as chairman were also included, as well as a compilation of clips taken from other editions from the first two series with guest hosts (with only the episode hosted by Liza Tarbuck not represented). The DVD release also included a bonus disc, &quot;The Full Boris&quot;, which showed a far longer cut of the same episode (lasting slightly under 60 minutes), alongside several other extra features, including a discussion between Paul Merton and Boris Johnson regarding Johnson&#x27;s appearance as presenter, filmed during his appearance as the celebrity guest on &quot;Room 101&quot;.
* &quot;Have I Got News for You: The Best of the Guest Presenters Vol. 2&quot; (2005) is nearer in content to the first &quot;Best of&quot; DVD compilation than its direct predecessor, consisting of four 45-minute compilations of the Autumn 2003, Spring 2004, Autumn 2004 and Spring 2005 series. The bonus disc contains an 80-minute uncut version of Boris Johnson&#x27;s second guest-hosted episode, alongside a bonus mini-feature called &quot;The A to Z of HIGNFY&quot;. On it, each letter is used to stand for a different term or name often associated with the show, each highlighted by various example clips – except for the &quot;problem letters&quot; of X, Y and Z, which just lead into a selection of random outtakes. This feature also includes some behind-the-scenes content, with Marcus Brigstocke guiding the viewer around the studio and backstage, on a recording night.

==Internet spin-offs==
During the late 1990s, the website haveigotnewsforyou.com, run in association with Freeserve, featured interactive versions of the show&#x27;s games, including the missing words round and the caption competition, offering prizes.

&quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; started broadcasting a video podcast, &quot;The Inevitable Internet Spin-off&quot;, on 13 April 2007. It was initially planned to run for six series, from series 33 to 38, taking it to the end of 2009.

From the beginning of Series 37, a new internet feature, &quot;Have I Got News for You, News... for You&quot;, was introduced. A short programme featuring typical opening and closing sequences (without the presence of a live audience) as well as other short sketches, it has so far been presented by Alexander Armstrong, and run fortnightly, bridging the gap between series 37 and 38.

On 1 October 2009, the last &quot;webisode&quot; episode was made available via both the BBC iPlayer and YouTube.

==Other shows based on the &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; format==

Shows based on the &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; format are broadcast in other countries:
* American weekly radio show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; was started in 1998 on public radio network NPR. Based in Chicago, the show follows a similar format, but with three individual panellists competing to win. They play some of the same games including fill in the missing headline, however many TV games have to be excluded due to their visual nature. Frequently the same stories are covered on both &quot;Wait Wait&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Differences include: listeners calling in to win mini games, and a celebrity interview and quiz in the middle of the show. &quot;Wait Wait&quot; is more closely related to &quot;The News Quiz&quot; which is also the inspiration for &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.
* Comedian Roy Wood, Jr. began hosting an American version of the show for CNN in September 2024. It was initially commissioned for a ten-episode run, with Amber Ruffin and Michael Ian Black as team captains. Black had previously served as a team captain for a pilot episode produced by NBC on 20 November 2009, with host Sam Seder and opposing team captain Greg Giraldo. Two other pilot versions of the show had been made in the US prior to its CNN run, commissioned by cable channels Bravo and TBS.
* Dutch comedian Raoul Heertje appeared on the original &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in May 1995. A year later he became team captain in the newly launched Dutch version of the show: &quot;Dit was het nieuws&quot; (&quot;This was the news&quot;). On 19 December 2009, the last episode was broadcast. RTL ran new episodes between May 2011 and October 2015; in December 2017, the show returned to the public broadcaster AVROTROS.
* The Finnish version called &quot;Uutisvuoto&quot; (&quot;newsleak&quot;) was broadcast for 20 years, 1998–2018 on Yle TV1, and was one of the most popular TV shows, and also the continuously longest running TV entertainment show, in Finland. In 2019, the show continued on MTV3 with its original host Peter Nyman.
* The Estonian version, called &quot;Teletaip&quot; (&quot;TV uptake&quot;), was first aired in 2000 on ETV; seven series were produced. Its two main hosts were the comedian Tarmo Leinatamm and former MEP Indrek Tarand.
* The Swedish version called &quot;Snacka om nyheter&quot; (&quot;Talk about news&quot;) was broadcast from 1995 to 2003 and 2008 to 2009.
* The Norwegian version called &quot;Nytt på nytt&quot; (&quot;The news anew&quot;) started on NRK in 1999, and is still broadcast . It also became the most popular show on Norwegian TV in 2017.

<text>The Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway (L&amp;HR) is a heritage railway in Cumbria, England.

==History==
===Furness Railway operation of the branch line===
The railway is a former branch line of the Furness Railway (FR) and was opened on 1 June 1869. The line was served by local passenger trains which started their journey at Ulverston on the FR&#x27;s main line from Carnforth to Barrow-in-Furness. 

The FR branch trains travelled east to the triangular junction at Plumpton, then turned north via Greenodd and on to stations at Haverthwaite, Newby Bridge halt and Lakeside. The FR&#x27;s weekdays passenger service in July 1922 comprised eight trains in each direction. There were advertised train-to-boat connections that were established in 1869. During the summer season, excursion trains from Lancashire and elsewhere used the east-to-north side of Plumpton Junction to reach Lakeside, where their passengers joined the boat sailings on the lake.

===Closure of the branch and reopening by L&amp;HR===
British Railways closed the line to passengers on 6 September 1965, and to all traffic two years later.

A group of enthusiasts, chaired by Dr Peter Beet, formed the Lakeside Railway Estates Company; they had the idea of preserving both the line and the former LMS 10A locomotive shed at Carnforth, to provide a complete steam operating system. However, although backed by then transport minister Barbara Castle, the need to build a number of motorway bridges and rerouting of the A590 road from Haverthwaite via Greenodd to Plumpton Junction, meant that the complete vision was unsuccessful. Beet acquired 10A in partnership with Sir William McAlpine, 6th Baronet, which became the visitor attraction Steamtown from 1967. The venture folded as a public access visitor attraction in 1997, but the preserved site was taken over by businessman David Smith to become the base for his West Coast Railway Company.

As a result, Austin Maher became chairman of the LREC, which then reopened the truncated L&amp;HR as a heritage railway on 2 May 1973. Maher and fellow L&amp;HR director Jim Morris each bought one LMS 2-6-4T Class 4MT, nos. 42073 (Maher) and 42085 (Morris), which were restored eventually as L&amp;HR nos. 3 and 4, became the line&#x27;s core steam power units.

==Location==
The L&amp;HR runs from Haverthwaite, at the southern end of the line, via Newby Bridge to Lakeside at the southern end of Windermere. Some services are timed to connect with sailings of the diesel excursion vessels or steam vessels on Windermere, sailing from Lakeside to Bowness and Ambleside.

==In fiction==
In Christopher Awdry&#x27;s book &quot;Thomas &amp; Victoria&quot;, the Lakeside &amp; Haverthwaite Railway is featured as part of the railway route where Victoria worked along both Helena and Albert before coming to Sodor. In the Thomas the Tank Engine TV series, the railway was filmed for a series of short educational segments entitled &quot;Down at the Station&quot;.

In the adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel, &quot;Dumb Witness&quot;, by ITV for its television series, Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot, the opening scene was filmed at the Lakeside &amp; Haverthwaite Railway, at the Lakeside terminus.

The railway and Haverthwaite station are featured in the video to &quot;Never Went to Church&quot; by alternative hip hop band The Streets.

<text>The North Yorkshire Moors Railway (NYMR) is a heritage railway in North Yorkshire, England, that runs through the North York Moors National Park. First opened in 1836 as the Whitby and Pickering Railway, the railway was planned in 1831 by George Stephenson as a means of opening up trade routes inland from the then important seaport of Whitby. The line between and was closed in 1965 and the section between Grosmont and was reopened in 1973 by the North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd. The preserved line is now a tourist attraction and has been awarded several industry accolades.

In 2007, the railway started to run regular services over the section of the Esk Valley Line north of Grosmont to . In 2014, a second platform was opened at Whitby which allowed the NYMR to run an enhanced service and led to passenger numbers in the same year of nearly 350,000 people.

, the railway runs for . It is owned and operated by a charitable trust, with 100 staff who work full time, 50 seasonal staff, and over 550 volunteers. The complement includes 30 engineers. As of 2020, the &quot;NYMR is the UK’s most popular heritage railway&quot; according to a news report.

==Overview==
The NYMR carries more passengers than any other heritage railway in the UK and may be the busiest steam heritage line in the world, carrying 355,000 passengers in 2010. The railway is the third-longest standard gauge heritage line in the United Kingdom, after the West Somerset Railway () and the Wensleydale Railway (), and runs across the North York Moors from Pickering via Levisham, Newton Dale, Goathland and terminating at Grosmont.

Some heritage rail operations continue along the Network Rail tracks to Whitby. The railway is formed from the middle section of the former Whitby, Pickering and Malton Line, which was closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts.

The NYMR is owned by the North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd, a charitable trust and accredited museum, and is operated by its wholly owned subsidiary North Yorkshire Moors Railway Enterprises plc. It is mostly operated and staffed by volunteers.

During most years, the trains run daily from the beginning of April to the end of October, and on weekends and selected holidays during the winter, with no service from 24 to 27 December. Services are mostly steam-hauled; however, heritage diesel power is sometimes used. At the height of the running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. As well as the normal passenger running, there are dining services on some evenings and weekends. The extension of steam operated services to the seaside town of Whitby has proved popular.

==History==

The North Yorkshire Moors Railway was first opened in 1836 as the Whitby and Pickering Railway. The railway was planned in 1831 by George Stephenson as a means of opening up trade routes inland from the then important seaport of Whitby. The initial railway was designed and built to be used by horse-drawn carriages. Construction was carried out by navvies and coordinated by top engineers. Their three main achievements were cutting a tunnel through rock at Grosmont, constructing a rope-worked incline system at Beck Hole and traversing the marshy and deep Fen Bog using a bed of timber and sheep fleeces. The tunnel is believed to be one of the oldest railway tunnels in England.

In its first year of operation, the railway carried of stone from Grosmont to Whitby, as well as 6,000 passengers, who paid a fare of 1 shilling to sit on the roof of a coach, or 1 shilling and 3 pence to sit inside. It took two and a half hours to travel from Whitby to Pickering.

In 1845, the railway was acquired by the York and North Midland Railway who re-engineered the line to allow the use of steam locomotives. They also constructed the permanent stations and other structures along the line which still remain today. The Beck Hole incline was re-equipped with a steam powered stationary engine and iron rope. They also added the line south from Pickering so that the line had a connection to York and beyond.

In 1854 the York and North Midland Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway. Steam locomotives could not operate on the Beck Hole incline; so in the early 1860s the North Eastern Railway started construction of an alternative route which opened in 1865 – this is the route which is still in use today. The original route is now a rail trail named the &quot;Rail Trail&quot;.

In 1923 the North Eastern Railway was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway as a result of the Railways Act 1921. In 1948 nationalisation meant that British Railways took control. During this time, little changed on the line. However, in his controversial report Dr Beeching declared that the Whitby-Pickering line was uneconomic and listed it for closure; the last passenger service ran on 6 March 1965 with freight continuing until July 1966. The line was used in June 1965 to house the Royal Train for the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s visit to the RAF Fylingdales early warning station.

In 1967, the NYMR Preservation Society was formed, and negotiations began for the purchase of the line. After running various open weekends and steam galas during the early 1970s (by permission of British Railways) the NYMRPS transformed itself into a charitable trust to ensure the future of the railway, and became The North York Moors Historical Railway Trust Ltd in 1972. Purchase of the line was completed and the necessary Light Railway Order obtained, giving powers to operate the railway. The railway was able to reopen for running in 1973 as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, with much of the traction provided by the North Eastern Locomotive Preservation Group.

Services to Whitby were also mooted as a possibility; one of the first was in 1987 when &quot;92220 Evening Star&quot; worked a service between Pickering and Whitby. Since then, services ran sporadically with third party operators (such as the West Coast Railway Company in the early 2000s) as the NYMR was not a licensed company authorised to operate over Network Rail metals. From 2007, regular trains operated over the Esk Valley Line from Grosmont to Whitby, thus providing a service over the entire length of the original Whitby and Pickering Railway. Services were further improved in 2014 by the re-opening of a second platform at Whitby to enable services to increase from three out and back workings a day to five. After a year of operation, the NMYR stated that 120,000 people had travelled over the new operating section to Whitby and that overall in 2014, the railway had attracted nearly 350,000 visitors.

The preserved line is now a tourist attraction and has been awarded several tourist industry and heritage accolades.

In 2017, the NYMR received one half of a planned £9.2 million grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The balance was paid in May 2019 and was to be used towards the renewal of iron bridges at railway station and a new carriage shed at . A report in February 2021 said that the railway had received a £1.9 million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

The restrictions and lockdowns necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and into 2021, required the railway to cease operations for months. A crisis appeal was successful in raising over £400,000 in donations by September; that had increased to £440,000 by January 2021. The 2020 season was postponed by four months and events were cancelled due to the pandemic. The railway has received £295,000 in support funding from the Culture Recovery Fund.

A new carriage stabling facility was opened in September 2021, with space for 40 carriages.

On 12 June 2023, King Charles III arrived at the Pickering station on the British Royal Train, pulled by the LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman locomotive, &quot;after a trip through the countryside on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway&quot;, according to a news report. 
The visit marked the 100th anniversary of the locomotive and the 50th anniversary of the current version of the railway being operated by volunteers. The driver of the Flying Scotsman made this comment at the time: &quot;He&#x27;s a regular because he has been here before when he opened the station in 2000&quot;.

==Stations==
 
 
 
 
*Pickering is the southern terminus of the railway and serves the market town of that name. The station has been restored to its 1937 condition with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Original fixtures and fittings have been installed in the booking office and parcels office, as well as in the tea room. A park-and-ride service is provided to keep traffic out of the town during busy periods. The station is home to the railway&#x27;s carriage workshops, and there is also a turntable. Originally Pickering station had an overall roof designed by the architect G. T. Andrews. This roof was removed by British Railways in 1952 due to corrosion. A replacement roof was fitted to the station between January and April 2011, as part of the NYMR&#x27;s Train of Thought project. Other work includes a learning centre and a visitor centre behind the down platform. Originally, the line continued south of Pickering to join the Malton to Scarborough Line at Rillington Junction but this track has since been lifted with the last trip to Malton running on 1 July 1966, the day the freight services were withdrawn.
*Farwath railway station (or Farworth) was a small railway halt located between Pickering and Levisham; however, the halt was subsequently closed and demolished. Railway-built cottages still exist in this location. There is some doubt as to whether or not there were actually any station buildings here. There was a signal box, which closed when the line was singled between Levisham and Pickering in the First World War. Additionally, there was a public delivery siding, but mapping from 1913 does not list Farworth as being a station, though it does show a gravel siding.
*Levisham is a small countryside station set in the Newton Dale valley. The location of the station is notable, as it is nearly from the village which it serves, and whose name it takes. The area is used for walking and a variety of wildlife and flowers can be found within a short distance of the station. Levisham Station has been renovated and preserved to represent a small NER country station, . The station has a traditional camping coach, which is let for holidays. Since 2007, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway&#x27;s artist in residence, Christopher Ware, has used a studio at the station.
*Newton Dale Halt is a remote walkers&#x27; request stop in Cropton Forest. There are forest walks of varying lengths.

*Goathland is almost unchanged since its construction in 1865. The station has been restored to represent an NER country station post-First World War, . The station is popular with tourists due to its appearances in Yorkshire TV&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and the first of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films (see below). The station has a newly refurbished tea room which is inside a goods warehouse. The station also has a traditional camping coach, which is let for holidays.
*Grosmont was the railway&#x27;s permanent northern terminus until 2007, when trains began operating into Whitby on a regular basis. The locomotive sheds are situated here, just south of the tunnel through which trains run en route to Goathland and beyond. The station itself has been restored to the British Railways style . It has full facilities including a shop, café serving cooked meals, toilets including disabled, a ticket office and a waiting room. The shed area has facilities to provide water and coal for the engines, as well as stabling. The running shed is usually open to public access at one end, where stationary engines can be viewed. These are usually either operational but not in service that day, or undergoing light repair work. Also open to the public is the deviation shed which houses locomotives and stock owned by NELPG as well as a small display about the history of the organisation. A number of other sheds not available for public access are used for the maintenance and overhaul of the engines. At Grosmont, the line connects with the Network Rail operated Esk Valley Line, where passengers may change trains to travel to the coast at Whitby, or inland to Middlesbrough and the rest of the national network. Thus, platform one of the station is served by Northern Rail services, whilst platforms two, three and four are used by the NYMR.
*Whitby is, on many operating days, the railway&#x27;s northern terminus. All but two of the various timetables see steam trains operating through from Pickering, including daily throughout July and August except on Sundays. When NYMR trains terminate at Grosmont rather than Whitby at off-peak times, connecting trains with Northern Rail are usually available at Grosmont, allowing passengers to begin their journey at Whitby and board a steam-hauled train at Grosmont through to Goathland or Pickering. Facilities available at Whitby station include ticket office and shop. National Rail tickets and Railcards are also available to purchase. In August 2014 a second platform was opened at the station to cater for the NYMR&#x27;s trains.

==Locomotives==
==Future and possibility of expansion==
The possibility of reopening the missing section between Malton via Rillington Junction (on the York – Malton – Scarborough Line) and Pickering has often been discussed. It is included in a list of rail lines, where campaigns exist for reopening, issued by the Campaign for Better Transport.

This might allow the running of steam services from York to Whitby again. To achieve this would require considerable engineering work, as the former trackbed has been built upon with houses and a supermarket.

Reinstating this missing rail link was adopted as a policy objective by the North Yorkshire County Council some years ago; the NYMHRT board agreed to support this policy in principle, whilst having reservations about its implementation as they believed the necessary upgrade works were costly and that it would harm their business stating that they had concerns about &quot;the effect on the railway&quot;.

Hopes for this have been dampened as of October 2014 with reports that the managing director of the NYMR stating that they did not support any trains running along their tracks.

===Bridge and wheels appeal===
In March 2009, the railway announced that bridge 30 over the Eller Beck at Darnholme near Goathland needed to be repaired/replaced over the winter of 2009/2010, otherwise the railway would be forced to close. The railway therefore launched an appeal to raise £1 million to cover the costs of the bridge work with any excess raised going towards the restoration of locomotive 80135. £610,000 was raised in time, and the bridge was replaced over the winter-Christmas/new year period of 2009/2010, with the first trains crossing over the new bridge in March 2010. The bridge was formally opened by Pete Waterman on 27 March 2010.

===Yorkshire&#x27;s &#x27;magnificent journey&#x27; appeal===
During 2017, the NYMR announced it was applying to the Heritage Lottery Fund, as part of a new appeal to keep the whole preserved railway running for the next 50 years. The bid attracted £4.4 million in HLF funding and the appeal also donations from other funding streams such as the Rural Payments Agency, which donated £1.97 million.

The aim of this appeal includes a series of individual projects such as,

# The renewal and repair of a total of three bridges around Goathland.
# Provide fuss free access for accommodation aboard every passenger train.
# The construction of a carriage shed (accommodating up to 40 carriages) at Pickering.
# A dedicated education carriage at Goathland.
# The creation of a new volunteer hostel at Grosmont.
# A volunteering development programme, recruiting new generations of volunteers in the foreseeable future.
# Railway apprenticeship schemes, with offers of training in engineering.
# A lineside conservation initiative, raising the awareness of conservation issues.

In early 2021, the project benefitted from £296,000 from the Culture Recovery Fund.

As of 11 January 2020, bridge 27 at Goathland was removed; work to replace it was underway in March 2020. Bridges 24 &amp; 25 were scheduled for replacement in early 2022.

==Special events==
The NYMR runs several special events through the year, usually revolving around a particular theme.

* Steam galas are weekend events, sometimes extended to Friday and/or Monday. On these days, a full timetabled service is run alongside extra trains, such as local shuttle services and demonstration freight trains. The LNER gala in April 2008 featured all three of the UK&#x27;s operational Gresley A4 Pacifics, and attracted thousands of visitors.

* Santa Special trains are run in the Christmas period, complete with elves, Santa&#x27;s grotto, presents and mince pies. The winter scenery of the North York Moors National Park adds to the charm of these events.

==Television and film appearances==
The railway has been seen both on television and in film. Michael Palin hosted and produced an episode of the first series of &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot;, titled &quot;Confessions of a Train Spotter&quot;. Filmed during late July/early August 1980, it featured a 15-minute segment filmed as he travelled the entire railway and visited the repair shops. Goathland station has been used as Hogsmeade in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, the 2016 &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; film and Aidensfield in the sixties drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. Pickering station was used in the films &quot;Possession&quot;, &quot;Keeping Mum&quot; and &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. Other appearances include &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, &quot;The Royal&quot;, &quot;Poirot&quot;, the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series, and the films &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;, &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; and &quot;The Runaways&quot;.

The railway has also featured in the documentary &quot;Yorkshire Steam&quot;, which ran for two series on local television; in the second series of &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot;; and in the Channel 5 documentary &quot;The Yorkshire Steam Railway: All Aboard&quot;, with series three being aired during February and March 2020. Goathland station features in the 1985 music video for Simply Red&#x27;s &quot;Holding Back the Years&quot;, along with BR Standard Class 4MT Tank No. 80135. The railway has also appeared in a series of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; learning segments, with LNER Class A4 &quot;60007 Sir Nigel Gresley&quot;.

The production of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; film used Pickering station on the railway in its opening scene; the train is shown travelling through several communities.

In April 2021, scenes for the film &quot;&quot;, were filmed on the railway, at Levisham. Filming for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny also took place on a section of the railway, in June 2021, in the village of Grosmont.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 21 May 2012, a steam locomotive pushing carriages was accidentally started in the wrong direction at Grosmont and killed a volunteer guard, Bob Lund, who was uncoupling carriages.
*On 21 September 2021, Class 20 diesel locomotive 20189 collided with a rake of carriages at Grosmont. Five passengers were injured. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigation revealed that the NYMR could not prove that the traction inspector in charge of the locomotive at the time of the accident was qualified to drive that class of locomotive. Consequently, the Office of Rail and Road issued the NYMR with an improvement notice.

<text>The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway (RH&amp;DR) is a gauge light railway in Kent, England, operating steam and internal combustion locomotives. The line runs from the Cinque Port of Hythe via Dymchurch, St. Mary&#x27;s Bay, New Romney and Romney Sands to Dungeness, close to the Dungeness nuclear power stations and Dungeness Lighthouse. The line is double track north of New Romney and single track south.

==History==
===Planning===
The railway was the dream of millionaire racing drivers Captain John Edwards Presgrave (&quot;Jack&quot;) Howey and Count Louis Zborowski. The latter had constructed a railway at Higham Park, his home at Bridge, Kent, and agreed to donate the rolling stock and infrastructure to the project. However, he was killed in a motor racing accident at the Monza Grand Prix on 19 October 1924 before the Romney Marsh site was chosen, and Howey continued the project alone.

After Howey had unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway and extend it, he investigated a greenfield site between Burnham-on-Sea and Weston-super-Mare in Somerset and offered to buy the Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway in Sussex, Henry Greenly drew Howey&#x27;s attention to the potential for a 15-inch gauge line between New Romney and Hythe. Howey first visited New Romney on 8 September 1925 and decided there and then that it was an ideal location for his proposed railway.

The railway would cross public highways, and would need to acquire land from a number of different owners. Thus a Light Railway Order under the Light Railways Act 1896 was necessary and was applied for in November 1925. A Public Inquiry was held by the Light Railway Commissioners in the Assembly Rooms at New Romney on 15 and 16 January 1926. The Minister of Transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 February 1926 and The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway Order 1926 was made on 26 May. This incorporated the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway Company as a statutory public utility undertaking, gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required (which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed route).

During construction, the Duke of York (later King George VI) visited the railway on 5 August 1926 and drove &quot;Northern Chief&quot;, hauling a train with about 100 passengers from Jesson Halt to New Romney and back.

===Opening===
The railway was opened on 16 July 1927 by Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp. The locomotives were designed by Henry Greenly who was commissioned by Howey to work on the construction of the entire railway and became the railway&#x27;s first chief engineer until his abrupt resignation in March 1929. Mountain Class &quot;Hercules&quot; hauled the inaugural train from Hythe to New Romney, with guests including the mayors of the two towns and General Sir Ivor Maxse.

Howey was not satisfied with just of track from Hythe to New Romney and plans were in hand for an extension even before the original section had opened. The line was to be extended from New Romney to Dungeness, double-tracked throughout apart from a balloon loop on which the station at Dungeness was sited. A Light Railway Order for this extension was applied for and, following a Public Inquiry on 18 April 1928, the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway (Extension) Order was granted on 12 July 1928. Ahead of this the line between New Romney and The Pilot had actually opened on 24 May 1928 and the rest of the line through to Dungeness opened on 3 August 1928. Since it was laid directly onto the shingle forming the Dungeness peninsula it has been suggested that the extension was the most cheaply constructed railway in the world.

===Second World War===
In 1940 the railway was taken over by the military during World War II, and a miniature armoured train was used on the line. It was also used by the Department of Petroleum Warfare in the construction of PLUTO (&quot;Pipe Line Under The Ocean&quot;) intended to supply fuel to the Allied forces after the D-Day Normandy landings. During the latter stages of the construction of PLUTO considerable damage was caused to the track on the extension when, to speed up the work, lengths of pipe were dragged along the trackbed by bulldozers, resulting in its reduction to a single track after the war.

===Post war===
The line re-opened between Hythe and New Romney in 1946, the New Romney to Dungeness section following with a formal opening by Laurel and Hardy on 21 March 1947. Regular services started on 29 March 1947.

In June 1947 the Duke of Westminster&#x27;s railway from Eaton Hall, Cheshire was transported by the Great Western Railway and Southern Railway from Balderton, Cheshire to New Romney in Kent. It comprised an engine, nine coaches and trucks, and track totalling 222 tons.

In 1949, Captain Howey bought the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s private train including engine Dunrobin and coach for the museum at New Romney. It was transported there in 1950 and displayed until sold in 1963.

From 7 September 1977 until 24 July 2015, the railway provided school trains to transport children to and from the Marsh Academy in New Romney. The service was finally withdrawn due to falling usage.

The railway&#x27;s role as part of the local public transport network was extended when Warren Halt re-opened in 2009, providing a link to the Romney Marsh Visitor Centre. Further discussions with local councils took place regarding the possible expansion of Burmarsh Road and the provision of a new station at the gravel pits in West Hythe, in connection with both the proposed extensive new housing construction and the need to provide alternative transport to the A259 coast road.

The railway, which carries over 150,000 passengers each year, celebrated its 95th birthday in 2022 with a 2-day steam and diesel gala.

===Smallest public railway in the world===
From 1926 to 1978, the RH&amp;DR held the title of the &quot;Smallest public railway in the world&quot; (in terms of track gauge). The title was lost to the gauge Réseau Guerlédan in France in 1978 and regained in 1979 when that line closed. It was lost again in 1982 when the gauge Wells and Walsingham Light Railway opened.

The railway has featured in several television and radio shows including an episode of the BBC series &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; in 2006, Harry Secombe&#x27;s &quot;Highway&quot; on 8 September 1991, Michael Bentine&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot; in 1964, BBC&#x27;s Multicoloured Swapshop (filmed on 20 February 1978) and children&#x27;s show &quot;Rainbow&quot;.

===The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway Association===

Formed in 1967 as a supporters association, and regarded with some suspicion by the railway&#x27;s management of the time, the association has become a significant contributor to the railway&#x27;s continuance and refurbishment. It is now the largest single shareholder in the railway and its members provide a significant input of voluntary labour on both operating and maintenance work. It became a registered charity on 23 January 2009. At 31 December 2015 its membership stood at 3,355.

==Stations==

===Stations currently open===

Stations in full or limited use:
* Hythe
* Burmarsh Road (usually special services only)
* Dymchurch
* St Mary&#x27;s Bay
* Warren Halt (usually visitor centre shuttle trains only)
* New Romney
* Romney Sands
* Dungeness

===Stations closed===
Those shown as &#x27;halt&#x27; never had a higher status; all stations below became halts prior to their closure.
* Prince of Wales Halt (closed 1928)
* Botolph&#x27;s Bridge Halt (closed 1939)
* Golden Sands Halt (closed 1990s)
* Greatstone (closed 1983)
* War Department Halt (closed 1945)
* Lade (closed 1983)
* The Pilot Inn (closed 1983)
* Britannia Points Halt (closed 1930)

===Stations proposed===
Stations which never existed but were at one time proposed by the directors or are currently under consideration:
*Hythe (Red Lion Square): Was first mentioned at the January 1928 meeting of Hythe Chamber of Commerce by Charles Duruz, a local nurseryman, who had contacted the railway company and who indicated they were quite willing to build this extension. Nothing came of the proposal however. In 1946 the possibility of extending the railway to Red Lion Square, Hythe was investigated again, but the East Kent Road Car Co Ltd agreed to extend their bus service from Folkestone to terminate at the original Hythe station and the extension idea was dropped.
* Sandling Junction: Suggested by objectors to the railway&#x27;s original Light Railway Order in 1926 as more useful than a terminus on the outskirts of Hythe, but demonstrated by Greenly to be impracticable because of the difference in levels between Hythe and Sandling which would have necessitated severe gradients. The idea was revived in the late 1980s to connect with the main line at Sandling but again came to nothing, although detailed survey work had been undertaken.
* Sandling Park: A proposal was made for a station to serve this estate at Pedlinge on the abortive 1980s Sandling extension.
* Nickolls Quarry: A proposal for a station to serve a new housing development at the West Hythe site of Nickolls Quarry has been formally included in a planning application to Folkestone and Hythe District Council.

==Way and works==
===Permanent way===
The line was originally laid using second-hand First World War surplus rail. Most was material rolled in the US, the rest was rolled in Belgium when the country was under German occupation. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the railway managed to obtain supplies of good second-hand rail on the closure of the Sierra Leone Government Railway; these are the oldest rails on the line, some of which date from the 1890s.

During the mid-1980s the company began obtaining brand new 25 lb/yd rail from Luxembourg before switching to 30 lb/yd material produced British Steel Track Products in Scunthorpe and later obtained further supplies of the same from South Africa. The present standard rail for relaying work is obtained from a manufacturer in Spain.

The original sleepers were creosoted Baltic fir spaced at centres. These have now been entirely replaced by second-hand standard gauge sleepers cut into thirds, creosoted douglas fir, or jarrah and karri (Australian hardwoods from the eucalyptus family).

The railway has a permanent way team, with a full-time staff of platelayers. It forms part of the larger Engineering Department. Some platelayers work all year round, whilst others are diverted to other seasonal employment within the engineering department, for example as summer drivers, when more drivers are required than during the out of season periods. Additionally, the permanent way team is strengthened on many days of the year, especially in the winter months, by volunteer workers.

===Way and works data===
The longest underline bridge is Collins Bridge, with a span of approximately . The summit of the line is above Ordnance Datum, located between Hull Road and Taylor Road, Lydd-on–Sea. The ruling gradient is 1 in 75 at the Dungeness end of New Romney Station rising from the Littlestone Road Tunnels. The tightest curve measures radius and is at the Hythe end of &#x27;The Deviation&#x27;, a dogleg section of track at Pennypot on the outskirts of Hythe.

The ruling gradient and tightest curve are the results of post-1972 reconstruction work. Pre-1990 references to these give out-of-date figures. Statements in a number of books claiming the summit of the line is at Star Dyke (a point approximately midway between Burmarsh Road level crossing and Willop Sewer) are only partly correct; whilst it is the highest point between Hythe and New Romney it is not the highest on the entire line.

==Signalling==

===Signal boxes===
There were originally six signal boxes on the first section of the line to open (Hythe to New Romney). All were equipped with Greenly designed fully interlocked lever frames constructed by Jackson Rigby Ltd at New Romney. These were:

Hythe - 16 levers controlling points and signals within the station area. Now the only original Jackson Rigby lever frame in existence.

Palmarsh - although this building is known to have existed there is doubt about whether the 8 lever Jackson Rigby frame it contained was ever fully connected up. The frame was later transferred to Greatstone (see below). The box itself had vanished by the late-1940s.

Burmarsh Road - 2 levers located in the booking office and controlling signals. The station building had vanished by the mid-1950s.

Dymchurch - confusion surrounds the number of levers in this box, with different sources quoting 10, 12 and 16. The box had vanished by 1963 and signalling is controlled here today by a push button electronic panel in the booking office and a 2 lever ground frame released by an Annett&#x27;s key normally held in the signal panel.

Holiday Camp – this building is known to have been erected on land owned by Allnatt Ltd since it is marked on the plans accompanying a combined conveyance/lease concluded by the railway with that company and is shown as measuring . Some rather poor quality photographic evidence of the existence of this box also exists. There is uncertainty as to whether it was ever brought into use though and if so how many levers it contained.

New Romney – 17 levers controlling points and signals within the station area. The lever frame was enlarged to the present 24 levers when the line was extended to Dungeness in 1928.

The extension to Dungeness led to the enlargement of the lever frame at New Romney (as mentioned above) and also the opening of two new signal boxes:

Greatstone - the 8 lever frame originally at Palmarsh was transferred here and installed in the booking office.

Dungeness - like Dymchurch it is uncertain how many levers this box actually contained.

Arrangements for working the temporary turning wye at The Pilot are not known.

==Locomotives==
===Locomotives in service===
&quot;Including engines serviceable, under overhaul, awaiting overhaul, or reserved to shunting or engineering duties.&quot;
=== Locomotive names ===

* Nameplates are usually in upper case.
* No 1 was named &quot;Green Goddess&quot; after the 1921 stage play by William Archer, which Captain Howey had enjoyed.
* Nos 2 &amp; 3 were to be called &quot;Northern Chief&quot; and &quot;Southern Chief&quot; and these nameplates were fitted at the works; however No 3&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Southern Maid&quot;.
* No 4 was sold in 1934 after construction because the proposed shunting and freight trains for it to work did not materialise. It ran in Belle Vue, Manchester, then Belfast with the new name &quot;Jean&quot;. The engine regained its original name on return to the RH&amp;DR and restoration in the 1970s. It bears the colloquial name &quot;Basil the Bug&quot; in its role as mascot of the railway&#x27;s children&#x27;s supporter group.
* Nos 5 &amp; 6 were to be called &quot;Man of Kent&quot; and &quot;Maid of Kent&quot;, but due to their high tractive effort (having smaller coupled wheels than the Pacifics) the names &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot;, with their allusion of strength, were substituted during construction. A decade later, Henry Greenly, the designer, was involved in the construction of a locomotive on the nearby Saltwood Miniature Railway, and this engine took the &quot;Maid of Kent&quot; name.
* Nos 7 &amp; 8 were constructed with an extra third cylinder for express passenger services and were given their names &quot;Typhoon&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot; for speed. The third cylinder was later removed from each due to unreliability. The locomotives were originally to carry the &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot; nameplates, but Howey gave the Mountain classes these names before the three-cylinder locomotives had arrived.
* Following a mishap when Howey was at the controls, No 8 was renamed &quot;Bluebottle&quot; between 1938 and 1946, apparently as a punishment.
* No 9 was originally &quot;Black Prince&quot;, but exchanged its name with No 10 in 1931. Its name became &quot;Winston Churchill&quot; in 1948 for a tour of Canada, and remained so afterwards. At the same time the name &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; was transferred to No 10 and the name &quot;Black Prince&quot; fell into disuse.
* A brass name plate survives suggesting one of the Canadian outline locos was originally to have been called &quot;Black Devil&quot;. In the event this name was never used. George Barlow, the railway&#x27;s operating manager, received a brass rubbing of this from an enquirer. When offered up to the cab side of &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; the bolt holes on the rubbing matched those in the loco&#x27;s cab side perfectly.

* No 11 took over the redundant &quot;Black Prince&quot; name upon transfer to the RH&amp;DR in 1976, in place of its German name &quot;Fleißiges Lieschen&quot; (Busy Lizzie). The name was chosen after a competition run by a local newspaper in which &quot;Spitfire&quot; scored heavily, but was considered rather undiplomatic given the loco&#x27;s origins.
* No 12, originally named &quot;John Southland&quot; after the founder of the local secondary school in New Romney, has since been renamed after the railway&#x27;s long serving managing director John Bernard Snell.
* No 13 was never assigned, probably due to superstition. Another engine of the same class as Nos 12 and 14 was built in the years between them (1988) and exported to the Shuzenji Romney Railway in Japan where it is No 3 in their fleet and carries the name &quot;John Southland II&quot;.
* No 14 ran nameless for 12 years until it was named after the line&#x27;s founder, Captain Howey.
* PW1 carried the fleet number 4 for about ten years from 1961 as a replacement for the Rolls-Royce engine, which in turn had inherited the number from &quot;The Bug&quot; which had been sold. The engine was renumbered PW1 shortly before the return of &quot;The Bug&quot;, leaving fleet number 4 available again for its original holder.
* PW2 was constructed in 1949, mainly by the rebuilding and re-use of a former War Department locomotive which had been in service since 1929. Popularly known as &quot;The Scooter&quot; it has recently acquired nameplates showing this name.
* PW3 &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; was built c1964 by Michel Jacot and using a modified Austin 7 engine originally ran on paraffin. It ran trials at both the Ravenglass &amp; Eskdale and Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch in the late 1960s and was acquired by the RHDR in the early 1970s.

===Locomotives withdrawn from service===
This list includes engines sold, scrapped, failed in trials, or otherwise withdrawn. All engines were internal combustion locomotives.

===Locomotives on site===
In addition to the railway&#x27;s own 16 locomotives, one additional engine is currently housed at New Romney. This is a partially constructed third-scale reproduction of an LMS Princess Coronation Class locomotive, commonly known as the &#x27;Duchess&#x27; type (although of the 38 engines of this class, only 10 were named after duchesses). The replica was commissioned by Paul Riley, a director of the railway, as a private project and is currently stored in an engineers&#x27; depot. Following the unexpected death of Mr Riley on 4 June 2008 the future of this locomotive is currently unknown. It is understood that the machine is more than half complete. This Locomotive was removed from the railway earlier this year and is currently (Summer 2023) up for sale with the Denver Light Railway.

== Freight traffic ==

=== Freight services ===
From the outset, the railway&#x27;s owners and designers envisaged freight services. Two of the original locomotives (No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; and No 6 &quot;Samson&quot;) were built to the &#x27;mountain&#x27; wheel arrangement (4-8-2), unique on any British railway and giving the ability to haul heavy freight with only a small loss of speed when used on passenger work. In the early years the railway carried a limited amount of freight (mainly shingle and fish traffic). A goods shed was built at New Romney and featured dual gauge track allowing easy transfer between the standard and 15-inch gauges. This was seldom used and was demolished in about 1934.

The greater part of the railway&#x27;s freight traffic in the early years was carried for the War Department, who made extensive use of the line to convey materials and equipment for the construction of the reinforced concrete sound ranging detectors they were experimenting with near Greatstone. A special siding was laid in joining their working site with the RHDR main line (the course of which can still be traced today [2016]) and the WD constructed their own locomotive to work their trains.

From time to time, the railway has had short term &quot;ad hoc&quot; freight contracts, for example one in 1975 to transport drainage pipes. The most recent freight workings involved delivering gas mains from New Romney to Greatstone in 1989. As a publicity stunt the first gas main train was steam hauled using No 4 &quot;The Bug&quot;, which appeared on the local TV news that evening.

The railway operates its own engineering and permanent way trains, which now form the majority of its non-passenger workings.

==== Dungeness fish trade ====
There are several disused sidings on the beach at Dungeness. These were used by fishermen to help move their hauls across the shingle. This joint provision was to allow transport of fish from Dungeness to Hythe and there to transfer it to road. The company had four-wheel fish wagons, stencilled &quot;Fish Only&quot;. The service was developed from 1937 following closure of the South Eastern Railway&#x27;s Dungeness line that year. The fish trade developed in a small way and was withdrawn. Two such sidings are still in place but are both in a very poor state of repair although they were used by fishermen to transport fish across the beach for many years after the main railway service was withdrawn.

To facilitate the transfer of this traffic from rail to road on its arrival at Hythe the track serving Platform 1 there extended into the car park for some years.

==== Uncrushed shingle transport ====
The most successful freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson&#x27;s Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line and then up the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice did not last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.

==== Postal service ====
The railway is licensed by the Post Office for rail postal services, and is entitled to issue postage stamps. A number of first day covers have been issued. A four-wheel secure postage wagon was constructed.

==== Parcels service ====
The railway operates a casual parcels service. Parcels handed in at one station will be delivered to another for collection. This is the last remnant of the railway&#x27;s freight services.
=== Freight vehicles ===
The railway has permanent way stock, examples of which include:

* the platelayers&#x27; mess coach 100P
* assorted tipper wagons (largely left over from ballast operations)
* secure tool trucks
* specialized platelaying vehicles incorporating concrete mixers, compressors, generators etc.
* flat wagons
* four-wheel wagons, both box vans and open trucks, including vehicles surviving from the fish trains
* tank wagons, used primarily for spraying weed killer on tracks.

==Passenger traffic==

===Passenger services===

The railway was conceived and constructed as a public service, not as a tourist attraction, although it now relies on tourist trade.

School children were transported under contract to Kent County Council to The Marsh Academy (known as &quot;Southland&#x27;s Comprehensive School&quot; until 2007); this service was provided all year during term time. The contract ceased due to falling passenger numbers after the summer term in July 2015. Local residents are transported to shopping centres and the railway has operated &#x27;shoppers specials&#x27;. Holiday camp trains have operated with camps at Romney Sands, St Mary&#x27;s Bay and Dymchurch. Charters are operated as required. During the Second World War the railway was operated by The Royal Engineers and later the Somerset Light Infantry as a military railway and there was extensive transport of soldiers on troop trains.

===Passenger vehicles===
At the outset the railway was equipped with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by Henry Greenly and his son Kenneth. 117 of these had been built by 1928. With only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation, especially to Dungeness. In 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by the Clayton Carriage &amp; Wagon Company of Lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and steam heating.

In 1934 Howey decided to scrap all the original four-wheelers and replace them with fully enclosed bogie vehicles. The 16-foot underframes for these were constructed by Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds and the bodies were built locally by the Hythe Cabinet &amp; Joinery Works Ltd. By June 1936 54 of these together with two matching vans had been taken into stock.

The RH&amp;DR now operates 20-seat and 16-seat open and closed coaches. These have been built on four different types of underframe:

* The original Clayton Carriage &amp; Wagon Co long frames unaltered in length (used for 16-seat opens and 8-seat guards vans)
* The 1936 Robert Hudson frames extended to between and by inserting a new centre section between the swan-necks which carry the frame over the bogies (used for 20-seat open and closed coaches)
* A small batch of all welded long frames made by Gowers of Bedford in 1962 and unaltered in length (used for 16-seat closed coaches)
* The remaining bogie hopper wagons acquired secondhand from the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway in 1928 (used for 20-seater semi-open coaches)

The first batch of 20-seater closed coaches were bodied with utile and numbered 51 to 61 inclusive. From coach 62 onwards aluminium has been used.

Over 80 years, the coach livery has changed from all-over green to brown and cream, blue, blue and cream, green and cream, chocolate and cream, and red and cream in the late 1980s. Since 2000, rakes of coaches (trains of around a dozen coaches) have been painted in individual liveries and there are now maroon, green, blue, crimson and teak coaches; &#x27;Heritage&#x27; coaches are chocolate and cream.

The railway has built several coaches to accommodate wheelchair users, starting with driving trailer coach 105 (heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named &quot;Marjorie&quot;) followed by 601 &quot;Elsie&quot;, then 602 &quot;Winn&quot; and 603 &quot;May&quot;.

A new coach design featuring a lower floor, for easier loading, and a higher roof-line, giving better headroom for wheelchair users, was introduced in 2015. The first, &quot;Phylis&quot;, is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches. Two further coaches, &quot;Iris&quot; for the green set and &quot;Edith May&quot; for the teak/chocolate set, are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting. As well as the wheelchair compartment, which has tip-up seats, each will have a guard&#x27;s compartment with (emergency) brake valve, vacuum gauge, side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment. The guard&#x27;s compartment has four seats and may be used by passengers when not in use by the guard

In addition to the main stock, the &#x27;Heritage&#x27; set is made up of: 
* the Clayton Pullman (built in 1928 and the last remaining example of a set of eight, with superior comfort and design with twelve seats in three compartments, originally with steam heating and coach lighting); 
* a preserved 1960s twelve-seat hardboard bodied coach named &quot;Ruth;&quot; 
* the Royal Saloon (used by Queen Elizabeth II and members of her family when she visited the railway on 30 March 1957), a luxury version of a coach design introduced in 1934/5;
* and the licensed bar car named &quot;Gladys&quot; (after Captain Howey&#x27;s wife), an observation coach built on a 1936 Robert Hudson underframe extended to with a bar and 16 seats.

==Armoured train==

During World War II, a miniature armoured train was used on the line to patrol the coast in case of invasion. The train consisted of No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; and a few wagons fitted with armour plating and armed with a Boys anti-tank rifle and Lewis guns.

==Proposed extension to Sandling==
Objectors to the railway&#x27;s first Light Railway Order advocated an extension from Hythe to Sandling ( away) to meet mainline services at Sandling Junction which they claimed would provide a more useful transport facility than the original proposals. Henry Greenly undertook a preliminary survey which demonstrated the scheme was impracticable.

Supposition that the 4-8-2 locomotives &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot; were ordered for the project, which involved steep inclines, is unfounded as the engines were intended for freight traffic, in particular a contract with Kent County Council to transport up to 30,000 tons of ballast a year from their pits at Palmarsh. In the end this contract failed to materialize.

In the 1980s, the directors reconsidered proposals to extend the line to Sandling and detailed surveys were undertaken. Again, consideration was given to motive power with new locomotives discussed. Although still called the &quot;Sandling Extension&quot;, the 1980s plan was for a single-track line from Pennypot, short of Hythe, to provide a more gentle route to an area known as The Roughs, where a more powerful locomotive would take over for the heavy climb to Sandling station. It would therefore have been a branch line rather than an actual extension to the existing mainline. Again, the project was abandoned mainly because of the same obstacles as before.

== Tenders ==
The following tenders are in use:

* &quot;Green Goddess&quot; (rebodied in 2009) and &quot;Typhoon&quot; (rebodied in 2012) have Ashford 1947 tenders (see below).
* &quot;Northern Chief&quot; and &quot;Southern Maid&quot; ran with 1983–4 built TMA tenders which are similar to, but longer than, the Greenly tenders and have a greater coal and water capacity. &quot;Northern Chief&quot; received a new tender tank as part of her overhaul in the winter of 2015. &quot;Southern Maid&quot; will return to traffic in 2016 with a new tender tank which will be a copy of her old tank.
* &quot;The Bug&quot;&#x27;s tender was newly built in the mid-1970s as the original had been cut up during its time in a Belfast scrap yard. A new tender tank was built by Fowler Engineering and fitted in October 2022
* &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot; have, since 2009, been fitted with new tenders to a design resembling the Great Northern Railway &#x27;high-sided&#x27; type.
* &quot;Hurricane&quot; is coupled to the rebodied Paxman-built 1934 large tender, complete with mock corridor connector (a feature of LNER locos used on the non-stop London–Edinburgh services allowing for crew changes en route).
* &quot;Winston Churchill&quot; and &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; have rebodied Gower tenders using parts from their original Vanderbilt tenders from 1931.
* &quot;Black Prince&quot; received a new tender in 2008, using bogies and other parts from its original one which, like the Greenly tenders, suffered from low water and coal capacity. As built, the loco and tender were fitted with air brakes which were replaced at the RH&amp;DR with vacuum brakes for the loco driving wheels only; the original tender was not altered. The new tender, fitted with vacuum brakes, was tested at New Romney on 27 September 2008. On 4 October 2008, &quot;Black Prince&quot; completed a non-stop run from Hythe to Dungeness and back again, without the aid of another tender, a first for this locomotive.

=== Greenly tenders ===
Of the seven Greenly tenders supplied new with locos 1–8, two are still in service albeit with new bodies to the original design. Originally built with vacuum brakes and a handbrake, both brake systems have been removed, leaving them as through-piped only. They were coupled to &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Samson&quot; but withdrawn from mainline service due to concerns over safety, and their coal and water capacity.

=== Ashford tenders ===
The Southern Railway&#x27;s Ashford works built four tenders in 1946–47. Ashford No 1 ran coupled to &quot;Hercules&quot;, but was built too high because John Iron, the Southern&#x27;s draughtsman sent to New Romney to &quot;measure a loco&quot;, took his measurements from a Canadian-type Pacific and not a British outline one. The design of subsequent tenders was altered hurriedly after this and the second one, Ashford No 2, was coupled to &quot;Typhoon&quot;. The design was further refined and two more were constructed. Ashford No 3 was coupled to &quot;Green Goddess&quot; and Ashford No 4 to &quot;Southern Maid&quot;. Ashford No 1 last ran in 1974 when &quot;Hercules&quot; was withdrawn for overhaul. Ashford Nos 2 and 3 are still in service with new bodies. Ashford No 4 was withdrawn when &quot;Southern Maid&quot; was overhauled in 1983.

Until 1959, when its tender was cut down in size, &quot;Hercules&quot; ran with the cab roof raised on blocks of wood to match the height of the tender.

=== Tender shortage ===
&quot;Hercules&quot; was out of service after the Burmarsh Road level crossing incident in 2003, and &quot;Samson&quot; was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards. Once both locomotives were back in service, the railway was faced with a tender shortage. &quot;Samson&quot; was kept from mainline service while &quot;Hercules&quot; was coupled to the tender from &quot;Green Goddess&quot; while it was stored prior to overhaul. During the 2007 season, &quot;Samson&quot; saw service using the tender from &quot;Hurricane&quot; while it was being overhauled (a situation that had also happened in 1949 when &quot;Samson&quot; was used for ballast train duties).

==Safety==

=== Incidents ===
There have been a number of serious accidents over the railway&#x27;s 90-year operation with an extensive mainline timetable. The majority of these have been related to level crossings, and in every documented case the road user has either admitted liability, or been found to have been in the wrong by the subsequent investigation. Despite the presence of large numbers of visitors and tourists, almost all recorded level crossing incidents have involved local car drivers. The more serious incidents, including those at level crossings, have been:
* 17 August 1927. 27-year-old platelayer Harold Adams was struck and fatally injured by a train whilst he was working on the track near the Prince of Wales Bridge.
* 2 June 1931. Locomotive No 10, then still named &quot;Doctor Syn&quot; (the exchange of names with locomotive No 9 did not take place until later in the year), broke away from its tender, leaving its train near the Coastguard Cottages at Lade. The locomotive continued alone towards Dungeness where the combination of speed, curvature and cant deficiency caused it to derail on the loop and fall on its side. The locomotive was just over two weeks old at the time
* 10 May 1934. A train hauled by the Rolls-Royce locomotive was in collision with a large car at Bonnington Road (since renamed Eastbridge Road) level crossing in Dymchurch. The long-serving internal combustion locomotive (which carried no name at the time of the accident) was derailed and turned on its side, receiving significant damage and narrowly avoiding a fall into the dyke beside the road. The engine driver, Claude Webb, who was also Captain Howey&#x27;s chauffeur, was slightly injured in the accident. A steam hauled engineers&#x27; train was coincidentally nearby at the time, and quickly able to render assistance. The damaged locomotive was sent to Robert Hudson Ltd in Leeds for repair, and returned to service later in the same year.
* 2 September 1935. &quot;Northern Chief&quot; was struck by a lorry on the level crossing with Bonnington Road (now known as Eastbridge Road), Dymchurch. The locomotive fell onto its right side coming to rest on the canal bridge. The tender stayed upright. Having sustained minimal damage, the loco was repaired quickly and returned to service. The lorry was a write-off.
* 16 May 1946. A train hauled by locomotive No 3 &quot;Southern Maid&quot; was in collision with a lorry at Eastbridge Road level crossing in Dymchurch. The locomotive was derailed, and fell into the drainage canal running beside the road. The engine driver was badly injured but survived. The lorry driver was killed. The locomotive was recovered from the water by an army crane, but required extensive repairs.
* 22 April 1947. A train hauled by locomotive No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot; was in collision with a large agricultural tractor at an occupation crossing near Prince of Wales, south of Hythe. The subsequent investigation found that the tractor had become stuck on the rails as it had smooth steel wheels, with no spikes, studs or tyres; the tractor driver made no attempt to contact the signalman or warn approaching trains. The engine was derailed and turned on its side, but was not badly damaged and returned to service later the same month. The tractor was split in two and destroyed.
* 16 July 1952. A head-on collision between two passenger trains (one hauled by No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot;, the other by No 8 &quot;Hurricane&quot;) occurred just north of Britannia Points. The station master at Dungeness, who was not in possession of the single line token, improperly issued the driver of the Up train with a single line ticket and verbally instructed him to take his train to Britannia Points and wait there to be shown the token by the driver of the approaching Down train before proceeding. The Up train over-ran Britannia Points causing the collision.
* 11 August 1952 The driver of a Down train on the Dungeness line, 21-year-old Jeffery Reddecliffe, was knocked out after striking his head on an overbridge. A passenger in the leading carriage, Leslie J. Ashman, saw this happen, left the carriage, clambered over the tender into the loco cab and stopped the train. Captain Howey later presented him with a sea fishing rod in gratitude for his bravery.
* 2 May 1954. A train driven by Bob Hobbs and hauled by locomotive No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; was derailed at half mile curve, between New Romney and Greatstone. The cause of the incident was severe gale-force wind. The train was the 14.50 from Hythe to Dungeness, and the leading vehicle (behind the engine) was a light guard&#x27;s van, of a type nicknamed &quot;jumping jacks&quot;, as their relatively light weight made for an uncomfortable ride for the guard. In the severe weather, as the train passed over the exposed embankment of half mile curve, the jumping jack guard&#x27;s van was blown over, and smashed on the embankment. Fortunately the guard, Mavis Thomas, had decided to ride in another coach, and so avoided injury. As the van turned over in the wind, it also tipped the locomotive&#x27;s high-sided tender, which in turn tipped the locomotive which ended on its side down the embankment. The engine driver, Bob Hobbs, who was a highly experienced driver, had been alerted to the sequence of events by noises behind him, and was able to jump from the footplate, sustaining only cuts and grazes. All &quot;jumping jack&quot; guard&#x27;s vans on the railway were withdrawn from service and scrapped.
* 27 May 1963. A train hauled by locomotive No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; from Hythe to New Romney was suffering from a faulty boiler pressure gauge which was showing erratic readings. The workshop staff at New Romney had recalibrated the safety valves that morning so that they lifted at what the gauge showed as 180 lb sq in. In fact the gauge was reading high. After this the boiler was unable to maintain sufficient pressure to keep the train&#x27;s vacuum brakes off and they were dragging. The train stalled at Palmarsh, but the driver managed to get it moving again, but at only . The train was struck from behind by the following service train, hauled by locomotive No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot; which had been allowed into the section by the Hythe signalman before he had received line clear from Dymchurch. A number of carriages in both trains were derailed (some telescoped) and there were a number of injuries. The incident was reported in The Railway Magazine together with two photographs taken in the aftermath of the crash.
* 9 August 1967. A train hauled by locomotive No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; driven by Jim Brodie over-ran the terminus at Hythe, resulting in a number of minor injuries. It is thought the engine driver was struck on the head at Prince of Wales Bridge, and lost consciousness, allowing the train to continue unchecked for the remaining into Hythe station where it crashed through buffer stops and continued into the station car park, coming to rest before reaching the main road. The driver could not subsequently recall whether his head had struck the stonework of the bridge, or whether he had been hit by an object thrown from the bridge. The incident received national newspaper coverage.
* 25 July 1968. A heavy double headed train of 23 coaches, hauled by locomotives No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot; (train engine) and No 9 &quot;Winston Churchill&quot; (pilot engine), was struck by a car at Botolph&#x27;s Bridge Road. The car was destroyed, but damage to the train was limited to the motion of locomotive No 9. The damaged engine was recovered to New Romney (towed by a shunting engine), and the other locomotive continued alone with the entire 23 coach train.
* April 1970. A train hauled by locomotive No 2 &quot;Northern Chief&quot; was in collision with a car at Botolph&#x27;s Bridge level crossing, south of Palmarsh. The swift action of the engine driver, Cyril Carter, resulted in a low impact collision, and nobody was injured. The locomotive was slightly damaged. The car, an Austin 1100, was damaged, but not destroyed.
* August 1972. A passenger train was in collision with a circus caravan at St Mary&#x27;s Road level crossing, Dymchurch. Nobody was injured.
* 6 August 1973. A train hauled by locomotive No 6 &quot;Samson&quot; was in collision with a stolen motor car at St Mary&#x27;s Road level crossing, a short distance south of Dymchurch station. The locomotive was badly damaged and the engine driver, Peter Hobson, was killed. The locomotive was sent to Leeds for repair, returning to service the following year. Although not the first level crossing incident on the railway, it was the first to prove fatal to the engine driver, and initiated discussion which led to the gradual introduction of warning lights at all the railway&#x27;s level crossings.
* August 1974. A train driven by driver George Barlow (believed to be driving locomotive No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot;) was in collision with a car at Botolph&#x27;s Bridge Road. There were no injuries, but the car was badly damaged, and the front carriage of the train was slightly damaged.
* 28 August 1975. A train hauled by locomotive No 7 &quot;Typhoon&quot; was in collision with a car on St Mary&#x27;s Road level crossing, Dymchurch. The car, a Ford Corsair, was destroyed, and one of its occupants had to be cut free, having been trapped by her feet, but was not seriously injured. The train driver, Cyril Carter, was uninjured. The occupants of the car were a local young brother and sister, Roger Piper (20) and Belinda Piper (14) driving to the fish and chip shop, and witnesses reported that they had seen the approaching train but tried to race it to the level crossing. Their father John Piper was quoted in the local newspaper as having said, &quot;Funnily enough, it is nearly always someone local who is involved&quot;, referring to accidents on Dymchurch&#x27;s level crossings.
* 11 May 1993. A train propelled by locomotive No 12 &quot;John Southland&quot; driven by Stuart Barratt was in collision with a white van at Eastbridge Road level crossing, Dymchurch. The train was an empty coaching stock (ECS) working which had earlier operated the daily school service for pupils returning home from New Romney. The locomotive was propelling from the rear, and the leading vehicle was Driving Van Trailer (DVT) No 105. The transit van and the railway DVT both fell into the dyke beside the road. The van driver was uninjured. The Guard, Simon Oldfield, who was travelling in the DVT, was briefly trapped under water, but was able to free himself and swim to safety. The DVT was heavily damaged and had to be completely rebuilt. During this rebuild it was adapted to become the railway&#x27;s first wheelchair accessible coach. Two other passenger coaches, 804 and 807, were also seriously damaged in the incident. The van driver admitted fault but claimed that his brakes had failed. The subsequent police investigation revealed that the brakes had operated correctly, but that the van driver had vainly hoped to beat the train to the crossing. Police also found that the van&#x27;s tyres were bald, and that it had no current road tax. A large crane recovered both vehicles from the water.
* 3 August 2003. A train hauled by locomotive No 5 &quot;Hercules&quot; was in collision with a car at Burmarsh Road level crossing protected by flashing warning lights. The engine driver, 31-year-old Kevin Crouch, died at the scene, and some passengers were treated for shock and minor injuries. The locomotive was seriously damaged and underwent extensive repairs, returning to service in 2005. The female car driver, 22-year-old Marie Scrace whose baby was a passenger in the vehicle, had ignored or failed to see the warning lights. Scrace and her baby were taken to hospital, but were not badly hurt. The railway and the Health and Safety Executive instigated an investigation, and the woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Although acquitted, she was found guilty of the lesser charge of careless driving.
* 10 July 2005. A train hauled by locomotive No 8 &quot;Hurricane&quot; was in collision with a car at Battery Road level crossing near Dungeness. The driver of the train, Suzanne Martin (the wife of the railway&#x27;s general manager), was killed. Several passengers were treated for shock. The locomotive was seriously damaged and underwent extensive repairs, returning to service the following year. The car driver, 20-year-old Richard Isted, had ignored or failed to see warning lights and was arrested at the scene by Kent Police. He subsequently appeared in court charged with driving without due care and attention, to which he pleaded guilty.
* 10 September 2016. A passenger train was struck by a tractor pulling a heavily laden hay trailer, on occupation crossing number 10 (approximately half a mile north of Dymchurch station). Locomotive No 1 &quot;Green Goddess&quot; and its tender were both derailed and thrown onto their sides. The leading coach was also derailed but remained upright. The train driver and four passengers sustained minor injuries.
* 28 August 2019 Two passenger trains ended up on the single track line between New Romney and Romney Sands stations. The trains stopped apart. An investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch found that the cause was a misunderstanding by the trainee stationmaster at Romney Sands who issued a ticket without having the token in his possession, and the acceptance of the ticket by the driver of the train from Romney Sands without having seen the token for the section. Comparisons were made with the Abermule train collision in 1921. As a result of this incident the New Romney to Romney Sands section of the Single Line was equipped with Electric Token Block equipment.

===Level crossings===
Following the two fatal accidents in 2003 and 2005, the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment. There are a number of occupation crossings with local control, where the railway meets farm tracks, but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways, five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings. During the late 1970s to early 1980s, all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings (AOCLs) by installation of flashing warning lights. Between 2006 and 2016, twelve of them were upgraded to Automatic Barrier Crossing Locally Monitored (ABCL) status. This involved the decommissioning of the life expired AOCL control equipment, the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and train detection systems, at a cost of around £90,000 per crossing. On 22 March 2017 the crossing at Romney Sands was commissioned as an ABCL, this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close. During the single line crossing upgrades the Road Signal heads (Wig Wags) have either been replaced with new ones (Battery Road and Dungeness Road) or had their existing heads refurbished.

==Ownership and operation==

=== Ownership ===
The railway is owned by Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway PLC, which was originally incorporated as a private limited company on 15 November 1971 under the name RH&amp;D Light Railway Holding Company Limited, adopting its present title on re-registration as a &quot;new&quot; public limited company under Section 8(3) of the Companies Act 1980 on 10 May 1982. Its shareholders (of whom there are now over a thousand) travel free of charge on trains, but receive no financial dividend on their shareholdings, instead re-investing all operating profit back into the company. By 14 June 2015 there were 25 &quot;Gold Medallion&quot; shareholders owning 5,000 or more shares each and 119 &quot;Silver Medallion&quot; shareholders owning between 500 and 4,999 shares each. The remaining shareholders owned between 100 and 499 shares each. The PLC&#x27;s issued and fully paid share capital at that date was £508,858 in £1 Ordinary Shares.

Shares in the PLC remain available to the public at a cost of £4 each. The minimum holding is 100 shares, but above this number potential shareholders may purchase any amount. The two largest shareholders in the PLC are the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway Association with 78,604 shares (15.45%) and the estate of the late Sir William McAlpine (leader of the group which saved the railway from closure in 1972) which holds 38,837 (7.63%). The PLC controls the entire share capital of the older statutory Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway Company, incorporated by The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway Order 1926. It acquired a controlling interest in the Statutory Company on 14 February 1972 for £106,947.64 when it purchased 50,447 of the 51,000 Statutory Company shares then in issue. Since February 1972 it has bought out all of the minority shareholders in the Statutory Company which is now a wholly owned subsidiary.

The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway (Amendment) Order 1974 altered the capital structure of the Statutory Company, allowing its issued share capital and borrowings to amount in aggregate to £400,000 (instead of the previously completely inadequate £68,000). On 1 October 1975 the Statutory Company created a further 24,000 new shares, bringing its issued capital up to £75,000 in £1 shares. The PLC subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by a director of the Statutory Company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 Light Railway Order. Directors&#x27; shareholdings in the Statutory Company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the PLC and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company.

It is usual for the two companies to share the same board of directors; with the anomaly that whilst the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway Association has been granted a seat on the Statutory Company&#x27;s board it has no direct representation on the PLC&#x27;s board.

=== Directors ===
The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway Order 1926 restricted the maximum number of directors of the Statutory Company to five and named Captain John Edwards Presgrave Howey, Gladys May Howey, Captain John Alexander Holder, Major William Bertram Bell and Henry Greenly as the first directors. Greenly never owned more than 50 shares in the company so was ineligible to sit on the board and Holder did not achieve the qualifying holding of 250 shares until 30 December 1929. Gladys Howey was also ineligible until 1931 when her shareholding reached 250 and she was able to join the board.

Section 5 of The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Light Railway (Amendment) Order 1974 increased the maximum number of directors from five to ten and also set the minimum number of directors at three.

=== Operation ===
The day-to-day operation of the railway is in the hands of a full-time permanent staff of around 35 assisted by 5 part-time permanent staff. These include a general manager, departmental managers (engineering, commercial and operations) and a large number of engineering staff (from locomotive fitters to permanent way gangers) and catering staff (the New Romney and Dungeness cafes and the restaurant adjoining Hythe station are open all year round; some of the railway&#x27;s other commercial outlets are more seasonal). In addition to this core staff, seasonal employees are taken on through the summer season, particularly to increase the staffing of the shops and catering outlets and to provide the required levels of staffing at stations. At the height of the operating season there are over 60 staff on the payroll.

<text>Top Cat is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and originally broadcast in prime time on the ABC network. It aired in a weekly evening time slot from September 27, 1961, to April 18, 1962, for a single season of 30 episodes. The show was a ratings failure in prime time, but became successful upon its time on Saturday morning television. The show also became very popular in Latin American countries (especially Mexico), and the United Kingdom.

==Background==
&quot;Top Cat&quot; was created as a parody of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; (1955–59), a successful military comedy whose lead character (Sergeant Bilko, played by Silvers) was a fast-talking con artist. Hanna-Barbera sold the cartoon to ABC based on a drawing of Top Cat. Arnold Stang&#x27;s vocal characterization of the main character was originally based on an impression of Phil Silvers&#x27;s voice. During the original network run, the sponsor objected to the Silvers impersonation—insisting that it was paying for Stang, not Silvers—so in later episodes Stang modified his characterization, bringing it closer to his own voice, though still copying Silvers. Additionally, Maurice Gosfield, who played Private Duane Doberman in &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, provided the voice for Benny the Ball in &quot;Top Cat&quot;, and Benny&#x27;s chubby appearance was based on Gosfield&#x27;s. Top Cat and his gang were also inspired by the East Side Kids, roguish, street-smart characters from a series of 1940s B movies. 

This was only the second original cartoon series to premiere on prime time network television in the United States. &quot;Top Cat&quot; was conceived along the lines of a traditional, live-action situation comedy, and Hanna-Barbera recruited top sitcom writers of the day to furnish scripts, including Barry Blitzer (a &quot;Phil Silvers Show&quot; veteran), Harvey Bullock, and Kin Platt.

==Premise==
The title character, Top Cat (T.C.), is the leader of a gang of Manhattan alley cats living in Hoagy&#x27;s Alley: Benny the Ball, Brain, Choo-Choo, Fancy-Fancy and Spook.

The gang constantly hatch get-rich-quick schemes through scams but they usually backfire, and a frequent plot thread revolves around the local police officer, Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Dibble (voiced by Allen Jenkins), ineffectually trying to either arrest them, evict them from the alley, get them to clean the alley, or stop them using the policebox phone.

Like &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, all the episodes feature a cold open, which is a small scene from the episode that takes place &quot;in medias res&quot;, and after that, a long flashback that leads to the scene begins with the series&#x27; theme song &quot;The Most Effectual Top Cat&quot; and features Top Cat&#x27;s misadventures that happen before the scene from the beginning plays. The story then continues from where it left off. In some episodes, the flashback stops near the middle when the same scene plays.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Top Cat&quot; aired on Wednesday nights in prime time at 8:30 pm. Hanna-Barbera created 30 half-hour episodes. The show was broadcast in black-and-white but was created in color. The show aired on Saturdays in 1962 and 1963 on ABC, and was then rerun (now in color) in various Saturday-morning slots on NBC from 1965 to 1969, and occasionally in the 1980s.

Reruns of the series aired on Cartoon Network from 1992 until 2004, and on Boomerang from 2000 to 2014 and again from November 26 to November 29, 2020. Reruns later returned to Boomerang on April 4, 2023. The show began airing on MeTV Toons on June 29, 2024.

==Analysis==
Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman says that the series can be seen as social commentary. The cats may represent disenfranchised people confined to living in a poor environment. Top Cat&#x27;s get-rich-quick schemes are efforts to escape to a better life. The gang faces a human police officer who frustrates their efforts and keeps them trapped in the alley. This enforcement of the social order by police ensures that the cats will not escape their current living conditions.

Co-creator Bill Hanna said it was one of the wittiest and most sophisticated shows he produced, with a rare appeal to audiences of all ages.

===Series overview===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Home media==
Episodes of the series were released on VHS in Europe, as well as Worldvision Home Video in the United States.

The series&#x27; episode, &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, was edited into a 7-minute preview as part of the &quot;A Sample of Boomerang&quot; tape, from Cartoon Network&#x27;s sister channel, Boomerang.

Episodes of the series were also released on Laserdisc in the United Kingdom by Guild Home Video, as well as Image Entertainment in the United States.

Warner Home Video released &quot;Top Cat: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on December 7, 2004, as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection. This set was re-released by Warner Archive on January 10, 2017, albeit as a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release. On June 6 of that year, &quot;Top Cat&quot; was re-released in stores again as part of the Hanna-Barbera Diamond Collection in honor of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 60th anniversary; however, all bonus features were removed.

In the UK, the complete series box set was released in 2007, initially as a HMV exclusive until 2008. Alternatively, five single DVD volumes, each containing 6 episodes, were released. The covers were originally from the US edition but later re-released with a new design. Each volume shows a group picture of Top Cat using Dibble&#x27;s phone with his gang beside him, but the colour-coding is:
* Volume 1: Primrose (Episodes 1–6) – Top Cat
* Volume 2: Green (Episodes 7–12) – Choo-Choo
* Volume 3: Red (Episodes 13–18) – Fancy Fancy
* Volume 4: Blue (Episodes 19–24) – Benny
* Volume 5: Orange (Episodes 25–30) – Spook

The DVDs have since been made available to buy in other retailers across the UK.

Warner Archive released the series on Blu-ray on September 17, 2024.

==In other media==
===Comic books===
The gang&#x27;s adventures continued off-screen in comic books as Dell (which became Gold Key) published 31 issues from 1961 to 1970. Charlton Comics published 20 more issues from 1970 to 1973. In Mexico, Ediciones Latinoamericanas&#x27; &quot;La Colección Primavera&quot; featured Don Gato in 1968.

In 2012, there was a crossover between Top Cat and Chilean comic book character Condorito.

Top Cat had a backup story in &quot;Adam Strange/Future Quest Annual #1&quot; in where he escapes from prison and meets Batman through a cosmic portal. Unlike the cartoon, Top Cat is from a world where cats are the dominant species. As a follow-up, Top Cat also appears in one issue of a crossover series between DC and Hanna-Barbera, titled &quot;Superman/Top Cat Special&quot; (October 2018).

===Books===
Little Golden Books and Durabooks have both produced hardcover children&#x27;s books starring Top Cat. In the UK, World Distributors published annuals during the 1960s sourced from the Dell comics strips. BrownWatson later published a 1978 annual entitled &quot;The Great Grape Ape and Boss Cat&quot;.

===View-Master===
T.C. and friends appeared on three View-Master reels in 1962. These were titled &quot;Medal for Meddling&quot;, &quot;Zoo-Operation&quot;, and &quot;No Cat Fishing&quot;.

===Music===
The Original TV Soundtrack, written and recorded by Hoyt Curtin, was released by Colpix Records in 1962, consisting of slightly edited versions of &quot;The Unscratchables&quot; and &quot;Top Cat Falls in Love&quot;. Hanna-Barbera Records released an LP in 1965 titled &quot;Robin Hood Starring Top Cat&quot;. T.C. and the gang were pictured as Merry Men on the cover. Its songs included &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;M-O-N-E-Y&quot;, &quot;Dibble&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, and &quot;Buddies&quot;. It was re-released in 1977 on Columbia Records&#x27; Special Products label. A jazzy arrangement of the &quot;Top Cat&quot; theme can be heard most weeks over the end credits of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Theme Time Radio Hour&quot;.

The titles and underscore were released as part of the CD release, &quot;The Best of Hanna-Barbera: Tunes from the Toons&quot; by Music Club in 2002 in Europe.

===Box office===
==International broadcast==
===Australia===
The show premiered on the Seven Network on September 27, 1961

===Canada===
&quot;Top Cat&quot; premiered on the CTV Television Network on October 9, 1961.

===Hungary===
&quot;Top Cat&quot; (&quot;Turpi úrfi&quot;) was one of the first American cartoons premiered on Hungarian television channels in 1969. It also broadcast later with &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; on Magyar Televízió from 1985 to 1990, and tv2 from 1997 to 1999 (together with &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;). Boomerang began broadcasting it in Hungarian in 2013 (the show had a one-off airing the year before as part of a Cats-themed block).

===Latin America===
The show was dubbed to Spanish in Mexico in 1963, using some of the same voice actors who worked in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Don Gato y su pandilla&quot; (literally &quot;Mr. Cat and his gang&quot;) and the main characters adopted different accents. The voice acting improved the show, adding new jokes and local references.

In spite of the modest success of the show in the United States, the show was a massive hit in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina, where it is recognized as one of the most famous Hanna Barbera characters ever, being as popular as The Flintstones.

Besides Top Cat, all the other characters from the show were famous, and their popularity is commonly attributed by the excellent dubbing and voice acting: 
* Benny was renamed &quot;Benito B. Bodoque y B.&quot; and given a more childlike voice than was the case in the original dubbing.
* Choo Choo was renamed &quot;Cucho&quot; and spoke with a Yucatecan accent.
* Fancy-Fancy was &quot;Panza&quot; (belly).
* Spook renamed as the word&#x27;s rough translation &quot;Espanto&quot;.
* Brain was called &quot;Demóstenes&quot; (honouring the Greek statesman Demosthenes, with whom he shares a speech impediment).
* Officer Charlie Dibble renamed as &quot;Oficial Carlos &quot;Carlitos&quot; Matute&quot;.

The adaptation and translation was made by Rubén Arvizu. The main voice actors were Julio Lucena (voice of Top Cat), Jorge Arvizu (voice of Benny and Choo Choo), Víctor Alcocer (voice of Dibble), and David Reynoso, among others. &quot;Top Cat&quot; is still rerun every few years.

In Brazil, the character is known as &quot;Manda-Chuva&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese for &quot;big shot&quot;) and was voiced by actor Lima Duarte. The dub premiered in 1963 on TV Record in São Paulo and other stations in other cities. The series was later syndicated and was aired in the late 80s on TV Globo as part of &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot;. In addition, the city of New York was replaced by Brasília (federal capital) in the Brazilian version most of the time.

===India===
&quot;Top Cat&quot; was one of the early favorites on Cartoon Network. It was aired in India in the 1990s. Top Cat was aired again in 2003 until 2004.

===Japan===
&quot;Top Cat&quot; (Japanese: &quot;ドラ猫大将&quot;) first aired on TV Asahi back in 1963 under the title translating to &quot;Stray Cat Boss.&quot; It was then rebroadcast many times over the years. In 1990, A new dub was produced for VHS sold by Nippon Columbia and released under its original name in Katakana (&quot;トップキャット&quot;). This new dub was also carried over to airing on Cartoon Network Japan since its launch in 1997.

===Sri Lanka===
&quot;Top Cat&quot; (Sinhala: () literally &quot;Crazy Cat&quot;) was one of the most popular cartoon shows in Sri Lanka early 1980s and it has been repeated several times on the national television channel &quot;Rupavahini&quot;. The series is dubbed in Sinhala and directed by Titus Thotawatte.

===United Kingdom===

&quot;Top Cat&quot; premiered on the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) on May 16, 1962, under its original name but after only four weeks was renamed &quot;The Boss Cat&quot; on June 13, 1962. This was shortened on 22 February 1967 to &quot;Boss Cat&quot;. This rapid name change was made because Top Cat was also the name of a then-popular British brand of cat food, and the cartoon was aired on the BBC which can not carry advertising. The dialogue and theme tune still referred to the character by his original name.

Despite the show being renamed &quot;Boss Cat&quot;, the character&#x27;s name was unchanged as Top Cat or the initials &quot;TC&quot;. The &quot;Boss Cat&quot; title card was last used for a repeat run in summer 1989; From that point onwards the original US title sequence was used in full. 

In 2016, the characters from the show (all the cats and Officer Dibble) were used as part of a set of television commercials for the British bank Halifax.

<text>A seed bank (also seed banks, seeds bank or seed vault) stores seeds to preserve genetic diversity; hence it is a type of gene bank. There are many reasons to store seeds. One is to preserve the genes that plant breeders need to increase yield, disease resistance, drought tolerance, nutritional quality, taste, etc. of crops. Another is to forestall loss of genetic diversity in rare or imperiled plant species in an effort to conserve biodiversity &quot;ex situ&quot;. Many plants that were used centuries ago by humans are used less frequently now; seed banks offer a way to preserve that historical and cultural value. Collections of seeds stored at constant low temperature and low moisture are guarded against loss of genetic resources that are otherwise maintained in situ or in field collections. These alternative &quot;living&quot; collections can be damaged by natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, or war. Seed banks are considered seed libraries, containing valuable information about evolved strategies to combat plant stress, and can be used to create genetically modified versions of existing seeds. The work of seed banks often span decades and even centuries. Most seed banks are publicly funded and seeds are usually available for research that benefits the public.

==Storage conditions and regeneration==
Seeds are living plants and keeping them viable over the long term requires adjusting storage moisture and temperature appropriately. As they mature on the mother plant, many seeds attain an innate ability to survive drying. Survival of these so-called &#x27;orthodox&#x27; seeds can be extended by dry, low temperature storage. The level of dryness and coldness depends mostly on the longevity that is required and the investment in infrastructure that is affordable. Practical guidelines from a US scientist in the 1950s and 1960s, James Harrington, are known as &#x27;Thumb Rules&#x27;. The &#x27;Hundreds Rule&#x27; guides that the sum of relative humidity and temperature (in Fahrenheit) should be less than 100 for the sample to survive five years. Another rule is that reduction of water content by 1% or temperature by will double the seed life span. Research from the 1990s showed that there is a limit to the beneficial effect of drying or cooling, so it must not be overdone.

Understanding the effect of water content and temperature on seed longevity, the Food and Agriculture division of the United Nations and a consultancy group called Bioversity International developed a set of standards for international seed banks to preserve seed longevity. The document advocates drying seeds to about 20% relative humidity, sealing seeds in high quality moisture-proof containers, and storing seeds at . These conditions are frequently referred to as &#x27;conventional&#x27; storage protocols. Seeds from species considered most important – corn, wheat, rice, soybean, pea, tomato, broccoli, melon, sunflower, etc. are stored in this way. However, there are many species that produce seeds that do not survive the drying or low temperature of conventional storage protocols. These species must be stored cryogenically. Seeds of citrus fruits, coffee, avocado, cocoa, coconut, papaya, oak, walnut and willow are a few examples of species that should be preserved cryogenically.

Like everything, seeds eventually degrade with time. It is hard to predict when seeds lose viability and so most reputable seed banks monitor germination potential during storage. When seed germination percentage decreases below a prescribed amount, the seeds need to be replanted and fresh seeds collected for another round of long-term storage.

Seeds banks may operate in much more primitive conditions if the aim is only to maintain year-by-year seed supplies and lower costs for farmers in a particular area.

==Challenges==
One of the greatest challenges for seed banks is selection. Collections must be relevant and that means they must provide useful genetic diversity that is accessible to the public. Collections must also be efficient and that means they must not duplicate materials already in collections.

Keeping seeds alive for hundreds of years is the next biggest challenge. Orthodox seeds are amenable to &#x27;conventional&#x27; storage protocols but there are many seed types that must be stored using nonconventional methods. Technology for these methods is rapidly advancing; local institutional infrastructure may be lacking.

Some seeds cannot be kept alive in storage and must be regenerated – planted to produce a new quantity of seeds to be stored for another length of time. Parzies et al. 2000 found that this reduced the effective population size and alleles were lost. Parzies&#x27; finding has since been taken seriously by banks around the world and has sparked further verification – regeneration is widely recognized to not preserve diversity perfectly.

==Alternatives==
In-situ conservation of seed-producing plant species is another conservation strategy. In-situ conservation involves the creation of National Parks, National Forests, and National Wildlife Refuges as a way of preserving the natural habitat of the targeted seed-producing organisms. In-situ conservation of agricultural resources is performed on-farm. This also allows the plants to continue to evolve with their environment through natural selection.

An arboretum stores trees by planting them at a protected site.

A less expensive, community-supported seed library can save local genetic material.

The phenomenon of seeds remaining dormant within the soil is well known and documented (Hills and Morris 1992). Detailed information on the role of such &quot;soil seed banks&quot; in northern Ontario, however, is extremely limited, and research is required to determine the species and abundance of seeds in the soil across a range of forest types, as well as to determine the function of the seed bank in post-disturbance vegetation dynamics. Comparison tables of seed density and diversity are presented for the boreal and deciduous forest types and the research that has been conducted is discussed. This review includes detailed discussions of: (1) seed bank dynamics, (2) physiology of seeds in a seed bank, (3) boreal and deciduous forest seed banks, (4) seed bank dynamics and succession, and (5) recommendations for initiating a seed bank study in northern Ontario.

==Longevity==

Seeds may be viable for hundreds and even thousands of years. The oldest carbon-14-dated seed that has grown into a viable plant was a Judean date palm seed about 2,000 years old, recovered from excavations at the palace of Herod the Great in Israel.

In February 2012, Russian scientists announced they had regenerated a narrow leaf campion (&quot;Silene stenophylla&quot;) from a 32,000-year-old seed. The seed was found in a burrow under Siberian permafrost along with 800,000 other seeds. Seed tissue was grown in test tubes until it could be transplanted to soil. This exemplifies the long-term viability of DNA under proper conditions.

== Climate change ==
Conservation efforts such as seed banks are expected to play a greater role as climate change progresses. Seed banks offer communities a source of climate-resilient seeds to withstand changing local climates. As challenges arise from climate change, community based seed banks can improve access to a diverse selection of locally adapted crops while also enhancing indigenous understandings of plant management such as seed selection, treatment, storage, and distribution.

== Facilities ==

There are about 6 million accessions, or samples of a particular population, stored as seeds in about 1,300 genebanks throughout the world as of 2006. This amount represents a small fraction of the world&#x27;s biodiversity, and many regions of the world have not been fully explored.
* The Svalbard Global Seed Vault has been built inside a sandstone mountain in a man-made tunnel on the frozen Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, which is part of the Svalbard archipelago, about from the North Pole. It is designed to survive catastrophes such as nuclear war and world war. It is operated by the Global Crop Diversity Trust. The area&#x27;s permafrost will keep the vault below the freezing point of water, and the seeds are protected by 1-metre thick walls of steel-reinforced concrete. There are two airlocks and two blast-proof doors. The vault accepted the first seeds on 26 February 2008.
* The Millennium Seed Bank is located in the grounds of Wakehurst Place in West Sussex, near London, UK. Established in 1996, it is the largest seed bank in the world (and will longterm be at least 100 times bigger than Svalbard Global Seed Vault), providing space for the storage of billions of seed samples in a nuclear bomb proof multi-story underground vault. Its ultimate aim being to store every plant species possible. It is already (2024) home to over 2.4 billion seeds, representing over 39,000 different species of the world’s storable seeds. Importantly they also distribute seeds to other key locations around the world, do germination tests on each species every 10 years, and other important research.
* The Institute of Plant Genetic Resource in Saint Petersburg, Russia is probably the oldest and still one of the 5-6 largest in the world. It was started in 1924 by Russian geneticist and botanist Nikolai Vavilov and survived the 28-month Siege of Leningrad in World War II because several botanists starved to death rather than eat the collected seeds and potatoes. 
* The Australian PlantBank is located in the Australian Botanic Gardens, Mount Annan, New South Wales. It is part of the Millennium Seed Bank Project in London and incorporates the former NSW Seedbank, established in 1986 to preserve native Australian flora, especially NSW threatened species.
** The Australian Grains Genebank (AGG), in Horsham, Victoria, Australia, is a national center for storing genetic material for plant breeding and research. The Genebank is in a collaboration with the Australian Seed Bank Partnership on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. It was officially opened in March 2014 The primary reason for the bank to be created was the extreme temperatures in the area, up to in the summer time. Because of that they had to ensure the protection of the grains all year around. The Genebank aims to collect and conserve the seeds of Australian crop wild species, that are not yet adequately represented in existing collections.
** The George Hulbert Seed Vault in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, is dedicated to the preservation of rice varieties, including some predating the Green Revolution.
* Indian Seed Vault is a secure seed bank located in a high-altitude mountain pass on the Chang La in Ladakh, India. It was built in 2010 and is claimed to be the second largest in the world.
** The BBA (Beej Bachao Andolan — Save the Seeds movement) began in the late 1980s in Uttarakhand, India, led by Vijay Jardhari. Seed banks were created to store native varieties of seeds.
* The National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, in Fort Collins, Colorado, is the largest seed bank in the United States.
** Desert Legume Program (DELEP) in Tucson, Arizona, focuses on wild species of plants in the legume family (Fabaceae), specifically legumes from dry regions around the world. The DELEP seed bank currently has over 3,600 seed collections representing nearly 1,400 species of arid land legumes originating in 65 countries on six continents. It is backed up (at least in part) in National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, and in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The DELEP seed bank is an accredited collection of the North American Plant Conservation Consortium.
* The National Gene Bank of Plants of Ukraine was created in the 1990s in Ukraine. Described as one of the largest seed banks in the world, it was damaged during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but survived in substantial part.
* The INRAE Centre for Vegetable Germplasm in Avignon, France stores over 10,000 species of five vegetable crops as seeds: aubergine (eggplant), pepper, tomato, melon and lettuce collections, together with their wild or cultivated relatives. Species from the collections have geographically diverse origins, are generally well-described and fixed for traits of agronomic or scientific interest, and have available passport data.
* Meise Botanical Garden houses a seed bank in Belgium. Among other things, it aims to preserve endangered and rare wild species of Belgian flora.It also includes wild beans, wild bananas and seeds of the Copper plants of Katanga.

== Seed banks classification ==
Seed banks can be classified in three main profiles: assistentialist, productivist or preservationist. In practice, many seed banks have a combination of these three main types, and they may have different priorities depending on the context and goals of the seed bank.

# Assistentialist seed banks: These seed banks primarily aim to support the needs of local communities and small-scale farmers. They focus on providing seed samples that are well-suited to local conditions and are easy to grow and maintain. They prioritize seed samples that have high yield potential, are pest and disease resistant, and can be grown with minimal inputs.
# Productivist seed banks: These seed banks primarily aim to support large-scale agricultural production and commercial farming. They focus on providing seed samples that have high yield potential, are pest and disease resistant, and can be grown with minimal inputs. They prioritize seed samples that are well-suited to large-scale mechanized farming and can be grown in large quantities.
# Preservationist seed banks: These seed banks primarily aim to conserve the genetic diversity of wild and domesticated plant species. They focus on preserving the genetic diversity of plant species, and make seed samples available for research and breeding programs. They prioritize seed samples that are rare, endangered, or have unique genetic characteristics.

== Early concepts ==
In Zoroastrian mythology, Ahura Mazda instructed Yima, a legendary king of ancient Persia, to build an underground structure called a &quot;Vara&quot; to store two seeds from every kind of plant in the known world. The seeds had to come from plant specimens that were free of defects, and the structure itself had to withstand a 300-year apocalyptic winter. Some scholars have suggested that the Norse equivalent of this myth is the underground garden Odainsaker, which was intended to withstand the three-year &quot;fimbul&quot; winter preceding Ragnarok, to protect the people (and seemingly the plants) that would repopulate the world after this event.

<doc id="142187" wikidata="Q5021459" url="?curid=142187" title="Calke Abbey">
<text>Calke Abbey is a Grade I listed country house near Ticknall, Derbyshire, England, in the care of the charitable National Trust.

The site was an Augustinian priory from the 12th century until its dissolution by Henry VIII. The present building, named Calke Abbey in 1808, was never actually an abbey, but is a Baroque mansion built between 1701 and 1704.

The house was owned by the Harpur family for nearly 300 years until it was passed to the Trust in 1985 in lieu of death duties. Today, the house is open to the public and many of its rooms are deliberately displayed in the state of decline in which the house was handed to the Trust.

==History==
Calke Priory was founded by Richard d&#x27;Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester some time between 1115 and 1120 and was dedicated to St Giles; d&#x27;Avranches had inherited from his father vast estates in both England and Normandy, of which Calke and many of the surrounding villages were part. The Priory was initially an independent community, but after the death of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester in 1153, it (along with most of his Derbyshire estates) became part of the dowry of his widow, Maud of Gloucester. Maud initially granted nearby St. Wystan&#x27;s Church, Repton to the canons at Calke Priory, but subsequently had a new priory, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, built at Repton. In 1172 she moved the Canons from Calke to the new Repton Priory, with Calke then becoming a subordinate &quot;cell&quot; to Repton Priory.

Nothing is known of the priory during the 14th and 15th centuries; however, historian Oliver Garnett suggests the priory may have served more as the centre of an agricultural estate than as a religious establishment during this time.

During the Dissolution of the Monasteries of 1536 – 1541, Repton, along with other monasteries whose income was £200 or less, failed to escape the first wave and was dissolved in 1536. A reinstatement was possible through the payment of a fine and on 12 June 1537, Repton was reinstated, at a cost of £266 13s 4d. A loan to cover this huge amount was made possible by John Preste (Prest and other variations), a Master Grocer of London, for which he received from Prior John Young a 99-year lease dated 31 August 1537 for Calke Priory with various lands and permissions, stating 59 years being prepaid to reflect the amount lent. This lease appeared to secure Calke’s future but on 25 October 1538 Repton Priory was surrendered for the second and final time, and the freehold of Calke transferred back to the Crown. 

===Post-Dissolution===

When Repton was dissolved in 1538 John Preste relocated from London to Calke along with his family for safety. He remained until Thomas Cromwell was beheaded in 1540. During this time John converted Calke Priory into a Tudor house and his family remained at Calke Manor until his death in October 1546. In his will John left the remainder of the 99-year lease for Calke, which included the Tudor manor, to his youngest daughter Frances, aged about 8 years, with his wife Alice having custody and acting as guardian until Frances became of age or married. It stipulated that if Alice remained at Calke she was obliged to pay rent and cover the necessary repairs. A further condition stated that the lease was for Frances and her heirs only – meaning when she later married William Bradbourne in 1557, he was not allowed to take ownership of Calke, as was normal practice in Tudor times.

In January 1547 Alice married Richard Blackwell, lawyer of the Inner Temple, London and ignoring the fact that the legal owner of the lease was Frances, took everything of value as his ‘by rights of marriage to Alice&#x27;. He named himself as Calke’s owner in Queen Elizabeth’s Pardon Rolls in 1559 and in his will Richard referred to Calke Manor as the &#x27;Chief Mansion House&#x27;. Meanwhile the freehold of Calke was granted by King Edward VI to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick (later Duke of Northumberland), for services in Scotland. Due to the 99-year lease already in place for Calke, nothing was to be gained from this freehold, so he sold it on to John Beaumont of Grace Dieu and his sons Francis and Henry Beaumont.

Following the death of Richard Blackwell in 1568 (Alice having died in 1561) his executors retained the lease, despite the fact that it had been awarded to Frances in her father&#x27;s will. Her death in 1572, without any heirs, precipitated a court battle about the rightful ownership until 1573/4, when lawyer Richard Wendsley achieved a settlement to enjoy the lease under the title of John Smyth and Grace (nee Prest). In 1585 Wendsley defaulted on loans made by Robert Bainbridge, three-time MP for Derby, linked to the freehold and the leasehold of Calke, so Robert Bainbridge became the rightful legal owner of Calke. A final settlement was made to John Reames (Grace’s 2nd husband) and Grace to release their connection to Calke.

Robert Bainbridge was an avowed Protestant who was imprisoned in 1586 in the Beauchamp Tower of the Tower of London for refusing to accept Elizabeth I&#x27;s Church Settlement, and may have chosen to live at Calke as the parish was not under the control of a bishop. He requested that his body be laid to rest in the vault he had built in St. Giles Church. Following Robert&#x27;s death, Calke passed to his son Robert Bainbridge Jr, who sold the estate in 1622 to Sir Henry Harpur for £5,350.

The Tudor manor forms the core of the house that exists today, and parts are still visible within the house&#x27;s courtyard. Little was known about how Calke Manor looked until repair work on the current house was undertaken by the National Trust in 1988. The house was built around a courtyard with the south range serving as the entrance front, with a gatehouse; two projections in the foundations at the northeast and northwest reveal the locations of 2 stair-turrets. The work also revealed a later 17th-century arcaded loggia which were built next to both the stair-turrets. The east and west ranges of this house were not parallel; something that has distinctly affected the shape and layout of the current house. This discrepancy could either reflect the different phases of construction within the Tudor house or the layout and alignment of the walls of the original priory buildings.

===The Harpurs===

In 1622 the estate was bought by Sir Henry Harpur, 1st baronet (c. 1579–1639). The Harpur family had become established in the middle of the previous century; descendants of Richard Harpur who was a successful lawyer who had risen to become a judge at the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster and then Chief Justice of the County Palatine of Lancaster. He and his descendants acquired, through wealth and marriage, estates in Staffordshire (centred on Alstonfield) and Derbyshire (centred on Swarkestone).

The house was rebuilt by Sir John Harpur, 4th baronet (1680–1741) between 1701 and 1704. The house and estate were owned by successive Harpur baronets and were ultimately inherited by Sir Vauncey Harpur-Crewe, 10th Baronet (1846–1924), 10th (and last) baronet who was devoted to his vast collections of natural history assembled by the Harpurs and Harpur Crewes of Calke Abbey between 1793 and 1924. When he died, his eldest daughter, Hilda Harpur Crewe (1877–1949) sold some of his collection of birds, butterflies and fishes to pay death duties. She was succeeded by her nephew, Charles Jenney (1917–81), who was the eldest son of Frances Harpur Crewe, the fourth daughter of Sir Vauncey. Charles changed his name to Charles Harpur-Crewe. His sudden death in 1981 led to crippling death duties (£8m of an estate worth £14m) and in 1985 the estate was transferred to the National Trust by his younger brother Henry Harpur-Crewe (1921–91).

=== National Trust ownership ===

Set in the midst of a landscape park, Calke Abbey is presented by the National Trust as an illustration of the English country house in decline. At its time of endowment, there had been little change to many rooms since the 1880s. A massive amount of remedial work but no restoration has been done and interiors are almost as they were found in 1985, so the decay of the building and its interiors has been halted but not reversed.

== Estate ==
The Trust manages the surrounding landscape park with an eye to nature conservation. It contains such features as a walled garden, with a flower garden and a former physic garden, now managed as a kitchen garden. The ancient deer park of the Calke Abbey Estate is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve, particularly noted for its rare wood pasture habitat and associated deadwood invertebrate fauna. The estate is also listed at Grade II* on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

To the side of the house is a large quadrangle of buildings forming the old stable yard and farm, complete with old carriages and farm implements. The outbuildings incorporate a brewhouse that is linked to the main house by a tunnel.

The limestone quarries on the estate near Ticknall are the end point of the railway that took limestone to the Ashby Canal at Willesley basin and one of the tunnels can be seen restored and running under the drive. It closed in 1915.

<text>Sudbury Hall is a country house in Sudbury, Derbyshire, England. One of the country&#x27;s finest Restoration mansions, it has Grade I listed building status, and the garden is Grade II listed in Historic England&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens.

The National Trust Museum of Childhood is housed in the 19th-century servants&#x27; wing of Sudbury Hall.

==History==
In 1086, following the Norman Conquest, the manor of Sudbury was listed in the Domesday Book.

The Vernon family came to Sudbury as a result of the 16th-century marriage of the Sudbury heiress Ellen Montgomery to Sir John Vernon (d.1545), a son of Sir Henry Vernon of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire.

The present house at Sudbury was built shortly after the restoration of King Charles II, between 1660 and 1680 by George Vernon, grandfather of [[George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon]. George Vernon used his new-found wealth from marrying Northamptonshire heiress Margaret Onley to build a grand new mansion on the site of a smaller house. He kept meticulous accounts of the building project, and because there is no record of any payment to an architect, historians surmise that George designed Sudbury Hall himself. George Vernon also established the Estate village close to the Hall to provide housing for his servants, labourers and tradesmen. The buildings in the village still survive intact today.

Sudbury Hall was leased for three years from 1840 by Queen [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Adelaide]], the widow of [[William IV]]. The east wing was added by [[George Devey]] in 1876–83. By the late 19th century, the extent of the Sudbury Estate stretched from [[Cubley, Derbyshire|Cubley]] down to [[Marchington]] in [[Staffordshire]].

In 1916, [[George Venables-Vernon, 8th Baron Vernon]], died aged 26 in Malta from an illness contracted while in service as an officer in [[World War I]]. As a result, the Sudbury estate was subject to [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|Death duties]], the taxation which had been introduced in 1894 by the [[Liberal Government 1892–95|Liberal Government]]. As with many other large estates across Britain, this increased financial burden compelled [[Francis Venables-Vernon, 9th Baron Vernon]], to sell off tracts of land and some of the contents of Sudbury Hall. In the 1930s and 1940s, the 9th Lord was able to buy back some of this land to provide social housing in Sudbury village.

During [[World War II]], a [[United States Army Air Forces]] hospital was based in Sudbury Park, close to [[RAF Sudbury]]. The land was purchased by the government in 1948 and converted into [[HM Prison Sudbury]], with a housing estate for prison officers.

===National Trust===
Death duties continued to burden the Vernon family, and in 1967, Sudbury Hall and its principal contents along with part of the gardens and parkland, was transferred by John Venables-Vernon, 10th Baron Vernon via the [[National Land Fund]] to the [[National Trust]], in part payment of death duties. The remainder of the Sudbury Estate is still held by Vernon descendants.

In 2020 Sudbury Hall closed to the public for renovations, during which the National Trust consulted 100 child &quot;ambassadors&quot; to redesign the visitor experience for children. It reopened in October 2022, rebranded as &quot;The Children’s Country House at Sudbury&quot;, equipped with a dressing up and dancing area, a mirror ball, a neon sign with the words &quot;Party like it’s 1699&quot;, an [[escape room]] experience and humorous [[speech bubbles]] hung next to portraits. The revised visitor experience has been criticised by the Vernon Family; Joanna FitzAlan Howard, daughter of the 10th Baron Vernon accused the National Trust of &quot;[[dumbing down]]&quot; by turning her ancestral home into &quot;a child-centred theme park&quot;. The National Trust have stated that the new experience offers &quot;new ways for children to learn about the history of Sudbury Hall&quot; and that the speech bubbles inform children about &quot;hidden symbolism in historic portraits&quot;. The changes have also been criticised by the pressure group [[Restore Trust]] for discouraging adult visitors unaccompanied by children, and for removing the house contents to make way for &quot;fun active games and activities&quot;. In May 2023 the Children’s Country House at Sudbury was awarded Permanent Exhibition of the Year at the Museum and Heritage Awards 2023. Judges expressed the view that the redesign of Sudbury Hall offered a &quot;participatory and imaginative new bold approach to interpreting historic houses and heritage&quot;.

==Architecture==

Sudbury Hall dates from the [[Restoration style|Restoration era]], but George Vernon&#x27;s building is based on a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] design, with its ornate Great Staircase and Long Gallery. Notably, the [[state rooms]] are located on the west side of the building and the [[servants&#x27; quarters]] on the east side, a traditional layout preferred by Tudor architects. Architectural historian Cherry Ann Knott has suggested that the design of the hall was based on [[Crewe Hall]] in [[Cheshire]], which stands around 1.5 miles from [[Haslington Hall]], where George Vernon was born.

The house is a two-storey [[red brick]] building fronted with a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] main entrance porch, with two levels of paired [[columns]], each surmounted with a [[pediment]]. The carvings above the porch were sculpted by [[William Wilson (architect)|William Wilson]].

===Interior===
The interior of the house was completed in 1691. There have been a number of small alterations in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the interior was restored 1969-1971 by [[John Beresford Fowler]]. The Great Staircase, designed by [[Edward Pierce (sculptor)|Edward Pierce]], dates from c.1676 and is considered to be one of the finest Restoration staircases in Britain. It is noted for its white-painted balustrade with luxuriant, carved foliage. The landing ceiling is adorned with ornate plasterwork by Robert Bradbury and James Pettifer (1675) and ceiling paintings of mythological scenes by [[Louis Laguerre]]. Other plasterwork within the house was designed by Pettifer, Bradbury and Samuel Mansfield of Derby. Of particular note in the [[drawing room]] is an ornately carved [[overmantel]] by [[Grinling Gibbons]].

Between c.1872 and 1880, architect George Devey significantly modified and extended an early 19th-century servants&#x27; east wing to Sudbury Hall; this now houses the National Trust Museum of Childhood.

==Art collection==
Sudbury holds a large collection of portraits of Vernon family members, as well as other paintings and works of fine art. Of particular note are a portrait of George Vernon (1635/6-1702), the builder of Sudbury Hall, by [[John Michael Wright]], (oil on canvas, 1660). Other portraits in the collection include:

*Catherine Vernon (1663-1710), one of George Vernon&#x27;s wives, by [[John Riley (painter)|John Riley]] (oil on canvas, 1681); 
*[[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt]], [[Archbishop of York]], by Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]] (oil on canvas, 1823);
*Two [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]: [[Nell Gwyn]] by Sir [[Peter Lely]] (oil on canvas c.1675); and [[Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth]], attributed to Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]] (oil on canvas 1670)
*A pair of portraits of King [[George III]] and Queen [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] from the studio of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] (oil on canvas, 1779).

==Filming location==
The house was used for the internal [[Pemberley]] scenes in [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV serial)|the BBC dramatisation (1995)]] of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;[[Pride and Prejudice]]&quot;. The house&#x27;s centrally-positioned domed cap-house featured in the title shot of Yorkshire Television&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme &quot;[[The Book Tower]]&quot;.

<text>The Cathedral Church of All Saints, Derby, better known as Derby Cathedral, is a cathedral church in the city of Derby, England. In 1927, it was promoted from parish church status to that of a cathedral, creating a seat for the Bishop of Derby, which new Episcopal see was created in that year. The original church of All Saints was founded in the mid-10th century as a royal collegiate church, dedicated to All Saints. The main body of the church as it stands today is a Georgian rebuilding by James Gibbs, completed in 1725. The tower dates from the 16thcentury, and a retroquire was added in the 20thcentury. 

==History==
===All Saints&#x27; Church===
The original church, dedicated to All Saints, was probably built in about 943 by the Anglo-Saxon King Edmund I as a royal collegiate church, of which building no trace survives. Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, and according to the Domesday Book of 1086, it belonged to the king, and was served by a college of seven priests.

The Saxon building probably became structurally unstable, and was therefore demolished. A new building was constructed in the 14thcentury, which surviving drawings show was about the same size as the present building. In 1510–1532, the surviving tower was built in the Perpendicular Gothic style. On top of the tower are twelve large sculpted grotesque animal figures, three per face, and the sculpted stone head of a Green Man can be seen on each side of the main West Door at the base of the tower. The tower is built with Ashover Grit sandstone, sourced from nearby Duffield Bank quarry. 
in 1556, during the persecutions of Protestants during the reign of Queen Mary (1553–1558), Joan Waste was tried for heresy within the Church of All Saints, and was executed on the Burton Road in Derby.

The fabric of the church appears to have deteriorated severely from about 1650, and was in a ruinous state in 1700. In February 1723 the vicar, Dr Michael Hutchinson, having decided that a new building was required, made the decision unilaterally to demolish the church, and employed a gang of workmen to accomplish the task overnight. Having accepted this &quot;fait accompli&quot; handed to them, the Mayor and Corporation of Derby commenced fundraising for the building of a new church by inviting subscriptions for the purpose, and made the first donation themselves. Dr Hutchinson expended much effort in fundraising, which exertion may have adversely affected his health. He made a significant personal financial contribution to the fund, and his efforts are recorded on a memorial tablet in the South Aisle. Having encountered numerous disputes, Hutchinson eventually resigned in 1728 and died about eighteen months later, leaving numerous outstanding debts.

With the original 1530s tower retained, the rest of the church was rebuilt to a Neo-Classical design made in 1725 by the architect James Gibbs. In his &quot;Book of Architecture&quot;, Gibbs wrote as follows regarding All Saints&#x27; Church: &quot;It is the more beautiful for having no galleries, which, as well as pews, clog up and spoil the insides of churches ... the plainness of this building makes it less expensive, and renders it more suitable to the old steeple&quot;. To offset the rather austere interior, Gibbs introduced a wrought iron chancel screen, extending across the entire width of the church, manufactured by the local iron-smith and gate-maker Robert Bakewell, but not completed until five years after the new church was opened. The first sermon was preached in the new church on 25November 1725.

By Order in Council on 1July 1927, All Saints&#x27; Church became a cathedral. The new building was later extended eastwards with the addition of a retroquire designed by Sebastian Comper, constructed between 1967 and 1972.

The cathedral was registered as a charity on 9April 2024, with the Registered Charity Number 1207768.

==Monuments and furnishings==
The cathedral&#x27;s treasures include the 18th-century wrought iron rood screen manufactured by Robert Bakewell, for which he was paid £157.10.0d (150guineas); a monument with effigy of Bess of Hardwick, of Hardwick Hall; and monumental brasses of her descendants the Cavendish family (later the Dukes of Devonshire), including brasses of Henry Cavendish and of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. The entrance gates, moved to the cathedral from StMary&#x27;s Gate in 1957, were also made by Robert Bakewell. The gates were refurbished in 2012, and renamed the Queen ElizabethII Gates to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. Notable 20th-century additions are stained-glass windows designed by Ceri Richards, and a bronze crucifix by Ronald Pope.

==Clock and carillon==

In 1927 a new clock was installed by John Smith &amp; Son, Derby clockmakers, replacing one reputed to have been made by George Ashmore in 1738, but by then so worn as to be beyond its useful life. Until March 1976 this timekeeper and associated parts had been mechanically driven by heavy weights that had to be wound manually, some of them daily. This work had been undertaken by John Smith&#x27;s for many years, but rising costs caused the authorities to install an automatic winding mechanism to both the clock and the carillon, which sounds the bells.

Derby Cathedral&#x27;s clock has two dials, one facing West along StMary&#x27;s Gate, and one facing South down Irongate. Both are of stone and are 8feet in diameter. They were restored and gilded in 1964, then again in the early 21stcentury. The 1964 restoration proved beyond doubt that the long metal tubes driven through the tower walls to operate the clock mechanism were actually gun barrels (cavalry carbines) dating from the 1745 &#x27;uprising&#x27; of Bonnie Prince Charlie.

The carillon is the mechanical instrument that drives the tunes played upon the cathedral&#x27;s bells each day. It was installed by John Smith of Derby in 1931 to replace a machine of similar design, dating from the 17thcentury and subsequently enhanced towards the end of the 17thcentury by George Sorocold, a Derby millwright. The current machine plays a tune three times a day, and the seven tunes it plays are changed automatically each day. It is known that the tunes of the original machine were varied over the years, first by John Whitehurst at various times between 1745 and 1762, and then by John Smith in 1873.

There is documentary evidence to show that John Whitehurst was paid £3.3.0d (3guineas) for winding and care of the clock and carillon, although he is known to have paid from this sum the amount of £1.11.6d (1½gns.) to a MrFrost, who did the actual daily winding of the carillon.

On 3July 1976, one of the less well-known carillon tunes was replaced with the melody of &quot;The Derby Ram&quot;, a regimental march associated with the Sherwood Foresters, so that it would become a permanent reminder of the Regiment&#x27;s association with the town and county of Derby.

The tunes are currently played at 9am, 12noon and 6pm as follows:
*Sunday — Thaxted
*Monday — Truro
*Tuesday — The Shady Bowers
*Wednesday — All Saints
*Thursday — Lass of Paittie&#x27;s Mill
*Friday — The Highland Laddie
*Saturday — The Derby Ram
They can be listened to live on a local webcam feed.
(The previous carillon played at 3, 6, 9, and 12 both night and day.)

==Tower and bells==
Derby Cathedral has the oldest ring of ten bells in the world. Most of them have been there since 1678, when the number of bells was increased from six to ten. The largest bell weighs 19cwt (965kg), its note is D-flat and it is over 500 years old — older than the tower itself. It is believed that it came from Dale Abbey in Erewash in Derbyshire at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The youngest bell, no.3, is dated 1693, so all the bells are over 300 years old. Bell no.8 was in Ashbourne parish church until 1815. A carillon in the tower uses the same bells to provide a tune at 9am, 12noon and 6pm. The bells used to hang in a wooden frame; when the church became a cathedral in 1927, the bells were retuned and rehung at a lower level in a new metal frame.

On 28October 1732, a Frenchman called Gillinoe &#x27;flew&#x27; down on a rope from the top of All Saints&#x27; steeple. He did this on a number of occasions, landing variously at StMichael&#x27;s church and at the bottom of StMary&#x27;s Gate. On one occasion an ass was sent down the rope, but it broke under the weight and a number of onlookers were injured.

On 25July 1940, a wartime barrage balloon broke loose from its moorings during a heavy storm and, as it floated past, its chain caught round one of the pinnacles on the tower and demolished the top half of the pinnacle.

In late 2005, it was discovered that a pair of peregrine falcons had taken up residence on the cathedral tower. In 2006 a nesting platform was installed, and they nested there in April of that year. Webcams were installed in 2007, 2008 and 2013 to enable the birds to be seen at close range without being disturbed by human contact. The same pair successfully reared chicks every year up to and including 2016. However, on 27March 2017 it became clear that a new male had taken over the nesting platform and ousted his predecessor who, by that time, was at least 14years old. It is not known whether the first male died of old age, or was chased away or killed by the new one after a fight. The female accepted the new male and together they produced, somewhat later than in previous years, four eggs, three of which successfully hatched into one male and two female chicks.

In 2009, more than 150 members of the Derby Mountain Rescue Team abseiled down the tower for charity. Further sponsored abseils have taken place every year since, and in 2012 this included the Assistant Curate, Andy Trenier, and the Dean of Derby Cathedral, Dr John Davies.

==Cathedral Centre==
The Derby Cathedral Centre is opposite the west doors on Irongate. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It once included a café, a bookshop and an exhibition space, featuring work by local artists, but since March 2020 the shop and café have remained closed. The Cathedral Centre also houses the cathedral offices and meeting rooms.

In 2017, the Cathedral Café won the annual Derby Food and Drinks Award for Best Customer Service.

* Henry Cavendish
* Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire
* John Lombe

==Music==
===Organs and organists===
====Organ====

In 1939, an organ was installed by John Compton of London, although it did not gain its impressive case (designed by Sebastian Comper) until 1963. It is played from a four-manual console in the Consistory Court area of the cathedral, and was overhauled in 1992. In 1973, an additional instrument was installed in the new retroquire (east end) by Cousans of Lincoln.

====Organists====
Between April 2013 and December 2014, Canon Peter Gould undertook a musical pilgrimage of 270 churches, in which he raised £7,478.78 over 39tour days, performing to a collective audience of over 3,500 people. During the tour, three church organs were found to be in a poor state.

<text>This list of museums in [[Scotland]] contains museums which are defined for this context as institutions (including nonprofit organisations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Also included are non-profit art galleries and university art galleries. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not included. Many other small historical displays are located in the country&#x27;s stately homes, castles and public libraries.

<text>Triprolidine is an over-the-counter antihistamine with anticholinergic properties. It is used to combat the symptoms associated with allergies and is sometimes combined with other cold medications designed to provide general relief for flu-like symptoms. As with many antihistamines, the most common side effect is drowsiness.

Today, Triprolidine is used less frequently and has been replaced in popular medications by other antihistamines like Diphenhydramine, Promethazine, Chlorpheniramine, as well as second generation antihistamines like Loratadine and Fexofenadine. Triprolidine remains an ingredient in the cold medicine Actifed in many territories. 
It was patented in 1948 and came into medical use in 1953.

<doc id="142207" wikidata="Q420904" url="?curid=142207" title="Singular value decomposition">
<text>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix into a rotation, followed by a rescaling followed by another rotation. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix. It is related to the polar decomposition.

Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an formula_1 complex matrix is a factorization of the form formula_2 where is an complex unitary matrix, formula_3 is an formula_1 rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, is an formula_5 complex unitary matrix, and formula_6 is the conjugate transpose of . Such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix. If is real, then and can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices; in such contexts, the SVD is often denoted formula_7

The diagonal entries formula_8 of formula_3 are uniquely determined by and are known as the singular values of . The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of . The columns of and the columns of are called left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of , respectively. They form two sets of orthonormal bases and and if they are sorted so that the singular values formula_10 with value zero are all in the highest-numbered columns (or rows), the singular value decomposition can be written as

formula_11

where formula_12 is the rank of 

The SVD is not unique. However, it is always possible to choose the decomposition such that the singular values formula_13 are in descending order. In this case, formula_3 (but not and ) is uniquely determined by 

The term sometimes refers to the compact SVD, a similar decomposition in which is square diagonal of size where is the rank of and has only the non-zero singular values. In this variant, is an semi-unitary matrix and formula_15 is an semi-unitary matrix, such that formula_16

Mathematical applications of the SVD include computing the pseudoinverse, matrix approximation, and determining the rank, range, and null space of a matrix. The SVD is also extremely useful in all areas of science, engineering, and statistics, such as signal processing, least squares fitting of data, and process control.

== Intuitive interpretations ==

=== Rotation, coordinate scaling, and reflection ===
In the special case when is an real square matrix, the matrices and can be chosen to be real matrices too. In that case, &quot;unitary&quot; is the same as &quot;orthogonal&quot;. Then, interpreting both unitary matrices as well as the diagonal matrix, summarized here as as a linear transformation of the space the matrices and represent rotations or reflection of the space, while represents the scaling of each coordinate by the factor Thus the SVD decomposition breaks down any linear transformation of into a composition of three geometrical transformations: a rotation or reflection followed by a coordinate-by-coordinate scaling followed by another rotation or reflection 

In particular, if has a positive determinant, then and can be chosen to be both rotations with reflections, or both rotations without reflections. If the determinant is negative, exactly one of them will have a reflection. If the determinant is zero, each can be independently chosen to be of either type.

If the matrix is real but not square, namely with it can be interpreted as a linear transformation from to Then and can be chosen to be rotations/reflections of and respectively; and besides scaling the first coordinates, also extends the vector with zeros, i.e. removes trailing coordinates, so as to turn into 

=== Singular values as semiaxes of an ellipse or ellipsoid ===
As shown in the figure, the singular values can be interpreted as the magnitude of the semiaxes of an ellipse in 2D. This concept can be generalized to -dimensional Euclidean space, with the singular values of any square matrix being viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an -dimensional ellipsoid. Similarly, the singular values of any matrix can be viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an -dimensional ellipsoid in -dimensional space, for example as an ellipse in a (tilted) 2D plane in a 3D space. Singular values encode magnitude of the semiaxis, while singular vectors encode direction. See below for further details.

=== The columns of and are orthonormal bases ===
Since and are unitary, the columns of each of them form a set of orthonormal vectors, which can be regarded as basis vectors. The matrix maps the basis vector to the stretched unit vector By the definition of a unitary matrix, the same is true for their conjugate transposes and except the geometric interpretation of the singular values as stretches is lost. In short, the columns of and are orthonormal bases. When is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix, and are both equal to the unitary matrix used to diagonalize However, when is not positive-semidefinite and Hermitian but still diagonalizable, its eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition are distinct.

=== Relation to the four fundamental subspaces ===
* The first columns of are a basis of the column space of .
* The last columns of are a basis of the null space of .
* The first columns of are a basis of the column space of (the row space of in the real case).
* The last columns of are a basis of the null space of .

=== Geometric meaning ===
Because and are unitary, we know that the columns of yield an orthonormal basis of and the columns of yield an orthonormal basis of (with respect to the standard scalar products on these spaces).

The linear transformation

formula_17

has a particularly simple description with respect to these orthonormal bases: we have

formula_18

where is the -th diagonal entry of and for 

The geometric content of the SVD theorem can thus be summarized as follows: for every linear map one can find orthonormal bases of and such that maps the -th basis vector of to a non-negative multiple of the -th basis vector of and sends the leftover basis vectors to zero. With respect to these bases, the map is therefore represented by a diagonal matrix with non-negative real diagonal entries.

To get a more visual flavor of singular values and SVD factorization – at least when working on real vector spaces – consider the sphere of radius one in The linear map maps this sphere onto an ellipsoid in Non-zero singular values are simply the lengths of the semi-axes of this ellipsoid. Especially when and all the singular values are distinct and non-zero, the SVD of the linear map can be easily analyzed as a succession of three consecutive moves: consider the ellipsoid and specifically its axes; then consider the directions in sent by onto these axes. These directions happen to be mutually orthogonal. Apply first an isometry sending these directions to the coordinate axes of On a second move, apply an endomorphism diagonalized along the coordinate axes and stretching or shrinking in each direction, using the semi-axes lengths of as stretching coefficients. The composition then sends the unit-sphere onto an ellipsoid isometric to To define the third and last move, apply an isometry to this ellipsoid to obtain As can be easily checked, the composition coincides with 

== Example ==
Consider the matrix

formula_19

A singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by 

formula_20

The scaling matrix is zero outside of the diagonal (grey italics) and one diagonal element is zero (red bold, light blue bold in dark mode). Furthermore, because the matrices and are unitary, multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yields identity matrices, as shown below. In this case, because and are real valued, each is an orthogonal matrix.

formula_21

This particular singular value decomposition is not unique. For instance, we can keep and the same, but change the last two rows of such that

formula_22

and get an equally valid singular value decomposition. As the matrix has rank 3, it has only 3 nonzero singular values. In taking the product , the final column of and the final two rows of are multiplied by zero, so have no effect on the matrix product, and can be replaced by any unit vectors which are orthogonal to the first three and to each-other.

The compact SVD, , eliminates these superfluous rows, columns, and singular values:

formula_23

== SVD and spectral decomposition ==
=== Singular values, singular vectors, and their relation to the SVD ===
A non-negative real number is a singular value for if and only if there exist unit-length vectors in and in such that

formula_24

The vectors and are called left-singular and right-singular vectors for respectively.

In any singular value decomposition

formula_25

the diagonal entries of are equal to the singular values of The first columns of and are, respectively, left- and right-singular vectors for the corresponding singular values. Consequently, the above theorem implies that:
* An matrix has at most distinct singular values.
* It is always possible to find a unitary basis for with a subset of basis vectors spanning the left-singular vectors of each singular value of 
* It is always possible to find a unitary basis for with a subset of basis vectors spanning the right-singular vectors of each singular value of 

A singular value for which we can find two left (or right) singular vectors that are linearly independent is called &quot;degenerate&quot;. If and are two left-singular vectors which both correspond to the singular value σ, then any normalized linear combination of the two vectors is also a left-singular vector corresponding to the singular value σ. The similar statement is true for right-singular vectors. The number of independent left and right-singular vectors coincides, and these singular vectors appear in the same columns of and corresponding to diagonal elements of all with the same value 

As an exception, the left and right-singular vectors of singular value 0 comprise all unit vectors in the cokernel and kernel, respectively, of which by the rank–nullity theorem cannot be the same dimension if Even if all singular values are nonzero, if then the cokernel is nontrivial, in which case is padded with orthogonal vectors from the cokernel. Conversely, if then is padded by orthogonal vectors from the kernel. However, if the singular value of exists, the extra columns of or already appear as left or right-singular vectors.

Non-degenerate singular values always have unique left- and right-singular vectors, up to multiplication by a unit-phase factor (for the real case up to a sign). Consequently, if all singular values of a square matrix are non-degenerate and non-zero, then its singular value decomposition is unique, up to multiplication of a column of by a unit-phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the corresponding column of by the same unit-phase factor.
In general, the SVD is unique up to arbitrary unitary transformations applied uniformly to the column vectors of both and spanning the subspaces of each singular value, and up to arbitrary unitary transformations on vectors of and spanning the kernel and cokernel, respectively, of 

=== Relation to eigenvalue decomposition ===
The singular value decomposition is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any matrix, whereas eigenvalue decomposition can only be applied to square diagonalizable matrices. Nevertheless, the two decompositions are related.

If has SVD the following two relations hold:

formula_26

The right-hand sides of these relations describe the eigenvalue decompositions of the left-hand sides. Consequently:

* The columns of (referred to as right-singular vectors) are eigenvectors of 
* The columns of (referred to as left-singular vectors) are eigenvectors of 
* The non-zero elements of (non-zero singular values) are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of or 

In the special case of being a normal matrix, and thus also square, the spectral theorem ensures that it can be unitarily diagonalized using a basis of eigenvectors, and thus decomposed as for some unitary matrix and diagonal matrix with complex elements along the diagonal. When is positive semi-definite, will be non-negative real numbers so that the decomposition is also a singular value decomposition. Otherwise, it can be recast as an SVD by moving the phase of each to either its corresponding or The natural connection of the SVD to non-normal matrices is through the polar decomposition theorem: where is positive semidefinite and normal, and is unitary.

Thus, except for positive semi-definite matrices, the eigenvalue decomposition and SVD of while related, differ: the eigenvalue decomposition is where is not necessarily unitary and is not necessarily positive semi-definite, while the SVD is where is diagonal and positive semi-definite, and and are unitary matrices that are not necessarily related except through the matrix While only non-defective square matrices have an eigenvalue decomposition, any matrix has a SVD.

==Applications of the SVD==

===Pseudoinverse===
The singular value decomposition can be used for computing the pseudoinverse of a matrix. The pseudoinverse of the matrix with singular value decomposition is

formula_27

where formula_28 is the pseudoinverse of formula_29, which is formed by replacing every non-zero diagonal entry by its reciprocal and transposing the resulting matrix. The pseudoinverse is one way to solve linear least squares problems.

===Solving homogeneous linear equations===
A set of homogeneous linear equations can be written as for a matrix and vector A typical situation is that is known and a non-zero is to be determined which satisfies the equation. Such an belongs to &#x27;s null space and is sometimes called a (right) null vector of The vector can be characterized as a right-singular vector corresponding to a singular value of that is zero. This observation means that if is a square matrix and has no vanishing singular value, the equation has no non-zero as a solution. It also means that if there are several vanishing singular values, any linear combination of the corresponding right-singular vectors is a valid solution. Analogously to the definition of a (right) null vector, a non-zero satisfying with denoting the conjugate transpose of is called a left null vector of 

===Total least squares minimization===
A total least squares problem seeks the vector that minimizes the 2-norm of a vector under the constraint formula_30 The solution turns out to be the right-singular vector of corresponding to the smallest singular value.

===Range, null space and rank===
Another application of the SVD is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of a matrix The right-singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of span the null space of and the left-singular vectors corresponding to the non-zero singular values of span the range of For example, in the above example the null space is spanned by the last row of and the range is spanned by the first three columns of 

As a consequence, the rank of equals the number of non-zero singular values which is the same as the number of non-zero diagonal elements in formula_3. In numerical linear algebra the singular values can be used to determine the &quot;effective rank&quot; of a matrix, as rounding error may lead to small but non-zero singular values in a rank deficient matrix. Singular values beyond a significant gap are assumed to be numerically equivalent to zero.

===Low-rank matrix approximation===
Some practical applications need to solve the problem of approximating a matrix with another matrix formula_32, said to be truncated, which has a specific rank . In the case that the approximation is based on minimizing the Frobenius norm of the difference between and under the constraint that formula_33 it turns out that the solution is given by the SVD of namely

formula_34

where formula_35 is the same matrix as formula_3 except that it contains only the largest singular values (the other singular values are replaced by zero). This is known as the Eckart–Young theorem, as it was proved by those two authors in 1936 (although it was later found to have been known to earlier authors; see ).

===Separable models===
The SVD can be thought of as decomposing a matrix into a weighted, ordered sum of separable matrices. By separable, we mean that a matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors or, in coordinates, Specifically, the matrix can be decomposed as,

formula_37

Here and are the -th columns of the corresponding SVD matrices, are the ordered singular values, and each is separable. The SVD can be used to find the decomposition of an image processing filter into separable horizontal and vertical filters. Note that the number of non-zero is exactly the rank of the matrix. Separable models often arise in biological systems, and the SVD factorization is useful to analyze such systems. For example, some visual area V1 simple cells&#x27; receptive fields can be well described by a Gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by a modulation function in the time domain. Thus, given a linear filter evaluated through, for example, reverse correlation, one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension, thus yielding a two-dimensional filter (space, time) which can be decomposed through SVD. The first column of in the SVD factorization is then a Gabor while the first column of represents the time modulation (or vice versa). One may then define an index of separability

formula_38

which is the fraction of the power in the matrix M which is accounted for by the first separable matrix in the decomposition.

===Nearest orthogonal matrix===
It is possible to use the SVD of a square matrix to determine the orthogonal matrix closest to The closeness of fit is measured by the Frobenius norm of The solution is the product This intuitively makes sense because an orthogonal matrix would have the decomposition where is the identity matrix, so that if then the product amounts to replacing the singular values with ones. Equivalently, the solution is the unitary matrix of the Polar Decomposition formula_39 in either order of stretch and rotation, as described above.

A similar problem, with interesting applications in shape analysis, is the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which consists of finding an orthogonal matrix which most closely maps to Specifically,

formula_40

where formula_41 denotes the Frobenius norm.

This problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to a given matrix formula_42.

===The Kabsch algorithm===
The Kabsch algorithm (called Wahba&#x27;s problem in other fields) uses SVD to compute the optimal rotation (with respect to least-squares minimization) that will align a set of points with a corresponding set of points. It is used, among other applications, to compare the structures of molecules.

===Signal processing===
The SVD and pseudoinverse have been successfully applied to signal processing, image processing and big data (e.g., in genomic signal processing).

===Other examples===
The SVD is also applied extensively to the study of linear inverse problems and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of Tikhonov. It is widely used in statistics, where it is related to principal component analysis and to correspondence analysis, and in signal processing and pattern recognition. It is also used in output-only modal analysis, where the non-scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors. Yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural-language text processing.

In general numerical computation involving linear or linearized systems, there is a universal constant that characterizes the regularity or singularity of a problem, which is the system&#x27;s &quot;condition number&quot; formula_43. It often controls the error rate or convergence rate of a given computational scheme on such systems.

The SVD also plays a crucial role in the field of quantum information, in a form often referred to as the Schmidt decomposition. Through it, states of two quantum systems are naturally decomposed, providing a necessary and sufficient condition for them to be entangled: if the rank of the formula_3 matrix is larger than one.

One application of SVD to rather large matrices is in numerical weather prediction, where Lanczos methods are used to estimate the most linearly quickly growing few perturbations to the central numerical weather prediction over a given initial forward time period; i.e., the singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the linearized propagator for the global weather over that time interval. The output singular vectors in this case are entire weather systems. These perturbations are then run through the full nonlinear model to generate an ensemble forecast, giving a handle on some of the uncertainty that should be allowed for around the current central prediction.

SVD has also been applied to reduced order modelling. The aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in a complex system which is to be modeled. SVD was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three-dimensional unsteady flow problems.

Interestingly, SVD has been used to improve gravitational waveform modeling by the ground-based gravitational-wave interferometer aLIGO. SVD can help to increase the accuracy and speed of waveform generation to support gravitational-waves searches and update two different waveform models.

Singular value decomposition is used in recommender systems to predict people&#x27;s item ratings. Distributed algorithms have been developed for the purpose of calculating the SVD on clusters of commodity machines.

Low-rank SVD has been applied for hotspot detection from spatiotemporal data with application to disease outbreak detection. A combination of SVD and higher-order SVD also has been applied for real time event detection from complex data streams (multivariate data with space and time dimensions) in disease surveillance.

In astrodynamics, the SVD and its variants are used as an option to determine suitable maneuver directions for transfer trajectory design and orbital station-keeping.

By the extreme value theorem, this continuous function attains a maximum at some when restricted to the unit sphere formula_46 By the Lagrange multipliers theorem, necessarily satisfies

formula_47

for some real number The nabla symbol, , is the del operator (differentiation with respect to Using the symmetry of we obtain

formula_48

Therefore so is a unit length eigenvector of For every unit length eigenvector of its eigenvalue is so is the largest eigenvalue of The same calculation performed on the orthogonal complement of gives the next largest eigenvalue and so on. The complex Hermitian case is similar; there is a real-valued function of real variables.

Singular values are similar in that they can be described algebraically or from variational principles. Although, unlike the eigenvalue case, Hermiticity, or symmetry, of is no longer required.

This section gives these two arguments for existence of singular value decomposition.

=== Based on the spectral theorem ===
Let formula_49 be an complex matrix. Since formula_50 is positive semi-definite and Hermitian, by the spectral theorem, there exists an unitary matrix formula_15 such that

formula_52

where formula_53 is diagonal and positive definite, of dimension formula_54, with formula_55 the number of non-zero eigenvalues of formula_50 (which can be shown to verify formula_57). Note that formula_15 is here by definition a matrix whose formula_59-th column is the formula_59-th eigenvector of formula_50, corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_62. Moreover, the formula_63-th column of formula_15, for formula_65, is an eigenvector of formula_50 with eigenvalue formula_67. This can be expressed by writing formula_15 as formula_69, where the columns of formula_70 and formula_71 therefore contain the eigenvectors of formula_50 corresponding to non-zero and zero eigenvalues, respectively. Using this rewriting of formula_15, the equation becomes:

formula_74

This implies that

formula_75

Moreover, the second equation implies formula_76. Finally, the unitary-ness of formula_15 translates, in terms of formula_70 and formula_71, into the following conditions:

formula_80

where the subscripts on the identity matrices are used to remark that they are of different dimensions.

Let us now define

formula_81

Then,

formula_82

since formula_83 This can be also seen as immediate consequence of the fact that formula_84. This is equivalent to the observation that if formula_85 is the set of eigenvectors of formula_50 corresponding to non-vanishing eigenvalues formula_87, then formula_88 is a set of orthogonal vectors, and formula_89 is a (generally not complete) set of &quot;orthonormal&quot; vectors. This matches with the matrix formalism used above denoting with formula_70 the matrix whose columns are formula_85, with formula_71 the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of formula_50 with vanishing eigenvalue, and formula_94 the matrix whose columns are the vectors formula_89.

We see that this is almost the desired result, except that formula_94 and formula_70 are in general not unitary, since they might not be square. However, we do know that the number of rows of formula_94 is no smaller than the number of columns, since the dimensions of formula_53 is no greater than formula_100 and formula_101. Also, since

formula_102

the columns in formula_94 are orthonormal and can be extended to an orthonormal basis. This means that we can choose formula_104 such that formula_105 is unitary.

For we already have to make it unitary. Now, define

formula_106

where extra zero rows are added or removed to make the number of zero rows equal the number of columns of and hence the overall dimensions of formula_3 equal to formula_108. Then

formula_109

which is the desired result:

formula_110

Notice the argument could begin with diagonalizing rather than (This shows directly that and have the same non-zero eigenvalues).

=== Based on variational characterization ===
The singular values can also be characterized as the maxima of considered as a function of and over particular subspaces. The singular vectors are the values of and where these maxima are attained.

Let denote an matrix with real entries. Let be the unit formula_111-sphere in formula_112, and define formula_113 formula_114 formula_115

Consider the function restricted to Since both and are compact sets, their product is also compact. Furthermore, since is continuous, it attains a largest value for at least one pair of vectors in and in This largest value is denoted and the corresponding vectors are denoted and Since is the largest value of it must be non-negative. If it were negative, changing the sign of either or would make it positive and therefore larger.

Statement. and are left and right-singular vectors of with corresponding singular value 

Proof. Similar to the eigenvalues case, by assumption the two vectors satisfy the Lagrange multiplier equation:

formula_116

After some algebra, this becomes

formula_117

Multiplying the first equation from left by and the second equation from left by and taking formula_118 into account gives

formula_119

Plugging this into the pair of equations above, we have

formula_120

This proves the statement.

More singular vectors and singular values can be found by maximizing over normalized and which are orthogonal to and respectively.

The passage from real to complex is similar to the eigenvalue case.

== Calculating the SVD ==
=== One-sided Jacobi algorithm ===
One-sided Jacobi algorithm is an iterative algorithm,
where a matrix is iteratively transformed into a matrix with orthogonal columns. The elementary iteration is given as a Jacobi rotation,

formula_121

where the angle formula_122 of the Jacobi rotation matrix formula_123 is chosen such that after the rotation the columns with numbers formula_124 and formula_125 become orthogonal. The indices formula_126 are swept cyclically, formula_127, where formula_100 is the number of columns.

After the algorithm has converged, the singular value decomposition formula_129 is recovered as follows: the matrix formula_130 is the accumulation of Jacobi rotation matrices, the matrix formula_131 is given by normalising the columns of the transformed matrix formula_132, and the singular values are given as the norms of the columns of the transformed matrix formula_132.

=== Two-sided Jacobi algorithm ===
Two-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm—a generalization of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm—is an iterative algorithm where a square matrix is iteratively transformed into a diagonal matrix. If the matrix is not square the QR decomposition is performed first and then the algorithm is applied to the formula_134 matrix. The elementary iteration zeroes a pair of off-diagonal elements by first applying a Givens rotation to symmetrize the pair of elements and then applying a Jacobi transformation to zero them,

formula_135

where formula_136 is the Givens rotation matrix with the angle chosen such that the given pair of off-diagonal elements become equal after the rotation, and where formula_137 is the Jacobi transformation matrix that zeroes these off-diagonal elements. The iterations proceeds exactly as in the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm: by cyclic sweeps over all off-diagonal elements.

After the algorithm has converged the resulting diagonal matrix contains the singular values.
The matrices formula_131 and formula_130 are accumulated as follows:
formula_140,
formula_141.

=== Numerical approach ===
The singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations:
* The left-singular vectors of are a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of .
* The right-singular vectors of are a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of .
* The non-zero singular values of (found on the diagonal entries of formula_3) are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of both and .

The SVD of a matrix is typically computed by a two-step procedure. In the first step, the matrix is reduced to a bidiagonal matrix. This takes order floating-point operations (flop), assuming that The second step is to compute the SVD of the bidiagonal matrix. This step can only be done with an iterative method (as with eigenvalue algorithms). However, in practice it suffices to compute the SVD up to a certain precision, like the machine epsilon. If this precision is considered constant, then the second step takes iterations, each costing flops. Thus, the first step is more expensive, and the overall cost is flops .

The first step can be done using Householder reflections for a cost of 
 flops, assuming that only the singular values are needed and not the singular vectors. If is much larger than then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix to a triangular matrix with the QR decomposition and then use Householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form; the combined cost is flops .

The second step can be done by a variant of the QR algorithm for the computation of eigenvalues, which was first described by . The LAPACK subroutine DBDSQR implements this iterative method, with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small . Together with a first step using Householder reflections and, if appropriate, QR decomposition, this forms the DGESVD routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition.

The same algorithm is implemented in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). The GSL also offers an alternative method that uses a one-sided Jacobi orthogonalization in step 2 . This method computes the SVD of the bidiagonal matrix by solving a sequence of SVD problems, similar to how the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm solves a sequence of eigenvalue methods . Yet another method for step 2 uses the idea of divide-and-conquer eigenvalue algorithms .

There is an alternative way that does not explicitly use the eigenvalue decomposition. Usually the singular value problem of a matrix is converted into an equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem such as or 

formula_143

The approaches that use eigenvalue decompositions are based on the QR algorithm, which is well-developed to be stable and fast. 
Note that the singular values are real and right- and left- singular vectors are not required to form similarity transformations. One can iteratively alternate between the QR decomposition and the LQ decomposition to find the real diagonal Hermitian matrices. The QR decomposition gives and the LQ decomposition of gives Thus, at every iteration, we have update and repeat the orthogonalizations. Eventually, this iteration between QR decomposition and LQ decomposition produces left- and right- unitary singular matrices. This approach cannot readily be accelerated, as the QR algorithm can with spectral shifts or deflation. This is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformations. However, this iterative approach is very simple to implement, so is a good choice when speed does not matter. This method also provides insight into how purely orthogonal/unitary transformations can obtain the SVD.

=== Analytic result of 2 × 2 SVD ===
The singular values of a matrix can be found analytically. Let the matrix be
formula_144

where formula_145 are complex numbers that parameterize the matrix, is the identity matrix, and formula_10 denote the Pauli matrices. Then its two singular values are given by

formula_147

==Reduced SVDs==
In applications it is quite unusual for the full SVD, including a full unitary decomposition of the null-space of the matrix, to be required. Instead, it is often sufficient (as well as faster, and more economical for storage) to compute a reduced version of the SVD. The following can be distinguished for an matrix of rank :

===Thin SVD===
The thin, or economy-sized, SVD of a matrix is given by

formula_148

where formula_149 the matrices and contain only the first columns of and and contains only the first singular values from The matrix is thus is diagonal, and is 

The thin SVD uses significantly less space and computation time if The first stage in its calculation will usually be a QR decomposition of which can make for a significantly quicker calculation in this case.

===Compact SVD===

The compact SVD of a matrix is given by

formula_150

Only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the non-zero singular values are calculated. The remaining vectors of and are not calculated. This is quicker and more economical than the thin SVD if The matrix is thus is diagonal, and is 

===Truncated SVD===
In many applications the number of the non-zero singular values is large making even the Compact SVD impractical to compute. In such cases, the smallest singular values may need to be truncated to compute only non-zero singular values. The truncated SVD is no longer an exact decomposition of the original matrix but rather provides the optimal low-rank matrix approximation by any matrix of a fixed rank 

formula_151

where matrix is is diagonal, and is Only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the largest singular values are calculated. This can be much quicker and more economical than the compact SVD if but requires a completely different toolset of numerical solvers.

In applications that require an approximation to the Moore–Penrose inverse of the matrix the smallest singular values of are of interest, which are more challenging to compute compared to the largest ones.

Truncated SVD is employed in latent semantic indexing.

==Norms==

=== Ky Fan norms ===
The sum of the largest singular values of is a matrix norm, the Ky Fan -norm of 

The first of the Ky Fan norms, the Ky Fan 1-norm, is the same as the operator norm of as a linear operator with respect to the Euclidean norms of and In other words, the Ky Fan 1-norm is the operator norm induced by the standard formula_152 Euclidean inner product. For this reason, it is also called the operator 2-norm. One can easily verify the relationship between the Ky Fan 1-norm and singular values. It is true in general, for a bounded operator on (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces

formula_153

But, in the matrix case, is a normal matrix, so formula_154 is the largest eigenvalue of i.e. the largest singular value of 

The last of the Ky Fan norms, the sum of all singular values, is the trace norm (also known as the &#x27;nuclear norm&#x27;), defined by formula_155 (the eigenvalues of are the squares of the singular values).

=== Hilbert–Schmidt norm ===
The singular values are related to another norm on the space of operators. Consider the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product on the matrices, defined by

formula_156

So the induced norm is

formula_157

Since the trace is invariant under unitary equivalence, this shows

formula_158

where are the singular values of This is called the Frobenius norm, Schatten 2-norm, or Hilbert–Schmidt norm of Direct calculation shows that the Frobenius norm of coincides with:

formula_159

In addition, the Frobenius norm and the trace norm (the nuclear norm) are special cases of the Schatten norm.

== Variations and generalizations ==

=== Scale-invariant SVD ===

The singular values of a matrix are uniquely defined and are invariant with respect to left and/or right unitary transformations of In other words, the singular values of for unitary matrices and are equal to the singular values of This is an important property for applications in which it is necessary to preserve Euclidean distances and invariance with respect to rotations.

The Scale-Invariant SVD, or SI-SVD, is analogous to the conventional SVD except that its uniquely-determined singular values are invariant with respect to diagonal transformations of In other words, the singular values of for invertible diagonal matrices and are equal to the singular values of This is an important property for applications for which invariance to the choice of units on variables (e.g., metric versus imperial units) is needed.

=== Bounded operators on Hilbert spaces ===
The factorization can be extended to a bounded operator on a separable Hilbert space Namely, for any bounded operator there exist a partial isometry a unitary a measure space and a non-negative measurable such that

formula_160

where is the multiplication by on 

This can be shown by mimicking the linear algebraic argument for the matrix case above. is the unique positive square root of as given by the Borel functional calculus for self-adjoint operators. The reason why need not be unitary is that, unlike the finite-dimensional case, given an isometry with nontrivial kernel, a suitable may not be found such that

formula_161

is a unitary operator.

As for matrices, the singular value factorization is equivalent to the polar decomposition for operators: we can simply write

formula_162

and notice that is still a partial isometry while is positive.

=== Singular values and compact operators ===
The notion of singular values and left/right-singular vectors can be extended to compact operator on Hilbert space as they have a discrete spectrum. If is compact, every non-zero in its spectrum is an eigenvalue. Furthermore, a compact self-adjoint operator can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors. If is compact, so is . Applying the diagonalization result, the unitary image of its positive square root has a set of orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to strictly positive eigenvalues . For any in 

formula_163

where the series converges in the norm topology on Notice how this resembles the expression from the finite-dimensional case. are called the singular values of (resp. ) can be considered the left-singular (resp. right-singular) vectors of 

Compact operators on a Hilbert space are the closure of finite-rank operators in the uniform operator topology. The above series expression gives an explicit such representation. An immediate consequence of this is:

:Theorem. is compact if and only if is compact.

==History==
The singular value decomposition was originally developed by differential geometers, who wished to determine whether a real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on. Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the bilinear forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the &quot;canonical multipliers&quot; of the matrix The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the polar decomposition. The first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale J. Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the principal axis transformation for Hermitian matrices.

In 1907, Erhard Schmidt defined an analog of singular values for integral operators (which are compact, under some weak technical assumptions); it seems he was unaware of the parallel work on singular values of finite matrices. This theory was further developed by Émile Picard in 1910, who is the first to call the numbers formula_164 &quot;singular values&quot; (or in French, &quot;valeurs singulières&quot;).

Practical methods for computing the SVD date back to Kogbetliantz in 1954–1955 and Hestenes in 1958, resembling closely the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm, which uses plane rotations or Givens rotations. However, these were replaced by the method of Gene Golub and William Kahan published in 1965, which uses Householder transformations or reflections. In 1970, Golub and Christian Reinsch published a variant of the Golub/Kahan algorithm that is still the one most-used today.
