<text>The Darling Scarp, also referred to as the Darling Range or Darling Ranges, is a low escarpment running north–south to the east of the Swan Coastal Plain and Perth, Western Australia. The escarpment extends generally north of Bindoon, to the south of Pemberton. The adjacent Darling Plateau goes easterly to include Mount Bakewell near York and Mount Saddleback near Boddington. It was named after the Governor of New South Wales, Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling.

== History ==
The feature was first recorded as General Darling Range by Charles Fraser, Government Botanist with Captain James Stirling aboard in March 1827.

Maps from the 1830s show the scarp labelled &quot;General Darlings Range&quot;; this later became Darling Range, a name by which the formation was still commonly known in the late 20th century despite common understanding of it being an escarpment. There is also a tendency to identify the locations on or to the east of the scarp as being in the &quot;Perth Hills&quot; (or simply &quot;The Hills&quot;).

The earliest traverses by British settlers in the Swan River Colony occurred in the 1830s. The best known of these is the expedition of Ensign Robert Dale, who appears to have gone from a point near Guildford, to the south side of Greenmount Hill and up through the Helena Valley.

== Geology ==
The Darling Scarp originated as the local expression, in the Perth area, of the extensive Darling Fault, a major and ancient geological discontinuity separating the Archaean Yilgarn Craton in the east from the younger Pinjarra Orogen and overlying Phanerozoic Perth Basin to the west. The Darling Fault is exposed for over , from the area east of Shark Bay, to the southern coast of Western Australia east of Albany. The location of the scarp must once have coincided with the location of the fault, but the scarp has since eroded about eastwards. The original location of the scarp is indicated in places by an unusual landform known as the Ridge Hill Shelf.

The Darling Plateau is covered by lateritic materials that cover the underlying geology.

The Archaean granites and gneisses of the Yilgarn Craton form the high ground of the Perth Hills and can be observed in road cuts, with good examples in the Mundaring Weir area. The only exposed sediments of the Perth Basin, west of the fault, are of Cenozoic age, and are composed of materials such as sandy limestone, travertine and dune sand on which the city of Perth is built, including sand dunes of Pleistocene age formed during the last glacial period.

This area is also a distinct physiographic section of the larger Yilgarn Block province, which in turn is part of the larger West Australian Shield division.

===Climate===
The Scarp, like the rest of south west Australia, has a Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters and warm dry summers. Average annual rainfall is 1300 mm along the scarp, declining to the east and north.

Often the Bureau of Meteorology identifies different weather for &quot;the hills&quot; in comparison to that of the Swan Coastal Plain.

Also, in traditionally hot summers, strong easterly winds travelling across the scarp have presented serious issues for planes using the Perth Airport because of the alignment of the runways. On 2 September 1999, the number one engine of a Qantas Boeing 747, en route from Sydney Airport coming into land on Runway 06/24, struck the runway surface upon landing, due to wind shear caused by rolling winds on the Darling Scarp. In addition, orographic uplift is produced when rain clouds move over the hills, giving higher rainfalls in settlements in the ranges compared with their coastal neighbours.

==Flora and fauna==
The scarp is part of the Jarrah Forest bioregion. The natural vegetation of the scarp is predominantly jarrah–marri forest, characterised by jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;) and marri (&quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;), with bullich (&quot;Eucalyptus megacarpa&quot;) and blackbutt (&quot;Eucalyptus patens&quot;) in the valleys. The Darling Range ghost gum (&quot;Eucalyptus laeliae&quot;) is endemic to the western slopes of the scarp.

Heath is found on granite outcrops. Low woodlands of &quot;Banksia&quot; grow on sand sheets.

Native mammals include the quenda (&quot;Isoodon fusciventer&quot;), chuditch (&quot;Dasyurus geoffroii&quot;), woylie (&quot;Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi&quot;), and brush-tailed phascogale (&quot;Phascogale tapoatafa wambenger&quot;). Quokka (&quot;Setonix brachyurus&quot;) and western ringtail possum (&quot;Pseudocheirus occidentalis&quot;) are often restricted to riparian areas.

== Land use ==
The Darling escarpment has been exploited for stone quarries, forestry and bauxite mining. Extensive timber railways and timber mills and the supporting communities existed along the escarpment because of the high quality jarrah forests.

=== Dams ===
In the early twentieth century, most of the main rivers flowing off the escarpment had mainly been used for dams for water supply for metropolitan Perth. The dams on the scarp include:
* Mundaring Weir (on the Helena River)
* Serpentine Dam and Pipehead (Serpentine River)
* Wungong Dam
* Churchman Brook Dam
* North Dandalup Dam
* South Dandalup Dam (on the two Dandalup branches)
*Canning Dam (on the Canning River)

The only free flowing water from the Darling Range in the Peel Region is the Dirk Brook in Keysbrook and the Murray River.

The scarp also defines the easternmost limit of the various aquifers present in the Perth Basin sediments, most notably the Southwest Yarragadee Aquifer. The scarp forms a divide between the hypersaline groundwaters typical of the Yilgarn Craton basement from the fresh ground waters of the Perth Basin. Some dams along the scarp are contaminated by seepage of saline water from the granite into the base of the dam&#x27;s water column and must be periodically flushed to preserve water quality.

=== Rock quarries ===
Also in the early to mid-twentieth century numerous rock quarries existed on the edge of the escarpment - visible and affecting both the aesthetics and the environment of the escarpment.

In the area where the Helena River emerges from its valley to the sandplain, there are still four quarries evident, despite being unused as quarries for fifty years or more. Mountain and Stathams quarries are now managed as rock climbing locations.

* &quot;Bluestone quarry&quot; (1850s name), later known as &quot;Greenmount Quarry&quot; (1850s to 1920s), at Greenmount Hill on the west side of Greenmount National Park.
* &quot;Mountain Quarry&quot; (now usually signed as &quot;Boya Quarry&quot;), south of Greenmount Hill, which ceased operation in 1963.
* &quot;Byford brickworks (State Brickworks)&quot;, shale scar visible from early 20th century to WW2 quarrying.
* &quot;Fremantle Harbour Works Quarry&quot; (sometimes, &quot;C. Y. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Mole Reconstruction Quarry&quot;, and later known as the &quot;Public Works Quarry&quot;), now &quot;Hudman Road Amphitheatre&quot; at edge of Darlington - Boya localities border, operated from the 1900s to the 1930s.
* Statham&#x27;s Quarry at Gooseberry Hill at northern edge of the Kalamunda Zig Zag formation.
* &quot;Armadale brickworks (State Brickworks)&quot;, Bedfordale Hill, shale scar visible from 20th century quarrying, with an underground rail bypassing the South Western Highway to transport the ore.

There have also been visible quarries on the scarp in the Gosnells and Herne Hill areas.

Legislative restrictions upon such developments were initiated in the late twentieth century to prevent further visible scars on the western face of the scarp.

=== Bauxite mining ===
In the late twentieth century, the proving of bauxite deposits correlating to the extensive jarrah forests saw wide-ranging protests against the proposals to mine the forests. Campaign to Save Native Forests was one group to oppose the activity.

The lengthy process of protest forced the government and miners to check their original proposals, and wide-ranging processes to guard segments of the jarrah forests from mining ensued.

The current mining activity in the region is extensive - the main mines being Huntly and Willowdale.
=== Railways ===
The building and developing of rail access across the scarp developed three separate main routes over eighty years.

* The Eastern Railway first traversed the Darling Scarp in the 1880s along its &quot;first route&quot; through Greenmount (where three of the above quarries were later able to use the railway).
* By the 1890s, the &quot;second route&quot; passed through Swan View Tunnel and John Forrest National Park.
* In the 1960s, the &quot;third route&quot; used easier grades through the Avon Valley
* The Kalamunda Zig Zag or Upper Darling Range railway ran up the southern steep side of the Helena Valley entrance until 1949.
* The Millars timber lines operating south to Yarloop, north through Jarrahdale up to Jarrahglen east of Byford and the Chandler mill.

=== Perth suburbs on the scarp ===
The localities or suburbs on the &quot;edge&quot; of the scarp are those that sit at its western edge, and in most cases command excellent views of the Swan Coastal Plain:

The suburbs near Midland and Kalamunda are often referred to as the Perth Hills.
=== Television transmission towers ===

The suburbs to the south of Kalamunda are the locations of the main Perth Metropolitan television station transmission towers. There is also another site at Mount Lennard near Collie that Services the Southwest areas including Bunbury.

==Conservation==

=== Dieback and fire ===
Also in the late twentieth century, dieback affecting jarrah timber in particular infected large tracts of the forest. Currently only the restriction of vehicle access has proved effective in slowing the spread of this disease. This gained greater acceptance and publicity through the decision to allow Rally Australia to operate along services roads provided that the vehicles had a thorough wash including the under carriage at the end of each stage.

In late 2004, the largest bushfire in the northern Jarrah Forest for at least 100 years created significant issues for the forest as well. As a result of this fire intensity the Government increased the volume of controlled burns along the entire escarpment to reduce the buildup of flammable materials.

In the early 2000s, Greenmount National Park and John Forrest National Park were repeatedly burnt by bushfires - in most cases through suspected arson.

=== Darling Range Regional Park ===

A network of reserves of crown lands on the escarpment have been connected into a regional park to maintain and conserve parts of the escarpment.

In most cases the reserves or parks had individual names prior to being incorporated into the larger park, for example the Serpentine National Park, John Forrest National Park and the Greenmount National Park, or were simply known as State Forests (e.g. State Forest No.42).

Following a change in 2005, the separate parks have been known as the &quot;Parks of the Darling Range&quot;, and take up 23,948 hectares on the scarp. Further in August 2008 the parks were given indigenous names:
* Beelu National Park
* Korung National Park
* Midgegoroo National Park (formerly known as Canning National Park)
* Banyowla Regional Park (formerly known as Kelmscott-Martin Regional Park)
* Mundy Regional Park (formerly known as Kalamunda Regional Park)
* Wooroloo Regional Park (formerly known as Chidlow Regional Park)
* Wungong Regional Park

<text>Among the Living is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released on March 16, 1987, by Megaforce Records in the US and by Island Records in the rest of the world. The album is dedicated to Cliff Burton of Metallica, who died in a bus accident six months before its release while Metallica were on tour with Anthrax as the opening act.

Veteran engineer Eddie Kramer, at his first venture with a thrash metal act, co-produced the album. Recording proceeded smoothly, but different visions for the sound of the final release created disagreements between Anthrax and the producer during the audio mixing.

Anthrax members described the album as their major breakthrough, as it marked the progression from the band playing in small clubs to arenas and stadiums. The album was critically acclaimed, and promoted the band among the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal. The band&#x27;s second gold record, &quot;Among the Living&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on July 31, 1990.

==Background==
The original members of Anthrax grew up in New York City listening to 1970s rock and hard rock and turned to heavy metal in the 1980s, profoundly influenced by bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Motörhead. Drummer Charlie Benante was also a fan of bands playing music considered extreme at the time, such as Raven and Venom, and he and guitarist Scott Ian enjoyed hardcore as much as metal. Guitarist Dan Spitz, originally in the band Overkill, was an accomplished, trained musician, while Joey Belladonna had a background as a singer in cover bands of arena rock acts Bad Company, Foreigner and Journey. The integration of these differing musical sensibilities resulted in Anthrax&#x27;s second album, &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, praised by critics for showing decisive progress from the band&#x27;s debut release, &quot;Fistful of Metal,&quot; and for introducing a unique sound, which opposed the fast and heavy riffing of thrash metal with Belladonna&#x27;s clean and melodic vocals. That album also marked the beginning of the songwriting method that would see the band through its most successful period. Benante would create riffs and rough musical structures for all the songs, that would later be developed, integrated and arranged with the other musicians. Ian composed all the lyrics and worked on them with Belladonna to create vocal melodies that were fit to his high-pitched, melodic singing style.

Anthrax had spent about six months in 1985 recording &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, their first album for the major label Island Records, which sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. They had been on tour to support the album since its release, both as headliners in small clubs and as an opening act for other bands. When opening for W.A.S.P. and Black Sabbath on their tour supporting the album &quot;Seventh Star&quot;, Anthrax played for the first time in mid-sized arenas and were thrilled by the experience and by audiences&#x27; reaction to their music.

After a brief stop to rehearse new songs in July 1986, Anthrax joined longtime friends and Megaforce Records labelmates Metallica on the European leg of Metallica&#x27;s Damage, Inc. Tour supporting &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. In Sweden on September 27, Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was killed when the band&#x27;s tour bus skidded off the road. His death profoundly impacted the thrash-metal community in which he was a highly regarded figure, and the members of Anthrax dedicated their new album &quot;Among the Living&quot; to his memory. In 2012, Ian said in an interview that part of the reason &quot;... the album sounds so angry is because Cliff died. We&#x27;d lost our friend and it was so wrong and unfair.&quot;

==Musical style==

The music press largely considers &quot;Among the Living&quot; one of the strongest thrash metal albums ever recorded. In comparison with &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, the songs on the album generally feature faster rhythms granted by Benante&#x27;s double-pedal bass-drum beats, stronger hardcore influences in the frequent gang choruses and a more aggressive vocal delivery by Belladonna. According to Ian, the general sonic approach of the songs is similar to &quot;A.I.R.&quot;, the opening track of &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;. The structure of the tracks is conventional and sometimes inspired by other rock songs, such as AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; for &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot;, but with many rhythm changes and melodies that sometimes yield to the aggressive and dry sound. One critic considered this last feature a probable carryover from the Stormtroopers of Death project, a seminal crossover band formed in 1985 by Benante, Ian and original Anthrax bassist Danny Lilker, that had combined metal riffs with hardcore on an album of short, fast and satirical songs titled &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;.

==Composition==

Anthrax composed the songs &quot;I Am the Law&quot;, &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; during the tour of 1986, rehearsed the first two and included &quot;I Am the Law&quot; in their live setlist. Most of the songs were written in July 1986, after the tour had ended. At the end of July 1986, Anthrax arranged and rehearsed the new songs at Top Cat rehearsal studios in New York City, before leaving for the UK, where they joined Metallica for their European dates.

Music critics praised the use of humor in &quot;Among the Living&quot;&#x27;s lyrics and were inspired by disparate sources. Socially conscious matters are present in songs such as &quot;Indians&quot;, about the plight of Native Americans forced to live on reservations, &quot;One World&quot;, which deals with the risk of nuclear holocaust and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, about false personas, especially in the music business. &quot;Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)&quot; (&quot;nise fukin life&quot; spelled backwards) is a protest song against drug abuse and was inspired by comedian John Belushi&#x27;s drug addiction and death. Ian is still baffled that journalists ask him why he wrote a song about the National Football League, just showing that &quot;they haven&#x27;t bothered to read the lyrics, or understand the whole point of the song.&quot;

Two of the album&#x27;s songs are based on characters and situations taken from Stephen King&#x27;s work: &quot;Among the Living&quot; draws from the novel &quot;The Stand&quot;, and &quot;A Skeleton in the Closet&quot; from the novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, a part of the &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection. Both Ian and Benante were avid readers of King&#x27;s works. &quot;I Am the Law&quot; is based on riffs left over from the recording sessions of &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; and is co-credited with Lilker. The title is the catchphrase of Judge Dredd, a comic book character whose stories were originally published in the British magazine &quot;2000 AD&quot;, of which Ian was a reader and fan.

&quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot; recounts a roadie&#x27;s experience during an agitated concert; many metalheads consider it a classic thrash-metal anthem. Critics read it as a glorification of the slam pit and a metaphor for life struggles. The last song written for the album was &quot;Horror of It All&quot; as a tribute to Cliff Burton, whose death affected the band members.

==Recording==

The band wanted a producer who could capture the energy of their live show and requested Eddie Kramer for the task. Kramer was a famous producer and engineer who had worked with Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Kiss, among others. The live sound that Kramer had captured in the Kiss album &quot;Alive!&quot; (1975) had especially impressed Ian and Benante when they were young. &quot;When Eddie said yes to us, it was a total headfuck,&quot; guitarist Scott Ian recalled.

The band recorded the new songs in about six weeks at Quadradial Studios in Miami, Florida. It was difficult at the time to record the sound of down-tuned guitars, typical of thrash metal bands such as Anthrax, and manage to distinguish it from the bass guitar and the bass drum. As Kramer recalled: &quot;I&#x27;d never recorded anything quite like it. I wasn&#x27;t sure of what they were looking for initially. And it was a challenge to figure out ways to record heavy guitars with heavy drums – it was just a different process.&quot; Kramer set up the recording sessions as group live performances and the band members were enthusiastic regarding the atmosphere and the sound produced. &quot;We always felt like when we were in a room rehearsing, we were at our best,&quot; Ian said. &quot;We were killing it and we had all the confidence in the world.&quot; The production then moved for retouching and mixing of the tracks to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, a facility owned by Chris Blackwell, the president of Anthrax&#x27;s record label Island Records. Ian had suggested that recording studio only because Iron Maiden had been working there since 1983.

In Nassau, Kramer created a first mix full of sound effects and reverb and claimed to have done a &quot;modern mixing&quot;, similar to producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange&#x27;s work for Def Leppard&#x27;s best-selling album &quot;Pyromania&quot;. The band members were dissatisfied with the mix and rejected it, arguing with Kramer to return to a clean, dry sound as close to the original live recording as possible. In a 2013 interview, Kramer remarked how &quot;... the guys had a totally different attitude, a totally different way of thinking, and I remember it being contentious during the mixing.&quot; Pressed by the possibility of being fired, Kramer relented to the band members&#x27; request and wrapped up the mixing process in less than two weeks.

==Artwork==
The cover art is by illustrator and painter Don Brautigam, a cover artist since the early 1970s, who worked on both &quot;Among the Living&quot; and Metallica&#x27;s iconic &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. The painting of &quot;Among the Living&quot; has been the subject of discussion, because it was long believed to depict the character Rev. Henry Kane, the antagonist from the film &quot;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&quot;, while others thought it depicted Randall Flagg, the subject of the album&#x27;s title track and the antagonist from the Stephen King novel &quot;The Stand&quot;. Drummer Charlie Benante, who conceived the concept for the cover, explained: &quot;It was just about how much evil there is amongst us. I wanted to show just the same type of person on the cover. The same type of people and then, the one person that was sticking out kind of giving you a wave, like a &#x27;hi!&#x27;&quot;. In 1988, Brautigam was the cover artist for the following Anthrax album &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Among the Living&quot; was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City, and was released worldwide on March 22, 1987, through Jon Zazula&#x27;s label Megaforce Records and Island Records.

The album was preceded by the release of the single &quot;I Am the Law&quot; in February 1987, in 7-inch and 12-inch formats, which charted in the UK. Both versions had the non-album track &quot;Bud E. Luvbomb and Satan&#x27;s Lounge Band&quot; as B-side, and the 12-inch also featured &quot;I&#x27;m the Man,&quot; a song recorded in the same sessions as the rest of the album&#x27;s tracks. It is among the first songs to have mixed rap and metal. The band&#x27;s management thought that the song could not fit the sound and drive of &quot;Among the Living&quot; and decided to release it as a B-side. It was later re-released as a successful EP and became one of the most recognizable Anthrax songs.

The second single &quot;Indians&quot; was released in June 1987. The 12-inch vinyl featured covers of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; and of S.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Taint&quot;, both expressly recorded for the release. A music video directed by Jean Pellerin and Doug Freel was shot for &quot;Indians&quot; and received moderate rotation on MTV in the late-1980s thrash-metal heyday.

&quot;Among the Living&quot; charted in Europe and reached No. 62 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, despite no radio airplay. It sold steadily through the years, and on July 31, 1990, the album was certified Gold, the second Anthrax album to do so after &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; in 1989.

On November 10, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released that included a bonus concert DVD. The release features alternate takes of several album tracks, live versions and the B-side songs &quot;I Am the Law&quot; and &quot;Bud E Luv Bomb And Satan&#x27;s Lounge Band.&quot;

===In other media===
The re-recorded version of &quot;Among the Living&quot; from the album &quot;The Greater of Two Evils&quot; can be heard in the teaser for the 2006 film &quot;Clerks II&quot;. A cover version of &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot; is included in the 2007 videogame &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot;, while the master recording is included in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero: Smash Hits&quot; and in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;. The same game included &quot;Among the Living&quot; and &quot;Indians&quot; as downloadable content. &quot;Indians&quot; is also included in the 2010 videogame &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;.

To celebrate the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Anthrax and Z2 Comics released a graphic novel with stories inspired by the songs from &quot;Among the Living&quot; in July 2021. The collection features contributions from an all-star group of writers and artists from the worlds of music and comics, including Corey Taylor, Grant Morrison, Brian Posehn, Gerard and Mikey Way, Rob Zombie, Brian Azzarello, Jimmy Palmiotti and Rick Remender.

==Tour==

Soon after the release of the album, Anthrax embarked on a short tour in Japan, but they officially started the Among the Living Tour on May 26, 1987, at the Penny Arcade of Rochester, with Metal Church opening. They played in mid-sized venues as headliners during the summer and then moved to Europe. They were on the bill of the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England on August 22, 1987, alongside Bon Jovi, Dio, Metallica, W.A.S.P. and Cinderella. Anthrax played for an audience of 80,000 that day, and in the European tour that followed in September and October sold out 7,000-seaters venues. Back in the US in November, Anthrax went on a tour as headliners in 5000-plus-seaters venues, with Celtic Frost as opening act. At the beginning of 1988, Kiss requested Anthrax as support band for their Crazy Nights World Tour in the US. The tour concluded in the first days of April, when Anthrax returned to the studio to record the album &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;.

The songs of &quot;Among the Living&quot; have always been present in the band&#x27;s live set lists since 1987, with at least four of them as fixed staples of their shows. In 2005, Anthrax reunited their &quot;Among the Living&quot; lineup, bringing Belladonna and Spitz back into the fold. During the world tour that followed they played live numerous cuts from the album and performed the record front-to-back at some shows. The band played &quot;Among the Living&quot; in its entirety again during the Metal Alliance 2013 tour and in 2017.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Among the Living&quot; was acclaimed by contemporary and modern music critics and is often cited to this day as a favourite among Anthrax fans. It is generally considered the breakthrough album for Anthrax, their best and most influential, which for its merits propelled the band among the icons of thrash metal. The band&#x27;s musicianship and the lyrics dedicated to social issues and pop-culture tributes were universally praised.

On &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Malcolm Dome appreciated the consistent quality of the album and wrote that Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;musicianship is on par with anything Metallica were doing at the time.&quot; J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Benante and his bandmates may have been regular guys in other respects, but as musicians there was no denying the technical agility that went into each aural onslaught&quot;. He also remarked how Anthrax strived to be equal to their fans in the mosh pits and &quot;democratized (their) brilliance by attaching it to some of the band&#x27;s catchiest, most approachable material.&quot; According to Greg Moffitt of BBC Music, &quot;Among the Living&quot; stroke &quot;a deft balance between marauding speed and judicious use of melody, a juggling feat they&#x27;d fumble on later albums.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff had the same opinion about the music, but observed how the introduction for the first time of &quot;a punk ethic&quot; in songs like &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot;, &quot;Efilnikufesin&quot; and &quot;One World&quot; started to undermine &quot;the seriousness of the band, something that was soon to cause image problems.&quot; In fact, the album was a critical success, but Anthrax were criticized by both journalists and fans for the inconsistency of their musical evolution and, most of all, for their stage look, which was made up of short pants and t-shirts with commercial images or hardcore logos, in striking contrast with the denim and leather apparel of other thrash metal groups. The band members&#x27; apparent endorsement of the skateboarding world was another reason for controversy in contemporary music magazines and among fans.

Anthrax members acknowledge the importance of the album for the band and for the thrash metal scene. Ian declared that &quot;Among the Living&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t just an important moment in our career. It gave us a career!&quot;

===Accolades===
In several articles for the British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1988, journalist Don Kaye elected Anthrax in the so-called &quot;Big Four of Thrash Metal&quot; elite, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. The title was accepted by the metal community and remained attached to Anthrax for the rest of their career.

Martin Popoff placed &quot;Among the Living&quot; at No. 49 in his &quot;The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; book in 2004. In July 2005, &quot;Among the Living&quot; was inducted into the &quot;Decibel&quot; Hall of Fame, the sixth album overall to be featured. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006). In August 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; placed the album on its &quot;14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own&quot; list. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Among the Living&quot; as 20th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27; On October 26, 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed &quot;Among the Living&quot; at No. 6 in the list of &quot;The 25 greatest thrash metal albums ever&quot;. Regarding singular songs, &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot; is ranked No. 29 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;40 Greatest Metal Songs.&quot;

<doc id="146682" wikidata="Q606294" url="?curid=146682" title="Broome, Western Australia">
<text>Broome, also known as Rubibi by the Yawuru people, is a coastal pearling and tourist town in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, north of Perth. The town recorded a population of 14,660 in the . It is the largest town in the Kimberley region.

==Geography==
Broome is located on Western Australia&#x27;s tropical Kimberley coast on the eastern edge of the Indian Ocean.

===Roebuck Bay===

Being situated on a north–south peninsula, Broome has water on both sides of the town. On the eastern shore are the waters of Roebuck Bay extending from the main jetty at Port Drive to Sandy Point, west of Thangoo station. Town Beach is part of the shoreline and is popular with visitors on the eastern end of the town. It is the site of the &quot;Staircase to the Moon&quot;, where a receding tide and a rising moon combine to create a natural phenomenon that resembles a staircase reaching for the moon. On &quot;Staircase to the Moon&quot; nights, a food and craft market operates on Town Beach. The phenomenon only occurs in one other location in the world, the Nile River in Egypt.

Roebuck Bay is of international importance for the millions of migrating waders or shorebirds that use it seasonally on migration through the East Asian – Australasian Flyway from their breeding grounds in northern Asia. They feed on the extensive intertidal mudflats and roost at high tide on the red sand beaches of the bay. They can be seen in the largest numbers in summer, but many of the younger birds remain throughout the first and second years of their lives. The Broome Bird Observatory, sited in pindan woodland close to the northern shore of Roebuck Bay, was established by Birds Australia in 1988, and formally opened in 1990. The purpose of the observatory is to study the birds, learn how to protect them and educate the public about them.

A mixed black flying fox and little red flying fox colony of around 50,000 megabats lives all year in mangroves next to Broome township&#x27;s small Streeter&#x27;s Jetty. They chatter and socialise loudly before flying out at dusk each evening. The bats are key pollinators and seed dispersers for native trees and plants.

===Cable Beach===

Named for the Java-to-Australia undersea telegraph cable that reaches shore there, Cable Beach is situated from town along a bitumen road. The beach itself is long with white sand, washed by tides that can reach over . Located directly east of Cable Beach over the dunes is Minyirr Park, a coastal reserve administered by a collaboration of the Shire of Broome and the Yawuru people.

==History==
===Yawuru people===
Broome is situated on the traditional lands of the Yawuru people.

===European settlement===
It is often mistakenly thought that the first European to visit Broome was William Dampier in 1688, but he only visited the north of what was later named the Dampier Peninsula. In 1699 he explored the coast from Shark Bay to La Grange Bay, from where he headed north leaving the Australian coast. Many of the coastal features of the area were later named for him. In 1879, Charles Harper proposed the formation of a Government Station at the Roebuck Bay Pastoral and Agricultural Association&#x27;s site at Cape Villaret, at the south end of Roebuck Bay, to provide facilities for the extension of the Pearl Shell Fishery, and to form a port and base of operations for intending pastoral and agricultural settlers. In 1883, John Forrest chose the site for the town, and it was named after Sir Frederick Broome, the Governor of Western Australia from 1883 to 1889.

The 1880s saw the commencement of Broome&#x27;s pearling industry, which initially involved slavery and indentured labour, pearl diving being an occupation reserved for specific ethnic groups, most prominently from Japan and followed by other Asian countries. This led to numerous racially motivated conflicts, most notably the 1920 race riots between Japanese and Malay residents, resulting in 8 deaths and at least 60 injuries. The Broome community came to &quot;reflect the hierarchy of the pearling industry, which was based on occupation and ethnicity&quot;. White collar occupations and positions of power were exclusively held by Europeans. As a consequence, racial segregation was common in Broome until the 1970s.

In 1889, a telegraph undersea cable was laid from Broome to Banjuwangi, East Java, connecting to England. Hence the name Cable Beach given to the landfall site.

=== 1942 air attacks ===
Broome was attacked at least four times during World War II as part of the Japanese air raids on Australia. The worst attack in terms of loss of life was an air raid on 3 March 1942 in which at least 86 people (mostly civilian refugees from the Dutch East Indies) were killed, making it the second deadliest Japanese attack on Australia after the bombing of Darwin. Twenty-two aircraft were destroyed, most of them flying boats, the remains of which can still be seen in the harbour at low tide.

===1950s to 2000s===
In 1950, Broome was the setting for Arthur Upfield&#x27;s novel &quot;The Widows of Broome&quot;, his 12th novel featuring Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (&quot;Bony&quot;).
Dinosaur footprints dated as Early Cretaceous in age (approximately 130 million years ago) were discovered out to sea at Gantheaume Point in the 1960s. The tracks can be seen only during very low tide. In 1996, some of the prints were cut from the ground and stolen, but have since been recovered.

Broome entered into a sister city agreement with Taiji, Japan in 1981 as historic ties between the two towns date back to the early 1900s, when Japan became instrumental in laying the groundwork of Broome&#x27;s pearling industry. The annual dolphin hunt in Taiji was the subject of the 2009 documentary &quot;The Cove&quot;, and sparked a unanimous decision by Broome&#x27;s council, headed by Graeme Campbell, to end the relationship with Taiji if the dolphin hunt were to continue. The decision was reversed in October 2009.
Lord Alistair McAlpine&#x27;s Pearl Coast Zoological Gardens was opened in August 1984 to serve the burgeoning tourist industry in the town, as was the Malcolm Douglas Crocodile Park opened that same year. By 1987, tourism started to boom in the town, thanks in part to the bitumen road which had been completed and linked Highway One with Broome and the Kimberley. According to Martin Peirson-Jones, involved with real estate in the 1980s, there was a large shortage of accommodation between Broome and Kununurra, another town which was experiencing arrivals of bus tours for the first time. Land prices also rose exponentially within a short space of time, in reaction to the town&#x27;s newfound potential, as recounted by Peirson-Jones: 

&quot;There were large subdivisions taking place and that led to a change of focus in the town. It was interesting to watch the land auction prices rise from hundreds of dollars to thousands and then tens of thousands, all within the space of a few years. As more people came in they wanted more facilities, better roads and were expecting more. Prior to this nobody worried too much and the expectations were not there.&quot;
===2012 Save the Kimberley campaign===
The Broome community led a campaign to protest against a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point outside Broome. The campaign has received ardent support from public figures such as John Butler, Missy Higgins, Clare Bowditch and former leader of the Australian Greens, Dr Bob Brown. A concert for the campaign was held on 5 October 2012 at Federation Square in Melbourne and was attended by approximately 6,000 people. A long term protest camp operated at James Price Point. One of the campaign points was to protect the significant &#x27;dinosaur highway&#x27; of dinosaur tracks that are found in the intertidal zone outside Broome. The campaign has since remained a divisive topic amongst locals, with many blaming the &#x27;no&#x27; decision for the slow economic growth that characterises the region.

==Palaeontological significance==
Fossilised &quot;Megalosauropus broomensis&quot; dinosaur footprints dated as early Cretaceous in age are out to sea at Gantheaume Point. The fossil trackway can be viewed during very low tide. Plant fossils are preserved extensively in the Broome Sandstone at Gantheaume Point and in coastal exposures further north.

The fossil trackways at Broome include possibly the largest known dinosaur footprints, sauropod tracks upwards of long. It is suspected that the sauropod that made these tracks might have been tall at the hip.

== Pearling industry ==

The town has a history based around the exploits of the men and women who developed the pearling industry, starting with the harvesting of oysters for mother of pearl in the 1880s to the large present-day cultured pearl farming enterprises.

At first, Indigenous people, especially women and girls, were forced to dive for pearls by European pearlers, and many died working in the industry. Report of abuses in the early days of pearling led to legislation in 1871 and 1875 regulating native labour and prohibiting the use of women as divers.

By 1910, Broome was one of the leading producers of pearls globally. At that time, roughly 3,500 of the town&#x27;s then population of approximately 5,000 worked in the industry. At the beginning of World War I, many of the town&#x27;s pearlers were requisitioned for the war effort.

Asia-Pacific men, especially Japanese, excelled at pearl diving, with many of them becoming valued citizens in the town. Many Chinese and Japanese traders set up ventures in the town. Indeed, many people with Japanese names thrive in the community. Pearling was a dangerous and sometimes deadly occupation and the town&#x27;s Japanese cemetery is the resting place of 919 Japanese divers who lost their lives working in the industry.

Each year Broome celebrates the fusion of different cultures brought about by the pearling industry in an annual cultural festival called Shinju Matsuri (Japanese for &quot;festival of the pearl&quot;).

In 2010, the Shire of Broome and Kimberley commissioned a Memorial to the Indigenous Female Pearl Divers. In April 2019, the skeletons of 14 Yawuru and Karajarri people which had been sold by a wealthy Broome pearler to a museum in Dresden in 1894 were brought home. The remains, which had been stored in the Grassi Museum of Ethnology in Leipzig, showed signs of head wounds and malnutrition, a reflection of the poor conditions endured by Aboriginal people forced to work on the pearling boats. , the remains are being stored in Perth until facilities have been built to accommodate them in Broome.

==Population==
According to the , there were 14,660 people in Broome.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 23.4% of the population. 
* 70.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 2.9%, New Zealand 1.9% and the Philippines 1.5%. 
* 74.1% of people only spoke English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No religion 47.0% and Catholic 21.4%.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Broome has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), being a little too dry to be classified as a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;); like most parts of the Australian tropics, it has two seasons: a dry season and a wet season. The dry season is from April to November with nearly every day clear and maximum temperatures around . The wet season extends from December to March, with maximum temperatures of around , with rather erratic tropical downpours and high humidity. Broome&#x27;s annual rainfall average is , 75% of which falls from January to March. Broome observes an average of 48.4 days a year that record measurable precipitation. According to the indigenous Yawuru calendar, there are six seasons.

Broome is susceptible to tropical cyclones and these, along with the equally unpredictable nature of summer thunderstorms, play a large part in the erratic nature of the rainfall. For instance, in January 1922, Broome Post Office recorded just of rainfall while in the same month of 2018, the airport received . Dewpoint averages in the wet season, but is as low as in the dry season.

Frost is unknown; however, temperatures during the cooler months have dropped to as low as .

The average temperature of the sea ranges from in July and August to in March.

==Education==
Broome contains six schools: five government, Broome Primary School, Broome North Primary School in the northern suburb of Bilingurr, Cable Beach Primary School in Cable Beach, Roebuck Primary School in the northern suburb of Djugun, and Broome Senior High School; and St Mary&#x27;s College, a Catholic K–12 school.

==Sport and recreation==

Broome hosts a lawn bowling club and a golf club. 

Broome is considered to be among the best places in the world to catch sailfish.

Four soccer clubs compete in the local Broome Football Association&#x27;s BLiga competition each dry season. FC Meatworks, Pearlers, Racing G and Broome Town field sides across men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions.

The town has four Australian rules clubs; Broome Bulls (established 1949), Broome Saints, Broome Towns and Cable Beach all competing in the West Kimberley District League with games played at Haynes Oval.

==Culture and entertainment ==
Broome is home to the Sun Picture Garden, the oldest operating open-air cinema in the world.

Marrugeku is a dance company led by co-artistic directors choreographer/dancer Dalisa Pigram and director/dramaturg Rachael Swain, who have worked together for 23 years. The company has Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians working together to create new dance performances, and works from two bases, one in Broome and the other at Carriageworks in Sydney.

==Transport==
Broome International Airport is the regional air hub of northwestern Western Australia and is considered the tourism gateway to the Horizontal Falls and the whole Kimberley region.

The Broome Tramway was an industrial tramway used to convey goods between Mangrove Point and the town centre from 1898 until the 1960s.

==Media==
Since 1992 Broome has been home to a local community newspaper, the &quot;Broome Advertiser&quot;, published each Thursday, part of the Seven West Media group. Previously Broome had a Saturday weekly newspaper, published from 1912 to 1930, &quot;The Nor-West Echo&quot;, the successor to the &quot;Broome Chronicle and Nor&#x27;West Advertiser&quot; (1908–1912).

Locally, television stations available include Seven, WIN9, WDT10, ABC, SBS and Goolarri Media.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessnews/Goolarri-Media&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalartswa/goolarri-media&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Regional WA broadcasts a half-hour news program for regional WA, &quot;Seven News&quot;, at 5:30pm weeknights; Seven Regional WA has a district newsroom covering Broome and surrounding areas based in the town.

==Crocodile park==

The Malcolm Douglas Crocodile Park is located about from Broome. It was established in 1983 by the wildlife documentary maker Malcolm Douglas, and holds 30 adult crocodiles that have been captured in the wild after threatening humans. The park is home to Fatso, a saltwater crocodile who on 12 July 2010 bit a Melbourne man, Michael Newman, who climbed into his enclosure.

<doc id="146685" wikidata="Q256711" url="?curid=146685" title="Bunbury, Western Australia">
<text>Bunbury is a coastal city in the Australian state of Western Australia, approximately south of the state capital, Perth. It is the state&#x27;s third most populous city after Perth and Mandurah, with a population of approximately 75,000.

Located at the south of the Leschenault Estuary, Bunbury was established in 1836 on the orders of Governor James Stirling, and named in honour of its founder, Lieutenant (at the time) Henry Bunbury. A port was constructed on the existing natural harbour soon after, and eventually became the main port for the wider South West region. Further economic growth was fuelled by completion of the South Western Railway in 1893, which linked Bunbury with Perth.

Greater Bunbury includes four local government areas (the City of Bunbury and the shires of Capel, Dardanup, and Harvey), and extends between Yarloop in the north, Boyanup to the south and Capel to the southwest.

==History==

===Pre-European history===
The original inhabitants of Greater Bunbury are the Aboriginal Australian Noongar people. The people hunted and fished throughout the sub-region prior to the first European settlement in the 1830s. The area was originally known as &quot;Goomburrup&quot; before the arrival of Lt. Bunbury.

===Early colonial period===

The first registered sighting of Greater Bunbury was by French explorer Captain Louis de Freycinet from his ship the &quot;Casuarina&quot; in 1803. He named the area Port Leschenault after the expedition&#x27;s botanist, Leschenault de La Tour. The bay on Greater Bunbury&#x27;s western shores was named &quot;Geographe&quot; after another ship in the fleet.

In 1829, Dr Alexander Collie and Lieutenant Preston explored the area of Bunbury on land. In 1830 Lieutenant Governor Sir James Stirling visited the area and a military post was subsequently established; it only lasted six months. The area was renamed Bunbury by the Governor in recognition of Lieutenant Henry William St Pierre Bunbury, who developed the very difficult inland route from Pinjarra to Bunbury. Bunbury&#x27;s first settlers were John and Helen Scott, their sons Robert, William and John Jr, and step-son Daniel McGregor, who arrived in January 1838. Bunbury township was mentioned in the Government Gazette in 1839, but lots in the township were not surveyed until 1841. In March 1841 lots were declared open for selection.

Intermittent bay whaling activity was conducted on the coast from the 1830s through to the 1850s.

By 1842 Bunbury was home to 16 buildings including an inn. Thereafter, a growing port serviced the settlers and the subsequent local industries that developed.

One of the major industries to open up to cement the importance of Bunbury as a port was the timber industry. Timber logs would be floated down the Collie River to be loaded aboard ships headed to the Northern Hemisphere or to South Africa where the hardwood timbers were used for railway sleepers.

In 1884 the Government decided to construct a railway from Bunbury to Boyanup, long. When the line was completed in 1887, the contractor who had built it obtained a contract to control and work it, which he did with horses. The line was eventually taken over by the Government in 1891 and operated with locomotives. The inconvenience of a railway isolated from the capital gave rise to agitation and in 1893 the South Western Railway was constructed between East Perth and Picton, connecting Greater Bunbury and Perth. The Boyanup line was extended to Donnybrook in the same year. The railways connected the port of Bunbury to the coal and mineral deposits and agricultural areas to the north and east of Greater Bunbury.

The population of the town was 2,970 (1,700 males and 1,270 females) in 1898.

In 1903 a breakwater to further protect the bay and port area was completed.

===Federation to present day===
The Old Bunbury railway station served as the terminal for the Australind passenger train between Perth, transporting its first passengers on 24 November 1947. The last train to use the station departed on 28 May 1985 with a new station opening at East Bunbury, to the south-east the following day. The railway land was then sold and Blair Street realigned.

The Bunbury woodchip bombing in 1976 saw the bombing of Bunbury&#x27;s export port terminal by environmental activists, in an attempt to disrupt the woodchipping industry in the South West. Two of the three bombs planted failed to explode and the resulting damage to the port was estimated at only $300,000 (), although shrapnel broke windows in a nearby housing estate and the blast was heard up to away. There were no injuries although a security guard was held at gunpoint by the bombers.

==Geography==
Bunbury is situated south of Perth, at the original mouth of the Preston River and near the mouth of the Collie River at the southern end of the Leschenault Inlet, which opens to Koombana Bay and the larger Geographe Bay which extends southwards to Cape Naturaliste.

===Climate===
Bunbury has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen classification &quot;Csa&quot;) with warm to hot, dry summers and cool wet winters. Precipitation peaks from the months of May to September.

==Demographics==
In 2007 Bunbury was recognised as Australia&#x27;s fastest growing city for the 2005/06 period by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At the 2021 census the urban population of Bunbury was 76,452. At the 2021 Census the median age was 39. It is estimated that by 2031 the population of the Greater Bunbury region will exceed 100,000 people.

In urban Bunbury at the 2021 census, 74.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 5.5%, New Zealand 3.0%, South Africa 1.9%, the Philippines 1.3% and India 0.8%. 85.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Afrikaans 0.9%, Mandarin 0.7%, Italian 0.6%, Tagalog 0.6%, and Filipino 0.5%.

In the 2021 Census the most common responses for religion in Bunbury were No religion 47.5%, Catholic 17.2%, Anglican 12.3%, Christian, nfd (not further described) 3.3%.

The most common occupations in Bunbury included Technicians and Trades Workers 18.4%, Professionals 16.3%, Labourers 12.6%, Community and Personal Service Workers 12.0%, and Clerical and Administrative Workers 11.4%. In 2021 Bunbury had an unemployment rate of 4.9%.

==Governance==

The Greater Bunbury sub-region comprises the four local government areas of the City of Bunbury, Shire of Capel, Shire of Dardanup and Shire of Harvey. The &quot;Greater Bunbury Region Scheme&quot;, in operation since November 2007, provides the legal basis for planning in the Greater Bunbury sub-region.

The Greater Bunbury sub-region is administered by State and local governments. There is no sub-region government structure in place for Greater Bunbury.

In December 2013 the Western Australian Planning Commission published the &quot;Greater Bunbury Strategy&quot; to guide urban, industrial and regional land use planning; and associated infrastructure delivery in the Greater Bunbury sub-region in the short, medium and long terms. The Strategy provides for the growth of Greater Bunbury through infill development of existing urban areas and the development of greenfield land in Waterloo east of Eaton, to provide for a population of 150,000 people beyond 2050.

==Economy==

The economy of Bunbury is diverse, reflecting the range of heavy and general industries in the locality, mining, agricultural landscapes, services for the growing population, key transport links and the influence of Perth.

The mining and mineral processing sector remains the main economic driver for Bunbury ($2 billion annual turnover). The agriculture sector however, remains vitally important as the value of production is approximately $146 million per annum (2005/06) which equates to approximately 30 per cent of the South West region&#x27;s agricultural production.

Other industries that are vital to the economic well-being of Greater Bunbury include retail and service industries, building industry, timber production and tourism. Bunbury is home to SIMCOA, which is Australia&#x27;s only silicon manufacturing company. The Bunbury Port will continue to be the centre of economic activity for the Greater Bunbury sub-region with the flow of goods through it to and from all parts of the world. The proposed expansion of the port, as identified in the &quot;Bunbury Port Inner Harbour Structure Plan&quot;, will promote further economic growth for the sub-region, and may in time be an economic stimulus for the corporate support and ancillary services associated with port-based industries locating to Bunbury city centre, further strengthening its role as a regional city.

==Education==

Education is compulsory in Western Australia between the ages of six and seventeen, corresponding to primary and secondary school. Schools that serve high school students in the area include Bunbury Senior High School, Newton Moore Senior High School, Manea Senior College, College Row School (K–12 education support), Australind Senior High School, Eaton Community College, Dalyellup College, Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School (K–12), Bunbury Catholic College, Grace Christian School, and Our Lady of Mercy College.

===Tertiary education===
Tertiary education is available through a number of universities and technical and further education (TAFE) colleges. South Regional TAFE is a State Training Provider providing a range of vocational education with campuses in Bunbury, Albany, and other locations in the southern Western Australia region.

Edith Cowan University also has a campus based in Bunbury.

<doc id="146687" wikidata="Q1676224" url="?curid=146687" title="I'm the Man (EP)">
<text>I&#x27;m the Man is the second EP by American metal band Anthrax, released in 1987 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island Records (although the song was supposedly written three years before). The band, along with Eddie Kramer and Paul Hammingson, produced the EP, which includes the single &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;. The single is considered among the first rap metal songs.

The title track is a comedy/novelty song that parodies the style of the Beastie Boys, and its main guitar riff is based on the melody of the Jewish folk song &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; (guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Spitz, as well as all the members of the Beastie Boys, are Jewish); according to Charlie Benante, the song was meant to have the Beastie Boys as the MCs on the song, but scheduling conflicts prevented it, so the band performed the vocals themselves.

For live performances, Joey Belladonna and Benante would switch places, Benante performing some of the raps and Belladonna drumming. A 7&quot; single was also released, containing only the second and fifth tracks.

A new version titled &quot;I&#x27;m the Man &#x27;91&quot; would appear on the 1991 b-sides collection Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s

==Samples and borrowed material==
The beginning of &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; features an electric guitar riff of the Jewish folk song &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;, which can also be heard in the chorus. The chorus&#x27; lyrics are borrowed from one of Taylor Negron&#x27;s lines in the Rodney Dangerfield film &quot;Easy Money&quot;. Rather than using a sample, the song&#x27;s lines are performed by Frank Bello. Anthrax also used one of Sam Kinison&#x27;s famous primal screams for the song. At about 1:55, a sample of the Metallica song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; can be heard. A few times after &quot;I&#x27;m The Man&quot; is said, a sample of &quot;shut up&quot; from Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot; from the 1985 album &quot;King of Rock&quot; can be heard. Additionally, the &quot;yeah&quot; that begins the song &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot; by the Beastie Boys on their 1986 debut, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, is sampled.

<doc id="146688" wikidata="Q310994" url="?curid=146688" title="Patrick Hillery">
<text>Patrick John Hillery (; 2 May 1923 – 12 April 2008) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as the sixth president of Ireland from December 1976 to December 1990. He also served as vice-president of the European Commission and European Commissioner for Social Affairs from 1973 to 1976, Minister for External Affairs from 1969 to 1973, Minister for Labour from 1966 to 1969, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1965 to 1969 and Minister for Education from 1959 to 1965. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Clare constituency from 1951 to 1973.

In 1973, he was appointed Ireland&#x27;s first European Commissioner, upon Ireland&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community, serving until 1976, when he became President of Ireland. He served two terms in the presidency. Though seen as a somewhat lacklustre president, he was credited with bringing stability and dignity to the office, and won widespread admiration when it emerged that he had withstood political pressure from his own Fianna Fáil party during a political crisis in 1982.

==Early and private life==

Patrick John Hillery, more popularly known as Paddy Hillery, was born in Spanish Point, County Clare, in 1923. The son of Michael Joseph Hillery, a local doctor, and Ellen McMahon, a district nurse, he was educated locally at Milltown Malbay National School, before later attending Rockwell College. At the third level, Hillery attended University College Dublin, where he qualified with a degree in medicine. Upon his conferral in 1947, he returned to his native town where he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a doctor. Hillery&#x27;s medical career in the 1950s, saw him serve as a member of the National Health Council and as Medical Officer for the Milltown Malbay Dispensary District. He also spent a year working as coroner for West Clare.

Hillery married Maeve Finnegan, on 27 October 1955. Together they had a son, John, and a daughter, Vivienne, who died after a long illness in 1987, shortly before her eighteenth birthday.

==Domestic political career==
Hillery, though not himself political, agreed under pressure from Clare&#x27;s senior Fianna Fáil TD, party leader and former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, to become his running mate at the 1951 general election. Hillery received enough transfers from de Valera to be elected.

De Valera was elected as president of Ireland in 1959, and was succeeded as Taoiseach by Seán Lemass. Under Lemass, many party elders such as James Ryan, Seán MacEntee and Paddy Smith, retired and a new generation of politicians were introduced to government, such as Brian Lenihan, Donogh O&#x27;Malley, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. Key among this new breed of politician was Hillery, who was given his first position in cabinet as Minister for Education in 1959, succeeding Jack Lynch in that post.

===Government minister 1959–1973===
As Minister for Education, Hillery was responsible for much innovative thinking in a department which would become very important under Lemass&#x27;s leadership. In 1963, he made a major policy speech in which he outlined many of the educational reforms that were to be introduced over the next decade. These included increased educational opportunities for many, the establishment of comprehensive schools and Regional Technical Colleges. He also proposed access by students to all public examinations. As Minister for Education, Hillery laid the groundwork for successive Ministers to advance the reforms and initiatives he had begun. While Donogh O&#x27;Malley, has received much of the credit for introducing free education, it was in fact Hillery who laid much of the groundwork before this landmark announcement.

In 1965, Hillery succeeded Lynch again by taking over as Minister for Industry and Commerce. This department was considered one of the most important in kick-starting Ireland&#x27;s economy. Hillery only remained in this position for just over a year, becoming the country&#x27;s first Minister for Labour in 1966, as industrial disputes began to take their toll. This new department had been an ambition of Lemass&#x27;s for several years.

Lemass resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil in November 1966, a shock to many of his political friends. Hillery was invited by Lemass to allow his name to go forward for the leadership of the party, however, he declined explaining that he had no interest. Jack Lynch succeeded Lemass after a leadership contest with George Colley. Hillery retained his post as Minister for Labour in Lynch&#x27;s cabinet, serving until 1969.

Following a further victory for Fianna Fáil at the 1969 general election, Hillery was appointed Minister for External Affairs (renamed Foreign Affairs in 1971), one of the most prestigious of cabinet posts. He earned an international profile when, in the aftermath of the killing of fourteen unarmed civilians in Derry, by British paratroopers (known as Bloody Sunday), he travelled to the United Nations to demand UN involvement in peace-keeping on the streets of Northern Ireland. The trip to the UN achieved very little, other than to draw the attention of the world to the worsening situation in Northern Ireland. During the whole period, Hillery remained one of Jack Lynch&#x27;s staunchest allies in pursuing peaceful means with regard to the possibility of a civil war breaking out. Although considered a mild-mannered politician, Hillery showed his mettle at the 1971 Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis when Kevin Boland, an opponent of Lynch&#x27;s Northern policy, stormed a nearby podium and launched a very public and vocal attack on the Fianna Fáil leadership. While some of his supporters started chanting &quot;We want Boland&quot;, Hillery, who by this stage had grabbed the nearest microphone, shouted down the Boland faction with the line &quot;Ye can have Boland but ye can&#x27;t have Fianna Fáil.&quot;

As well as affairs in Northern Ireland, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillery also negotiated Irish membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), a process that was completed in 1973.

==European Commissioner 1973–1976==

Following Ireland&#x27;s successful entry into the European Economic Community (ECC), Hillery was rewarded by becoming the first Irish politician to serve on the European Commission. He was appointed Vice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for Social Affairs. While Europe had gained one of Ireland&#x27;s most capable and respected politicians, Jack Lynch had lost one of his allies, and someone who may have been in line to take over the leadership following Lynch&#x27;s retirement. As Social Affairs Commissioner, Hillery&#x27;s most famous policy initiative was to force EEC member states to give equal pay to women. However, in 1976, the then-Irish government, the Fine Gael–Labour Party National Coalition, under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, informed him that he was not being re-appointed to the Commission. He considered returning to medicine, perhaps moving with his wife, Maeve (also a doctor) to Africa. However, fate took a turn, when the then Minister for Defence, Paddy Donegan, launched a ferocious verbal attack on the then president, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, calling him &quot;a thundering disgrace&quot; for referring anti-terrorist legislation to the Supreme Court of Ireland to test its constitutionality. When Ó Dálaigh resigned, a deeply reluctant Hillery agreed to become the Fianna Fáil candidate for the presidency. Fine Gael and Labour decided it was unwise to nominate a candidate, in light of the row over Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s resignation and the part the government played in the affair. As a result, Hillery was elected unopposed, becoming President of Ireland on 3 December 1976.

==President of Ireland==

===The fake &quot;sex scandal&quot; during the papal visit===
Though once voted the world&#x27;s sexiest head of state by readers of the German &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine, few expected Hillery to become embroiled in a sex scandal as president. Yet, one occurred in September 1979, when the international press corps, travelling to Ireland for the visit of Pope John Paul II, told their Irish colleagues that Europe was &quot;awash&quot; with rumours that Hillery had a mistress living with him in Áras an Uachtaráin (the presidential residence), that he and his wife were divorcing and he was considering resigning from the presidency. However, the story was untrue. Once the Pope had left, Hillery held a press conference where he told a shocked nation that there was no mistress, no divorce and no resignation. In reality, few people had even heard of the rumours. Critics questioned why he chose to comment on a rumour that few outside media and political circles had heard. Hillery, however, defended his action by saying that it was important to kill off the story for the good of the presidency, rather than allow the rumour to circulate and be accepted as fact in the absence of a denial. In that, he was supported by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, whom he consulted before making the decision, he also got the support of Leader of the Opposition, Garret FitzGerald, of Fine Gael and Frank Cluskey, of the Labour Party. In 2008, Historian John Walsh claimed that within Irish political circles, the source of the rumours about Hillery was widely believed to have been planted by the leader of Fianna Fáil Charles Haughey, who was attempting to force Hillery to resign from office.

Hillery also hit the headlines when, on the advice of then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, he declined Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s invitation to attend the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981.

===Phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin===

It was in 1982 that Hillery&#x27;s reputation as President was arguably made. In January 1982, the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald lost a budget vote in Dáil Éireann. Since this was a loss of supply, FitzGerald travelled to Áras an Uachtaráin, to ask for a dissolution of the Dáil. Under Article 13.2.2°, If Hillery refused FitzGerald&#x27;s request for a dissolution, FitzGerald would have had to resign. Had this happened, Haughey, as Leader of the Opposition, would have been the next contender to form a government. While Hillery was considering FitzGerald&#x27;s request, a series of phone calls (some published reports claim seven, others eight) was made by senior opposition figures urging Hillery to refuse the dissolution, allowing Haughey a chance to form a government.

Hillery regarded such pressure as gross misconduct, and ordered one of his aides de camp, Captain Anthony Barber, not to pass on any telephone calls from opposition figures. He might also have been motivated by a conflict between the English and Irish versions of the Constitution. While the English version vests the President with certain powers that he uses &quot;in his absolute discretion,&quot; the Irish version states that these powers are used , which usually translates to &quot;under his own counsel&quot;. While &quot;absolute discretion&quot; implies that presidents have some latitude in whether to initiate contact with the opposition under these circumstances, &quot;under his own counsel&quot; has been understood to mean that no contact whatsoever can take place with the opposition. Whenever there is a conflict between the Irish and English versions, the Irish one takes precedence. In the end, Hillery granted the dissolution. (No Irish president to date has ever refused such a request.)

By 1990, Hillery&#x27;s term seemed to be reaching a quiet end, until the events of 1982 resurfaced. Three candidates had been nominated in the 1990 presidential election: the then Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan from Fianna Fáil (heavily tipped as the certain winner), Austin Currie from Fine Gael and Mary Robinson from the Labour Party. In May 1990, in an &quot;on the record&quot; interview with Jim Duffy, a post-graduate student researching the Irish presidency, Lenihan had confirmed that he had been one of those phoning President Hillery in January 1982. He confirmed that Haughey too had made phone calls. Jim Duffy mentioned the information in a newspaper article on the history of the Irish presidency on 28 September 1990 in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. In October 1990, Lenihan changed his story, claiming (even though he had said the opposite for eight years) that he had played &quot;no hand, act or part&quot; in pressurising President Hillery that night. He made these denials in an interview in &quot;The Irish Press&quot; (a Fianna Fáil–leaning newspaper) and on &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;, an RTÉ 1 political show.

When it was realised that he had said the opposite in an on-the-record interview in May 1990, his campaign panicked and tried to pressurise Duffy into not revealing the information. Their pressure backfired, particularly when his campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, named Duffy as the person to whom he had given the interview in a radio broadcast, prompting Duffy to release the relevant segment of his interview with Lenihan. In the aftermath, the minority partner in the coalition government, the Progressive Democrats, indicated that unless Lenihan resigned or was dismissed from cabinet, they would pull out of the coalition and support an opposition motion of no confidence in Dáil Éireann, bringing down the government and forcing a general election. Publicly, Haughey insisted that it was entirely a matter for Lenihan, his &quot;friend of thirty years&quot; and that he was putting no pressure on him. In reality, under pressure from the PDs, Haughey gave Lenihan a letter of resignation to sign. When Lenihan refused, Haughey formally advised President Hillery to sack Lenihan from the cabinet. As required by Article 13.1.3 of the Constitution, Hillery did so. Lenihan&#x27;s campaign never recovered, and he became the first candidate from Fianna Fáil to lose a presidential election, having begun the campaign as the favourite. Instead, Labour&#x27;s Mary Robinson became the first elected President of Ireland from outside Fianna Fáil, and the first woman to hold the office.

The revelations, and the discovery that Hillery had stood up to pressure in 1982 from former cabinet colleagues, including his close friend Brian Lenihan, substantially increased Hillery&#x27;s standing. From a low-key, modest presidency that had been seen as mediocre, his presidency came to be seen as embodying the highest standards of integrity. His reputation rose further when opposition leaders under parliamentary privilege alleged that Haughey, who in January 1982, had been Leader of the Opposition, had not merely rung the President&#x27;s Office but threatened to end the career of the army officer who took the call and who, on Hillery&#x27;s explicit instructions, had refused to put through the call to the president. Haughey angrily denied the charge, though Lenihan, in his subsequently published account of the affair, noted that Haughey had denied &quot;insulting&quot; the officer, whereas the allegation was that he had &quot;threatened&quot; him. Hillery, it was revealed, had called in the Irish Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff the following day and as Commander-in-Chief of the Army had ordered the Chief of Staff to ensure that no politician ever interfered with the career of the young army officer. About ten years after the incident, RTÉ attempted to interview the young officer with regard to the allegations but as a serving officer, he was unable to comment.

===Later period as President===
Having been re-elected unopposed in 1983, Hillery (until then) shared the distinction with Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Éamon de Valera of serving two full terms as President of Ireland. He was one of three holders of the office of President who did not face a popular election for the office, the others being Douglas Hyde and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh. Hillery left office in 1990, serving the maximum two terms, widely applauded for his integrity, honesty and devotion to duty. The previous image of Hillery, as low-key, dull and unexciting (except for the bizarre sex rumours), had been somewhat undermined. President Hillery retired from public life.

He re-entered public life in 2002, during the second referendum on the Nice Treaty, when he urged a &quot;yes&quot; vote.

==Foreign assessment==
In 2002, state papers released by the British Public Record Office under the thirty-year rule, published in the Irish media, revealed how Hillery was viewed. A briefing paper – prepared for the Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw – observed about Hillery, then Minister for Foreign Affairs:

==Death==
Patrick Hillery died on 12 April 2008, in his Dublin home, following a short illness. His family agreed to a full state funeral for the former president. He was buried at St. Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery, Sutton, Dublin. 
In tributes, President Mary McAleese said &quot;He was involved in every facet of policy-making that paved the way to a new, modern Ireland. Today, we detect his foresight and pioneering agenda everywhere – a free education system, a dynamic, well-educated people, a successful economy and a thriving membership of the European Union, one of the single most transformative events for this country.&quot; Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said he &quot;was a man of great integrity, decency and intelligence, who contributed massively to the progress of our country and he is assured of an honoured place in Ireland&#x27;s history&quot;.
In the Dáil and Seanad, he was praised by all political leaders and parties during expressions of sympathy on 15 April 2008.
In the graveside oration, Tánaiste Brian Cowen said Hillery was &quot;A humble man of simple tastes, he has been variously described as honourable, decent, intelligent, courteous, warm and engaging. He was all of those things and more.&quot;

In April 2023 a stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth was issued.

Earth radius (denoted as &quot;R&quot;🜨 or &quot;R&quot;E) is the distance from the center of Earth to a point on or near its surface. Approximating the figure of Earth by an Earth spheroid (an oblate ellipsoid), the radius ranges from a maximum (equatorial radius, denoted &quot;a&quot;) of nearly to a minimum (polar radius, denoted &quot;b&quot;) of nearly . 

A globally-average value is usually considered to be with a 0.3% variability (±10 km) for the following reasons.
The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) provides three reference values: the &quot;mean radius&quot; (&quot;R&quot;) of three radii measured at two equator points and a pole; the &quot;authalic radius&quot;, which is the radius of a sphere with the same surface area (&quot;R&quot;); and the &quot;volumetric radius&quot;, which is the radius of a sphere having the same volume as the ellipsoid (&quot;R&quot;). All three values are about .

Other ways to define and measure the Earth&#x27;s radius involve either the spheroid&#x27;s radius of curvature or the actual topography. A few definitions yield values outside the range between the polar radius and equatorial radius because they account for localized effects.

A &quot;nominal Earth radius&quot; (denoted formula_2) is sometimes used as a unit of measurement in astronomy and geophysics, a conversion factor used when expressing planetary properties as multiples or fractions of a constant terrestrial radius; if the choice between equatorial or polar radii is not explicit, the equatorial radius is to be assumed, as recommended by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

==Introduction==

Earth&#x27;s rotation, internal density variations, and external tidal forces cause its shape to deviate systematically from a perfect sphere. Local topography increases the variance, resulting in a surface of profound complexity. Our descriptions of Earth&#x27;s surface must be simpler than reality in order to be tractable. Hence, we create models to approximate characteristics of Earth&#x27;s surface, generally relying on the simplest model that suits the need.

Each of the models in common use involve some notion of the geometric radius. Strictly speaking, spheres are the only solids to have radii, but broader uses of the term &quot;radius&quot; are common in many fields, including those dealing with models of Earth. The following is a partial list of models of Earth&#x27;s surface, ordered from exact to more approximate:
* The actual surface of Earth
* The geoid, defined by mean sea level at each point on the real surface
* A spheroid, also called an ellipsoid of revolution, geocentric to model the entire Earth, or else geodetic for regional work
* A sphere

In the case of the geoid and ellipsoids, the fixed distance from any point on the model to the specified center is called &quot;a radius of the Earth&quot; or &quot;the radius of the Earth at that point&quot;. It is also common to refer to any &quot;mean radius&quot; of a spherical model as &quot;the radius of the earth&quot;. When considering the Earth&#x27;s real surface, on the other hand, it is uncommon to refer to a &quot;radius&quot;, since there is generally no practical need. Rather, elevation above or below sea level is useful.

Regardless of the model, any of these &quot;geocentric&quot; radii falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357 km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378 km (3,950 to 3,963 mi). Hence, the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent, which supports the spherical model in most contexts and justifies the term &quot;radius of the Earth&quot;. While specific values differ, the concepts in this article generalize to any major planet.

===Physics of Earth&#x27;s deformation===
Rotation of a planet causes it to approximate an &quot;oblate ellipsoid/spheroid&quot; with a bulge at the equator and flattening at the North and South Poles, so that the &quot;equatorial radius&quot; is larger than the &quot;polar radius&quot; by approximately . The &quot;oblateness constant&quot; is given by
:formula_3
where is the angular frequency, is the gravitational constant, and is the mass of the planet. For the Earth , which is close to the measured inverse flattening . Additionally, the bulge at the equator shows slow variations. The bulge had been decreasing, but since 1998 the bulge has increased, possibly due to redistribution of ocean mass via currents.

The variation in density and crustal thickness causes gravity to vary across the surface and in time, so that the mean sea level differs from the ellipsoid. This difference is the &quot;geoid height&quot;, positive above or outside the ellipsoid, negative below or inside. The geoid height variation is under on Earth. The geoid height can change abruptly due to earthquakes (such as the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake) or reduction in ice masses (such as Greenland).

Not all deformations originate within the Earth. Gravitational attraction from the Moon or Sun can cause the Earth&#x27;s surface at a given point to vary by tenths of a meter over a nearly 12-hour period (see Earth tide).

===Radius and local conditions===

Given local and transient influences on surface height, the values defined below are based on a &quot;general purpose&quot; model, refined as globally precisely as possible within of reference ellipsoid height, and to within of mean sea level (neglecting geoid height).

Additionally, the radius can be estimated from the curvature of the Earth at a point. Like a torus, the curvature at a point will be greatest (tightest) in one direction (north–south on Earth) and smallest (flattest) perpendicularly (east–west). The corresponding radius of curvature depends on the location and direction of measurement from that point. A consequence is that a distance to the true horizon at the equator is slightly shorter in the north–south direction than in the east–west direction.

In summary, local variations in terrain prevent defining a single &quot;precise&quot; radius. One can only adopt an idealized model. Since the estimate by Eratosthenes, many models have been created. Historically, these models were based on regional topography, giving the best reference ellipsoid for the area under survey. As satellite remote sensing and especially the Global Positioning System gained importance, true global models were developed which, while not as accurate for regional work, best approximate the Earth as a whole.

==Extrema: equatorial and polar radii==
The following radii are derived from the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) reference ellipsoid. It is an idealized surface, and the Earth measurements used to calculate it have an uncertainty of ±2 m in both the equatorial and polar dimensions. Additional discrepancies caused by topographical variation at specific locations can be significant. When identifying the position of an observable location, the use of more precise values for WGS-84 radii may not yield a corresponding improvement in accuracy.

The value for the equatorial radius is defined to the nearest 0.1 m in WGS-84. The value for the polar radius in this section has been rounded to the nearest 0.1 m, which is expected to be adequate for most uses. Refer to the WGS-84 ellipsoid if a more precise value for its polar radius is needed.

* The Earth&#x27;s &quot;equatorial radius&quot; , or semi-major axis, is the distance from its center to the equator and equals . The equatorial radius is often used to compare Earth with other planets.
* The Earth&#x27;s &quot;polar radius&quot; , or semi-minor axis is the distance from its center to the North and South Poles, and equals .

==Location-dependent radii==

===Geocentric radius===
The &quot;geocentric radius&quot; is the distance from the Earth&#x27;s center to a point on the spheroid surface at geodetic latitude , given by the formula

:formula_4
where and are, respectively, the equatorial radius and the polar radius.

The extrema geocentric radii on the ellipsoid coincide with the equatorial and polar radii.
They are vertices of the ellipse and also coincide with minimum and maximum radius of curvature.

===Radii of curvature===
====Principal radii of curvature====

There are two principal radii of curvature: along the meridional and prime-vertical normal sections. 

=====Meridional=====
In particular, the &quot;Earth&#x27;s meridional radius of curvature&quot; (in the north–south direction) at is
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the eccentricity of the earth. This is the radius that Eratosthenes measured in his arc measurement.

=====Prime vertical=====
If one point had appeared due east of the other, one finds the approximate curvature in the east–west direction.

This &quot;Earth&#x27;s prime-vertical radius of curvature&quot;, also called the &quot;Earth&#x27;s transverse radius of curvature&quot;, is defined perpendicular (orthogonal) to at geodetic latitude and is
:formula_7

&quot;N&quot; can also be interpreted geometrically as the normal distance from the ellipsoid surface to the polar axis.
The radius of a parallel of latitude is given by formula_8.

=====Polar and equatorial radius of curvature=====
The &quot;Earth&#x27;s meridional radius of curvature at the equator&quot; equals the meridian&#x27;s semi-latus rectum:

:formula_9

The &quot;Earth&#x27;s prime-vertical radius of curvature at the equator&quot; equals the equatorial radius, formula_10 

The &quot;Earth&#x27;s polar radius of curvature&quot; (either meridional or prime-vertical) is formula_11

=====Derivation=====

The principal curvatures are the roots of Equation (125) in:

:formula_12

where in the first fundamental form for a surface (Equation (112) in):

&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; are elements of the metric tensor:

:formula_14

formula_15, formula_16, formula_17

in the second fundamental form for a surface (Equation (123) in):

:formula_18

&quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; are elements of the shape tensor:

:formula_19

formula_20 is the unit normal to the surface at formula_21, and because
formula_22 and formula_23 are tangents to the surface,

:formula_24
is normal to the surface at formula_21.

With formula_26 for an oblate spheroid, the curvatures are

:formula_27 and formula_28

and the principal radii of curvature are

:formula_29 and formula_30

The first and second radii of curvature correspond, respectively, to the Earth&#x27;s meridional and prime-vertical radii of curvature.

Geometrically, the second fundamental form gives the distance from formula_31 to the plane tangent at formula_21.
====Combined radii of curvature====

=====Azimuthal=====
The Earth&#x27;s &quot;azimuthal radius of curvature&quot;, along an Earth normal section at an azimuth (measured clockwise from north) and at latitude , is derived from Euler&#x27;s curvature formula as follows:
:formula_33

=====Non-directional=====
It is possible to combine the principal radii of curvature above in a non-directional manner.

The &quot;Earth&#x27;s Gaussian radius of curvature&quot; at latitude is
:formula_34
where &quot;K&quot; is the &quot;Gaussian curvature&quot;, formula_35

The &quot;Earth&#x27;s mean radius of curvature&quot; at latitude is
:formula_36

==Global radii==
The Earth can be modeled as a sphere in many ways. This section describes the common ways. The various radii derived here use the notation and dimensions noted above for the Earth as derived from the WGS-84 ellipsoid; namely,

:&quot;Equatorial radius&quot;: = ()
:&quot;Polar radius&quot;: = ()

A sphere being a gross approximation of the spheroid, which itself is an approximation of the geoid, units are given here in kilometers rather than the millimeter resolution appropriate for geodesy.

===Arithmetic mean radius===
In geophysics, the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) defines the &quot;Earth&#x27;s arithmetic mean radius&quot; (denoted ) to be
:formula_37
The factor of two accounts for the biaxial symmetry in Earth&#x27;s spheroid, a specialization of triaxial ellipsoid.
For Earth, the arithmetic mean radius is .

===Authalic radius===

&quot;Earth&#x27;s authalic radius&quot; (meaning &quot;equal area&quot;) is the radius of a hypothetical perfect sphere that has the same surface area as the reference ellipsoid. The IUGG denotes the authalic radius as .
A closed-form solution exists for a spheroid:
:formula_38
where is the eccentricity, and is the surface area of the spheroid.

For the Earth, the authalic radius is .

The authalic radius formula_39 also corresponds to the &quot;radius of (global) mean curvature&quot;, obtained by averaging the Gaussian curvature, formula_40, over the surface of the ellipsoid. Using the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, this gives
:formula_41

===Volumetric radius===
Another spherical model is defined by the &quot;Earth&#x27;s volumetric radius&quot;, which is the radius of a sphere of volume equal to the ellipsoid. The IUGG denotes the volumetric radius as .
:formula_42
For Earth, the volumetric radius equals .

===Rectifying radius===

Another global radius is the &quot;Earth&#x27;s rectifying radius&quot;, giving a sphere with circumference equal to the perimeter of the ellipse described by any polar cross section of the ellipsoid. This requires an elliptic integral to find, given the polar and equatorial radii:
:formula_43

The rectifying radius is equivalent to the meridional mean, which is defined as the average value of :
:formula_44

For integration limits of [0,], the integrals for rectifying radius and mean radius evaluate to the same result, which, for Earth, amounts to .

The meridional mean is well approximated by the semicubic mean of the two axes,
:formula_45

which differs from the exact result by less than ; the mean of the two axes,
:formula_46

about , can also be used.

==Topographical radii==
The mathematical expressions above apply over the surface of the ellipsoid.
The cases below considers Earth&#x27;s topography, above or below a reference ellipsoid.
As such, they are &quot;topographical geocentric distances&quot;, &quot;R&quot;t, which depends not only on latitude.

===Topographical extremes===
* Maximum &quot;R&quot;t: the summit of Chimborazo is from the Earth&#x27;s center.
* Minimum &quot;R&quot;t: the floor of the Arctic Ocean is from the Earth&#x27;s center.

===Topographical global mean===
The &quot;topographical mean geocentric distance&quot; averages elevations everywhere, resulting in a value larger than the IUGG mean radius, the authalic radius, or the volumetric radius. This topographical average is with uncertainty of .

==Derived quantities: diameter, circumference, arc-length, area, volume ==

Earth&#x27;s diameter is simply twice Earth&#x27;s radius; for example, &quot;equatorial diameter&quot; (2&quot;a&quot;) and &quot;polar diameter&quot; (2&quot;b&quot;). For the WGS84 ellipsoid, that&#x27;s respectively:
: .

&quot;Earth&#x27;s circumference&quot; equals the perimeter length. The &quot;equatorial circumference&quot; is simply the circle perimeter: &quot;C&quot;e = 2&quot;πa&quot;, in terms of the equatorial radius &quot;a&quot;. The &quot;polar circumference&quot; equals &quot;C&quot;p = 4&quot;m&quot;p, four times the quarter meridian &quot;m&quot;p = &quot;aE&quot;(&quot;e&quot;), where the polar radius &quot;b&quot; enters via the eccentricity &quot;e&quot; = (1 − &quot;b&quot;2/&quot;a&quot;2)0.5; see Ellipse#Circumference for details.

Arc length of more general surface curves, such as meridian arcs and geodesics, can also be derived from Earth&#x27;s equatorial and polar radii.

Likewise for surface area, either based on a map projection or a geodesic polygon.

Earth&#x27;s volume, or that of the reference ellipsoid, is formula_47 Using the parameters from WGS84 ellipsoid of revolution, and , .

==Nominal radii==
In astronomy, the International Astronomical Union denotes the &quot;nominal equatorial Earth radius&quot; as formula_48, which is defined to be exactly . The &quot;nominal polar Earth radius&quot; is defined exactly as formula_49 = . These values correspond to the zero Earth tide convention. Equatorial radius is conventionally used as the nominal value unless the polar radius is explicitly required.
The nominal radius serves as a unit of length for astronomy.
(The notation is defined such that it can be easily generalized for other planets; e.g., formula_50 for the nominal polar Jupiter radius.)

==Published values==
This table summarizes the accepted values of the Earth&#x27;s radius.

==History==
The first published reference to the Earth&#x27;s size appeared around 350 BC, when Aristotle reported in his book &quot;On the Heavens&quot; that mathematicians had guessed the circumference of the Earth to be 400,000 stadia. Scholars have interpreted Aristotle&#x27;s figure to be anywhere from highly accurate to almost double the true value. The first known scientific measurement and calculation of the circumference of the Earth was performed by Eratosthenes in about 240 BC. Estimates of the error of Eratosthenes&#x27;s measurement range from 0.5% to 17%. For both Aristotle and Eratosthenes, uncertainty in the accuracy of their estimates is due to modern uncertainty over which stadion length they meant.

Around 100 BC, Posidonius of Apamea recomputed Earth&#x27;s radius, and found it to be close to that by Eratosthenes, but later Strabo incorrectly attributed him a value about 3/4 of the actual size. Claudius Ptolemy around 150 AD gave empirical evidence supporting a spherical Earth, but he accepted the lesser value attributed to Posidonius. His highly influential work, the &quot;Almagest&quot;, left no doubt among medieval scholars that Earth is spherical, but they were wrong about its size.

By 1490, Christopher Columbus believed that traveling 3,000 miles west from the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula would let him reach the eastern coasts of Asia. However, the 1492 enactment of that voyage brought his fleet to the Americas. The Magellan expedition (1519–1522), which was the first circumnavigation of the World, soundly demonstrated the sphericity of the Earth, and affirmed the original measurement of by Eratosthenes.

Around 1690, Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens argued that Earth was closer to an oblate spheroid than to a sphere. However, around 1730, Jacques Cassini argued for a prolate spheroid instead, due to different interpretations of the Newtonian mechanics involved. To settle the matter, the French Geodesic Mission (1735–1739) measured one degree of latitude at two locations, one near the Arctic Circle and the other near the equator. The expedition found that Newton&#x27;s conjecture was correct: the Earth is flattened at the poles due to rotation&#x27;s centrifugal force.

<text>Fremantle () () is a port city in Western Australia located at the mouth of the Swan River in the metropolitan area of Perth, the state capital. Fremantle Harbour serves as the port of Perth. The Western Australian vernacular diminutive for Fremantle is Freo.

Prior to British settlement, the indigenous Noongar people inhabited the area for millennia, and knew it by the name of Walyalup (&quot;place of the woylie&quot;). Visited by Dutch explorers in the 1600s, Fremantle was the first area settled by the Swan River colonists in 1829, and is named after Captain Charles Fremantle, an English naval officer who claimed the west coast of New Holland as British territory. The settlement struggled in its first decades, and in 1850, with the advent of penal transportation to the colony, Fremantle became Australia&#x27;s primary destination for convicts. The convict-built Fremantle Prison operated long after transportation of convicts ended in 1868, and is now a World Heritage Site.

Fremantle was charted as a municipality in 1883, and the following decade its harbour was deepened for commercial shipping, transforming the port into a bustling trade centre and gateway at the height of the Western Australian gold rushes. Declared a city in 1929, Fremantle played a key role in World War II as the largest submarine base in the Southern Hemisphere. Post-war immigration from Europe, particularly Italy, helped shape Fremantle&#x27;s character, and it rapidly gentrified after hosting the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup sailing competition. Today, Fremantle is recognised for its well-preserved Victorian and Edwardian streetscapes and convict-era architecture, and is known as a bohemian enclave with a thriving arts and culinary scene. It is also the traditional home of the Fremantle Football Club, one of two Australian Football League teams based in Western Australia.

== History ==
=== Indigenous Australians ===
The original inhabitants of the land on which the city is built are the Whadjuk Noongar people, who called the area &quot;Walyalup&quot; (&quot;place of the woylie&quot;). To the local Noongar people, Fremantle is a place of ceremonies, significant cultural practices and trading. For millennia the Noongar people met there in spring and autumn to feast on fish and game.

Anglesea Point and the limestone hill area at Arthur Head (where the Round House prison stands) to Point Marquis was called &quot;Manjaree&quot;, an important meeting place where bush paths converged and a major trading place for Whadjuk and neighbouring Noongars. Today, Whadjuk and other Noongars continue to gather and meet in &quot;Walyalup&quot; and at &quot;Manjaree&quot;.

=== European settlement and convict era ===
The first Europeans to visit the site of modern-day Fremantle were Dutch explorers captained by Willem de Vlamingh, in 1697. They mapped the area and went up the Swan River, and Vlamingh reported that it would be an ideal place for a settlement, although no attempts were made at the time.

The area was considered as a site for possible British settlement in 1827, when Captain James Stirling, in , explored the coastal areas near the Swan River. His favourable report was welcomed by the British Government, who had for some time been suspicious of French colonial intentions towards the western portion of Australia. As a result of Stirling&#x27;s report, Captain Charles Fremantle of , a 603-ton, 28-gun frigate, was instructed to sail to the west coast of Australia to establish a settlement there.

On 2 May 1829, Fremantle hoisted the Union Flag in a bay near what is now known as Arthur Head, and in accordance with his instructions, took formal possession &quot;of the whole of the West Coast of New Holland&quot; in the name of Britain&#x27;s King George IV. Western Australia Day (formerly Foundation Day) is observed on the first Monday in June, although it was actually on 2 June 1829 that Captain James Stirling on arrived with Surveyor-General Roe and the first contingent of immigrants to set up the Swan River Colony. The settlement of Perth began on 12 August 1829. Captain Fremantle left the colony on 25 August after providing much assistance to Stirling in setting up the colony. It was then that Stirling decided to name the port settlement &quot;Fremantle&quot;. In early September 1829, the merchant vessel &quot;Anglesea&quot; grounded at Gage Roads, at the mouth of the Swan River. She did not break up, as had been expected, but instead survived to become Western Australia&#x27;s first prison hulk. , which arrived on 10 October 1829, became the second vessel to land immigrants at Fremantle.

On 1 June 1850, the first convicts arrived at Fremantle aboard . The thirty-seventh and last convict ship to dock at Fremantle was on 10 January 1868, signalling the end of penal transportation to Australia. Among the 280 convicts on board were 62 Fenian military and political prisoners—members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood—six of whom managed to escape the Convict Establishment in the Catalpa rescue of 1876. During this period, notorious South Sea pirate Bully Hayes lived in Fremantle with his fiancée Miss Scott, daughter of the Fremantle Harbour Master.

=== Gateway to the West ===


In 1897, Irish-born engineer C. Y. O&#x27;Connor deepened Fremantle Harbour and removed the limestone bar and sand shoals across the entrance to the Swan River, thus rendering Fremantle a serviceable port for commercial shipping. This occurred at the height of the late 19th-century Western Australian gold rush, transforming Fremantle into a capital of trade and gateway for thousands of gold miners to the inland boom towns of Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie and Southern Cross. Camels and their Afghan drivers were familiar sights, and by-laws regulating the driving of camels through the streets of Fremantle were enacted.

The wealth generated during this period resulted in the construction of many pubs, hotels, banks, warehouses, import-export businesses and shipping companies throughout Fremantle, and in 1905, the Fremantle tram network opened.

In 1919, a deadly clash between striking waterside workers and police took place at Fremantle Harbour.

===Naval operations===

During the Second World War, Fremantle was the home of the largest base for Allied submarines in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second largest in the Pacific War after Pearl Harbor. In the lead-up to and during the war, the port&#x27;s existing batteries were upgraded and new ones were constructed, forming a coastal defence system referred to as Fremantle Fortress. There were up to 125 US, 31 British and 11 Free Dutch submarines operating out of Fremantle, until the Americans moved forward to the Philippines. One of the first US submarines to arrive in Fremantle, the USS &quot;Sargo&quot; (SS-188), was bombed by an Australian Lockheed Hudson, which mistook it for a Japanese vessel. The movements and presence of USS &quot;Sturgeon&quot; (SS-187) is a good example of such activity.

Fremantle was considered a &quot;veritable Shangri-la&quot; among submariners during the war, however tensions between transient American and non-American soldiers often led to alcohol-fuelled violence. On 11 April 1944, a brawl between American and New Zealand servicemen at the National Hotel resulted in many injuries and the death from stab wounds of two Māori soldiers.

===Post-Second World War===

After Australia won the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup yacht race, Fremantle hosted Australia&#x27;s defence of the trophy in 1987. The series was held in Gage Roads and significantly boosted the local economy and tourism. A new Fremantle marina, Challenger Harbour, was built alongside the existing Fishing Boat Harbour.

The City of Fremantle introduced several urban renewal projects in 2012, encouraging mixed-use development by increasing the maximum building height on key sites in the CBD, including Kings Square and the inner East End. In January 2013, the City of Fremantle became the first council in Australia to outlaw the use of non-degradable plastic bags within their local area.

Fremantle still serves as the chief general seaport for Western Australia, though far greater tonnages are exported from the iron-ore ports of the Pilbara.

== Geography ==

Fremantle lies on a series of limestone hills known by the Nyungar people as &quot;Booyeembara&quot;; the sandplain to the east is &quot;Gardoo&quot;. The original vegetation of the area was mainly &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; and eucalyptus trees, which were traditionally fired annually by the Aboriginal people.

The suburb of Fremantle is bounded by the Swan River to the north and north-west, the Indian Ocean to the west, South Street to the south, and the suburbs of East Fremantle and White Gum Valley to the east. The central part of the suburb extends eastwards to include Royal Fremantle Golf Club and a suburban area south of Marmion Street and west of Carrington Street. The City of Fremantle local government area also includes the suburbs of Beaconsfield, Hilton, North Fremantle, O&#x27;Connor, Samson, South Fremantle, and White Gum Valley. East Fremantle has its own town council and is not governed by the City of Fremantle.

Fremantle is the end of the Fremantle railway line which runs from Perth to Fremantle, run by the Western Australia&#x27;s Public Transport Authority. Major highways including Stirling Highway, Canning Highway and Leach Highway have Fremantle as their start point and/or terminus.

=== Climate ===
Fremantle has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa). The regular sea breeze is known as the Fremantle Doctor, as it provides cooling relief from the summer heat when it arrives between noon and 3pm. Fremantle is generally a few degrees cooler than Perth in summer.

==Politics==
The Fremantle state seat was continuously held by the Australian Labor Party from 1924 until 2009, when it was lost at a by-election to Greens candidate Adele Carles. The seat was returned to Labor (Simone McGurk) in the 2013 state election. The federal electorate has returned Labor members continuously since 1934, including former Prime Minister John Curtin, and is represented by Josh Wilson.

The local government of the City of Fremantle consists of a mayor and council. Hannah Fitzhardinge has been the mayor since the 2021 local government elections.
Fremantle has been represented by some significant Australian political figures. John Curtin served as Prime Minister during the Second World War, and is often described as one of the nation&#x27;s greatest political leaders. The state&#x27;s largest university and a major secondary school in Fremantle are named after him, and his statue stands in Kings Square near the Fremantle Town Hall. A long-serving mayor of the town, Sir Frank Gibson (1919–1923 and 1926–1952), was also a Liberal parliamentarian from 1942 to 1956. Gibson, a pharmacist with a shop in High Street, was admired by all sides of politics for his civic leadership and tireless work for the city, especially during the Second World War, when he is said to have visited every ship that called at the port. He was a leading figure in many civic organisations and his stepson, Roger Dunkley, was medical officer with the 2nd/2nd Independent Company during the Timor campaign in the Second World War. Carmen Lawrence, the first female premier of an Australian state, later represented Fremantle in the federal House of Representatives.

Fremantle has seen many industrial conflicts, the most famous of which occurred in 1919 when rioting broke out during the Battle of the Barricades, resulting in one death and many injuries.

On 10 November 2006, Australian state and territory attorneys general met in Fremantle to sign the Fremantle Declaration, a restatement and affirmation of legal and human rights principles in Australia. In 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched the Commonwealth Youth Forum in Fremantle as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011, held in Perth 28–30 October.

== Heritage buildings ==

Fremantle is renowned for its well-preserved architectural heritage, including convict-built structures and hundreds of gold rush-era buildings, presenting a variety and unity of historic buildings and streetscapes. These were often built in locally quarried limestone with ornate façades in a succession of architectural styles. Rapid development following the harbour works gave rise to an Edwardian precinct as merchant and shipping companies built in the west end and on reclaimed land.

The Round House, the oldest remaining intact building in Western Australia, was built as a jail between 1830 and 1831. The Round House had eight cells and a jailer&#x27;s residence, which all opened up into a central courtyard. In the 1800s, bay whaling was carried out from Bathers Beach below the Round House. As part of the whaling operations, a tunnel was constructed under the Round House to provide whalers with access to the town from the jetty and beach. The Round House is located in what is now known as Fremantle&#x27;s West End: a collection of streets characterised by late Victorian and Edwardian architecture. A process of gentrification in the early 1990s was accelerated by the establishment of the University of Notre Dame Australia that occupies, and has restored, many of the buildings in the West End.
When the first 75 convicts arrived from Britain in 1850 to support the colony&#x27;s dwindling population, it became apparent that the Round House was inadequate to house them. The convicts built a new jail, Fremantle Prison, which was completed in the 1850s and continued to be used as Fremantle&#x27;s prison until 1991. Fremantle Prison was once one of the most notorious prisons in the British Empire. It housed British convicts, local prisoners, military prisoners, enemy aliens and prisoners of war. In 2010, Fremantle Prison was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the &quot;Australian Convict Sites&quot;, making it the first built environment in Western Australia to be bestowed this honour. It continues to be accessible to the public for guided tours and as a venue for artistic and cultural activities.

Other convict-built buildings in Fremantle include the 1850s Fremantle School building and Commissariat Buildings, and the Fremantle Arts Centre, constructed in the 1860s from locally quarried limestone. It is a former lunatic asylum building on Ord Street, and is one of Fremantle&#x27;s most significant landmarks. Today, the imposing Victorian Gothic building and its historic courtyards are used for art exhibitions and music concerts.
The Fremantle Markets opened in 1897, forming a precinct providing handicrafts, specialty foods, dining halls and fish and vegetable markets. The area also hosts buskers and other street performers. The then premier, Sir John Forrest, laid the foundation stone for the markets on Saturday 6 November 1897. Over 150 stalls are housed in the Victorian-era building, which was listed by the National Trust of Australia and the state&#x27;s Heritage Council in 1980. The Fremantle Markets are adjacent to several other historic buildings, including the Sail and Anchor Hotel (which contains a microbrewery), the Norfolk Hotel, the Warders Cottages, the Fremantle Technical School, Fremantle Synagogue and Scots Presbyterian Church.

Some key historical buildings have been lost to development, while others are only extant thanks to community activism that went against the wishes of developers. For example, the art deco Oriana Cinema on the corner of Queen and High streets was demolished in 1972, after only 34 years of operation. This was done to make way for the widening of High Street, but that project was stopped thanks to the campaigning of the Fremantle Society and other community members, and the buildings along the southern side of High Street were retained. The Fremantle Markets nearly suffered a similar fate in the late 1970s due to another road-widening proposal.

The National Hotel, one of the city&#x27;s historic buildings, was almost destroyed by fire on the night of Sunday, 11 March 2007. Though the interior was gutted, the façade was saved and the building has since been fully restored with an additional rooftop bar.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Australian census, the local government area of City of Fremantle had a population of 31,930 people. 64.9% of the population was born in Australia, compared with the national average of 67%. Indigenous Australians make up 1.7% of the population, and the largest overseas-born groups come from England (8.5%), Italy (2.3%), New Zealand (2.1%), Scotland (1.2%) and Ireland (1.0%). After English, the most common language spoken at home is Italian (3.2%), followed by French (1.1%), German (1.1%), Spanish (1.0%) and Portuguese (0.8%).

As of the 2021 census, Fremantle had an unemployment rate of 5.8%. The city has an above-average proportion of rented dwellings (31.7%, vs 30.6% nationally). 54% of the population had no religion, 19.7% of the population was Catholic, 8.1% Anglican and 7.5% not stated.

==Education==

===Tertiary institutions===

Fremantle&#x27;s tertiary education institutions are:
* University of Notre Dame Australia – the university&#x27;s presence has contributed to Fremantle often being referred to as a &quot;university town&quot; typical of the older university towns of Europe and the only one of its type in Australia. The restored historic buildings of the campus lend a distinctive character to Notre Dame.
* South Metropolitan TAFE (Technical And Further Education) – has several campuses in Fremantle, including its main campus in Beaconsfield, the WA Maritime Training Centre at Victoria Quay, and the E-Tech campus located within the city centre.

==Media==
Fremantle was served by a Community Newspaper Group paper, &quot;The Fremantle–Cockburn Gazette&quot;, until 2021 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Newspaper_Group) and was replaced by &quot;PerthNow – Fremantle&quot;. The independent local newspaper, the &quot;Fremantle Herald&quot;, also serves the region.

Fremantle also has two radio stations: Radio Fremantle on 107.9FM and 91.3 SportFM.

Online reporting and reviews of events and places within Fremantle are comprehensively covered by a group of local designers on their popular blog, known as &#x27;Love Freo&#x27;, and by a local photographer with his daily updated blog Freo&#x27;s View.

==Culture==
Fremantle offers a wide variety of dining experiences, with a strong emphasis on Italian and Asian cuisine as well as seafood. Various cafés and coffee shops are situated around Fremantle, particularly on the &#x27;Cappuccino Strip&#x27;, a section of South Terrace known for its &quot;al fresco&quot; dining culture. The Fishing Boat Harbour has become a tourist precinct, with a mixture of microbreweries, restaurants and some of Australia&#x27;s largest fish and chip shops. A number of old buildings on the harbour have been renovated, including Little Creatures Brewery, which occupies a former boat shed and crocodile farm, and contains a café and art gallery. The harbour&#x27;s annual Fremantle Sardine Festival on Esplanade Park attracts thousands of seafood lovers every year. Other annual events held at the harbour include Araluen&#x27;s Fremantle Chilli Festival, the Fremantle Boat Show, and the traditional Italian Blessing of the Fleet ceremony.

Fremantle—along with the inner suburbs Northbridge, Leederville and Subiaco—is one of Perth&#x27;s major nightlife hubs. It attracts people from all over the metropolitan region for its pubs, bars and nightclubs.

There are several major annual festivals in Fremantle. First held in 1906, the Fremantle Festival is Australia&#x27;s longest running community festival. International street performers converge for the Fremantle Street Arts Festival, held over the Easter holiday period. The Fremantle Heritage Festival celebrates local history with a variety of events, tours, concerts and workshops.

Fremantle is also home to several galleries and museums. The Western Australian Museum has two branches in Fremantle: the Shipwreck Galleries, housed in convict-constructed commissariat buildings and known for its artefacts from the wrecked Dutch East India Company ship &quot;Batavia&quot; and other 17th-century Dutch ships; and the Maritime Museum on Victoria Quay, which contains exhibits related to maritime trade and the Indian Ocean. The Army Museum of Western Australia is housed in an historic Fremantle artillery barracks.

=== Arts ===

The city has a large arts community, with a number of small art galleries and musical venues and a community theatre company, Harbour Theatre Inc., which has been performing in the city since 1963. There is also the J Shed situated on Bathers&#x27; Beach. J Shed houses four artists studios. Old Customs House, a heritage building just across from the working Fremantle Ports, is home to a not-for-profit artists agency, Artsource, and provides 23 artist studios, and houses several other arts organisations.
Known as a music hub, Fremantle has given rise to many notable musicians, including AC/DC frontman Bon Scott, who grew up in the city and whose gravesite at Fremantle Cemetery has become a cultural landmark. A statue of Scott was erected in 2009 at the Fishing Boat Harbour. Dom Mariani also grew up in Fremantle, as did James Baker, and in the mid-1970s, fellow punk rock pioneer Kim Salmon resided at the Tarantella Night Club, where he made his first public performances. John Butler of the John Butler Trio started his music career busking in Fremantle in the 1990s. Alternative rock and folk groups Little Birdy, The Waifs and Eskimo Joe all have Fremantle connections, and belong to what has been dubbed the &#x27;Freo Sound&#x27;. Other notable Fremantle musicians include bassist Martyn P. Casey, psychedelic rock groups Tame Impala and Pond, and indie pop band San Cisco. Songs about Fremantle include the title track of Paul Kelly&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Under the Sun&quot;, The Waifs&#x27; 2004 single &quot;Bridal Train&quot;, and much of Eskimo Joe&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;A Song is a City&quot;. Fremantle is home to a number of independent labels, including Redline Records, co-run by Jebediah frontman and Fremantle-native Kevin Mitchell, and Jarrah Records, co-founded by the John Butler Trio and The Waifs. Music festivals held in Fremantle include the West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival, the Fremantle Winter Music Festival, and the St Jerome&#x27;s Laneway Festival. The Fremantle Eisteddfod, running annually at the Fremantle Town Hall, supports young artists with prizes and concerts.
Fremantle has served as the setting for several films. &quot;Windrider&quot; (1986) was shot in Fremantle and starred Nicole Kidman. In the 2004 film &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, four devoted AC/DC fans travel across Australia from Sydney to Fremantle to bury their best friend next to Bon Scott&#x27;s grave. Shooting for the 2006 film &quot;Last Train to Freo&quot; took place outside Fremantle railway station, while scenes in the 2010 musical film &quot;Bran Nue Dae&quot; were shot in Fremantle&#x27;s West End. Other films shot and/or set in Fremantle include &quot;Wind&quot; (1992), &quot;Teesh and Trude&quot; (2003) and &quot;Two Fists, One Heart&quot; (2008).

The children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Sleepover Club&quot; and &quot;Streetsmartz&quot; were set and shot in Fremantle. In 2006, Fremantle Prison was featured on an episode of the American version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Episodes of the BBC World documentary television series &quot;Peschardt&#x27;s People&quot; have been filmed in Fremantle, including an episode with Australian actress Toni Collette and another with Fremantle-based English comedian Ben Elton.

Actors from Fremantle include Emma Booth, Ewen Leslie, David Frankflin, Mary Ward and Simon Lyndon. Sam Worthington and Megan Gale attended their first acting classes at John Curtin College of the Arts in Fremantle. In 2009, Fremantle model Tahnee Atkinson won the fifth cycle of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

===Sport and recreation===

Global attention turned to Fremantle when it hosted the America&#x27;s Cup yachting race in 1987, after Australia was the first country to ever win the race, aside from the US, in 1983. The unsuccessful cup defence was conducted on the waters in Gage Roads, and is considered a hallmark event of the late 20th century revitalisation and gentrification of the city. Fremantle has subsequently served as a stopover in the Clipper, Velux and Volvo round-the-world yacht races, and hosted the 2011 ISAF Sailing World Championships, a major qualifying event for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Organised Australian rules football was first played in Fremantle in the early 1880s with the Fremantle Football Club, a founding member of the West Australian Football Association in 1885. The club disbanded at the end of the 1886 season after winning its first premiership. Founded in 1882, the Fremantle-based Unions Football Club entered WAFA in 1886, attracting many players from the original Fremantle club, and went on to dominate the competition with ten premiership victories. The Unions folded in 1899 and were superseded by East Fremantle (1898–), South Fremantle (1900–), and North Fremantle (1901–1915). The East Fremantle Sharks are by far the most successful club in the West Australian Football League, winning a total of 30 premierships. East Fremantle Oval has been the team&#x27;s home ground since 1953. Today, Fremantle is represented in the Australian Football League by the Fremantle Dockers, who previously trained at the heritage-listed Fremantle Oval, shared with South Fremantle, and play their home matches at Perth Stadium (also known as Optus Stadium) in Burswood. The club&#x27;s main rivalry is with the Perth-based West Coast Eagles. In 2013, the Dockers played in (and lost) their first Grand Final. The Fremantle women&#x27;s team has competed in AFL Women&#x27;s since 2017 and play their home games at Fremantle Oval.

Founded in 1887, the Fremantle District Cricket Club competes in the Western Australian Grade Cricket competition, and plays its home fixtures at Fremantle&#x27;s Stevens Reserve. The club has produced a number of Test players including Graeme Wood, Brad Hogg, Geoff Marsh and sons Shaun Marsh and Mitchell Marsh. Three Fremantle soccer teams compete in Football West State League competitions: Fremantle Spirit, Fremantle United and the Fremantle Croatia Soccer Club.
Fremantle is home to five beaches: Bathers Beach, River Beach, South Beach, Leighton Beach and Port Beach. The city&#x27;s strong afternoon sea breeze, known locally as the Freo Doctor, has made its beaches a prime location for wind and kite surfing. The Fremantle Surf Life Saving Club has been active since the 1930s. Fishing takes place at the many jetties and groynes surrounding Challenger, Success Boat and Fishing Boat harbours, and along Blackwall Reach at the Swan River, which is also used for canoeing, rock climbing and cliff diving. A chain of islands listed as A Class nature reserves lie within 20 km (12 mi) of Fremantle, and are accessible by ferry or private boat. The largest and most well-known island is Rottnest Island, followed by Garden Island and Carnac Island. Each island is home to endemic flora and fauna, and provide opportunities for water-based activities such as sunbathing, surfing, snorkelling and scuba diving.

==Transportation==
Fremantle is home to Western Australia&#x27;s largest working port. The Inner Harbour, in Fremantle itself, handles almost the entire container trade for the state, as well as livestock exports, motor vehicle imports and general cargo. Located fifteen kilometres south of Fremantle, at Kwinana, the Outer Harbour is one of Australia&#x27;s major bulk cargo ports, handling a variety of bulk commodities, from grain to LPG.

The city is the western terminus of the direct, electrified passenger railway service from the Perth CBD. Fremantle was the starting point of railways in the metropolitan area of Perth, the Fremantle railway line being the starting point of the first railway in 1881 to Guildford.

Major highways, the Stirling Highway, Canning Highway and Leach Highway connect Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Passenger ferries operate from the port, travelling to Rottnest Island, 22 kilometres off of the coast in the Indian Ocean, and upriver to Perth city centre. Fremantle&#x27;s free Central Area Transit (CAT) bus services are popular and practical ways to get around, with one service (Blue CAT) linking key points in the city and to Fremantle&#x27;s inner suburbs. But ceased operations in October 2023

== Health ==
The major health service facility in Fremantle is Fremantle Hospital, located at Alma Street, a short walk from the city centre. Fremantle Hospital is a 450-bed major acute-care teaching hospital with important tertiary links. The 24-hour emergency department was closed in 2015. It is Western Australia&#x27;s referral hospital for diving and hyperbaric medicine, and has a cardiothoracic surgery centre and nuclear medicine department. It also has a 66-bed mental health facility.

As a tertiary teaching hospital, Fremantle Hospital provides almost all specialty services on site and clinical services are backed by an extensive teaching program. As well as routine departmental and hospital-wide teaching, formal postgraduate courses are offered. Emergency nursing, critical care nursing, perioperative nursing and infection control courses are held regularly and a postgraduate weekend for general practitioners is held every October.

<text>A bodyguard (or close protection officer/operative) is a type of security guard, government law enforcement officer, or servicemember who protects an important person or group of people, such as high-ranking public officials, wealthy businesspeople, and celebrities, from harm. The personnel team that protects a VIP is often referred to as the VIP&#x27;s security detail.

Most important public figures, such as heads of state, heads of government, and governors are protected by a team of bodyguards from a government agency, security forces, or police forces. Less-important public figures, or those with lower risk profiles, may be accompanied by a single bodyguard who doubles as a driver.

==Roles==




The work of a bodyguard consists mainly of planning routes, pre-searching rooms and buildings where the client will be visiting, researching the backgrounds of people that will have contact with the client, searching vehicles, and escorting the client on their day-to-day activities. In the event of an emergency, a bodyguard&#x27;s priority will always be to evacuate their client, rather than engage with threats.

<text>Christopher Thomas Ewart Ewart-Biggs, (5 August 1921 – 21 July 1976) was the British Ambassador to Ireland, an author and senior Foreign Office liaison officer with MI6. He was killed in 1976 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Sandyford, Dublin.

His widow, Jane Ewart-Biggs, became a Life Peer in the House of Lords, campaigned to improve Anglo-Irish relations and established the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize for literature.

==Early life and career==
Christopher Thomas Ewart-Biggs was born in the Thanet district of Kent, England, to Captain Henry Ewart-Biggs of the Royal Engineers and his wife Mollie Brice. He was educated at Wellington College and University College, Oxford, and served in the Royal West Kent Regiment of the British Army during the Second World War. At the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942 he lost his right eye and as a result he wore a smoked-glass monocle over an artificial eye. He spent the rest of the war and after (1943–7) as political officer in Jefren, Tripolitania, where he learned fluent Italian and some Arabic.

Ewart-Biggs joined the Foreign Service in 1949, serving in Lebanon, Qatar and Algiers, as well as Manila, Brussels and Paris.

Following study at the Middle East Centre for Arabic Studies near Beirut, he was posted as political officer to Qatar (1951). In 1952 he married Gabrielle Verschoyle, and gained four stepchildren. The couple wrote a number of thrillers together using the pen name ‘Charles Elliott’ including &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; (1956). In 1959 she died in childbirth. He remarried (Felicity) Jane Randall on 5 May 1960. They had three children, Henrietta, Robin and Kate Ewart-Biggs.

==Death==
Ewart-Biggs was killed on 21 July 1976, at age 54, when his armoured Jaguar car, part of a four-vehicle convoy on its way to the British Embassy in Dublin, was thrown into the air by a land mine planted by the IRA. He had been taking precautions to avoid such an incident since coming to Dublin only two weeks before. Among the measures he employed was to vary his route many times a week but, at a vulnerable spot on the road connecting his residence to the main road, there was only a choice between left or right. He chose right, and, 317 yards down the road, the IRA remotely detonated 200 pounds of explosives hidden under a culvert. Ewart-Biggs and fellow passenger and civil servant Judith Cooke (aged 26) were killed. Driver Brian O&#x27;Driscoll and third passenger Brian Cubbon (the highest-ranking civil servant in Northern Ireland at the time) were injured. Republicans suggested Ewart-Biggs was targeted because of his intelligence connections though possibly Cubbon was the intended target. Two months after his murder, the IRA claimed responsibility and said that Ewart-Biggs had been sent to Dublin &quot;to co-ordinate British intelligence activities and he was assassinated because of that.&quot; The British Foreign Office dismissed the claim as nonsense.

It later emerged that the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, had at the last minute been forced to cancel plans which would have placed him in the convoy. He was to travel to the Republic to consult with the ambassador and Irish ministers, but postponed his trip after Margaret Thatcher refused to allow Northern Ireland ministers to &quot;pair&quot; their votes in House of Commons divisions. Rees wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Northern Ireland, a Personal Perspective&quot;, that it seemed likely the IRA had known of his impending visit but were unaware of its cancellation.

==Investigation==
The Irish government launched a manhunt involving 4,000 Gardaí and 2,000 soldiers. Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave declared that &quot;this atrocity fills all decent Irish people with a sense of shame.&quot; In London, the UK Prime Minister James Callaghan condemned the assassins as a &quot;common enemy whom we must destroy or be destroyed by&quot;. Thirteen suspected members of the IRA were arrested during raids as the British and Irish governments attempted to apprehend the assassins, but no one was ever convicted of the killings. In 2006, released Foreign and Commonwealth Office files revealed that the Gardaí had matched a partial fingerprint at the scene to Martin Taylor, an IRA member suspected of gun running from the United States. Taylor denied involvement.

<doc id="146699" wikidata="Q1243001" url="?curid=146699" title="Fine (penalty)">
<text>A fine or mulct (the latter synonym typically used in civil law) is a penalty of money that a court of law or other authority decides has to be paid as punishment for a crime or other offense. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.


The most usual use of the term is for financial punishments for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the settlement of a claim.

One typical example of a fine is money paid for violations of traffic laws. In English common law, relatively small fines are used either in place of or alongside community service orders for low-level criminal offences. More considerable fines are also given independently or alongside shorter prison sentences when the judge or magistrate considers a large amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be a significant danger to the public. For instance, fraud is often punished by substantial fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or profession they abused to commit their crimes.

Fines can also be used as a form of tax. Money for bail may be applied toward a fine.

A day-fine is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income (similar to progressive taxation), as opposed to a fine of a fixed amount. Day-fines are often implemented to alleviate some of the burden on people experiencing poverty, who might otherwise have issues paying/affording some fines.

Some fines are small, such as for loitering, for which fines (in the United States) range from about $25 to $100. In some areas of the United States (for example California, New York, Texas, and Washington D.C.), fines for petty crimes, such as criminal mischief (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) range from $2,500 to $5,000.

==Fines by country==
===England and Wales===

In the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression &quot;fine&quot;, except for any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any pecuniary penalty or pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.

In section 32 of that Act, the expression &quot;fine&quot; includes a pecuniary penalty but does not include a pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation.

In sections 15 to 32 and 48 of the Criminal Law Act 1977, the expression &quot;fine&quot; includes any pecuniary penalty.

In England, there is now a system whereby the court gives the offender a &#x27;fine card&#x27;, which is somewhat like a credit card; at any shop that has a paying-in machine, he pays the value of the fine to the shop, which then uses the fine card to pass that money on to the court&#x27;s bank account.

A related concept is the fixed penalty notice, a pecuniary penalty for some minor crimes that can be either accepted (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork) or taken to court for regular proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the Bill of Rights 1689, may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.

Early examples of fines include the weregild or blood money payable under Anglo-Saxon common law for causing a death. The murderer would be expected to pay a sum of money or goods dependent on the victim&#x27;s social status.

===The Netherlands===

====Criminal law====
====General information====
The Dutch Criminal Code &quot;(Dutch: Wetboek van Strafrecht (WvSr))&quot; doesn&#x27;t contain specific amounts for fines for every violation of the law. Instead of that, the Criminal Code provides six fine categories. Every penalty clause of the Criminal Code contains a fine category. The categories are:

These sums are only an upper limit, it&#x27;s up to the judge or the prosecutor to determine the exact sum of the fine. However, the amount of the fine must be at least €3. The sums of categories are always 1, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 2000 times the amount of the first category. In addition to the fine, the convict also has to pay an administration fee of €9. The amounts are established by the government, via a royal order.

When the judge convicts an individual to a fine, the judge must also set a term of substitute imprisonment. This substitute imprisonment will be executed in the case that the fine remains unpaid. The judge may count one-day imprisonment for every unpaid €25, however usually judges reckon one day for every €50 which stays unpaid. However, the substitute imprisonment must be at least one day (even though the fine was €3) and cannot exceed one year (even though the penalty was €100,000).

====Execution of a court-imposed fine====
Once a person is irrevocably convicted of a fine, it&#x27;s up to the public prosecutor to collect the fine. To do so, the cjib &quot;(centraal justiteel incassobureau (English: central judicial collection agency))&quot; is established.

First, the CJIB will send the convict the fine. If the convict pays the penalty, the case is closed (by paying, the convict loses the right to go into appeal as well); if they do not, the case will be continued. The CJIB will then send the convict a reminder, though this reminder will contain an increment of €15. If this doesn&#x27;t lead to the payment of the fine, the CJIB will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30. When the fine continues to be unpaid, the CJIB will instruct a bailiff to collect the penalty nonetheless. This bailiff may, for example, seize the convict&#x27;s income and sell his possessions. If these measures do not result in the full fine collection, the bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum but not the entire fine amount. After the substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again. He also won&#x27;t have to pay the fine anymore, and the case will be closed.

Before 1 September 1990, all traffic violations were punished via the criminal law. The suspects were first offered a sort of plea bargain. This mostly contains a fine. If the suspect didn&#x27;t pay the fine of this plea bargain, the public prosecutor had to open a criminal case. Otherwise, he wasn&#x27;t authorized to collect the penalty through force. The case had to be withdrawn when the capacity of the courts or the prosecutor&#x27;s office didn&#x27;t allow the start of a criminal case for a traffic violation. This was the case very often. This situation led to a negative spiral because traffic offenders hoped and expected their case to be withdrawn and not pay the plea bargain fine. This led to growing pressure on the capacity of the courts, which caused more sepots (decisions not to prosecute). This encouraged more offenders not to pay, etc.

To stop this spiral, the secretary general of the justice department (at that time), Dr. Albert Mulder, designed a new law enforcement system. Under this new system, the government acquired the right of summary foreclosure. The summary foreclosure means that the CJIB can execute the fine directly unless the fined subject goes to appeal.

The Administrative Enforcement of Traffic Rules Act &quot;(Dutch: Wet administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften (WAHV))&quot; regulates the system regarding frequently committed traffic violations. According to the WAHV, the maximum sum of the administrative fine is the same as the maximum amount of the first category (Art. 2 section 3 WvSr Criminal Code). The exact fine per violation is determined by an annex of the WAHV. In addition to the fine, the fined subject will also have to pay €9 administration costs as well. The amount of the administration costs will also be determined by the minister.

====Process of the administrative fine====
Once a subject has been fined by an officer or photographed by a speed camera, he will receive a decision within four months. This decision will contain a short description of the violation, the place and time the violation was committed and the sum of the fine.
The subject will have two choices now. He can pay the fine, or he can go into appeal. In contrast to the court-imposed fine, when the subject has paid the fine, he will keep the right to go into appeal. The subject can go into appeal within six weeks. In the first instance, the subject appeals to the public prosecutor. The prosecutor shall withdraw the fine completely when he thinks the appellant has right. He will lower the fine sum if he thinks the suspect is partially correct. If the prosecutor believes the suspect is wrong, he will uphold the fine. The suspect does not have to pay the fine as long as the prosecutor has not decided on the appeal yet.

Once the prosecutor has decided, the suspect will again have two choices. He can pay, or he goes into appeal at the sub-district judge of his arrondissement (or the arrondissement of the place where the disputed violation was committed). But now, the suspect has to pay the fine as a surety. If the suspect doesn&#x27;t pay the surety, the judge will declare him inadmissible (thus the fine will be upheld). The judge will have the same choices as the prosecutor. He can withdraw the fine, lower the fine, or uphold the fine.

If the (remaining) fine is higher than €70 and the suspect or/nor the prosecutor disagrees with the sub-district judge&#x27;s verdict, the suspect or the prosecutor can go into appeal for the last time. He does that at the court of appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden in Leeuwarden. This appeal will be in writing, unless the appellant, per se, wants to do it orally. If the fine is lower than €70, or the appellant&#x27;s appeal is rejected in Leeuwarden, there will be no legal remedies anymore and the case will be closed. The appellant&#x27;s surety will be transformed into a fine.

<doc id="146700" wikidata="Q896527" url="?curid=146700" title="Deadly force">
<text>Deadly force, also known as lethal force, is the use of force that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a , when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.

Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives, and vehicles are among those weapons the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of non-traditional weapons in an offensive manner, such as a baseball bat, sharp pencil, tire iron, or other, may also be considered deadly force.

==United Kingdom==
The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows householders to use reasonable force against intruders. In certain circumstances this can be lethal force.

== United States law ==

The United States Armed Forces defines deadly force as &quot;Force that is likely to cause, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury.&quot;.
In the United States, the use of deadly force by sworn law enforcement officers is lawful when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others. The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest, but this was narrowed in the &quot;Tennessee v. Garner&quot; ruling in 1985 when the U.S. Supreme Court said that &quot;deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape, and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others.&quot;

In the 1989 &quot;Graham v. Connor&quot; ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include the &quot;objective reasonableness&quot; standard—not subjective as to what the officer&#x27;s intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.

Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum, starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum relative to the force they are opposing.

A civilian&#x27;s use of deadly force is generally justified if they reasonably believe that they or another person are in imminent danger of death or serious injury. Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children, or the prevention of sexual assaults. 

U.S. law requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person&#x27;s death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for a particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may be performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General. A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.

The US police killing rate is 3.05 police killings per million of population. The US police killing rate of Blacks is 5.34 per million; of Hispanics is 2.63 per million; of Whites is 1.87 per million, and of others is 1.5 per million of population. The US police killing rate of Blacks is 2.86 times the US police killing rate of Whites. US police killing rates compare unfavorably with other jurisdictions.

=== In relation to motor vehicles ===
In , the U.S. Supreme Court held that a police officer&#x27;s attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the &quot;Harris&quot; case, Officer Scott applied his police car&#x27;s push bumper to the rear of the suspect&#x27;s vehicle, causing the suspect vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.

Traditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that, although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles, such fatalities are infrequent and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by
, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Scott v. Harris&quot; case discussed above; the extent to which &quot;Adams&quot; can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the &quot;Adams&quot; case, the officer rammed the suspect&#x27;s vehicle.

In
, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the &quot;Donovan&quot; case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer&#x27;s vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.

=== Situational threats === 
There are two main types of critical threats a suspect may pose: 1) escape and 2) physical harm. The latter threat involves a threat of violence, bodily harm, and/or death. If the suspect threatens to harm civilians and/or officers, then those officers must act to protect themselves and the public. In such a scenario, the perception of the officer(s) is critical. If there is a realistically perceived threat (i.e., the suspect is putting lives in danger), then officers may take the life of the suspect in order to protect themselves and the public. However, these situations can become complicated if the threat is not perceived as &#x27;genuine&#x27;, or if the suspect is in a location in which the use of deadly force to subdue the suspect may place other innocent bystander lives in danger.

<doc id="146702" wikidata="Q324563" url="?curid=146702" title="SWAT">
<text>In the United States, a SWAT (&quot;special weapons and tactics&quot;) team is a generic term for a police tactical unit.

SWAT units are generally trained, equipped, and deployed to resolve &quot;high-risk situations&quot;, often those regular police units are not trained or equipped to handle, such as shootouts, standoffs, raids, hostage-takings, and terrorism. SWAT units are equipped with specialized weapons and equipment not normally issued to regular police units, such as automatic firearms, high-caliber sniper rifles, stun grenades, body armor, ballistic shields, night-vision devices, and armored vehicles, among others. SWAT units are often trained in special tactics such as close-quarters combat, door breaching, crisis negotiation, and de-escalation.

The first SWAT units were formed in the 1960s to handle riot control and violent confrontations with criminals. The number and usage of SWAT units increased in the 1980s during the War on Drugs and the 1990s following incidents such as the North Hollywood shootout and Columbine High School massacre, with further increases in the 2000s for counterterrorism interests in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In the United States by 2005, SWAT teams were deployed 50,000 times every year, almost 80% of the time to serve search warrants, most often for narcotics. By 2015, the number of annual SWAT deployments had increased to nearly 80,000 times a year. Despite their heightened involvement in high-risk scenarios, research on their use of force has shown varied results. A study by professor Jimmy J. Williams and professor David Westall found that there wasn&#x27;t a significant difference in the frequency of use of force between SWAT and non-SWAT officers when responding to similar situations.

== Definition ==
The United States National Tactical Officers Association&#x27;s definition of SWAT is:

SWAT: A designated law enforcement team whose members are recruited, selected, trained, equipped and assigned to resolve critical incidents involving a threat to public safety which would otherwise exceed the capabilities of traditional law enforcement first responders and/or investigative units.

== History ==
=== Riots and political conflicts of the 1960s ===

According to the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Law Enforcement&quot;, the term &quot;SWAT&quot; was used as an acronym for the &quot;Special Weapons and Tactics&quot; established as a 100-man specialized unit in 1964 by the Philadelphia Police Department in response to an alarming increase in bank robberies. The purpose of this unit was to react quickly and decisively to bank robberies while they were in progress, using a large number of specially trained officers who had a great amount of firepower at their disposal. The tactic worked and was used to resolve other types of incidents involving heavily armed criminals. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Special Weapons and Tactics was established in 1967. LAPD inspector Daryl Gates envisioned the &quot;SWAT&quot; acronym to be &quot;Special Weapons Attack Team&quot; but this was not accepted by deputy chief Edward M. Davis who instead approved Special Weapons and Tactics. 

The LAPD promoted what became known as SWAT teams for a variety of reasons. After the racially-charged Watts riots in Los Angeles in August 1965, the LAPD began considering tactics it could use when faced with urban unrest, rioting, or widespread violence. Daryl Gates, who led the LAPD response to the riots, would later write that police at the time did not face a single mob, but rather &quot;people attacking from all directions&quot;. New York University professor Christian Parenti has written that SWAT teams were originally conceived of as an &quot;urban counterinsurgency bulwark&quot;.

Another reason for the creation of SWAT teams was the fear of lone or barricaded gunmen who might outperform police in a shootout, as happened in Austin with Charles Whitman.

After the LAPD&#x27;s establishment of its own SWAT team, many law enforcement agencies in United States established their own specialized units under various names. Gates explained in his autobiography &quot;&quot; that he neither developed SWAT tactics nor the associated and often distinctive equipment; but that he supported the underlying concept, tried to empower his people to develop it, and generally lent them moral support.

SWAT-type operations were conducted north of Los Angeles in the farming community of Delano, California on the border between Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley. At the time, the United Farm Workers union led by César Chavez was staging numerous protests in Delano in a strike that would last over five years from 1965 to 1970. Though the strike never turned violent, the Delano Police Department responded by forming ad-hoc SWAT-type units involving crowd and riot control, sniper skills, and surveillance. Television news stations and print media carried live and delayed reportage of these events across the United States. Personnel from the LAPD, having seen these broadcasts, contacted Delano and inquired about the program. One officer then obtained permission to observe the Delano Police Department&#x27;s special weapons and tactics units in action, and afterwards, he took what he had learned back to Los Angeles, where his knowledge was used and expanded on to form the LAPD&#x27;s own first SWAT unit.

John Nelson was the officer who conceived the idea to form a specially trained and equipped unit in the LAPD, intended to respond to and manage critical situations involving shootings while minimizing police casualties. Inspector Gates approved this idea, and he formed a small select group of volunteer officers. This first SWAT unit initially consisted of fifteen teams of four men each, making a total staff of sixty. These officers were given special status and benefits, and were required to attend special monthly training sessions. The unit also served as a security unit for police facilities during civil unrest. The LAPD SWAT units were organized as &quot;D Platoon&quot; in the Metro division.

Early police powers and tactics used by SWAT teams were aided by legislation passed in 1967-8 with the help of Republican House representative Donald Santarelli. The legislation was promoted within the context of fears over the civil rights movement, race riots, the Black Panther Party, and the emerging War on Drugs.

The first significant deployment of the LAPD SWAT was on December 9, 1969, when an attempt by the LAPD to serve arrest warrants against the Black Panthers led to a four-hour standoff at their Los Angeles headquarters at 41st and Central, during which over 5,000 rounds were exchanged between police and the Panthers. During the shootout, Daryl Gates called the Department of Defense, requesting and receiving permission to use a grenade launcher; however, it was never actually used. The Panthers eventually surrendered, with four Panthers and four officers being injured. All six arrested Panthers were acquitted of the most serious charges brought against them, including conspiracy to murder police officers, because it was ruled that they acted in self-defense.

By 1974, there was a general acceptance of SWAT as a police resource in Los Angeles.

==== 1974 Symbionese Liberation Army shootout ====
On the afternoon of May 17, 1974, elements of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a group of heavily armed left-wing guerrillas, barricaded themselves in a residence on East 54th Street at Compton Avenue in Los Angeles. Coverage of the siege was broadcast to millions via television and radio and featured in the world press for days afterwards. SWAT teams engaged in a several-hour gun battle with the SLA; no police were wounded, but the six SLA members died in the conflict, which ended when the house caught fire and burned to the ground.

By the time of the SLA shootout, SWAT teams had reorganized into six 10-man teams, each team being divided further into two five-man units, called elements. An element consisted of an element leader, two assaulters, a scout, and a rear-guard. The normal complement of weapons was a sniper rifle (a .243-caliber bolt-action, based on the ordnance expended by officers at the shootout), two .223-caliber semi-automatic rifles, and two shotguns. SWAT officers also carried their service revolvers in shoulder holsters. Standard gear included a first aid kit, gloves, and a military gas mask. At a time when officers were usually issued six-shot revolvers and shotguns, it was a significant change to have police armed with semi-automatic rifles. The encounter with the heavily armed Symbionese Liberation Army, however, sparked a trend towards SWAT teams being issued body armor and automatic weapons of various types.

A report issued by the LAPD after the SLA shootout offers one of the few firsthand accounts by the department regarding SWAT history, operations, and organization. On page 100 of the report, the Department cites four trends which prompted the development of SWAT. These included riots such as the Watts riots, which in the 1960s forced the LAPD and other police departments into tactical situations for which they were ill-prepared; the emergence of snipers as a challenge to civil order; political assassinations; and the threat of urban guerrilla warfare by militant groups. &quot;The unpredictability of the sniper and his anticipation of normal police response increase the chances of death or injury to officers. To commit conventionally trained officers to a confrontation with a guerrilla-trained militant group would likely result in a high number of casualties among the officers and the escape of the guerrillas.&quot; To deal with these under conditions of urban violence, the LAPD formed SWAT, notes the report. The report states on page 109, &quot;The purpose of SWAT is to provide protection, support, security, firepower, and rescue to police operations in high personal risk situations where specialized tactics are necessary to minimize casualties.&quot;

=== The War on Drugs: 1980s and 1990s ===

In 1981 U.S. Congress passed the Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Act, giving police access to military intelligence, infrastructure, and weaponry in the fight against drugs. Reagan subsequently declared drugs to be a threat to U.S. national security. In 1988 the Reagan administration encouraged Congress to create the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Program. The program modified existing federal aid structures to local police, making it easier to transfer money and equipment to fight the War on Drugs. Police forces also received increased assistance from the DEA. The money resulted in the creation of many narcotics task forces, and SWAT teams became an important part of these forces.

In 1972, paramilitary police units launched a few hundred drug raids annually within the United States. In the early 1980s, SWAT drug raid numbers increased to 3000 annually, and by 1996, 30,000 raids annually. During the 1990s, according to &quot;The Capital Times&quot; in Madison, Wisconsin, weapons donations from the Department of Defense greatly bolstered the number of SWAT teams and the extent of their operations. The paper reported that the military transferred nearly 100,000 pieces of military equipment to Wisconsin police departments in the 1990s.

Criminal justice professors Peter Kraska and Victor Kappeler, in their study &quot;Militarizing American Police: The Rise and Normalization of Paramilitary Units&quot;, surveyed police departments nationwide and found that their deployment of paramilitary units had grown tenfold between the early 1980s and late 1990s.

==== Columbine shooting ====

The Columbine High School massacre in Colorado on April 20, 1999 was another seminal event in SWAT tactics and police response. As perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were shooting students and staff inside the school, officers did not intervene in the shooting, but instead set a perimeter as they were trained to do. By the time they did enter the school, 12 people were killed and Harris and Klebold had committed suicide. They were also heavily criticized for not saving teacher Dave Sanders, who had died from blood loss, three hours after the SWAT first entered the school. As noted in an article in the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;Instead of being taught to wait for the SWAT team to arrive, street officers are receiving the training and weaponry to take immediate action during incidents that clearly involve suspects&#x27; use of deadly force.&quot; The article further reported that street officers were increasingly being armed with rifles, and issued heavy body armor and ballistic helmets, items traditionally associated with SWAT units. The idea was to train and equip street officers to make a rapid response to so-called active shooter situations. In these situations, it was no longer acceptable to simply set up a perimeter and wait for SWAT. As an example, in the policy and procedure manual of the Minneapolis Police Department, it is stated, &quot;MPD personnel shall remain cognizant of the fact that in many active shooter incidents, innocent lives are lost within the first few minutes of the incident. In some situations, this dictates the need to rapidly assess the situation and act quickly in order to save lives.&quot;

=== Post-9/11 and the War on Terror ===
According to criminal justice professor Cyndi Banks, the War on Terror, like the War on Drugs, became the context of a significant expansion of SWAT policing. Whereas some have attributed this expansion to &quot;mission creep&quot; and the militarization of police, other scholars argue that increased SWAT policing is a response to real or perceived moral panics associated with fear of crime and terrorism. Banks writes that SWAT team employment of military veterans has influenced their tactics and perspective.

Countering the view that post-9/11 SWAT policing represents the militarization of police forces, scholar den Heyer writes that SWAT policing is part of a natural progression towards police professionalization. Den Heyer also argues that while SWAT teams continue to be deployed to execute large numbers of drug warrants, this is a rational use of available police resources. Other defenders of SWAT deployments state that police have every reason to minimize risks to themselves during raids.

By 2005, the number of yearly SWAT deployments in the United States had increased to 50,000, most often to serve drug-related warrants in private homes. According to a study by the ACLU, just under 80% of SWAT deployments were used to serve arrest warrants.

Officers have cited safety as the main reason for use of SWAT teams, stating that SWAT units would frequently be called if there were a possibility a suspect might be armed. For instance, in 2006, only two police officers were killed in the arrest of 2 million drug suspects, a low casualty rate possibly stemming from the military equipment and tactics used in the raids.

On February 7, 2008, a siege and subsequent firefight with a shooter in the Winnetka neighborhood of Los Angeles led to the first line-of-duty death of a member of the LAPD&#x27;s SWAT team in its 41 years of existence.

Radley Balko, an analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, argued in his book &quot;Overkill: The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in America&quot; that increased SWAT raids have made no-knock raids, and danger to innocents and suspects, far greater. Another study, &quot;Warrior Cops: The Ominous Growth of Paramilitarism in American Police Departments&quot; by Diane Cecilia Weber, also of the Cato Institute, raised concern about the increasing use of SWAT teams for ordinary policing tasks.

== Organization ==
The relative infrequency of SWAT call-outs means these expensively trained and equipped officers cannot be left to sit around, waiting for an emergency. In many departments the officers are normally deployed to regular duties, but are available for SWAT calls via pagers, mobile phones, or radio transceivers. Even in larger police agencies, SWAT personnel will normally be seen in crime suppression roles—specialized and more dangerous than regular patrol, but the officers would not be carrying their distinctive armor and weapons.

Since officers have to be on call-out most of the day, they may be assigned to regular patrol duties. To decrease response times to situations that require a SWAT team, it is now a common practice to place SWAT equipment and weaponry in secured lockers in the trunks of specialized police cruisers instead of forcing officers to travel to gather their equipment or only use a single dedicated SWAT vehicle.

By illustration, the LAPD&#x27;s website shows that in 2003, their SWAT units were activated 255 times for 133 SWAT calls and 122 times to serve high-risk warrants. The NYPD&#x27;s Emergency Service Unit is one of the few police special-response units that operate autonomously 24 hours a day. However, this unit also provides a wide range of services in addition to SWAT functions, including search and rescue, and car accident vehicle extrication, normally handled by fire departments or other agencies.

The need to summon widely dispersed personnel, then equip and brief them, makes for a long lag between the initial emergency and actual SWAT deployment on the ground. The problems of delayed police response at Columbine led to changes in police response, mainly rapid deployment of line officers to deal with an active shooter, rather than setting up a perimeter and waiting for SWAT to arrive.

== SWAT equipment ==
SWAT teams use equipment designed for a variety of specialist situations including close-quarters combat (CQC) in an urban environment. The particular pieces of equipment vary from unit to unit, but there are some consistent trends in what they wear and use. Much of their equipment is indistinguishable from that supplied to the military, not least because much of it is military surplus.

=== Clothing ===

SWAT personnel wear similar uniforms to those worn by military personnel. Traditional SWAT uniforms are usually solid tones of dark blue, black, grey, tan, or olive green, though uniforms with military camouflage have become popular with some SWAT units since the 2000s.

Early SWAT units were equipped with a variety of headgear such as M1 helmets, motorcycle helmets, bump helmets, or even soft patrol caps. Modern SWAT units use helmets similar to those issued by the U.S. military, such as the PASGT helmet or Future Assault Shell Technology helmet, though they may also use riot helmets or soft headgear such as caps. Balaclavas and goggles are often used to protect the face and protect the identities of team members. Ballistic vests, sometimes including rigid plate inserts, are standard-issue. These vests are labelled with &quot;POLICE&quot;, &quot;SHERIFF&quot;, &quot;SWAT&quot;, or similar, to allow for easy identification.

=== Weapons and equipment ===
SWAT units are equipped with special weapons that are not normally used by regular police units, typically military firearms such as assault rifles, submachine guns, riot shotguns, sniper rifles, riot control agents, smoke grenades, stun grenades, and stinger grenades. Though these armaments make SWAT teams resemble military infantry squads, they are still law enforcement units tasked with arrest, and are thus often also equipped with less-lethal weapons such as tasers, pepper spray, pepperballs, baton rounds, bean bag rounds, and rubber bullets to incapacitate suspects. Many SWAT units also have access to specialized equipment such as ballistic shields, entry tools, battering rams, armored vehicles, thermal and night-vision devices, fiberscope cameras, and motion detectors.

Canine units may also be incorporated within SWAT teams, or may be used on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.

=== Vehicles ===
SWAT units often employ SWAT vehicles, also called &quot;armored rescue vehicles&quot; (ARV), for insertion, maneuvering, and during operations such as the rescue of personnel and civilians who may be in danger of receiving fire from suspects if extracted through other methods. Common armored SWAT vehicles include the Lenco BearCat, Lenco BEAR, BAE Caiman, Cadillac Gage Ranger, Cadillac Gage Commando, and similar vehicles. Some departments use decommissioned, disarmed military vehicles acquired from the Law Enforcement Support Office. Alternatively, SWAT teams may use unmarked police cars to respond faster, provide better mobility when splitting up, or avoid detection.

Police aircraft, commonly helicopters, are used to provide aerial reconnaissance or insertion via rappelling or fast-roping.

The use of armored vehicles by SWAT teams is controversial, and it has been alleged that police armored vehicles escalate situations that could otherwise be resolved peacefully. Some smaller police departments and sheriff&#x27;s departments also acquire armored vehicles despite few incidents occurring in their jurisdictions that would necessitate their use.

<text>A riot or mob violence is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people.

Riots typically involve destruction of property, public or private. The property targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.

Riots often occur in reaction to a grievance or out of dissent. Historically, riots have occurred due to poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions, governmental oppression, taxation or conscription, conflicts between ethnic groups (race riot) or religions (e.g., sectarian violence, pogrom), the outcome of a sporting event (e.g., sports riot, football hooliganism) or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances.

While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots typically consist of disorganized groups that are frequently &quot;chaotic and exhibit herd behavior.&quot; There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behavior (sometimes called mob mentality), but actually follow inverted social norms.

Dealing with riots is often a difficult task for police forces. They may use tear gas or CS gas to control rioters. Riot police may use less-than-lethal methods of control, such as shotguns that fire flexible baton rounds to injure or otherwise incapacitate rioters for easier arrest.

==Classification==
Food riots are caused by harvest failures, incompetent food storage, hoarding, poisoning of food, or attacks by pests like locusts. When the public becomes desperate from such conditions, groups may attack shops, farms, homes, or government buildings to obtain bread or other staple foods like grain or salt. T. S. Ashton, in his study of food riots among colliers, noted that &quot;the turbulence of the colliers is, of course, to be accounted for by something more elementary than politics: it was the instinctive reaction of virility to hunger.&quot; Charles Wilson noted, &quot;Spasmodic rises in food prices provoked keelmen on the Tyne to riot in 1709, tin miners to plunder granaries at Falmouth in 1727.&quot; In the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots, hundreds of thousands of people rioted after food subsidies stopped and prices rose.

A police riot is a term for the disproportionate and unlawful use of force by a group of police against a group of civilians. This term is commonly used to describe a police attack on civilians or provoking civilians into violence.

A political riot is a riot for political purposes or that develops out of a political protest.

A prison riot is a large-scale, temporary act of concerted defiance or disorder by a group of prisoners against prison administrators, prison officers, or other groups of prisoners. It is often done to express a grievance, force change or attempt escape.

In a race riot, race or ethnicity is the key factor. The term had entered the English language in the United States by the 1890s. Early use of the term referred to riots that were often a mob action by members of a majority racial group against people of other perceived races.
In a religious riot, the key factor is religion. Historically, these riots could involve groups arguing who possesses the primate of orthodoxy. The rioting mob targets people and properties of a specific religion, or those believed to belong to that religion.
Sports riots such as the Nika riots can be sparked by the losing or winning of a specific team or athlete. Fans of the two teams may also fight. Sports riots may happen as a result of teams contending for a championship, a long series of matches, or scores that are close. Sports are the most common cause of riots in the United States, accompanying more than half of all championship games or series. Almost all sports riots in the United States occur in the winning team&#x27;s city.

==Effects==

The economic and political effects of riots can be as complex as their origins. Property destruction and harm to individuals are often immediately measurable. During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, 2,383 people were injured, more than 12,000 were arrested, 63 people were killed and over 700 businesses burned. Property damage was estimated at over $1 billion. At least ten of those killed were shot by police or National Guard forces.

Similarly, the 2005 civil unrest in France lasted over three weeks and spread to nearly 300 towns. By the end of the incident, over 10,000 vehicles were destroyed and over 300 buildings burned. Over 2,800 suspected rioters were arrested and 126 police and firefighters were injured. Estimated damages were over €200 Million.

==Riot control and laws==

Riots are typically dealt with by the police, although methods differ from country to country. Tactics and weapons used can include attack dogs, water cannons, plastic bullets, rubber bullets, pepper spray, flexible baton rounds, and snatch squads. Many police forces have dedicated divisions to deal with public order situations. Some examples are the Territorial Support Group (London), Special Patrol Group (London), Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (France), Mobiele Eenheid (Netherlands), and Arrest units (Germany).

The policing of riots has been marred by incidents in which police have been accused of provoking rioting or crowd violence. While the weapons described above are officially designated as non-lethal, a number of people have died or been injured as a result of their use. For example, seventeen deaths were caused by rubber bullets in Northern Ireland over the thirty five years between 1970 and 2005.

===Risk of arrest===
A high risk of being arrested is even more effective against rioting than severe punishments. As more and more people join the riot, the risk of being arrested goes down, which persuades still more people to join.

===National laws===

====India====
In India, rioting is an offense under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

====Israel====
In 1988 the Israeli army issued rules of engagement for the use of plastic bullets which defined a &quot;violent riot&quot; as a disturbance with the participation of three or more persons, including stone throwing, erection of a barrier or barricade, burning a tire.

====United Kingdom====
=====England and Wales=====
Riot is a statutory offence in England and Wales. It is created by section 1(1) of the Public Order Act 1986. Sections 1(1) to (5) of that Act read:

A single person can be liable for an offence of riot when they &quot;use&quot; violence, provided that it is shown there were at least twelve present &quot;using or threatening&quot; unlawful violence. The word &quot;violence&quot; is defined by section 8. The violence can be against the person or against property. The &quot;mens rea&quot; is defined by section 6(1).

In the past, the Riot Act had to be read by an official – with the wording exactly correct – before violent policing action could take place. If the group did not disperse after the Act was read, lethal force could legally be used against the crowd. See also the Black Act.

======Mode of trial and sentence======
Riot is an indictable-only offence. A person convicted of riot is liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.

See the following cases:
* &quot;R v Luttman&quot;
* &quot;R v Pilgrim&quot;
* &quot;R v Keys&quot;
* &quot;R v Cooke&quot;

======Association football matches======
In the case of riot connected to football hooliganism, the offender may be banned from football grounds for a set or indeterminate period of time and may be required to surrender their passport to the police for a period of time in the event of a club or international match, or international tournament, connected with the offence. This prevents travelling to the match or tournament in question. (The measures were brought in by the Football (Disorder) Act 2000 after rioting of England fans at Euro 2000.)

======Compensation for riot damage======
See the Riot (Damages) Act 1886 and section 235 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.

======Construction of &quot;riot&quot; and cognate expressions in other instruments======
Section 10 of the Public Order Act 1986 now provides:

As to this provision, see pages 84 and 85 of the Law Commission&#x27;s report.

======History======
The common law offence of riot was abolished for England and Wales on 1 April 1987.

The Riot Act 1414 (2 Hen. 5. Stat. 1. c. 8) was an Act of the Parliament of England.

Section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1948 repealed:
*The words from the beginning to &quot;officers aforesaid in this behalf; And that&quot;
*The words &quot;and ransom&quot;
*The words from &quot;And that the bailiffs&quot; to &quot;the same franchises&quot;
*The words from &quot;and that this statute&quot; to the end of the chapter.

The whole chapter, so far as unrepealed, was repealed by section 10(2) of, and Part I of Schedule 3 to, the Criminal Law Act 1967.

The statute 2 Hen. 5. Stat. 1, of which this chapter was part, was repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 1 of, and Part 2 of the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1983.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Riot is a serious offence for the purposes of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.

See paragraph 13 of Schedule 5 to the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962.

=====Scotland=====
There is an offence under the law of Scotland which is known both as &quot;mobbing&quot; and &quot;mobbing and rioting&quot;.

In July 1981, both Dundee and Edinburgh saw significant disorder as part of the events of that July, while in 1994 and in 2013, two years after the English riots of August 2011, Edinburgh saw rioting, albeit localised to one specific area and not part of any bigger &#x27;riot wave&#x27;. Events in 1981 were very similar to those in England, although sources are severely limited. Both Niddrie and Craigmillar saw riots in the 1980s.

====United States====

Under United States federal law, a riot is defined as:
 A public disturbance involving (1) an act or acts of violence by one or more persons part of an assemblage of three or more persons, which act or acts shall constitute a clear and present danger of, or shall result in, damage or injury to the property of any other person or to the person of any other individual or (2) a threat or threats of the commission of an act or acts of violence by one or more persons part of an assemblage of three or more persons having, individually or collectively, the ability of immediate execution of such threat or threats, where the performance of the threatened act or acts of violence would constitute a clear and present danger of, or would result in, damage or injury to the property of any other person or to the person of any other individual..

Each state may have its own definition of a riot. In New York, the term &quot;riot&quot; is not defined explicitly, but under § 240.08 of the New York Penal Law, &quot;A person is guilty of inciting to riot when one urges ten or more persons to engage in tumultuous and violent conduct of a kind likely to create public alarm.&quot;

<text>Combatant is the legal status of a person entitled to directly participate in hostilities during an armed conflict, and may be intentionally targeted by an adverse party for their participation in the armed conflict. Combatants are not afforded immunity from being directly targeted in situations of armed conflict and can be attacked regardless of the specific circumstances simply due to their status, so as to deprive their side of their support.

In an interstate conflict, the definition of &quot;combatant&quot; is found in Article 43 (2) of Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions: &quot;Members of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict (other than medical personnel and chaplains covered by Article 33 of the Third [Geneva] Convention) are combatants, that is to say, they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.&quot; Combatants when captured by an opposing party are automatically granted the status of protected persons, whether as prisoners of war or unlawful combatants.

In a non-interstate armed conflict, combatants who fought with non-state armed groups are not afforded immunity for taking part in hostilities, as insurrection is a crime under the domestic law of most nations. Therefore, they can be prosecuted by the territorial state or intervening third state for simply taking up arms. 

==Distinction between combatants and protected civilians==
In an interstate conflict, the requirement of distinction between combatants and protected civilians lies at the root of the &quot;jus in bello&quot;. It is reflected in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I of 1977 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, entitled &quot;Basic rule&quot;: &quot;the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly direct their operations only against military objectives.&quot;

In a non-interstate conflict, no requirement of distinction exists under Additional Protocol II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, it did state under Article 13 of the protocol that civilians &quot;shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations&quot; until &quot;they take a direct part in hostilities.&quot;

==Status of combatants==
===Interstate armed conflict===
Under international humanitarian law applicable to interstate armed conflict, combatants may be classified in one of two categories: privileged or unprivileged. In that sense, privileged means the retainment of prisoner of war status and impunity for the conduct prior to capture. Thus, combatants that have violated certain terms of the IHL may lose their status and become unprivileged combatants either &quot;ipso jure&quot; (merely by having committed the act) or by decision of a competent court or tribunal. In the relevant treaties, the distinction between privileged and unprivileged is not made textually; international law uses the term combatant exclusively in the sense of what is here termed &quot;privileged combatant&quot;.

If there is any doubt as to whether the person benefits from &quot;combatant&quot; status, they must be held as a POW until they have faced a &quot;competent tribunal&quot; (Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention) to decide the issue.

====Privileged combatants====
The following categories of combatants qualify for prisoner-of-war status on capture:

# Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
# Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that they fulfill the following conditions:
#* that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
#* that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
#* that of carrying arms openly;
#* that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.
# Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.
# Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war; often dubbed a &quot;levée&quot; after the mass conscription during the French Revolution.

For countries which have signed the &quot;Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot; (Protocol I), combatants who do not wear a distinguishing mark still qualify as prisoners of war if they carry arms openly during military engagements, and while visible to the enemy when they are deploying to conduct an attack against them.

====Unprivileged combatants====
There are several types of combatants who do not qualify as privileged combatants:
*Combatants who would otherwise be privileged but have breached the &quot;laws and customs of war&quot; (e.g., committing perfidy or killing surrendered enemy combatants). The loss of privileges in that case only occurs upon conviction, i.e. after a competent court has determined the unlawfulness of the conduct in a fair trial.
*Combatants who are captured without the minimum requirements for distinguishing themselves from the civilian population, i.e. carrying arms openly during military engagements and the deployment immediately preceding it, lose their right to prisoner of war status without trial under Article 44 (3) of Additional Protocol I.
*Spies, i.e. persons who collect information clandestinely in the territory of the opposing belligerent. Members of the armed forces conducting reconnaissance or special forces behind enemy lines are not considered spies as long as they wear their own uniform. 
*Mercenaries, child soldiers, and civilians who take a direct part in combat and do not fall into one of the categories listed in the previous section.

Most unprivileged combatants who do not qualify for protection under the Third Geneva Convention do so under the Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV), which concerns protected civilians, until they have had a &quot;fair and regular trial&quot;. If found guilty at a regular trial, they can be punished under the civilian laws of the detaining power.

===Non-interstate armed conflict===
In a non-interstate armed conflict, combatants who fought with non-state armed groups are not afforded immunity for taking part in hostilities, as insurrection is a crime under the domestic law of most nations. Therefore, they can be prosecuted by the territorial state or intervening third state for simply taking up arms. On October 7, 2021, a former Taliban commander was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York for the June 26, 2008 attack on an American military convoy that killed three U.S. soldiers and their Afghan interpreter, and October 27, 2008 shooting down of a U.S. military helicopter during the War in Afghanistan (the conflict became non-interstate not long after the United States invasion of Afghanistan ended on December 7, 2001).

<text>Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People is a 1959 American fantasy adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions, adapted from the &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill&quot; stories of Herminie Templeton Kavanagh. Directed by Robert Stevenson and written by Lawrence Edward Watkin, the film stars Albert Sharpe as O&#x27;Gill alongside Janet Munro, Sean Connery, and Jimmy O&#x27;Dea. It was released on Walt Disney Home Video via video cassette in October 1981.

==Plot==
Darby O&#x27;Gill and his daughter, Katie, live in Rathcullen, a small Irish town, where Darby is the caretaker for Lord Fitzpatrick&#x27;s estate. Darby continually tries to catch a tribe of leprechauns, particularly their king, Brian Connors.

Lord Fitzpatrick retires Darby, replacing him with a young Dubliner named Michael McBride. Darby begs Michael not to tell Katie he has been replaced, and he reluctantly agrees. While chasing a &quot;púca&quot; disguised as Fitzpatrick&#x27;s horse Cleopatra, Darby is captured by the leprechauns and taken to their mountain lair, Knocknasheega. Brian has brought Darby there to live with him, as he has come to respect and care for Darby, even as an adversary. He must also prevent Katie from learning that he lost his job and that Darby cannot leave Knocknasheega.

Darby tricks the leprechauns into opening the mountain and leaving by playing &quot;The Fox Chase&quot; on Brian&#x27;s Stradivarius violin. Darby escapes, and expecting Brian to pursue him, later engages him in a drinking game with a jug of &quot;poitín&quot;, allowing him to capture the leprechaun at sunrise when his magic has no effect. Since Darby has caught him, Brian grants him three wishes. Brian tries to trick Darby into making additional wishes, but Darby recalls that wishing for a fourth forfeits them all from their previous encounter. Darby&#x27;s first wish is for Brian to stay by his side for two weeks or until Darby runs out of wishes. Darby tries to show Michael the King while he is trapped in a sack, but Michael sees only a rabbit; Darby accidentally wishes that Michael could see Brian, which the fairy king grants with the caveat, &quot;He does see me, he sees me as a rabbit.&quot;

Pony Sugrue, the town bully, decides to try to take Michael&#x27;s new job and Katie for himself. Pony&#x27;s mother, Sheelah, tells Katie about Darby&#x27;s retirement, causing Katie to confront Darby and Michael angrily. When Cleopatra got loose again, Katie chased her to Knocknasheega. Darby later finds Katie fallen at the bottom of a cliff and stricken with a deadly fever. A banshee appears and summons the Dullahan on a death coach to transport Katie&#x27;s soul. Brian sadly grants Darby&#x27;s third wish to take Katie&#x27;s place. Inside the death coach, Brian consoles Darby, then, to save him, tricks him into wishing he would have Brian&#x27;s company in the afterlife. This counts as a fourth wish, and Brian voids all his others. Darby is freed from the death coach and returns to Katie, who makes a full recovery. Michael later confronts and humiliates Pony at the pub. Michael and Katie fall in love with Darby&#x27;s approval.

==Cast==
==Production==
Walt Disney conceived the film during a trip to Ireland with the Irish Folklore Commission in 1947. The following year, Disney announced he would make a film titled &quot;Three Wishes&quot;, based on a script from Watkin about an Irishman battling a leprechaun, which was to involve both live action and animation, but the script was never produced. Disney took a second trip to Ireland in 1956 and announced a new film that October, &quot;The Three Wishes of Darby O&#x27;Gill&quot;, based on Kavanagh&#x27;s 1903 book &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Good People&quot;, retaining Watkin as writer. Disney studied Gaelic folklore for three months at the Dublin Library and received input from (traditional storytellers) while developing the film. During casting in London in February 1958, the film&#x27;s title became &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;.

Barry Fitzgerald was Disney&#x27;s first choice to play both Darby and Brian. Sharpe and O&#x27;Dea were instead cast in the lead roles after Disney spotted O&#x27;Dea in a pantomime. Munro was cast in March after Disney signed her for a five-year contract, while Connery was borrowed from 20th Century Fox, where he was then under contract. &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; was Connery&#x27;s first leading role. Filming started on the Disney backlot in May 1958, though some location work was done at Albertson Ranch in the San Fernando Valley.

Munro and Connery sing a duet in the film titled &quot;Pretty Irish Girl&quot;, apparently dubbing over vocals by Brendan O&#x27;Dowda and Ruby Murray, which was released in the UK as a single in 1959. A demonstration recording of Connery singing the song solo was included in the 1992 compilation &quot;The Music of Disney: A Legacy of Song&quot;.

Dell Comics produced a comic-book adaptation of the film in August 1959.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. H. Weiler praised the cast, but described Connery as &quot;merely tall, dark, and handsome&quot;, and called the film an &quot;overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;rollicking Gaelic fantasy&quot; with &quot;meticulously painstaking production&quot; and &quot;a gem&quot; of a performance from Sharpe, though Connery was called &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;the weakest link in Robert Stevenson&#x27;s otherwise distinguished direction&quot;. Charles Stinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Being a Disney product, it is as technically perfect a job as can be had; the Technicolor, the camera work, the special effects, the Irish music, and all are a rich feast for anyone&#x27;s eye and ear.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the special effects &quot;brilliantly executed&quot;, but found that &quot;all attempts at Irish charm seem pretty synthetic, a notable exception being the playing of Jimmy O&#x27;Dea, who makes King Brian the most likeable and beguiling leprechaun yet to appear on the screen.&quot;

Leonard Maltin praises the film in his book &quot;The Disney Films&quot;, calling it &quot;not only one of Disney&#x27;s best films, but [also it] is certainly one of the best fantasies ever put on film.&quot; In a later article, he included it among a list of outstanding lesser-known Disney films. &quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;one of Disney’s most enchanting live-action films of the 1950s, if not the most, and a great deal of that is due to the bewitching Munro.&quot;

The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews, with an average grade of 7 out of 10.

Munro won the 1960 Golden Globe for New Star of the Year for her performance in the film.

===Box office===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film performed &quot;better than average&quot; at the British box office in 1959.

<doc id="146712" wikidata="Q174662" url="?curid=146712" title="Mary McAleese">
<text>Mary Patricia McAleese ( ; ; ; born 27 June 1951) is an Irish activist lawyer, academic, author, and former politician who served as the eighth president of Ireland from November 1997 to November 2011. McAleese was first elected as president in 1997, having received the nomination of Fianna Fáil. She succeeded Mary Robinson, making her the second female president of Ireland and the first woman in the world to succeed another woman as president. She nominated herself for re-election in 2004 and was returned unopposed for a second term. Born in Ardoyne, north Belfast, she is the first president of Ireland to have come from either Northern Ireland or Ulster.

McAleese graduated in law from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. In 1975, she was appointed Professor of Criminal Law, Criminology and Penology at Trinity College Dublin, and in 1987 she returned to her alma mater, Queen&#x27;s, to become director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. In 1994, she became the first female pro-vice-chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University. She worked as a barrister and as a journalist with RTÉ. She is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge. She has also earned a doctorate in Catholic canon law.

McAleese used her time in office to address issues concerning justice, social equality, social inclusion, anti-sectarianism and reconciliation. She described her presidency&#x27;s theme as &quot;Building Bridges&quot;. This bridge-building materialised in her attempts to reach out to the unionist community in Northern Ireland. These steps included celebrating the Twelfth of July at Áras an Uachtaráin and taking Communion in a Church of Ireland cathedral in Dublin, for which she incurred some criticism from some of the Irish Catholic hierarchy. Though a Catholic, McAleese holds liberal views on homosexuality and women priests. She is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders and was ranked the 64th most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;. In spite of some minor controversies, McAleese remained popular, and her presidency is regarded as successful.

==Background and family life==
Born Mary Patricia Leneghan (), in Ardoyne, north Belfast to Paddy Leneghan from Croghan, County Roscommon and Claire McManus from County Antrim. She is a Catholic but grew up in a largely Protestant neighbourhood. Loyalists forced her family to leave the area when the Troubles broke out. She was educated at St Dominic&#x27;s High School, an all-girls Catholic grammar school in Belfast. She studied law at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, graduating in 1973 with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB Hons) degree. She was called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1974, and was later called to the Irish Bar.

In 1976, she married Martin McAleese, an accountant and dentist. He assisted his wife with some of her initiatives as president. They have three children: Emma, born in 1982, who graduated as an engineer from University College Dublin and graduated as a dentist from Trinity College Dublin; and twins born in 1985, Justin, an accountant with a master&#x27;s degree from University College Dublin, and SaraMai, who obtained a master&#x27;s degree in biochemistry at the University of Oxford. Ahead of the 2015 marriage equality referendum, Justin spoke publicly about growing up gay.

Every year she spends some time with the Poor Clares.

==Early career==
In 1975, having spent a year as a practising barrister in Belfast, she was appointed Reid Professor of Criminal Law, Criminology and Penology in Trinity College Dublin, succeeding Mary Robinson. Also in 1975, McAleese chaired a meeting at Liberty Hall that advocated a woman&#x27;s right to choose and was quoted as saying that &quot;I would see the failure to provide abortion as a human rights issue&quot;. She later claimed that she was given to understand that the nature of the meeting was to be a discussion among all sides and opinions.

During the same decade, she was a legal advisor to and a founding member of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform. She left this position in 1979, to join RTÉ as a journalist and presenter, during one period as a reporter and presenter for their &quot;Frontline&quot; replaced by &quot;Today Tonight&quot; in 1980 programme. However, in RTÉ, she and Alex White (then a TV producer and later a Labour Party TD) were attacked and criticised by a group led by Eoghan Harris, associated with the Workers&#x27; Party, over what they perceived as her bias towards republican groups in the North. McAleese was critical of the Provisional IRA, but believed it was important to hear their side of the story; she opposed the Harris faction&#x27;s support for Section 31, which she believed was an attack on free speech. In 1981, she returned to the Reid Professorship, but continued to work part-time for RTÉ for a further four years. In 1987, she returned to Queen&#x27;s University, to become Director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the Dublin South-East constituency at the 1987 general election, receiving 2,243 votes (5.9%).

McAleese has a long-standing involvement in ecumenism and anti-sectarianism. She co-chaired the working party on sectarianism set up by the Irish Inter-Church Meeting in 1991 and its report (1993) was described by Professor Marianne Elliot as &quot;the most notable&quot; work of the Inter-Church Meetings. McAleese was the author and presenter of a successful BBC Radio Ulster series called &quot;The Protestant Mind&quot; which encouraged the divided communities in Northern Ireland to try to stand in each other&#x27;s shoes. McAleese was a member of the Catholic Church Episcopal Delegation to the New Ireland Forum in 1984, and a member of the Catholic Church delegation to the Northern Ireland Commission on Contentious Parades in 1996. She was also a delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland and to the subsequent Pittsburgh Conference in 1996. She became the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Prior to becoming president in 1997, McAleese had also held the following positions: Channel 4 Television, Director, Northern Ireland Electricity, Director, Royal Group of Hospitals Trust and Founding member of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.

McAleese is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women Presidents and Prime Ministers, whose mission is to mobilise the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

==Presidency==
===First term (1997–2004)===
In 1997, McAleese defeated former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and former minister Michael O&#x27;Kennedy in an internal party election held to determine the Fianna Fáil nomination for the Irish presidency.

Her opponents in the 1997 presidential election were Mary Banotti, nominated by Fine Gael, Adi Roche nominated by the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party, and two candidates standing as Independents nominated by local authorities: Dana Rosemary Scallon and Derek Nally. McAleese won 45.2% of first preference votes. In the second and final count, McAleese was elected having obtained 55.6% of votes against Banotti. On 11 November 1997, she was inaugurated as the eighth President of Ireland. Within weeks of this, she made her first official overseas trip to Lebanon.

McAleese described the theme of her presidency as &quot;building bridges&quot;. The first individual born in Northern Ireland to become President of Ireland, President McAleese was a regular visitor to Northern Ireland throughout her presidency, where she was on the whole warmly welcomed by both communities, confounding critics who had believed she would be a divisive figure. People from Northern Ireland, indeed people from right across the nine-county Province of Ulster, were regular and recurring visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin while she was president. She is also an admirer of Queen Elizabeth II, whom she came to know when she was Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. In March 1998, President McAleese stated that she would officially celebrate the Twelfth of July as well as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, recognising the day&#x27;s importance among Ulster Protestants.

She also incurred some criticism from some of the Irish Catholic hierarchy by taking communion in a Church of Ireland (Anglican) Cathedral, in Dublin, on 7 December 1997, although 78 per cent of Irish people approved of her action in a following opinion poll. While Cardinal Desmond Connell called her action a &quot;sham&quot; and a &quot;deception&quot;, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said it was ironic that &quot;the Church was condemning an act of reconciliation and bridge-building between the denominations&quot;.

In 1998, she met Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston on an official visit to the United States. In an interview in 2012, she said that Law told her he was &quot;sorry for Catholic Ireland to have you as President&quot; and went on to insult a Minister of State, who was accompanying McAleese. &quot;His remarks were utterly inappropriate and unwelcome,&quot; she said. McAleese told the cardinal that she was the &quot;President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland&quot;. At this point, a heated argument ensued between the two, according to McAleese.

===Second term (2004–2011)===

McAleese&#x27;s first seven-year term of office ended in November 2004, but she stood for a second term in the 2004 presidential election. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation, and was declared elected on 1 October 2004. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second seven-year term on 11 November 2004. McAleese&#x27;s very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in an election that would prove difficult to win.

On 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp, she created friction by referring to the way some Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been raised to hate Catholics, just as European children &quot;for generations, for centuries&quot; were encouraged to hate Jews. These remarks provoked outrage among unionist politicians. McAleese later apologised, conceding that her comments had been unbalanced because she had criticised only the sectarianism found on one side of the community.

She was the Commencement Speaker at Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania, on 22 May 2005. The visit prompted protests by conservatives because of the president&#x27;s professing heterodox Catholic views on homosexuality and women in the priesthood. She was the commencement speaker at the University of Notre Dame on 21 May 2006. In her commencement address, among other topics, she spoke of her pride at Notre Dame&#x27;s Irish heritage, including the nickname the &quot;Fighting Irish&quot;.

She attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II on 8 April 2005, and the Papal Inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI on 24 April 2005.

McAleese attended the canonisation by Pope Benedict XVI in Rome of Charles of Mount Argus on 3 June 2007. She was accompanied by her husband, Martin, Cardinal Desmond Connell, Mary Hanafin, the Minister for Education and Science, together with bishops and other pilgrims. She later met the Pope and embarked on other official duties, including a trip to St. Isidore&#x27;s College, a talk at the Pontifical Irish College and a Mass said especially for the Irish Embassy at Villa Spada chapel.

In August 2007, she spoke out against homophobia at the International Association of Suicide Prevention&#x27;s 24th Biennial Conference.

She paid a seven-day visit to Hollywood in December 2008, alongside Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Film Board on a mission to promote the Irish film and television industry. A reception held in her honour was attended by Ed Begley, Jr. and Fionnula Flanagan. She later met the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In 2009, Forbes named her among the hundred most powerful women in the world later that year.

McAleese undertook an official two-day visit to London on 28–29 February 2010, where she visited the site of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and was guest of honour at the Madejski Stadium for a rugby union match between London Irish and Harlequin F.C. On 13 May 2010, she attended the Balmoral Show at the Balmoral Showgrounds, which includes the King&#x27;s Hall, in south Belfast. Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness and Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Michelle Gildernew gave her breakfast and walked around with her during the day.

She began an official visit to New York City for several days, on 16 May 2010. She began by appearing at an &quot;Irish Voice&quot; event in honour of life science. She then addressed business leaders at the New York Stock Exchange to say Irish people were &quot;as mad as hell&quot; over the Irish banking crisis, and opened the &quot;An Gorta Mór&quot; (Great Famine) exhibition with a speech promising that Ireland&#x27;s foreign policy focussed on global hunger. She was also present at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral for a Famine mass and went to the Battery Park City&#x27;s Irish Hunger Memorial to see the official New York commemoration of the 19th-century Irish Famine. On 22 May 2010, she delivered the keynote address at Fordham University&#x27;s 165th Commencement.

She opened the Bloom Festival, Ireland&#x27;s largest gardening show, on 3 June 2010, acknowledging an improved interest in gardening in Ireland, particularly among younger people. On 13 June 2010, McAleese began an official visit to China. She met with Vice President of China Xi Jinping and the pair spoke for 35 minutes over lunch.

She made an official visit to Russia, with Minister of State, Billy Kelleher, for four days in September 2010, and met with President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev. She spoke kindly of Mikhail Gorbachev, officially invited Medvedev to Ireland, and addressed students at a university in Saint Petersburg. She called for warmer relations between the European Union and Russia. On her state tour to Russia, highlighting the importance of competence, she launched an unprecedented attack on the Central Bank of Ireland, for their role in the financial crisis which resulted in tens of thousands of people in mortgage arrears.

The President turned down an invitation to be Grand Marshal at the 250th St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in New York City planned for 2011. The parade organisers refused to allow gay people to march under their banner, and there was media speculation that this was the reason for the refusal. A spokesperson for the President&#x27;s office stated that, while honoured by the invitation, she could not attend because of &quot;scheduling constraints&quot;.

In March 2011, President McAleese invited Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom to make a state visit to Ireland. The Queen accepted, and the visit took place from 17 to 20 May 2011, the first state visit by a British monarch since Ireland had gained independence. McAleese had been eager to have the Queen visit Ireland, and the event was widely welcomed as a historic success.

In past media interviews, prior to the Queen&#x27;s visit, President McAleese had stated on several occasions that the highlight of her presidency to date was the opening ceremony of the 2003 Special Olympics World Games, which she describes as &quot;a time when Ireland was at its superb best&quot;. While opening the National Ploughing Championships in County Kildare in September 2011, she spoke of her sadness that she would soon no longer be president, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m going to miss it terribly ... I&#x27;ll miss the people and the engagement with them&quot;.

Mary McAleese made her final overseas visit as head of state to Lebanon in October 2011, the location of her very first official overseas visit in 1997. While there she met with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman. Before her trip to Lebanon she visited Derry, on one of her last official engagements to Northern Ireland, becoming the inaugural speaker at the first Conversations Across Walls and Borders event in First Derry Presbyterian Church. She voluntarily donated more than 60 gifts given to her over the 14 years, and worth about €100,000, to the Irish state.

McAleese left office on 10 November 2011; she was succeeded by Michael D. Higgins, who had been elected in the presidential election held on 27 October 2011.

On 10 November 2011, her last day in office, she thanked Ireland for her two terms in an article in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. She performed her last official public engagement at a hostel for homeless men in Dublin in the morning and spent the afternoon moving out of Áras an Uachtaráin.

===Tipperary Peace Prize===
Mary McAleese along with her husband Martin were awarded the Tipperary Peace Prize in January 2012.

===Canon law studies===
In 2018, McAleese was awarded a doctorate in canon law (JCD) from Pontifical Gregorian University. She had previously said that she obtained a master&#x27;s degree and licentiate in canon law and her interest grew because of her concern about what has been happening in the Church – the sexual abuse scandal, among other things. When McAleese looked at the scandal, she said &quot;I was struck by what investigators said about canon law and canon lawyers. It was a scathing indictment: In not one single incidence of sexual abuse had canon law been able to do anything on the victim&#x27;s side, nothing useful or helpful.&quot;

===Appointments===
In 2012, McAleese was announced as the Chair of the European Commission High Level Group on the Modernisation of Higher Education in the European Union. Her work on the Commission earned her the Universitas21 2016 Gilbert Award.

In 2018 McAleese was awarded a doctorate in Canon Law at the Pontifical Gregorian University.

In October 2017, McAleese was appointed a Canon of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin and is a regular homilist at services there.

On 1 October 2018, McAleese was appointed Professor of Children, Law and Religion at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, a joint appointment between the university&#x27;s College of Arts and College of Social Sciences.

On 1 November 2019, McAleese was elected as Chancellor of Trinity College Dublin.

McAleese is an executive fellow of the Notre Dame School of Global Affairs and Chair of the Institute for Global Religions.

===Podcast host===
In 2024, McAleese joined forces with broadcaster Mary Kennedy to host the &quot;Changing Times - The Allenwood Conversations&quot; podcast. The podcast is produced by Enda Grace at Dundara Television and Media in Allenwood, County Kildare.

==Catholic Church==

===Canon Lawyer===
McAleese is an alumna of the Pontifical Gregorian University where she obtained her licentiate of canon law in 2014 and a doctorate of canon law in 2018. On 22 September 2018, McAleese publicly defended her thesis on &quot;Children&#x27;s Rights and Obligations in Canon Law&quot; at the Pontifical Gregorian University. The defence was conducted in Italian. McAleese was questioned by Professor Robert J Geisinger S.J. and Professor Ulrich Rhode S.J. The Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, the Rector of the Pontifical Irish College in Rome and the Irish Ambassadors to Italy and the Holy See attended the defence. McAleese also holds a Masters in Canon Law (2010) from the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy. McAleese delivered the Valedictorian Address at her graduation.

In 2012, McAleese published &quot;Quo Vadis? Collegiality in the Code of Canon Law&quot; (Columba Press). The book was launched in Rome at the Irish Franciscan College of St. Isidore&#x27;s and in Dublin at the Redemptorists Centre at Marianella by the Former Chief Justice of Ireland, Ronan Keane

In 2019, McAleese published &quot;Children&#x27;s Rights &amp; Obligations in Canon Law: The Christening Contracts&quot; (Brill Publishers).

===Inclusion of women in the formation of the Catholic Faith===
In March 2018, McAleese asked &quot;If you are going to exclude women in perpetuity from priesthood and if all decision-making, discernment and policy-making in the Church is going to continue to be filtered through the male priesthood, tell me how in justice and charity, but most importantly in equality, are you going to include the voices of women in the formation of the Catholic faith? What radical, innovative, strategic ideas do you have for their inclusion while being excluded from priesthood? And that&#x27;s the question they have not answered&quot;.

On the ordination of women, McAleese said &quot;I believe that women should be ordained, I believe the theology on which that is based is pure codology. I&#x27;m not even going to be bothered arguing it. Sooner or later it&#x27;ll fall apart, fall asunder under its own dead weight.&quot;

On International&#x27;s Women Day, McAleese described the Catholic Church as &quot;an empire of misogyny&quot;. She said &quot;This regrettable situation arises because the Catholic Church has long since been a primary global carrier of the toxic virus of misogyny...Its leadership has never sought a cure for that virus although the cure is freely available. Its name is equality.&quot;

In response to her speech, the Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said &quot;Her challenge to the internal culture of the Church today was brutally stark. Some may find it unpleasant or unwelcome. I must accept the challenge with the humility of one who recognises her alienation.&quot;

===2018 Women&#x27;s Day Conference===
McAleese was due to speak on a panel at a Voices of Faith conference in the Vatican on International Women&#x27;s Day in 2018 on Women in the Church. The conference had been held for the previous four years at the Vatican. Irish born Cardinal Kevin Farrell and Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life banned McAleese from speaking in the Vatican. The organisers had not been given any reason for the decision. In response, conference organisers invited McAleese to deliver the keynote speech at the conference and relocated it to a Jesuit conference centre just outside the Vatican.

McAleese initiated a canonical complaint against Kevin Farrell. The complaint was made to the Cardinal&#x27;s superior – Pope Francis. The Nuncio to Ireland Jude Thaddeus Okolo personally collected the complaint from McAleese&#x27;s home and delivered it to the Vatican. According to McAleese, she was advised that there was a process for handling such complaints. In November 2019 she said that she had received neither an acknowledgement nor a reply to her complaint.

=== Synod of Bishops on the Family ===
Speaking before the opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese ridiculed the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics on the eve of the Vatican&#x27;s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: &quot;In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican&#x27;s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child&#x27;s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.&quot; Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church&#x27;s pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as &quot;cynical&quot; about the outcome of the forthcoming three-week consultation.

=== US Grand Jury Report Pennsylvania ===
On 18 August 2018, McAleese speaking in the aftermath of the US Grand Jury Report on children abused by Catholic Priests in Pennsylvania said the cover up of this abuse &quot;is not only systemic, it was directed from central command and control which is the Vatican ... It strikes me as impossible to believe that all bishops acted equally negligently by coincidence, that&#x27;s the problem.&quot;

=== World Meeting of Families 2018 ===
McAleese said in relation to the World Meeting of Families (held in Dublin in 2018), &quot;It&#x27;s always been essentially a right-wing rally... and it was designed for that purpose, to rally people to get them motivated to fight against the tide of same-sex marriage, rights for gays, abortion rights, contraceptive rights&quot;.

=== Alfons Auer Ethics Award ===
On 23 August 2019, McAleese was announced as the winner of the Alfons Auer Ethics Award, from Tübingen University in Germany for her political dedication in building bridges across divisions in society, especially in the conflict in Northern Ireland, her commitment to reforming the Catholic Church after the sexual abuse scandals, her theological and ethical advocacy for the rights of children, for the complete equality of women in church ministries and for the acceptance of diversity.

=== UN Convention on Rights of the Child ===
On 5 November 2019, McAleese delivered the annual Edmund Burke lecture at Trinity College Dublin. McAleese&#x27;s lecture was entitled &quot;The Future of Ireland: Human Rights and Children&#x27;s Rights&quot;. In her address McAleese called for &quot;a clear acknowledgement from the Catholic Church that the canon laws which constrict children&#x27;s rights have now been overtaken by the (UN) Convention and our Constitution&quot;

===Threat to leave Church ===

McAleese has written to Pope Francis threatening to quit the Catholic Church if it comes to light the Vatican &quot;failed to act to protect members of the L&#x27;Arche community&quot; from the organization&#x27;s founder Jean Vanier. He founded L&#x27;Arche in 1964 to work with intellectually disabled people. On 22 February 2020, L&#x27;Arche announced that it had received credible complaints that Vanier had sexually abused at least six women.

==China==
McAleese strongly promoted closer ties between Ireland and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, meeting frequently with officials from that country&#x27;s ruling Chinese Communist Party, including Xi Jinping and former President Hu Jintao. As President of Trinity College, McAleese refused to allow the board to bestow an honorary degree upon the Dalai Lama, noting the Chinese student presence at the university and stating that &quot;honouring the Tibetan monk would undoubtedly cause &quot;serious&quot; problems and consequences with the Chinese ambassador, and added that the Chinese would interpret the award as looking for trouble, as China regarded him as a religious-political leader.&quot;. According to the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, Chinese universities &quot;provided the fourth highest amount of non-EU collaborations with Trinity over the previous 10 years, with 581 co-publications.&quot;

==LGBT advocacy==

===Background===

In 1975, McAleese and David Norris founded the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform. McAleese was its legal advisor from 1975 until 1979 when she joined RTÉ as a current affairs journalist.

In a 2008 biography, McAleese explained that she first became aware of the plight of gay people as a student in San Francisco in the early 1970s. She was 21 and studying law at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Her job involved preparing food for airlines; a supervisor, &quot;a charming, lovely man&quot;, told her he was gay. They had become friends. He was wounded by being rejected by his family. She recalled, &quot;at school or university I was never aware of ever meeting a gay person, such were the taboos at the time. As a heterosexual, I had wondered what it must be like for those who are outside the mainstream, the self-discovery, when you can reveal it to no one.&quot; That man was her introduction to the reality. &quot;When I came back to Ireland I made it my business to do something about it,&quot; she said.

===During Presidency===

In 2008, McAleese addressed a gay youth forum in Galway and encouraged people to confront those who make anti-gay remarks. McAleese said that being gay was &quot;not a choice but a discovery&quot;.

In 2010, McAleese addressed the LGBT Diversity National Conference in Dublin. She said &quot;The toxic attitudes which were heard in homes, streets, workplaces even in schools and churches caused untold suffering and nothing is surer than the fact that those attitudes can have and will have no place in the Ireland we are building, for they belong in the same toxic waste dump along with sexism, racism, sectarianism and all those other contrary forces which would diminish the innate dignity, freedom and nature of the human person, reduce their life chances and opportunities and consign them to half-lived lives.

In 2011, McAleese declined an invitation to be the New York City St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade Grand Marshall. LGBT people were banned from marching in the parade under LGBT banners.

===Male suicide===

In a radio interview discussing her book &quot;Quo Vadis? Collegiality in the Code of Canon Law&quot; on 28 September 2012, said she was concerned at the growing number of young men, and in particular young gay men, who take their own lives in Ireland. She said that when the research is broken down, it shows that young gay men are one of the most risk-prone groups in Ireland. McAleese said many of these young men will have gone to Catholic schools and they will have heard there their church&#x27;s attitude to homosexuality. &quot;They will have heard words like &#x27;disorder&#x27;, they may even have heard the word &#x27;evil&#x27; used in relation to homosexual practice,&quot; she said. She went on to say &quot;And when they make the discovery, and it is a discovery and not a decision, when they make the discovery, that they are gay, when they are 14, 15 or 16, an internal conflict of absolutely appalling proportions opens up&quot;. She said many young gay men are driven into a place that is &quot;dark and bleak&quot;. McAleese said she met the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Charles John Brown, shortly after Easter to raise with him her concern about the growing number of suicides among young men in Ireland.

===Marriage equality referendum===

In May 2015, in advance of the marriage equality referendum, McAleese described same-sex marriage as a &quot;human rights issue&quot; as she and her husband Martin called for a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum. In her first public comments on the issue, McAleese said the vote next month is &quot;about Ireland&#x27;s children, gay children&quot; and said passing the referendum would help dismantle the &quot;architecture of homophobia&quot;. She also highlighted the problems in Ireland of suicide among young males. &quot;We now know from the evidence that one of the risk groups within that age cohort of 15–25 is the young male homosexual. We owe those children a huge debt as adults who have opportunities to make choices that impact their lives, to make the right choices, choices that will allow their lives to grow organically and give them the joy of being full citizens in their own country.&quot;

===Dublin Pride===

In June 2018, McAleese attended Dublin Pride for the first time along with her husband, son Justin and his husband Fionán Donohoe. This theme was &#x27;We Are Family&#x27;, and was a reference to Pope Francis&#x27; 2018 visit to Ireland for the Catholic World Meeting of Families. Speaking at the parade she said: &quot;Homophobia is evil. It ruins people&#x27;s lives, it has ruined families&#x27; lives, it has caused people to commit suicide, it has caused people to live in dark shadows, so unsure of themselves,&quot; she said.

===LGBT recognition===

In 2011, McAleese received the GALA Political Figure Award. In 2016, McAleese received the &quot;Ally of the year&quot; award from GALA&#x27;s.

In 2016, McAleese received The Northern Ireland Tolerantia Award for &quot;her commitment to equal treatment and the dignity of LGB&amp;T people for over four decades&quot;.

In August 2018 McAleese was awarded the Vanguard Award at the GAZE LGBT Festival in Dublin.

==Brexit==
In June 2016, McAleese urged the British to vote to remain in the EU. McAleese warned that Britain&#x27;s departure could result in the return of border controls on the island of Ireland and cause a &quot;potential drift&quot; in the peace process. McAleese said the &quot;chances of customs controls being reconstituted are probably greater as they had been eliminated by EU laws, not Anglo-Irish efforts&quot;. McAleese challenged claims by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who frequently repeated claims that the position on the island of Ireland would not change. McAleese said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that to be (true) and they do not know that&quot;.

In 2017, McAleese described Brexit as like &quot;pulling a tooth with 10,000 roots&quot;. She said that Northern Ireland will be the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit and she feared that checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would be an inevitable consequence of the UK leaving EU. McAleese said &quot;the lawyer in me says our migration controls are very different, and they are going to be if Britain is no longer part of the EU, and if they tighten the migration controls it won&#x27;t be enough that I&#x27;m entitled to use the Common Travel Area...how are they going to differentiate between me, the person who is entitled to plead the Common Travel Areas, and the person say from France or Germany or Poland who&#x27;s going to cross the road at Newry, or Derry? My view is that sooner or later the pressure will come to make it an ID card phenomenon...I don&#x27;t see, in the long run, how we&#x27;d get around that&quot;.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar responded to McAleese&#x27;s concerns saying &quot;I understand her concerns but it is one area that I am very sure about that&#x27;s that there won&#x27;t be a requirement to produce a passport to travel to Northern Ireland&quot;.

On 29 March 2019, McAleese addressed the Brexit Institute at DCU. She said &quot;The process of Brexit has been like watching a political form of necrotising fasciitis as it has devoured time, effort, goodwill, patience, reputations, relationships, engendering huge volumes of work, of anxiety and again, no obvious end in sight. We know that it has rendered the word &#x27;meaningful&#x27; completely meaningless.&quot; She said &quot;I am heart sorry to see the UK go, to leave the EU, things will not be the same. The future experience will not be the one we envisaged. I harboured a hope that somehow, the United Kingdom would step back from the brink and recommit to the ideal of the European Union, in my view the greatest and the noblest political undertaking ever envisaged and realised in human history. That&#x27;s a description that is unlikely to ever be attached to Brexit.&quot;

<text>Maximilian Adolph Otto Siegfried Schmeling (, ; 28 September 1905 – 2 February 2005) was a German boxer who was heavyweight champion of the world between 1930 and 1932. His two fights with Joe Louis in 1936 and 1938 were worldwide cultural events because of their national associations. Schmeling is the only boxer to win the world heavyweight championship on a foul.

Starting his professional career in 1924, Schmeling went to the United States in 1928 and, after a ninth-round technical knockout of Johnny Risko, became a sensation. He became the first to win the heavyweight championship (at that time vacant) by disqualification in 1930, after opponent Jack Sharkey knocked him down with a low blow in the fourth round. Schmeling retained his crown successfully in 1931 by a technical knockout victory over Young Stribling. A rematch in 1932 with Sharkey saw the American gaining the title from Schmeling by a controversial fifteen-round split decision. In 1933, Schmeling lost to Max Baer by a tenth-round technical knockout. The loss left people believing that Schmeling was past his prime. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party took over control in Germany, but Schmeling never joined the Party. The same year, he married Czech film actress Anny Ondra.

In 1936, in their first fight, Schmeling knocked out American rising star Joe Louis, placing him as the number one contender for Jim Braddock&#x27;s title, but Louis got the fight and knocked Braddock out to win the championship in 1937. Schmeling finally got a chance to regain his title in 1938 in the rematch, but Louis won by technical knockout in the first round. During World War II, Schmeling served with the German Air Force (&#x27;) as a paratrooper (&#x27;). After the war, Schmeling mounted a comeback, but retired permanently in 1948. After retiring from boxing, Schmeling worked for The Coca-Cola Company. Schmeling became friends with Louis, and their friendship lasted until the latter&#x27;s death in 1981. Schmeling died in 2005 aged 99, a sporting hero in his native Germany. Long after the Second World War, it was revealed that Schmeling had risked his life to save the lives of two Jewish children in 1938. At the age of 99, Schmeling was the longest living heavyweight boxing champion in history.

In 2003, Schmeling was ranked 55 on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Max Schmeling Jr. was born in Klein Luckow, in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, the son of Max Sr. and Amanda (&quot;née&quot; Fuchs) Schmeling. He had an older brother, Rudolf, born in 1902 and a younger sister, Edith, born in 1913. He first became acquainted with boxing as a teenager, when his father took him to watch film of the heavyweight championship match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. Impressed with Dempsey&#x27;s performance in that fight, young Schmeling became determined to imitate his new hero. He began boxing in amateur competitions and, by 1924, won Germany&#x27;s national amateur title in the light heavyweight division. Shortly thereafter, he turned professional. Ironically, though he idolised the raging, brawling Dempsey, Schmeling developed a careful, scientific style of fighting that lent itself more to counterpunching. Using this style, he won seventeen of his first twenty-three bouts, thirteen by knockout. In 1925, he got into the ring with Dempsey, who was then still heavyweight champion of the world and was touring Europe. Dempsey boxed for two rounds with the then-unknown German and, according to a story later told by Schmeling, was greatly impressed. He proved Dempsey&#x27;s praises correct on 24 August 1926, when picking up the German light heavyweight championship with a first-round knockout of rival Max Diekmann, who had previously beaten Schmeling. The next year, Schmeling won the European championship by stopping Fernand Delarge in the first boxing match broadcast live in Germany. After defending both titles against Hein Domgoergen the same year and, in 1928, the European Title with a first-round knockout of Michele Bonaglia, he secured the German heavyweight championship with a points victory against Franz Diener and decided to chase bigger fights and bigger purses in the United States.

Arriving in New York City for the first time in 1928, Schmeling was hardly noticed by the American fight circles. Considered a stiff European fighter who had padded his record against German and European unknowns, he was given few opportunities to prove himself until he hooked up with American manager Joe Jacobs. Schmeling&#x27;s debut in America took place at Madison Square Garden with an eighth-round knockout of Joe Monte, who was not a top-flight heavyweight but nonetheless had been in with some tough competition. Two more victories led to a fight with Johnny Risko, one of the biggest names in the division, though somewhat beyond his prime. On 1 February 1929, Schmeling floored Risko four times with his right hand before the referee halted the contest in the ninth round, handing Risko his only loss by TKO. The surprised crowd in attendance roared with appreciation and &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine subsequently recognized the win as its &#x27;Fight of the Year.&#x27;

===The &quot;Low Blow Champion&quot;===

When he defeated the highly regarded Spaniard Paulino Uzcudun with a fifteen-round decision at Yankee Stadium later that year, Schmeling was regarded as the foremost young contender in the division. With the World Heavyweight Champion Gene Tunney having recently retired, promoters arranged a matchup between the German and veteran contender Jack Sharkey to fill the vacancy. On 12 June 1930, at Yankee Stadium, in a fight billed as the &#x27;Battle of the Continents,&#x27; Schmeling, known as a slow starter, fell slightly behind on points going into the fourth round. He was trying to corner his opponent when Sharkey let loose with a very fast, clear hit to the groin. Schmeling fell to the canvas, claiming to have been fouled. When manager Jacobs ran into the ring, prompting chaos, the referee disqualified Sharkey and declared Schmeling the victor and the first man to win the world heavyweight championship on a foul. The New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), reviewing the call, agreed.

The first European-born boxer to win the heavyweight championship in thirty-three years, Schmeling was also the first from Germany to hold the distinction. Still, the way in which he won the title proved an embarrassment. Called the &#x27;low blow champion,&#x27; he was disparaged in both America and Europe as an unproven titleholder. When he initially refused to face Sharkey in a rematch, the NYSAC officially stripped him of their recognition as world champion, but he remained recognised by both the National Boxing Association (NBA) and &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. Most of the criticism faded after Schmeling&#x27;s first defence, a fifteen-round TKO over Young Stribling, a future hall-of-famer with 239 wins to his credit by 1931. In order to solidify his title as undisputed, Schmeling signed a contract to face the &quot;Boston Gob&quot; once more. On 21 June 1932, the championship picture became even more muddled when Sharkey won a highly controversial split decision, taking the championship. Many in attendance, including former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and the mayor of New York, felt that Schmeling had proven himself the better man and was robbed. In losing the championship, the German had elevated his reputation in the minds of boxing fans.

===Walker and Baer===
When Schmeling faced Mickey Walker, the future hall-of-famer who had recently held Sharkey to a draw that many felt Walker deserved, it was thought that this fight was for the real heavyweight championship. Walker, a former welterweight, was a popular slugger who had won championships in two divisions but was at a considerable size disadvantage against the European. Though Walker took the lead on points, Schmeling dealt out a beating as the fight progressed. After eight rounds, Walker&#x27;s corner threw in the towel, confirming Schmeling&#x27;s status as the leading heavyweight in the world.
With the coming of 1933, however, Schmeling&#x27;s image in America began to take a decided turn. In 1932, the Nazi Party became the most powerful political force in Germany, and its ideologies, voiced by party leader Adolf Hitler, overflowed with anti-Semitic tendencies. Major American cities such as New York had large Jewish populations, who worried over what the party could mean for people of their religion in the future. Schmeling, because he was German, was viewed as an extension of Hitler&#x27;s plans for world domination. When he was slated to fight heavy-hitting contender Max Baer on 8 June 1933, he immediately became the &#x27;bad guy&#x27; in the eyes of fans. Baer, who did not practice the Jewish religion but had a Jewish father, came into the ring wearing the Star of David on his shorts. Promoter Jack Dempsey played up this angle and suddenly the fight was viewed as Baer defending his faith against the prejudice of the Nazis, represented reluctantly by Schmeling. Thrown off of his game in part by the bad publicity but also because of Baer&#x27;s wild, brawling style and frequent fouls (including backhand punches and rabbit punches), Schmeling was thrashed after ten rounds before nearly 60,000 onlookers at Yankee Stadium. When the German took a battering against the ropes in the tenth, the referee leapt in to stop the fight. The fight, combined with a follow-up loss to contender Steve Hamas early the next year, left many wondering if Schmeling was still a world top-class fighter.

===Versus Joe Louis===
Returning to his native Germany, Schmeling won three of his next four fights, with one draw, including knockout wins over first Walter Neusel, then another avenging his previous loss to Steve Hamas. However, many among the American press and fans remained unmoved on the idea of rooting for Schmeling in light of the Nazi Party&#x27;s behavior. Articles continued to be published declaring the German &quot;washed up&quot;, a &quot;has been&quot;, or a &quot;Nazi puppet&quot;. When he was matched with undefeated boxing sensation Joe Louis in 1936 for the German&#x27;s first fight on American soil in more than two years, he was clearly the betting underdog, considered a name opponent for Louis to roll over on his route to the title. Nevertheless, he was the number two contender for the title behind Louis. Prior to the match, Schmeling carefully studied films of Louis&#x27;s prior fights, dissecting apparent flaws in the Detroit fighter&#x27;s technique. Among the weaknesses he noticed was the fact that Louis lowered his left hand after throwing a left jab. In the ring, Schmeling exploited this subtle flaw to his own advantage, countering nearly every Louis jab with his best punch, the right cross. The fight proved to be a competitive, hard-hitting affair for the first three rounds, but, in the fourth, a counter right from the German dropped Louis for the first time in his career. Though Louis rose, he was badly dazed for the remainder of the fight. For a further eight rounds, Schmeling battered Louis, often standing toe-to-toe with the vaunted puncher and landing that same right hand to the jaw repeatedly. In the twelfth, he sent the American tumbling to the floor once more, and this time Louis could not recover. He was counted out on the floor, and Schmeling had scored the most talked-about sports upset of the year.

Now the unexpected number one contender for the heavyweight crown held by Jim Braddock, Schmeling looked forward to his chance to become the first fighter to regain the world heavyweight title by winning the fight with Braddock that had been scheduled for that September. The fight was postponed, however, when Braddock injured his hand in training. Rumors existed that the fight&#x27;s organizers were stalling, afraid of the negative publicity that would be generated over a perceived Nazi getting a shot at the world&#x27;s title. When it was confirmed that Braddock&#x27;s managers were in talks with the Louis camp, the New York Commission officially released an order for Braddock to fight Schmeling for the title. Any other fight, with Louis or otherwise, would not be recognized by New York as being for the championship. The Madison Square Garden Corporation, the largest promotional company in the sport at the time, even attempted to get a legal injunction against a Braddock–Louis fight (Louis was not on their roster). Nonetheless, in February 1937, Schmeling received the news that the champion had indeed signed to defend his championship against Louis. A furious Schmeling protested, but to no avail, and he was forced to watch from ringside as Louis knocked Braddock out and gained the championship. Sorely disappointed and convinced that he would never receive his chance at redemption, Schmeling fought just once more in America, an eighth-round knockout of future contender Harry Thomas, before returning to Germany. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as a perfect example of German supremacy over the rest of the world by virtue of his defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. He continued to press for a chance at a rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas.

===&quot;Battle of the Century&quot;===
In 1938, champion Joe Louis announced that he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, lower-class roots, was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling&#x27;s knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.

Many years later, in 1975, Schmeling said, &quot;Looking back, I&#x27;m almost happy I lost that fight. Just imagine if I would have come back to Germany with a victory. I had nothing to do with the Nazis, but they would have given me a medal. After the war I might have been considered a war criminal.&quot;

===Schmeling in his later years===

When he returned to Germany after his defeat by Joe Louis, Schmeling was now shunned by the Nazis. He won both the German and European heavyweight championships on the same night, with a first-round knockout of Adolf Heuser. During the Nazi purge of Jews from Berlin, he personally saved the lives of two Jewish children by hiding them in his apartment. It was not the first time that Schmeling defied the Nazi regime&#x27;s hatred for Jews. As the story goes, Hitler let it be known through the Reich Ministry of Sports that he was very displeased at Schmeling&#x27;s relationship with Joe Jacobs, his Jewish fight promoter, and wanted it terminated, but Schmeling refused to bow even to Hitler. During the war, Schmeling was drafted, where he served with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and was trained as a paratrooper. He participated in the Battle of Crete in May 1941, where he was wounded in his right knee by mortar fire shrapnel during the first day of the battle. After recovering, he was dismissed from active service after being deemed medically unfit for duty because of his injury. Nevertheless, in July 1944 a rumor that he had been killed in action made world news. He later visited American POW camps in Germany and occasionally tried to help conditions for the prisoners. By early 1945, he was spending his time giving exhibition bouts against former British Free Corps member Eric Pleasants in German officers&#x27; messes.

After the war, Schmeling settled in Hamburg where in 1947, strapped for money, he embarked upon a moderately successful comeback in boxing, winning three of his five bouts with two point-defeats before re-entering retirement for good in October 1948.

Schmeling became a successful mink, chicken, and tobacco farmer in the early 1950s. Towards the end of the decade, after multiple meetings with The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s offices in Germany, Schmeling became the face of &#x27;Cocacolonization&#x27; and Coca-Cola&#x27;s reentry into Germany. Before long, he owned his own bottling plant and held an executive&#x27;s position within the company. Schmeling helped bring vending machines into use in Germany.

He became friends with Joe Louis and he assisted his former rival financially in his later years, eventually financing his funeral in 1981.

His wife of 54 years, the Czech-born actress Anny Ondra, died in 1987. In 1992, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. His autobiography, &quot;Max Schmeling: An Autobiography&quot;, was published in 1994. He lived his remaining years as a wealthy man and avid boxing fan, dying on 2 February 2005, at the age of 99.

In 2010, a bronze statue of Schmeling was erected in Hollenstedt.

==Cultural references==
Schmeling lived in Stettin, Germany (now known as Szczecin, Poland); a band from this city, The Analogs, recorded the song &quot;Max Schmeling&quot; on their album &quot;Hlaskover rock&quot; (2000).

Schmeling was referenced in the British Second World War song &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot;.

In a season 9 or 10 episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot;, Schmeling&#x27;s name is mentioned when the detectives are looking for a certain gun. The man who is supposed to own it is a fighter from the 1930s who went the distance with Schmeling in 1937.

Schmeling briefly appears as himself in the film &quot;The Zurich Engagement&quot; (1957)

The American-German film &quot;Joe and Max&quot; (2002) tells the true story of Joe Louis and Max Schmeling and their enduring friendship.

In the book &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;, Joe Kavalier is beaten up by someone who may or may not have been Max Schmeling. The author hints that it probably wasn&#x27;t, as Schmeling should have been fighting in Poland at the time.

In 2005, Österreichische Post issued a stamp commemorating Max Schmeling, based on the 1926 painting by German artist George Grosz.

In &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, the climactic fight between American Rocky Balboa and Russian Ivan Drago was inspired by the bout between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, updated to reflect Cold War relationships.

Schmeling also appears as a character in the opera, &quot;Shadowboxer&quot;, based on the life of Joe Louis.

Schmeling figures prominently in the 2010 novel by P.F. Kluge &quot;A Call From Jersey&quot;.
In a novel by Curzio Malaparte, &quot;Kaputt&quot; (1944), Schmeling figures prominently in the chapter &quot;Cricket in Poland&quot; depicting a gathering in February 1942 hosted by Governor-General Dr. Hans Frank in the Belvedere palace in Warsaw.

Schmeling&#x27;s role as a paratrooper in World War II is mentioned in the Günter Grass novel &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1959).

For the film &quot;Max Schmeling – Eine deutsche Legende&quot; (2010) another former boxing champion, who moreover had known him, played Max Schmeling: Henry Maske.

The &quot;Voyagers!&quot; episode &quot;All Fall Down&quot; depicts his second fight with Joe Louis. The series&#x27; time travelling protagonists Phineas Bogg and Jeffrey Jones convinced Louis not to back out of the fight and witnessed his victory over Schmeling in Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938.

Schmeling is mentioned in the song Ambling Alp by indie-band Yeasayer, &quot;Oh Max Schmeling was a formidable foe, Ambling Alp was too at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told&quot;

Schmeling is also referenced in the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 4&quot; by the German character Richtofen when he is hit by a zombie in the &quot;Alpha Omega&quot; DLC Zombies mode map (&quot;OW! What are you, the undead Max Schmeling?!&quot;).

In Season 6, Episode 7 of Better Call Saul, Schmeling is compared to the character of Howard Hamlin when the title character opens the front door saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll get it. Just in case Max Schmeling comes in swinging.&quot;

In Season 5, Episode 13 of Mad Men, a character is sarcastically referred to as Max Schmeling after he gets in a fight on a commuter train with main character Pete Campbell.

<text>Social work is an academic discipline and practice-based profession concerned with meeting the basic needs of individuals, families, groups, communities, and society as a whole to enhance their individual and collective well-being. Social work practice draws from liberal arts, social science, and interdisciplinary areas such as psychology, sociology, health, political science, community development, law, and economics to engage with systems and policies, conduct assessments, develop interventions, and enhance social functioning and responsibility. The ultimate goals of social work include the improvement of people&#x27;s lives, alleviation of biopsychosocial concerns, empowerment of individuals and communities, and the achievement of social justice.

Social work practice is often divided into three levels. Micro-work involves working directly with individuals and families, such as providing individual counseling/therapy or assisting a family in accessing services. Mezzo-work involves working with groups and communities, such as conducting group therapy or providing services for community agencies. Macro-work involves fostering change on a larger scale through advocacy, social policy, research development, non-profit and public service administration, or working with government agencies. Starting in the 1960s, a few universities began social work management programmes, to prepare students for the management of social and human service organizations, in addition to classical social work education.

The social work profession developed in the 19th century, with some of its roots in voluntary philanthropy and in grassroots organizing. However, responses to social needs had existed long before then, primarily from public almshouses, private charities and religious organizations. The effects of the Industrial Revolution and of the Great Depression of the 1930s placed pressure on social work to become a more defined discipline as social workers responded to the child welfare concerns related to widespread poverty and reliance on child labor in industrial settings.

== Definition ==
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions:

Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work. Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities, and indigenous knowledge, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being.
:—International Federation of Social Workers

Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence.
:— Canadian Association of Social Workers

Social work practice consists of the professional application of social principles, and techniques to one or more of the following ends: helping people obtain tangible services; counseling and psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services, and participating in legislative processes. The practice of social work requires knowledge of human development and behavior; of social and economic, and cultural institutions; and the interaction of all these factors.
:—[US] National Association of Social Workers

Social workers work with individuals and families to help improve outcomes in their lives. This may be helping to protect vulnerable people from harm or abuse or supporting people to live independently. Social workers support people, act as advocates and direct people to the services they may require. Social workers often work in multi-disciplinary teams alongside health and education professionals.
:—British Association of Social Workers

==History==
The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin, and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the Charity Organization Society in the mid-19th century, which was founded by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill in London, England. Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation. COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – &#x27;relief of paupers&#x27;. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the Settlement House Movement.

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundation basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.

Professional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution, in particular, the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based poverty and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work.

Other important historical figures that shaped the growth of the social work profession are Jane Addams, who founded the Hull House in Chicago and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931; Mary Ellen Richmond, who wrote &quot;Social Diagnosis&quot;, one of the first social workbooks to incorporate law, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, and history; and William Beveridge, who created the social welfare state, framing the debate on social work within the context of social welfare provision.

===United States===
During the 1840s, Dorothea Lynde Dix, a retired Boston teacher who is considered the founder of the Mental Health Movement, began a crusade that would change the way people with mental disorders were viewed and treated. Dix was not a social worker; the profession was not established until after she died in 1887. However, her life and work were embraced by early psychiatric social workers (mental health social worker/clinical social worker), and she is considered one of the pioneers of psychiatric social work along with Elizabeth Horton, who in 1907 was the first social worker to work in a psychiatric setting as an aftercare agent in the New York hospital systems to provide post-discharge supportive services.

The early twentieth century marked a period of progressive change in attitudes towards mental illness. The increased demand for psychiatric services following the First World War led to significant developments. In 1918, Smith College School for Social Work was established, and under the guidance of Mary C. Jarrett at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, students from Smith College were trained in psychiatric social work. She first gave social workers the &quot;Psychiatric Social Worker&quot; designation. A book titled &quot;The Kingdom of Evils,&quot; released in 1922, authored by a hospital administrator and the head of the social service department at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, described the roles of psychiatric social workers in the hospital. These roles encompassed casework, managerial duties, social research, and public education. After World War II, a series of mental hygiene clinics were established. The Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed in 1963. This policy encouraged the deinstitutionalisation of people with mental illness. Later, the mental health consumer movement came by 1980s. A consumer was defined as a person who has received or is currently receiving services for a psychiatric condition. People with mental disorders and their families became advocates for better care. Building public understanding and awareness through consumer advocacy helped bring mental illness and its treatment into mainstream medicine and social services. The 2000s saw the managed care movement, which aimed at a health care delivery system to eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate care to reduce costs, and the recovery movement, which by principle acknowledges that many people with serious mental illness spontaneously recover and others recover and improve with proper treatment.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq and War in Afghanistan (2001–2021), social workers worked in NATO hospitals in Afghanistan and Iraqi bases. They made visits to provide counseling services at forward operating bases. Twenty-two percent of the clients were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, 17 percent with depression, and 7 percent with alcohol use disorder. In 2009, there was a high level of suicides among active-duty soldiers: 160 confirmed or suspected Army suicides. In 2008, the Marine Corps had a record 52 suicides. The stress of long and repeated deployments to war zones, the dangerous and confusing nature of both wars, wavering public support for the wars, and reduced troop morale all contributed to escalating mental health issues. Military and civilian social workers served a critical role in the veterans&#x27; health care system.

Mental health services is a loose network of services ranging from highly structured inpatient psychiatric units to informal support groups, where psychiatric social workers indulges in the diverse approaches in multiple settings along with other paraprofessional workers.

===Canada===
A role for psychiatric social workers was established early in Canada&#x27;s history of service delivery in the field of population health. Native North Americans understood mental trouble as an indication of an individual who had lost their equilibrium with the sense of place and belonging in general, and with the rest of the group in particular. In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care. Indigenous peoples in Canada have faced cultural oppression and social marginalization through the actions of European colonizers and their institutions since the earliest periods of contact. Culture contact brought with it many forms of depredation. Economic, political, and religious institutions of the European settlers all contributed to the displacement and oppression of indigenous people.

The first officially recorded treatment practices were in 1714, when Quebec opened wards for the mentally ill. In the 1830s social services were active through charity organizations and church parishes (Social Gospel Movement). Asylums for the insane were opened in 1835 in Saint John and New Brunswick. In 1841 in Toronto care for the mentally ill became institutionally based. Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867, retaining its ties to the British crown. During this period, age of industrial capitalism began and it led to social and economic dislocation in many forms. By 1887 asylums were converted to hospitals, and nurses and attendants were employed for the care of the mentally ill. Social work training began at the University of Toronto in 1914. Before that, social workers acquired their training through trial and error methods on the job and by participating in apprenticeship plans offered by charity organization societies. These plans included related study, practical experience, and supervision. In 1918 Dr. Clarence Hincks and Clifford Beers founded the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene, which later became the Canadian Mental Health Association. In the 1930s Hincks promoted prevention and of treating sufferers of mental illness before they were incapacitated (early intervention).

World War II profoundly affected attitudes towards mental health. The medical examinations of recruits revealed that thousands of apparently healthy adults suffered mental difficulties. This knowledge changed public attitudes towards mental health, and stimulated research into preventive measures and methods of treatment. In 1951 Mental Health Week was introduced across Canada. For the first half of the twentieth century, with a period of deinstitutionalisation beginning in the late 1960s psychiatric social work succeeded to the current emphasis on community-based care, psychiatric social work focused beyond the medical model&#x27;s aspects on individual diagnosis to identify and address social inequities and structural issues. In the 1980s Mental Health Act was amended to give consumers the right to choose treatment alternatives. Later the focus shifted to workforce mental health issues and environmental root causes.

In Ontario, the regulator, the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (OCSWSSW) regulates two professions: registered social workers (RSW) and registered social service workers (RSSW). Each provinces has similar regulatory bodies. The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) is the national professional body for social workers. Prior to provincial-level politicization, registrants of this professional body were able to engage in inter-provincial practice as registered social workers.

===India===
The earliest citing of mental disorders in India are from Vedic Era (2000 BC – AD 600). Charaka Samhita, an ayurvedic textbook believed to be from 400 to 200 BC describes various factors of mental stability. It also has instructions regarding how to set up a care delivery system. In the same era, Siddha was a medical system in south India. The great sage Agastya was one of the 18 siddhas contributing to a system of medicine. This system has included the Agastiyar Kirigai Nool, a compendium of psychiatric disorders and their recommended treatments. In Atharva Veda too there are descriptions and resolutions about mental health afflictions. In the Mughal period Unani system of medicine was introduced by an Indian physician Unhammad in 1222. The existing form of psychotherapy was known then as ilaj-i-nafsani in Unani medicine.

The 18th century was a very unstable period in Indian history, which contributed to psychological and social chaos in the Indian subcontinent. In 1745, lunatic asylums were developed in Bombay (Mumbai) followed by Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1784, and Madras (Chennai) in 1794. The need to establish hospitals became more acute, first to treat and manage Englishmen and Indian &#x27;sepoys&#x27; (military men) employed by the British East India Company. The First Lunacy Act (also called Act No. 36) that came into effect in 1858 was later modified by a committee appointed in Bengal in 1888. Later, the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 was brought under this legislation. A rehabilitation programme was initiated between 1870s and 1890s for persons with mental illness at the Mysore Lunatic Asylum, and then an occupational therapy department was established during this period in almost each of the lunatic asylums. The programme in the asylum was called &#x27;work therapy&#x27;. In this programme, persons with mental illness were involved in the field of agriculture for all activities. This programme is considered as the seed of origin of psychosocial rehabilitation in India.

Berkeley-Hill, superintendent of the European Hospital (now known as the Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), established in 1918), was deeply concerned about the improvement of mental hospitals in those days. The sustained efforts of Berkeley-Hill helped to raise the standard of treatment and care and he also persuaded the government to change the term &#x27;asylum&#x27; to &#x27;hospital&#x27; in 1920. Techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name &#x27;habit formation chart&#x27; at the CIP, Ranchi. In 1937, the first post of psychiatric social worker was created in the child guidance clinic run by the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (established in 1936). It is considered as the first documented evidence of social work practice in Indian mental health field.

After Independence in 1947, general hospital psychiatry units (GHPUs) were established to improve conditions in existing hospitals, while at the same time encouraging outpatient care through these units. In Amritsar Dr. Vidyasagar instituted active involvement of families in the care of persons with mental illness. This was advanced practice ahead of its times regarding treatment and care. This methodology had a greater impact on social work practice in the mental health field especially in reducing the stigmatisation. In 1948 Gauri Rani Banerjee, trained in the United States, started a master&#x27;s course in medical and psychiatric social work at the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (now TISS). Later the first trained psychiatric social worker was appointed in 1949 at the adult psychiatry unit of Yerwada Mental Hospital, Pune.

In various parts of the country, in mental health service settings, social workers were employed—in 1956 at a mental hospital in Amritsar, in 1958 at a child guidance clinic of the college of nursing, and in Delhi in 1960 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and in 1962 at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. In 1960, the Madras Mental Hospital (now Institute of Mental Health) employed social workers to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. In 1961 the social work post was created at the NIMHANS. In these settings they took care of the psychosocial aspect of treatment. This system enabled social service practices to have a stronger long-term impact on mental health care.

In 1966 by the recommendation Mental Health Advisory Committee, Ministry of Health, Government of India, NIMHANS commenced Department of Psychiatric Social Work started and a two-year Postgraduate Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was introduced in 1968. In 1978, the nomenclature of the course was changed to MPhil in Psychiatric Social Work. Subsequently, a PhD Programme was introduced. By the recommendations Mudaliar committee in 1962, Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was started in 1970 at the European Mental Hospital at Ranchi (now CIP). The program was upgraded and other higher training courses were added subsequently.

A new initiative to integrate mental health with general health services started in 1975 in India. The Ministry of Health, Government of India formulated the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and launched it in 1982. The same was reviewed in 1995 and based on that, the District Mental Health Program (DMHP) was launched in 1996 which sought to integrate mental health care with public health care. This model has been implemented in all the states and currently there are 125 DMHP sites in India.

National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in 1998 and 2008 carried out systematic, intensive and critical examinations of mental hospitals in India. This resulted in recognition of the human rights of the persons with mental illness by the NHRC. From the NHRC&#x27;s report as part of the NMHP, funds were provided for upgrading the facilities of mental hospitals. As a result of the study, it was revealed that there were more positive changes in the decade until the joint report of NHRC and NIMHANS in 2008 compared to the last 50 years until 1998. In 2016 Mental Health Care Bill was passed which ensures and legally entitles access to treatments with coverage from insurance, safeguarding dignity of the afflicted person, improving legal and healthcare access and allows for free medications. In December 2016, Disabilities Act 1995 was repealed with Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWD), 2016 from the 2014 Bill which ensures benefits for a wider population with disabilities. The Bill before becoming an Act was pushed for amendments by stakeholders mainly against alarming clauses in the &quot;Equality and Non discrimination&quot; section that diminishes the power of the act and allows establishments to overlook or discriminate against persons with disabilities and against the general lack of directives that requires to ensure the proper implementation of the Act.

Mental health in India is in its developing stages. There are not enough professionals to support the demand. According to the Indian Psychiatric Society, there are around 9000 psychiatrists only in the country as of January 2019. Going by this figure, India has 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, while the desirable number is at least 3 psychiatrists per 100,000. While the number of psychiatrists has increased since 2010, it is still far from a healthy ratio.

Lack of any universally accepted single licensing authority compared to foreign countries puts social workers at general in risk. But general bodies/councils accepts automatically a university-qualified social worker as a professional licensed to practice or as a qualified clinician. Lack of a centralized council in tie-up with Schools of Social Work also makes a decline in promotion for the scope of social workers as mental health professionals. Though in this midst the service of social workers has given a facelift to the mental health sector in the country with other allied professionals.

==Theoretical models and practices==
Social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as (but not limited to) psychology, sociology, politics, criminology, economics, ecology, education, health, law, philosophy, anthropology, and counseling, including psychotherapy. Field work is a distinctive attribution to social work pedagogy. This equips the trainee in understanding the theories and models within the field of work. Professional practitioners from multicultural aspects have their roots in this social work immersion engagements from the early 19th century in the western countries. As an example, here are some of the models and theories used within social work practice:
* Empathy
* Social case work

==Profession==
American educator Abraham Flexner in a 1915 lecture, &quot;Is Social Work a Profession?&quot;, delivered at the National Conference on Charities and Corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession concerning social work. It is not a &#x27;single model&#x27;, such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are evidence-based by practice standards. A social work professional&#x27;s services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.

Its eight core functions present in its methods of practice are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
# Engagement — social worker must first engage the client in early meetings to promote a collaborative relationship
# Assessment — data gathered must be specifically aimed at guiding and directing a plan of action to help the client
# Planning — negotiate and formulate an action plan
# Implementation — promote resource acquisition and enhance role performance
# Monitoring/Evaluation — ongoing documentation for assessing the extent to which the client is following through on short-term goal attainment
# Supportive Counseling — affirming, challenging, encouraging, informing, and exploring options
# Graduated Disengagement — seeking to replace the social worker with a naturally occurring resource
# Administration — planning and managing social work programs, providing operations management support, and administrating case management services

There are six broad ethical principles in National Association of Social Workers&#x27; (NASW) Code of Ethics that inform social work practice, they are both prescriptive and proscriptive, and are based on six core values:

# Service — help people in need and provide pro bono services
# Social Justice — engage in social change activities for and with people to promote social justice and challenge social injustice
# Dignity and worth of the person — treat people with care and respect, be sensitive to cultural and ethnic diversity, and promote individuals socially responsible self determination 
# Importance of human relationships — maintain positive client relationships because they play a vital role in driving change, and engage with people as partners who empower them through the helping process
# Integrity — engage clients with honesty and responsibility to build trust, and you are not only responsible for your own professional ethics and integrity but also of the service organization
# Competence — practice and build expertise as a social worker, and continually seek to enhance and contribute professional knowledge and skills

The International Federation of Social Workers also outlines essential principles for guiding social workers towards high professional standards. These include recognizing the inherent dignity of all people, upholding human rights, striving for social justice, supporting self-determination, encouraging participation, respecting privacy and confidentiality, treating individuals holistically, using technology and social media responsibly, and maintaining professional integrity.

A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession&#x27;s focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society. Social workers promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients. A &quot;client&quot; can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community. In the broadening scope of the modern social worker&#x27;s role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.

Newer areas of social work practice involve management science. The growth of &quot;social work administration&quot; (sometimes also referred to as &quot;social work management&quot;) for transforming social policies into services and directing activities of an organization toward achievement of goals is a related field. Helping clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, to assist individuals and families in building savings and acquiring assets to improve their financial security over the long-term, to manage large operations, etc. requires social workers to know financial management skills to help clients and organization&#x27;s to be financially self-sufficient. Financial social work also helps clients with low-income or low to middle-income, people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions), with better mediation with financial institutions and induction of money management skills. A prominent area in which social workers operate is Behavioral Social Work. They apply principles of learning and social learning to conduct behavioral analysis and behavior management. Empiricism and effectiveness serve as means to ensure the dignity of clients, and focusing on the present is what distinguishes behavioral social work from other types of social work practices. In a multicultural case, the behavior of multiple members from different cultures matters. In such cases, an ecobehavioral perspective is taken due to the external influences. The interpersonal skills that a social worker brings to the job make them stand out from behavioral therapists. Another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as Knight in 1921 defined &quot;If you don&#x27;t even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and If you don&#x27;t even know the odds, that is uncertainty.&quot; Risk management in social work means minimizing the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analyzing the risks and benefits in the duty of care or decisions. Occupational social work is a field where the trained professionals assist a management with worker&#x27;s welfare, in their psychosocial wellness, and helps management&#x27;s policies and protocols to be humanistic and anti-oppressive.

In the United States, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, professional social workers are the largest group of mental health services providers. There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.

Examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are poverty relief, life skills education, community organizing, community organization, community development, rural development, forensics and corrections, legislation, industrial relations, project management, child protection, elder protection, women&#x27;s rights, human rights, systems optimization, finance, addictions rehabilitation, child development, cross-cultural mediation, occupational safety and health, disaster management, mental health, psychosocial therapy, disabilities, etc.

==Roles and functions==
Social workers play many roles in mental health settings, including those of case manager, advocate, administrator, and therapist. The major functions of a psychiatric social worker are promotion and prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Social workers may also practice:

* Counseling and psychotherapy
* Case management and support services
* Crisis intervention
* Psychoeducation
* Psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery
* Care coordination and monitoring
* Program management/administration
* Program, policy and resource development
* Research and evaluation

Psychiatric social workers conduct psychosocial assessments of the patients and work to enhance patient and family communications with the medical team members and ensure the inter-professional cordiality in the team to secure patients with the best possible care and to be active partners in their care planning. Depending upon the requirement, social workers are often involved in illness education, counseling and psychotherapy. In all areas, they are pivotal to the aftercare process to facilitate a careful transition back to family and community.

== Mental health of social workers ==
Several studies have reported that social workers have an increased risk of common mental disorders, long-term sickness absence due to mental illnesses and antidepressant use. A study in Sweden has found that social workers have an increased risk of receiving a diagnosis of depression or anxiety and stress-related disorders in comparison with other workers. The risk for social workers is high even when comparing to other similar human-service professions, and social workers in psychiatric care or in assistance analysis are the most vulnerable.

There are multiple explanations for this increased risk. Individual components include secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue and selection of vulnerable employees into the profession. On an organizational level, high job strain, organizational culture and work overload are important factors. 

There is a difference in gender. When comparing to their same-gender counterparts in other professions, men in social work have a higher risk than women. Male social workers, when compared to men in other professions, have a 70% increased risk of being diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders. Female social workers have an increased risk of 20% when comparing to women in other professions. This might be due the baseline prevalence of common mental disorders, which is high among women and lower among men in the general population. Another potential explanation is that men in gender-balanced workplaces tend to seek help from healthcare providers more often than men in male-dominated industries.

==Qualifications and license==
The education of social workers begins with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in social work or a Bachelor of Social Services. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, such as a master&#x27;s degree (MSW, MSSW, MSS, MSSA, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (Ph.D. and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). 

Several countries and jurisdictions require registration or license for working as social workers, and there are mandated . In other places, the professional association sets academic requirements as the qualification for practicing the profession. However, certain types of workers are exempted from needing a registration license. The success of these professionals is based on the recognition of and by the employers that provide social work services. These employers don&#x27;t require the title of a registered social worker as a necessity for providing social work and related services.

===North America===
In the United States, social work undergraduate and master&#x27;s programs are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker. The CSWE even accredits online master&#x27;s in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options. In 1898, the New York Charity Organization Society, which was the Columbia University School of Social Work&#x27;s earliest entity, began offering formal &quot;social philanthropy&quot; courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the United States, as well as the launching of professional social work. However, a CSWE-accredited program doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to meet ASWB licensing knowledge requirements, and many of them do not meet them.

The Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) is a regulatory organization that provides licensing examination services to social work regulatory boards in the United States and Canada. Due to the limited scope of the organization&#x27;s objectives, it is not a social work organization that is accountable to the broader social work community or to the ones certified by ASWB exams. ASWB generates an annual profit of $6,000,000 from license examination administration and $800,000 from publishing study materials. As such, it is an organization that is focused on revenue maximization, and by principle, it is only responsible and answerable to its board members. The objective of a social work license is to ensure the public&#x27;s safety and quality of service. It is intended to ensure that social workers understand and can follow NASW&#x27;s Code of Ethics in their occupational practices, ascertain social workers&#x27; knowledge in service provision, and protect the use of the Social Work title from misuse and unethical practices. However, a study found out that having a social work license is not related to improved service quality for consumers. They substituted paraprofessionals with qualified licensed social workers and found out that there was no improvement in overall facility quality, quality of life, or the provision of social services. The paraprofessionals with training were able to perform similarly to licensed social workers, just like any trained human resource in a workforce would perform a job for which they are trained. Social work graduates gain this knowledge and training through academic and financial investment in earning an accredited social work degree, degree equalization process, and from receiving professional supervision during and post-graduation. 

For decades, the social work community has called on ASWB for transparency regarding the data on the validity and racial sensitivity of the exams. However, ASWB suppressed this information, leading many critics to assess that if the exams were free from flaws and bias, such data would have been released a long time ago. In 2022, ASWB released the pass rate data, and a Change.org petition called &quot;#StopASWB&quot; highlighted with academic citations that the Association of Social Work Boards&#x27; exams are biased with feedback from white social workers. The petition also pointed out that the exams unfairly penalize social workers who practice in other languages, require privileged resources for success, and utilize oppressive standards in formatting the exams, which are inconsistent with social work values. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) expressed opposition to the social work licensing exams conducted by the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB). This came after analyzing ASWB data, which revealed considerable discrepancies in pass rates for aspiring social workers of diverse racial backgrounds, older individuals, and those who speak English as a second language (ESL). Pass rates of exams indicate that white test takers are more than twice as likely to pass on their first attempt compared to BIPOC test takers indicating high construct irrelevant variance among other issues. This finding raises questions about the reliability and credibility of social work licensure process through ASWB exams. 

NASW&#x27;s firm stance on the matter serves as a significant reckoning moment regarding the systemic racism in the social work profession, particularly within its regulatory system. It also highlights ASWB&#x27;s silence about the licensure apparatus that perpetuates racial disparities, leading its association members to institutional betrayal. After the release of ASWB data showing race and age-related discrepancies in pass rates, the national accreditation body, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), removed the ASWB licensure exam pass rates as an option for social work education programs to meet accreditation requirements. Members from various communities in social work have expressed that discussions about addressing this systemic oppression should be guided by a formal acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a spirit of reconciliation and healing. The state of Illinois passed a landmark bill, HB2365 SA1, marking a significant step in reducing its regulatory body&#x27;s dependency on ASWB. With this bill, Illinois has addressed the uneven power that ASWB held and its unfettered pursuit of profit, which affected the qualification of educated social workers for practice entry. Now, educated social workers can obtain licensing by completing 3000 hours of professional supervision, eliminating the previous requirement of ASWB exam results for licensure, which often led to issues of unemployment and related emotional, behavioral, and physical health consequences. 

Since the early 1990s, researchers have critiqued ASWB exams for their lack of content and criterion validity that undermines the test validity all together. In a study conducted in 2023, it was discovered that there are questions in ASWB exams that have rationales based on theories that are not evidence-based, and that have significant item validity issues. The researchers used generative AI application, ChatGPT to test ASWB rationales and found that the rationales provided by ChatGPT were of higher quality. They revealed that ChatGPT exhibited an excellent ability to recognize social work-related text patterns for scenario-based decision-making and offered high-quality rationales while taking into account the safety and ethics in social work practice, even without specific training for such a task. They suggested that it may be necessary and timely to move away from oppressive assessment formats used to evaluate social workers&#x27; competence and reconsider licensing exams with serious validity issues that disproportionately exclude individuals based on their race, age, and language. A proposed assessment format is one based on mastery learning, which would lead to competency-based licensing.

Due to the accumulated evidence of significant validity flaws in ASWB&#x27;s tests, its conflict of interest, and other issues, many researchers have urged state legislators and regulators to discontinue the use of ASWB exams for licensure or temporarily suspend them until a novel, anti-oppressive, and validated alternative is established. In the interim, they suggest relying on traditional supervision methods to ensure the safe and ethical practice of social work. They elucidate that supervision not only guides licensure seekers but also allows well-equipped supervisors to assess individuals&#x27; capabilities to practice safely and ethically more accurately in contexts, which is a more valid approach to assessing such competence.

==Professional associations==
Social workers have several professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW).

The largest professional social work association in the United States is the National Association of Social Workers, they have instituted a code for professional conduct and a set of principles rooted in six core values: service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as the American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychoanalysis. There are also several states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups, and individuals. The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA) is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres. The American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare (AASWSW) is a national honorific society of scholars and practitioners who focus on social work and social welfare. 

In the UK, the professional association is the British Association of Social Workers (BASW) with just over 18,000 members (as of August 2015), and the regulatory body for social workers is Social Work England. In Australia, the professional association is the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) that ensure social workers meet required standards for social work practice in Australia, founded in 1946 and have more than 10,000 members. Accredited social workers in Australia can also provide services under the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) program. In New Zealand, the regulatory body for social workers is Kāhui Whakamana Tauwhiro (SWRB).

==Trade unions representing social workers==
In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities, and many of these are represented by UNISON, the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of the Unite the Union and the GMB. The British Union of Social Work Employees (BUSWE) has been a section of the trade union Community since 2008.

While at that stage, not a union, the British Association of Social Workers operated a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations provide the kind of representation you would expect from a trade union in the event of a grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the goodwill of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.

By 2011 several councils had realized that they did not have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by the skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms-length trade union section, Social Workers Union (SWU). This gives the legal right to represent its members whether the employer or Trades Union Congress (TUC) recognizes SWU or not. In 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings, etc.

==Use of information technology in social work==
Information technology is vital in social work, it transforms the documentation part of the work into electronic media. This makes the process transparent, accessible and provides data for analytics. Observation is a tool used in social work for developing solutions. Anabel Quan-Haase in Technology and Society defines the term surveillance as &quot;watching over&quot; (Quan-Haase. 2016. P 213), she continues to explain that the observation of others socially and behaviorally is natural, but it becomes more like surveillance when the purpose of the observation is to keep guard over someone (Quan-Haase. 2016. P 213). Often, at the surface level, the use of surveillance and surveillance technologies within the social work profession is seemingly an unethical invasion of privacy. When engaging with the social work code of ethics a little more deeply, it becomes obvious that the line between ethical and unethical becomes blurred. Within the social work code of ethics, there are multiple mentions of the use of technology within social work practice. The one that seems the most applicable to surveillance or artificial intelligence is 5.02 article f, &quot;When using electronic technology to facilitate evaluation or research&quot; and it goes on to explain that clients should be informed when technology is being used within the practice (Workers. 2008. Article 5.02).

==Social workers in literature==
In 2011, a critic stated that &quot;novels about social work are rare&quot;, and as recently as 2004, another critic claimed to have difficulty finding novels featuring a main character holding a Master of Social Work degree.

However, social workers have been the subject of many novels, including:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* The basis of the movie &quot;Precious&quot;.
* Smith, Ali (2011) &quot;There But For The&quot;, Hamish Hamilton, Pantheon.

<doc id="146719" wikidata="Q193219" url="?curid=146719" title="Subsidy">
<text>A subsidy, subvention or government incentive is a type of government expenditure for individuals and households, as well as businesses with the aim of stabilizing the economy. It ensures that individuals and households are viable by having access to essential goods and services while giving businesses the opportunity to stay afloat and/or competitive. Subsidies not only promote long term economic stability but also help governments to respond to economic shocks during a recession or in response to unforeseen shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Subsidies take various forms— such as direct government expenditures, tax incentives, soft loans, price support, and government provision of goods and services. For instance, the government may distribute direct payment subsidies to individuals and households during an economic downturn in order to help its citizens pay their bills and to stimulate economic activity. Here, subsidies act as an effective financial aid issued when the economy experiences economic hardship. They can also be a good policy tool to revise market imperfections when rational and competitive firms fail to produce an optimal market outcome. For example, in an imperfect market condition, governments can inject subsidies to encourage firms to invest in R&amp;D (research and development). This will not only benefit the firms but also produce some positive externalities such that it benefits the industry in which the firms belong, and most importantly, the society at large.

Although commonly extended from the government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support – for example from NGOs or as implicit. Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, accelerated depreciation, rent rebates). Furthermore, they can be broad or narrow, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical. The most common forms of subsidies are those to the producer or the consumer. Producer/production subsidies ensure producers are better off by either supplying market price support, direct support, or payments to factors of production.
 Consumer/consumption subsidies commonly reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer. For example, in the US at one time it was cheaper to buy gasoline than bottled water.

All countries use subsidies via national and sub-national entities through different forms such as tax incentives and direct grants. Likewise, subsidies have an economic influence on both a domestic and international level. On a domestic level, subsidies affect the allocation decision of domestic resources, income distribution, and expenditure productivity. On an international level, subsidies may increase or decrease international interaction and integration through trade. For this reason, having a thorough subsidy policy is essential as its inadequacy can potentially lead to financial hardship and problems for not only the poor or low income individuals but the aggregate economy as a whole.

At large, subsidies take up a substantial portion of the government and economy. Amongst OECD countries in 2020, the median of subsidies and other transfers such as social benefits and non-repayable transfers to private and public enterprises was 56.3 percent of total government expenses which was 34.9 percent (weighted average) of GDP in the same year. Yet, the number of subsidy measures in force have been rapidly increasing since 2008.

==Types==

===Production subsidy===
A production subsidy encourages suppliers to increase the output of a particular product by partially offsetting the production costs or losses. The objective of production subsidies is to expand production of a particular product more so that the market would promote but without raising the final price to consumers. This type of subsidy is predominantly found in developed markets. Other examples of production subsidies include the assistance in the creation of a new firm (Enterprise Investment Scheme), industry (industrial policy) and even the development of certain areas (regional policy). Production subsidies are critically discussed in the literature as they can cause many problems including the additional cost of storing the extra produced products, depressing world market prices, and incentivizing producers to over-produce, for example, a farmer overproducing in terms of his land&#x27;s carrying capacity.

===Consumer/consumption subsidy===
A consumption subsidy is one that subsidizes the behavior of consumers. This type of subsidies are most common in developing countries where governments subsidise such things as food, water, electricity and education on the basis that no matter how impoverished, all should be allowed those most basic requirements. For example, some governments offer &quot;lifeline&quot; rates for electricity, that is, the first increment of electricity each month is subsidized. Evidence from recent studies suggests that government expenditures on subsidies remain high in many countries, often amounting to several percentage points of GDP. Subsidization on such a scale implies substantial opportunity costs. There are at least three compelling reasons for studying government subsidy behavior. First, subsidies are a major instrument of government expenditure policy. Second, on a domestic level, subsidies affect domestic resource allocation decisions, income distribution, and expenditure productivity. A consumer subsidy is a shift in demand as the subsidy is given directly to consumers.

===Export subsidy===
An export subsidy is a support from the government for products that are exported, as a means of assisting the country&#x27;s balance of payments. Usha Haley and George Haley identified the subsidies to manufacturing industry provided by the Chinese government and how they have altered trade patterns. Traditionally, economists have argued that subsidies benefit consumers but hurt the subsidizing countries. Haley and Haley provided data to show that over the decade after China joined the World Trade Organization industrial subsidies have helped give China an advantage in industries in which they previously enjoyed no comparative advantage such as the steel, glass, paper, auto parts, and solar industries. China&#x27;s shores have also collapsed from overfishing and industrialization, which is why the Chinese government heavily subsidizes its fishermen, who sail the world in search of new grounds.

Export subsidy is known for being abused. For example, some exporters substantially over declare the value of their goods so as to benefit more from the export subsidy. Another method is to export a batch of goods to a foreign country but the same goods will be re-imported by the same trader via a circuitous route and changing the product description so as to obscure their origin. Thus the trader benefits from the export subsidy without creating real trade value to the economy. Export subsidy as such can become a self-defeating and disruptive policy.

Adam Smith observed that special government subsidies enabled exporters to sell abroad at substantial ongoing losses. He did not regard that as a sound and sustainable policy. That was because &quot;… under normal industrial-commercial conditions their own interests soon oblige loss-making businesses to deploy their capital in other ways – or to move into markets where the sales prices do cover the supply costs and yield ordinary profits. Like other mercantilist schemes and devices, export bounties are a means of trying to force business capital into channels it would not naturally enter. The schemes are invariably costly and damaging in various ways.&quot;

===Import subsidy===
An import subsidy is support from the government for products that are imported. Rarer than an export subsidy, an import subsidy further reduces the price to consumers for imported goods. Import subsidies have various effects depending on the subject. For example, consumers in the importing country are better off and experience an increase in consumer welfare due to the decrease in price of the imported goods, as well as the decrease in price of the domestic substitute goods. Conversely, the consumers in the exporting country experience a decrease in consumer welfare due to an increase in the price of their domestic goods. Furthermore, producers of the importing country experience a loss of welfare due to a decrease in the price for the goods in their market, while on the other side, the exporters of the producing country experience an increase in well-being due to the increase in demand. Ultimately, the import subsidy is rarely used due to an overall loss of welfare for the country due to a decrease in domestic production and a reduction in production throughout the world. However, that can result in a redistribution of income.

===Employment subsidy===
Employment or wage subsidies keep the employment relationship ongoing even during financial crisis. It is particularly beneficial for enterprises to recover quickly after a temporary suspension following a crisis. Workers are prevented from losing their jobs and other associated employment benefits such as annual leave entitlements and retirement pensions.

Employment subsidies allow individual beneficiaries a minimum standard of living at the very least. However, less than half of active jobseekers in around 50% of OECD countries receive unemployment support. The effect of employment subsidies may not be evident immediately. When employers received grants to subside a substantial part of the wages for retaining their employees or to create new jobs during severe recessions such as the 2008 GFC (Global Financial Crisis), there were minor impacts on employment during the first year. However, the subsidy began to yield positive effects on employment, particularly a decrease in the unemployment rate, in the second year as employers began to properly utilise the subsidy.

===Tax subsidy===
Tax subsidies, also known as tax breaks or tax expenditures, are a way for governments to achieve certain outcomes without directly providing cash payments. By offering tax breaks, the government can incentivize behavior that is beneficial to the economy or society as a whole. Tax subsidies can also have negative consequences.

One type of tax subsidy is a health tax deduction, which allows individuals or businesses to deduct their health expenses from their taxable income. This can be seen as a way to incentivize people to prioritize their health and well-being. However, it can also create distortions in the economy by encouraging people to spend more on health care than they otherwise would.

Another type of tax subsidy is related to Intellectual Property. Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is a particular form of tax subsidy that involves companies shifting their profits to low-tax jurisdictions in order to reduce their overall tax burden. The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting is a treaty signed by half the nations of the world aimed at preventing this type of tax avoidance.

While tax subsidies can be effective in achieving certain outcomes, they are also less transparent than direct cash payments and can be difficult to undo. Some argue that tax breaks disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large corporations, further exacerbating income inequality. Therefore, it is important for governments to carefully consider the potential consequences of offering tax subsidies and ensure that they are targeted towards achieving the greatest public good.

Tax subsidies can have unintended consequences, such as creating market distortions that favor certain industries or companies over others. For example, if a government offers tax breaks to incentivize investment in renewable energy, it may lead to a glut of renewable energy projects and an oversupply of energy in the market. This, in turn, can lead to lower prices for energy and financial losses for investors.

Tax subsidies can be difficult to monitor and enforce, which can lead to abuse and fraud. Companies may claim tax breaks for activities that do not qualify, or may use complex legal structures to shift profits to lower tax jurisdictions. This can result in lost revenue for governments and a lack of fairness in the tax system.

Despite these concerns, tax subsidies remain a popular tool for governments to promote various policy objectives, such as economic growth, job creation, and environmental sustainability. The use of tax subsidies is often debated in political circles, with some arguing that they are necessary to support certain industries or to incentivize certain behaviors, while others argue that they create inefficiencies and distortions in the economy.

In conclusion, tax subsidies are a powerful tool for governments to achieve policy goals, but they come with their own set of challenges and limitations. It is important for policymakers to carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of tax subsidies and to design them in a way that maximizes their benefits while minimizing their costs. Additionally, strong monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are needed to ensure that tax subsidies are used appropriately and do not result in abuse or fraud.

===Transport subsidies===
Some governments subsidise transport, especially rail and bus transport, which decrease congestion and pollution compared to cars. In the EU, rail subsidies are around €73 billion, and Chinese subsidies reach $130 billion.

Publicly owned airports can be an indirect subsidy if they lose money. The European Union, for instance, criticizes Germany for its high number of money-losing airports that are used primarily by low cost carriers, characterizing the arrangement as an illegal subsidy.

In many countries, roads and highways are paid for through general revenue, rather than tolls or other dedicated sources that are paid only by road users, creating an indirect subsidy for road transportation. The fact that long-distance buses in Germany do not pay tolls has been called an indirect subsidy by critics, who point to track access charges for railways.

===Energy subsidies===

====Fossil fuels====
===Housing subsidies===
Housing subsidies are designed to promote the construction industry and homeownership. As of 2018, U.S housing subsidies total around $15 billion per year. Housing subsidies can come in two types; assistance with down payment and interest rate subsidies. The deduction of mortgage interest from the federal income tax accounts for the largest interest rate subsidy. Additionally, the federal government will help low-income families with the down payment, coming to $10.9 million in 2008.

As a housing policy tool, housing subsidies also help low income individuals gain and maintain liveable residency by easing the cost burdens of housing for low income individuals and households. However, some policy makers and experts believe they are costly to implement and may even reduce incentives for beneficiaries to participate in the labour market. In the contrary, certain literatures have found that subsidy cuts do not encourage employment or participation among beneficiaries. For example, research by Daniel Borbely found that reducing housing subsidies did not increase employment and labour force participation. Though, he also added that claimants relocated to other areas of the rental market to maintain their benefits.

Nonetheless, the most common method for providing housing subsidies is via direct payments to renters by covering a part of their rent on the private rent market. This method of direct transfer of housing subsidies is often referred to as &quot;housing vouchers&quot;. In the United States, the so-called Section 8 is a direct payment program subsidising the largest amount of money to renters for rental assistance.

===Environmental externalities===

While conventional subsidies require financial support, many economists have described implicit subsidies in the form of untaxed environmental externalities. These externalities include things such as pollution from vehicle emissions, pesticides, or other sources.

A 2015 report studied the implicit subsidies accruing to 20 fossil fuel companies. It estimated that the societal costs from downstream emissions and pollution attributable to these companies were substantial. The report spans the period 2008–2012 and notes that: &quot;for all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of ExxonMobil in 2008.&quot; Pure coal companies fare even worse: &quot;the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue (employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment) in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue.&quot;

==Categorising subsidies==

===Direct and indirect===

The first important classification of subsidies are direct and indirect subsidies. Subsidies are categorised as direct when it involves actual cash outlays targeted towards a specified individual or household. Popular examples includes cash grants and interest-free loans. Subsidies can also be classified as indirect when they do not involve actual payments. An example would be an increase in disposable income arising from a decrease in price of an essential good or service that the government has enforced in a form of monetary support. In contrast, a decrease in the price of a good or service may lead to an increase in revenue for producers earned from the heightened demand by consumers.

The use of indirect subsidies such as price controls is widespread among developing economies and emerging markets as a necessary tool for social policy. It has proven to be effective in many cases but price controls have a potential to dampen investment activity and growth, cause heavy fiscal burdens for the government, and may even complicate the optimal performance of monetary policy. To prevent the undesirable negative effects, price control regimes may be replaced by creating social safety nets and proposing sound reforms to encourage competition and growth.

===Production and consumption===

Another important classification of subsidies are producer/production subsidies and consumer/consumption subsidies. Production subsidies are designed to ensure producers are advantaged by creating fluid market activity through other market control mechanisms or by providing cash payments for factors of production. Consumption subsidies benefit consumers typically through a reduction in the market price of goods and services. They are commonly used by governments of many developing countries in an attempt to secure the most basic needs for its population.

===Broad and narrow===

These various subsidies can be divided into broad and narrow. Narrow subsidies are those monetary transfers that are easily identifiable and have a clear intent. They are commonly characterised by a monetary transfer between governments and institutions or businesses and individuals. A classic example is a government payment to a farmer.

===Monetary and non-monetary===

Conversely broad subsidies include both monetary and non-monetary subsidies and is often difficult to identify. A broad subsidy is less attributable and less transparent. Environmental externalities are the most common type of broad subsidy.

==Economic effects==
Competitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. When the price falls the quantity demand exceeds the equilibrium quantity, conversely, a reduction in the supply of a good beyond equilibrium quantity implies an increase in the price. The effect of a subsidy is to shift the supply or demand curve to the right (i.e. increases the supply or demand) by the amount of the subsidy. If a consumer is receiving the subsidy, a lower price of a good resulting from the marginal subsidy on consumption increases demand, shifting the demand curve to the right. If a supplier is receiving the subsidy, an increase in the price (revenue) resulting from the marginal subsidy on production results increases supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.

Assuming the market is in a perfectly competitive equilibrium, a subsidy increases the supply of the good beyond the equilibrium competitive quantity. The imbalance creates deadweight loss. Deadweight loss from a subsidy is the amount by which the cost of the subsidy exceeds the gains of the subsidy. The magnitude of the deadweight loss is dependent on the size of the subsidy. This is considered a market failure, or inefficiency.

Subsidies targeted at goods in one country, by lowering the price of those goods, make them more competitive against foreign goods, thereby reducing foreign competition. As a result, many developing countries cannot engage in foreign trade, and receive lower prices for their products in the global market. This is considered protectionism: a government policy to erect trade barriers in order to protect domestic industries. The problem with protectionism arises when industries are selected for nationalistic reasons (infant-industry), rather than to gain a comparative advantage. The market distortion, and reduction in social welfare, is the logic behind the World Bank policy for the removal of subsidies in developing countries.

Subsidies create spillover effects in other economic sectors and industries. A subsidized product sold in the world market lowers the price of the good in other countries. Since subsidies result in lower revenues for producers of foreign countries, they are a source of tension between the United States, Europe and poorer developing countries. While subsidies may provide immediate benefits to an industry, in the long-run they may prove to have unethical, negative effects. Subsidies are intended to support public interest, however, they can violate ethical or legal principles if they lead to higher consumer prices or discriminate against some producers to benefit others. For example, domestic subsidies granted by individual US states may be unconstitutional if they discriminate against out-of-state producers, violating the Privileges and Immunities Clause or the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Depending on their nature, subsidies are discouraged by international trade agreements such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). This trend, however, may change in the future, as needs of sustainable development and environmental protection could suggest different interpretations regarding energy and renewable energy subsidies. In its July 2019 report, &quot;Going for Growth 2019: The time for reform is now&quot;, the OECD suggests that countries make better use of environmental taxation, phase out agricultural subsidies and environmentally harmful tax breaks.

==Preventing fraud==
In the Netherlands, audits are performed to verify whether the funds that have been received has indeed been spent legally (and all requirements of the subsidy provider have been attained), for the purpose intended. It hence prevents fraud.

==Perverse subsidies==
===Definitions===
Although subsidies can be important, many are &quot;perverse&quot;, in the sense of having adverse unintended consequences. To be &quot;perverse&quot;, subsidies must exert effects that are demonstrably and significantly adverse both economically and environmentally. A subsidy rarely, if ever, starts perverse, but over time a legitimate efficacious subsidy can become perverse or illegitimate if it is not withdrawn after meeting its goal or as political goals change. Perverse subsidies are now so widespread that as of 2007 they amounted $2 trillion per year in the six most subsidised sectors alone (agriculture, fossil fuels, road transportation, water, fisheries and forestry).

===Effects===
The detrimental effects of perverse subsidies are diverse in nature and reach. Case-studies from differing sectors are highlighted below but can be summarised as follows.

Directly, they are expensive to governments by directing resources away from other legitimate should priorities (such as environmental conservation, education, health, or infrastructure), ultimately reducing the fiscal health of the government.

Indirectly, they cause environmental degradation (exploitation of resources, pollution, loss of landscape, misuse and overuse of supplies) which, as well as its fundamental damage, acts as a further brake on economies; tend to benefit the few at the expense of the many, and the rich at the expense of the poor; lead to further polarization of development between the Northern and Southern hemispheres; lower global market prices; and undermine investment decisions reducing the pressure on businesses to become more efficient. Over time the latter effect means support becomes enshrined in human behaviour and business decisions to the point where people become reliant on, even addicted to, subsidies, &quot;locking&quot; them into society.

Consumer attitudes do not change and become out-of-date, off-target and inefficient; furthermore, over time people feel a sense of historical right to them.

===Implementation===
Perverse subsidies are not tackled as robustly as they should be. Principally, this is because they become &quot;locked&quot; into society, causing bureaucratic roadblocks and institutional inertia. When cuts are suggested many argue (most fervently by those &quot;entitled&quot;, special interest groups and political lobbyists) that it will disrupt and harm the lives of people who receive them, distort domestic competitiveness curbing trade opportunities, and increase unemployment. Individual governments recognise this as a &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; – insofar as that even if they wanted to adopt subsidy reform, by acting unilaterally they fear only negative effects will ensue if others do not follow. Furthermore, cutting subsidies, however perverse they may be, is considered a vote-losing policy.

Reform of perverse subsidies is at a propitious time. The current economic conditions mean governments are forced into fiscal constraints and are looking for ways to reduce activist roles in their economies. There are two main reform paths: unilateral and multilateral. Unilateral agreements (one country) are less likely to be undertaken for the reasons outlined above, although New Zealand, Russia, Bangladesh and others represent successful examples. Multilateral actions by several countries are more likely to succeed as this reduces competitiveness concerns, but are more complex to implement requiring greater international collaboration through a body such as the WTO. Irrespective of the path, the aim of policymakers should be to: create alternative policies that target the same issue as the original subsidies but better; develop subsidy removal strategies allowing market-discipline to return; introduce &quot;sunset&quot; provisions that require remaining subsidies to be re-justified periodically; and make perverse subsidies more transparent to taxpayers to alleviate the &quot;vote-loser&quot; concern.

===Examples===

====Agricultural subsidies====
Support for agriculture dates back to the 19th century. It was developed extensively in the EU and US across the two World Wars and the Great Depression to protect domestic food production, but remains important across the world today. In 2005, US farmers received $14 billion and EU farmers $47 billion in agricultural subsidies. Today, agricultural subsidies are defended on the grounds of helping farmers to maintain their livelihoods. The majority of payments are based on outputs and inputs and thus favour the larger producing agribusinesses over the small-scale farmers. In the US nearly 30% of payments go to the top 2% of farmers.

By subsidising inputs and outputs through such schemes as &quot;yield based subsidisation&quot;, farmers are encouraged to over-produce using intensive methods, including using more fertilizers and pesticides; grow high-yielding monocultures; reduce crop rotation; shorten fallow periods; and promote exploitative land use change from forests, rainforests and wetlands to agricultural land. These all lead to severe environmental degradation, including adverse effects on soil quality and productivity including erosion, nutrient supply and salinity which in turn affects carbon storage and cycling, water retention and drought resistance; water quality including pollution, nutrient deposition and eutrophication of waterways, and lowering of water tables; diversity of flora and fauna including indigenous species both directly and indirectly through the destruction of habitats, resulting in a genetic wipe-out.

Cotton growers in the US reportedly receive half their income from the government under the Farm Bill of 2002. The subsidy payments stimulated overproduction and resulted in a record cotton harvest in 2002, much of which had to be sold at very reduced prices in the global market. For foreign producers, the depressed cotton price lowered their prices far below the break-even price. In fact, African farmers received 35 to 40 cents per pound for cotton, while US cotton growers, backed by government agricultural payments, received 75 cents per pound. Developing countries and trade organizations argue that poorer countries should be able to export their principal commodities to survive, but protectionist laws and payments in the United States and Europe prevent these countries from engaging in international trade opportunities.

====Fisheries====
Today, much of the world&#x27;s major fisheries are overexploited; in 2002, the WWF estimate this at approximately 75%. Fishing subsidies include &quot;direct assistant to fishers; loan support programs; tax preferences and insurance support; capital and infrastructure programs; marketing and price support programs; and fisheries management, research, and conservation programs.&quot; They promote the expansion of fishing fleets, the supply of larger and longer nets, larger yields and indiscriminate catch, as well as mitigating risks which encourages further investment into large-scale operations to the disfavour of the already struggling small-scale industry. Collectively, these result in the continued overcapitalization and overfishing of marine fisheries.

There are four categories of fisheries subsidies. First are direct financial transfers, second are indirect financial transfers and services. Third, certain forms of intervention and fourth, not intervening. The first category regards direct payments from the government received by the fisheries industry. These typically affect profits of the industry in the short term and can be negative or positive. Category two pertains to government intervention, not involving those under the first category. These subsidies also affect the profits in the short term but typically are not negative. Category three includes intervention that results in a negative short-term economic impact, but economic benefits in the long term. These benefits are usually more general societal benefits such as the environment. The final category pertains to inaction by the government, allowing producers to impose certain production costs on others. These subsidies tend to lead to positive benefits in the short term but negative in the long term.

====Manufacturing subsidies====
A survey of manufacturing in Britain found government subsidies had had various unintended dysfunctional consequences. The subsidies had usually been selective or discriminatory – benefiting some companies at the expense of others. Government money in the form of grants and awards of production and R&amp;D contracts had gone to advanced and viable firms as well as old uneconomic enterprises. However, the main recipients had been larger, established companies – while most of the firms pioneering radical technical-product developments with long-term economic growth potential had been new small enterprises. 
The study concluded that instead of providing subsidies, governments wanting to benefit industrial-technological development and performance should lower standard rates of business taxation, raise tax allowances for investments in new plant, equipment and products, and remove obstacles to market competition and customer choice.

====Others====
The US National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) profits have topped records at $11 billion, the highest of all sports. The NFL had tax-exempt status until voluntarily relinquishing it in 2015, and new stadiums have been built with public subsidies.

The Commitment to Development Index (CDI), published by the Center for Global Development, measures the effect that subsidies and trade barriers actually have on the undeveloped world. It uses trade, along with six other components such as aid or investment, to rank and evaluate developed countries on policies that affect the undeveloped world. It finds that the richest countries spend $106 billion per year subsidizing their own farmers – almost exactly as much as they spend on foreign aid.

<doc id="146720" wikidata="Q622899" url="?curid=146720" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">
<text>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice tasked with combating illicit drug trafficking and distribution within the U.S. It is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The DEA is responsible for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestically and internationally.

It was established in 1973 as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s war on drugs. The DEA has an intelligence unit that is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While the unit is part of the DEA chain-of-command, it also reports to the director of national intelligence. The DEA has been criticized for scheduling drugs that have medicinal uses, and for focusing on operations that allow it to seize money rather than those involving drugs that cause more harm.

==History and mandate==
The Drug Enforcement Administration was established on July 1, 1973, by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, signed by President Richard Nixon on July 28. It proposed the creation of a single federal agency to enforce the federal drug laws as well as consolidate and coordinate the government&#x27;s drug control activities. Congress accepted the proposal, as they were concerned with the growing availability of drugs. As a result, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD), the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE); approximately 600 Special Agents of the Bureau of Customs, Customs Agency Service, and other federal offices merged to create the DEA.

The DEA is the primary federal agency charged with implementing and enforcing the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which is Title II of a larger Federal Act called the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The DEA is responsible for drugs listed in the CSA&#x27;s five drug Schedules, categories that rank drugs by their potential for harm, and whether they have a medical use. The CSA seeks to ensure legitimate access to controlled pharmaceuticals, while preventing illicit use of controlled drugs. To these ends, the DEA implements two intersecting legal schemes created by the CSA, &quot;registration&quot; provisions for entities involved in legal activities, violations of which are not usually criminal offenses, and &quot;trafficking&quot; provisions for illegal activities, violations of which are criminal offenses.

From the early 1970s, DEA headquarters was located at 1405 I (&quot;Eye&quot;) Street NW in downtown Washington, D.C. With the overall growth of the agency in the 1980s (owing to the increased emphasis on federal drug law enforcement efforts) and concurrent growth in the headquarters staff, the DEA began to search for a new headquarters location; locations in Arkansas, Mississippi and various abandoned military bases around the United States were considered. However, then–attorney general Edwin Meese determined that the headquarters had to be located close to the attorney general&#x27;s office. Thus, in 1989, the headquarters relocated to 600–700 Army-Navy Drive in the Pentagon City area of Arlington County, Virginia, near the eponymous Metro station.

On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh carried out a terrorist attack on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He was targeting regional offices for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and DEA, all of which had carried out raids that he viewed as unjustified intrusions on the rights of the people. This attack caused the deaths of two DEA employees, one task force member and two contractors in the Oklahoma City bombing. Subsequently, the DEA headquarters complex was classified as a Level IV installation under United States federal building security standards, meaning it was to be considered a high-risk law enforcement target for terrorists. Security measures include hydraulic steel roadplates to enforce standoff distance from the building, metal detectors and guard stations.

In February 2003, the DEA established a Digital Evidence Laboratory within its Office of Forensic Sciences.

== Organization ==
The DEA is headed by an administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Administrator reports to the attorney general through the deputy attorney general. The administrator is assisted by a deputy administrator, the chief of operations, the chief inspector, and three assistant administrators (for the Operations Support, Intelligence, and Human Resources divisions). Other senior staff includes the chief financial officer and the chief counsel. The administrator and deputy administrator are the only presidentially appointed personnel in the DEA; all other DEA officials are career government employees. DEA&#x27;s headquarters is located in Arlington County, Virginia, across from the Pentagon. It maintains its own DEA Academy located on the Marine Corps Base Quantico at Quantico, Virginia, alongside the FBI Academy. , it maintains 241 domestic offices in 23 divisions, and 93 foreign offices in 69 countries. With a budget exceeding $3 billion, DEA employs 10,169 people, including 4,924 special agents and 800 intelligence analysts.

 its headquarters and the DEA Museum were in in Lincoln Place, a rented office building in Pentagon City in Arlington County, Virginia. In September 2018 this lease was scheduled to end. The General Services Administration (GSA), circa 2015, was checking to see where in Northern Virginia the DEA could be headquartered. In 2018 the government of the United States extended the lease at Lincoln Place, now to expire circa 2033. The DEA administration favored retaining the original location.

===Special agents===
As of 2017, there were 4,650 special agents employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA agents&#x27; starting salary is $49,746–$55,483. After four years, the salary rises to above $92,592. This figure doesn’t include Cost of living allowance (COLA) or LEAP which rated at 25% of base pay including COLA. Special Agents at the 13 step 5 level in high cost of living areas of the United States make near the federal pay cap of $191,000.

After receiving a conditional offer of employment, recruits must then complete an 18-week rigorous training which includes lessons in firearms proficiency (including basic marksmanship), weapons safety, tactical shooting, and deadly-force decision training. To graduate, students must maintain an academic average of 80 percent on academic examinations, pass the firearms qualification test, successfully demonstrate leadership and sound decision-making in practical scenarios, and pass rigorous physical-task tests. Upon graduation, recruits earn the title of DEA Special Agent.

Because the DEA is responsible for enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, it excludes from consideration job applicants who use or have a recent history of using narcotics or illicit drugs. As of June 27, 2024, DEA applicants cannot have used cannabis or marijuana within three years of submitting their application and cannot have used any other narcotic substance within seven years of applying, although allowances are made for the use of marijuana prior to an applicant&#x27;s 18th birthday. Background investigations usually include a polygraph test for special-agent, diversion-investigator, and intelligence research specialist positions.
The DEA&#x27;s relatively firm stance on personal drug use contrasts with those of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which in 2023 considered further relaxing their eligibility guidelines so as to combat dwindling recruitment rates.

===Aviation Division===
The DEA Aviation Division or Office of Aviation Operations (OA) (formerly Aviation Section) is an airborne division based in Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Texas. The current OA fleet consists of 106 aircraft and 124 DEA pilots.

The DEA shares a communications system with the Department of Defense for communication with state and regional enforcement independent of the Department of Justice and police information systems and is coordinated by an information command center called the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) near El Paso, Texas.

=== Special Response Teams ===

Rapid Response Teams (RRT), previously known as Foreign-Deployed Advisory and Support Teams (FAST), were decommissioned by DEA acting administrator Chuck Rosenburg in March 2017 via memorandum. A need for domestic high-risk service teams led to the hybrid creation of specialized tactical units residing within various geographical regions throughout the United States.

DEA officially created and standardized its Special Response Team (SRT) program in 2016. The SRT was designed as a stop-gap between tactical operations conducted by field agents and those necessitating specialized tactics as a result of elevated risks. SRT operators are highly trained in various weapons systems and entry tactics/maneuvers. Because of the clandestine nature of the DEA mission, SRT training protocols and activation requirements are highly sensitive and not available to the public. Some of the SRT missions consist of high-risk arrests, vehicle assaults, air assault/infiltration, specialized surveillance, custody of high-profile individuals, dignitary and witness protection, tactical surveillance and interdiction, advanced breaching, tactical training to other police units, and urban and rural fugitive searches. Covertly located throughout the nation, DEA SRT teams are available to respond to practically any CONUS geographical area with little to no preparation or notification. The DEA SRT has been involved in several high-profile operations in recent years, however, DEA involvement is often not publicized due to operational and intelligence considerations. Considered one of the most covert outfits in federal law enforcement, very little is known about DEA SRT capabilities and its operator selection process.

In the past, DEA had other tactical teams like the High-risk Entry Apprehension Teams (HEAT) in some Field Divisions, and Operation Snowcap Teams (predecessor of FAST). The teams administered by the Mobile Enforcement Section, the Mobile Enforcement Teams (MET), and Regional Enforcement Teams (RET), were mobile investigative units intended to deploy resources to state and local agencies (MET) or DEA Field Divisions (RET) in need of assistance with a particular investigation or trafficking group. These programs ended in the early 2000s.

=== Special Operations Division ===
The DEA Special Operations Division (SOD) is a division within the DEA, which forwards information from wiretaps, intercepts, and databases from various sources to federal agents and local law enforcement officials. The SOD came under scrutiny following the 2010s global surveillance disclosures.

=== Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program ===
The Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) began funding eradication programs in Hawaii and California in 1979. The program rapidly expanded to include programs in 25 states by 1982. By 1985, all 50 states were participating in the DCE/SP. In 2015, the DCE/SP was responsible for the eradication of 3,932,201 cultivated outdoor cannabis plants and 325,019 indoor plants for a total of 4,257,220 marijuana plants. In addition, the DCE/SP accounted for 6,278 arrests and the seizure in excess of $29.7 million of cultivator assets.

In 2014, the DEA spent $73,000 to eradicate marijuana plants in Utah, though they did not find a single marijuana plant. Federal documents obtained by journalist Drew Atkins detail the DEA&#x27;s continuing efforts to spend upwards of $14 million per year to completely eradicate marijuana within the United States despite the government funding allocation reports showing that the Marijuana Eradication Program often leads to the discovery of no marijuana plants. This prompted twelve members of Congress to push for the elimination of the program and use the money instead to fund domestic-violence prevention and deficit-reduction programs.

== Budget ==
In 2018, the DEA budget was $2.086 billion. $445 million was spent on international enforcement and $1.627 billion was spent on domestic enforcement.

* Breaking foreign and domestic sources of supply ($1.0149 billion) via domestic cannabis eradication/suppression; domestic enforcement; research, engineering, and technical operations; the Foreign Cooperative Investigations Program; intelligence operations (financial intelligence, operational intelligence, strategic intelligence, and the El Paso Intelligence Center); and drug and chemical diversion control.
* Reduction of drug-related crime and violence ($181.8 million) funding state and local teams and mobile enforcement teams.
* Demand reduction ($3.3 million) via anti-legalization education, training for law enforcement personnel, youth programs, support for community-based coalitions, and sports drug awareness programs.

==Firearms==
DEA agents&#x27; primary service weapons are the Glock 17 and Glock 19, Remington 870 12-gauge shotgun, and Rock River Arms LAR-15 semi-automatic carbine in 5.56×45mm NATO. Agents may also qualify to carry a firearm listed on an authorized carry list maintained and updated by the Firearms Training Unit (FTU), Quantico, Virginia.

Special Agents may qualify with their own personally-owned handguns, rifle, and shotgun, and certain handguns are allowed to be used with permission from the FTU. Agents are required to attend tactical and firearms proficiency training quarterly, and to qualify with their handguns twice per year. The DEA has one of the most challenging handgun qualification courses in all of the federal law enforcement. Failure to achieve a passing qualification score is the reason for most Academy dismissals and special agents in the field may have their authority to carry a firearm revoked for failure to qualify.

Basic Agent Trainees (BATs) who fail the initial pistol qualification course of fire are placed in a remedial program to receive additional training. In remedial training, BATs receive five extra two-hour range sessions, for a total of 10 more hours of live fire training on their issued sidearm, to further aid them in helping pass the pistol qualification. After passing their pistol qualification, Basic Agent Trainees move on to receive formal training on the DEA&#x27;s standard-issue long guns and will continue to frequently shoot the agency-issued sidearms that they have already qualified on. In all, BATs receive a total of 32 firearms training sessions, when combining classroom instruction, gear issue, and pistol, rifle, and shotgun live fire training at the DEA Academy. They will shoot the qualification courses for all three weapons systems during their initial training but must pass their final qualification attempts only on their Glock pistols to become a Special Agent.
Agents are trained to use shoulder-fired weapons, such as the Rock River LAR-15, adopted in 2004, and the LWRC M6A2, the standard carbine of DEA. The Colt 9mm SMG was previously issued, but no longer in service. Agents are required to complete a two-day (16-hour) proficiency course to carry a shoulder weapon on enforcement operations. They may carry a Rock River LAR-15 or LWRC carbine as authorized, personally-owned weapons, provided they meet the same training and proficiency standards.

==Impact on the drug trade==
In 2005, the DEA seized a reported $1.4 billion in drug trade related assets and $477 million worth of drugs. According to the White House&#x27;s Office of Drug Control Policy, the total value of all of the drugs sold in the U.S. is as much as $64 billion a year, giving the DEA an efficiency rate of less than 1% at intercepting the flow of drugs into and within the United States. Critics of the DEA (including recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Milton Friedman, prior to his death a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) point out that demand for illegal drugs is inelastic; the people who are buying drugs will continue to buy them with little regard to price, often turning to crime to support expensive drug habits when the drug prices rise. One recent study by the DEA showed that the price of cocaine and methamphetamine is the highest it has ever been while the quality of both is at its lowest point ever. This is contrary to a collection of data done by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which states that purity of street drugs has increased, while price has decreased. In contrast to the statistics presented by the DEA, the United States Department of Justice released data in 2003 showing that purity of methamphetamine was on the rise.

=== Registration and licensing ===
The DEA has a registration system in place which authorizes anyone to manufacture, import, export, and distribute by filing DEA form 225 along with medical professionals, researchers and manufacturers access to &quot;Schedule I&quot; drugs, as well as Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5. Authorized registrants apply for and, if granted, receive a &quot;DEA number&quot;. An entity that has been issued a DEA number is authorized to manufacture (drug companies), distribute research, prescribe (doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, etc.), or dispense (pharmacy) a controlled substance.

=== Diversion control system ===
Many problems associated with substance use disorders are the result of legitimately manufactured controlled substances being diverted from their lawful purpose into the illicit drug traffic. Many of the analgesics, depressants and stimulants manufactured for legitimate medical use can often carry the potential for addiction. Therefore, those scheduled substances have been brought under legal control for prevention and population safety. The goal of controls is to ensure that these &quot;controlled substances&quot; are readily available for medical use while preventing their distribution for illicit distribution and non-medical use. This can be a difficult task, sometimes providing difficulty for legitimate patients and healthcare providers while circumventing illegal trade and consumption of scheduled drugs.

Under federal law, all businesses which manufacture or distribute controlled drugs, all health professionals entitled to dispense, administer or prescribe them, and all pharmacies entitled to fill prescriptions must register with the DEA. Registrants must comply with a series of regulatory requirements relating to drug security, records accountability, and adherence to standards.

All of these investigations are conducted by Diversion Investigators (DIs). DIs conduct investigations to uncover and investigate suspected sources of diversion and take appropriate civil and administrative actions. Prescription Database Management Programs (PDMP) aid and facilitate investigation and surveillance.

===Fentanyl overdose crisis===
In 2019 and 2020, record overdoses from illicit fentanyl tablets or as a deadly adulterant in heroin have ravaged North America. An estimated 19,416 individuals died of a drug overdose in the United States in the first 3 months of 2020 compared with 16,682 in the same 3-month period in 2019; this trend was fueled by synthetic opioids (especially illicitly manufactured fentanyl and analogs). Furthermore, between May 2020 and April 2021, the estimated number of drug overdose deaths in the United States exceeded 100,000 over this time period, with 64.0% of deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (the same illicitly manufactured fentanyls and analogs). In contrast, Europe has seen a decrease from heroin overdoses, and a practical absence of illicit, synthetic opioids.

Fentanyl, originally developed in the 1970s by Janssen Pharmaceutica, is a potent anesthetic primarily used in hospital or hospice settings. In Europe, heroin is mainly supplied from Western Asia (from Afghanistan and neighboring countries), and less likely to be contaminated with fentanyl. In North America, there are now fewer deaths involving heroin than either meth or cocaine, a striking change that has taken place over the last two years as heroin has all but disappeared from some regions. Due to the absence of heroin from Asian sources, fentanyl-laced heroin powder or tablets have filled that void.

In October 2021, the US reported another record in fentanyl deaths, as federal agencies were unable to stem the tide of illicit, synthetic drugs entering the US. Originally, introduced to replace much of the white powder heroin in the Eastern United States, the drug continues to move further west. Between July 2019–December 2020, illicitly manufactured fentanyl involved deaths increased sharply in midwestern (33.1%), southern (64.7%), and western (93.9%) jurisdictions.

=== MDMA DEA scheduling overturn ===
In 1985 MDMA and its analogues were under review by the American government as a drug with a potential for addiction. During this time, several public hearings on the new drug were held by the DEA. Based on all of the evidence and facts presented at the time, the DEA&#x27;s administrative law judge did not see MDMA and its analogues as being of large concern and recommended that they be placed in Schedule III. The DEA administrator, expressing concern for addictive potential, overruled the recommendation and ruled that MDMA be put in Schedule I, the Controlled Substances Act&#x27;s most restrictive category.

==Rank structure==
The following is a listing of the rank structure found within the DEA (in ascending order):
* Agents
** Agent Trainee
** Special Agent
** Senior Special Agent
** Supervising Special Agent
** Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC)
** Special Agent in Charge (SAC)
* Management

== Line of duty deaths ==
54 DEA agents have been killed in the line of duty.

== Criticism and controversies ==

The DEA has been criticized for placing highly restrictive schedules on a few drugs that researchers in the fields of pharmacology and medicine regard as having medical uses. Critics assert that some such decisions are motivated primarily by political factors stemming from the U.S. government&#x27;s war on drugs and that many benefits of such substances remain unrecognized due to the difficulty of conducting scientific research. A counterpoint to that criticism is that under the Controlled Substances Act it is the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse), not the DEA, which has the legal responsibility to make scientific and medical determinations with respect to drug scheduling; no drug can be scheduled if the secretary of health and human services recommends against it on a scientific or medical basis, and no drug can be placed in the most restrictive schedule (Schedule I) if DHHS finds that the drug has an accepted medical use. Jon Gettman&#x27;s essay &quot;Science and the End of Marijuana Prohibition&quot; describes the DEA as &quot;a fall guy to deflect responsibility from the key decision-makers&quot; and opines, &quot;HHS calls the shots when it comes to marijuana prohibition, and the cops at DEA and the general over at ONDCP take the heat.&quot;

The DEA is also criticized for focusing on the operations from which it can seize the most money, namely the organized cross-border trafficking of marijuana. Some individuals contemplating the nature of the DEA&#x27;s charter advise that, based on danger, the DEA should be most focused on cocaine. Others suggest that, based on opiate popularity, the DEA should focus much more on prescription opiates used recreationally, which critics contend comes first before users switch to heroin.

Practitioners who legally prescribe medicine however must possess a valid DEA license. According to federal law, the budget of the DEA Diversion Control Program is to be paid by these license fees. In 1984 a three-year license cost $25. In 2009 the fee for a three-year license was $551. Some have likened this approach to license fees unreasonable, &quot;like making pilot licenses support the entire Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) budget.&quot; The renewal fee for 2020 as of October 1, 2020, is $888 for a three-year license.

In 2005, the DEA estimated that it had over 4,000 informants without which they &quot;could not effectively enforce the controlled substances laws of the United States.&quot; To gather information, agents permitted their informants to buy and sell drugs, engage in Medicaid fraud rings, and other illicit acts. Despite this, the DEA claims that they are &quot;in compliance&quot; with the rules for using informants to gather information about illicit activities.

===Costs===
The total budget of the DEA from 1972 to 2014, according to the agency website, was $50.6 billion. The agency had 11,055 employees in 2014. For the year 2014 the average cost per arrest made was $97,325.

===Civil liberties===
Others, such as former Republican congressman Ron Paul, the Cato Institute, The Libertarian Party and the Drug Policy Alliance criticize the very existence of the DEA and the war on drugs as both hostile, and contrary, to the concept of civil liberties by arguing that anybody should be free to put any substance they choose into their own bodies for any reason, particularly when legal drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs are also open to addiction, and that any harm caused by a drug user or addict to the general public is a case of conflicting civil rights. Recurrently, billions of dollars are spent yearly, focusing largely on criminal law and demand reduction campaigns, which has resulted in the imprisonment of thousands of U.S. citizens. Demand for recreational drugs is somewhat static as the market for most illegal drugs has been saturated, forcing the cartels to expand their market to Europe and other areas than the United States. United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug.

===Incarceration of Daniel Chong===

In April 2012 in San Diego, California, DEA agents detained a student, Daniel Chong, and left him locked in a holding room for five days. The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities. When he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations. The incident has been described as a &quot;Kafkaesque nightmare,&quot; a &quot;debacle,&quot; and &quot;one of the worst cases of its kind.&quot; Chong subsequently sued the DEA; the government settled the suit for $4.1 million.

===Department of Justice Smart on Crime Program===
On August 12, 2013, at the American Bar Association&#x27;s House of Delegates meeting, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the &quot;Smart on Crime&quot; program, which is &quot;a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug legislation and policies.&quot; Holder said the program &quot;will encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes &quot;for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins...&quot; Running through Holder&#x27;s statements, the increasing economic burden of over-incarceration was stressed. , the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort &quot;limited to the DOJ&#x27;s policy parameters.&quot;

===International events===
David Coleman Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani, June 30, 1960) who was working as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) simultaneously made periodic trips to Pakistan for LeT training and was one of the main conspirators in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
On January 24, 2013, Headley, then 52 years old, was sentenced by U.S. district judge Harry Leinenweber of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago to 35 years in prison for his part in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which at least 164 victims (civilians and security personnel) and nine attackers were killed. Among the dead were 28 foreign nationals from 10 countries. One attacker was captured. The bodies of many of the dead hostages showed signs of torture or disfigurement. A number of those killed were notable figures in business, media, and security services.

The DEA was accused in 2005 by the Venezuelan government of collaborating with drug traffickers, after which President Hugo Chávez decided to end any collaboration with the agency. In 2007, after the U.S. State Department criticized Venezuela in its annual report on drug trafficking, the Venezuelan Minister of Justice reiterated the accusations: &quot;A large quantity of drug shipments left the country through that organization. We were in the presence of a new drug cartel.&quot;
In his 1996 series of articles and subsequent 1999 book, both titled Dark Alliance, journalist Gary Webb asserts that the DEA helped harbor Nicaraguan drug traffickers. Notably, they allowed Oscar Danilo Blandón political asylum in the USA despite knowledge of his cocaine-trafficking organization.

The government of Bolivia has also taken similar steps to ban the DEA from operating in the country. In September 2008, Bolivia drastically reduced diplomatic ties with the United States, withdrawing its ambassador from the US and expelling the US ambassador from Bolivia. This occurred soon after Bolivian president Evo Morales expelled all DEA agents from the country due to a revolt in the traditional coca-growing Chapare Province. The Bolivian government claimed that it could not protect the agents, and Morales further accused the agency of helping incite the violence, which claimed 30 lives. National agencies were to take over control of drug management. Three years later, Bolivia and the US began to restore full diplomatic ties. However, Morales maintained that the DEA would remain unwelcome in the country, characterising it as an affront to Bolivia&#x27;s &quot;dignity and sovereignty&quot;.

In the Netherlands, both the Dutch government and the DEA have been criticized for violations of Dutch sovereignty in drug investigations. According to Peter R. de Vries, a Dutch journalist present at the 2005 trial of Henk Orlando Rommy, the DEA has admitted to activities on Dutch soil. Earlier, then Minister of Justice Piet Hein Donner, had denied to the Dutch parliament that he had given permission to the DEA for any such activities, which would have been a requirement by Dutch law in order to allow foreign agents to act within the territory.

The DEA conducted a covert operation over several years in which undercover operatives were sent to Venezuela to build drug-trafficking cases against Venezuela&#x27;s leadership, including Nicholas Maduro. The plan was part of &quot;Operation Money Badger&quot;, which the DEA and prosecutors in Miami created in 2013. It potentially breached Venezuelan and international law and therefore required the approval of the Sensitive Activity Review Committee, a secretive panel of senior State and Justice Department officials that oversees the most sensitive DEA cases involving tricky ethical, legal or foreign policy considerations.

Following the Colombian peace process, which brought an end to the Colombian conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC–EP), the Special Jurisdiction for Peace found that the DEA had plotted with Colombian Attorney General Néstor Humberto Martínez to fabricate drug trafficking charges against Jesús Santrich, in a bid to jeopardize the peace agreement by inciting the FARC to take up arms again.

===Special Operations Division fabricated evidence trails===
In 2013, &quot;Reuters&quot; published a report about the DEA&#x27;s Special Operations Division (SOD) stating that it conceals where an investigative trail about a suspect truly originates from and creates a parallel set of evidence given to prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers. This DEA program mainly affects common criminals such as drug dealers. The concealment of evidence means the defendant is unaware of how his or her investigation began and will be unable to request a review of possible sources of exculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence may include biased witnesses, mistakes, or entrapment. Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who had served from 1994 to 2011 and a Harvard Law School professor, stated that &quot;It is one thing to create special rules for national security. Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.&quot; Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that &quot;It&#x27;s the first clear evidence that the “special rules” and disregard for constitutional law that have characterized the hunt for so-called terrorists have crept into the domestic criminal justice system on a significant scale.&quot;

===Cannabis rescheduling===
A 2014 report by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and the Drug Policy Alliance accuses the DEA of unfairly blocking the removal of cannabis from Schedule I. The report alleges that the methods employed by the DEA to achieve this include: delaying rescheduling petitions for years, overruling DEA administrative law judges, and systematically impeding scientific research. The DEA continues to refuse the removal of cannabis from Schedule I despite wide-scale acceptance of the substance among the medical community, including 76% of doctors, for the treatment of various diseases.

===Domestic anti-drug advocacy===

The DEA, in addition to enforcement, also regularly engage in advocacy, specifically against rescheduling marijuana, by publishing policy-based papers on certain drugs. Some have criticized the DEA for using tax dollars in what they call an attempt to change public opinion, which they call an overreach from the scope of the agency&#x27;s job of enforcement, and that by releasing such non-peer-reviewed reports is a transparent attempt to justify its own activities. They have claimed that since the DEA is not, by law, an advocacy group, but a legal enforcement group, that those press releases are tantamount to what they consider domestic propaganda.

== Raids on medical marijuana dispensaries ==
The DEA has taken a particularly strong stance on enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on persons and organizations acting within state laws that allow medical cannabis cultivation and distribution. DEA agency executive Chuck Rosenberg has made negative statements against patients who use medical marijuana. Rosenberg has mentioned that he considers medical marijuana to be a &quot;joke&quot;. As a reaction against the negative statements made by Rosenberg towards medical marijuana, an international online petition has been formed. More than 159,737 signatures have been gathered globally with the intention that Rosenberg be fired or forced to resign as head of DEA.

&quot;The people of California and the County of Santa Cruz have overwhelmingly supported the provision of medical marijuana for people who have serious illnesses,&quot; county Supervisor Mardi Wormhoudt told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. &quot;These people (blocking the road) are people with AIDS and cancer and other grave illnesses. To attack these people, who work collectively and have never taken money for their work, is outrageous.&quot;

As a result, the Wo/Men&#x27;s Alliance for Medical Marijuana, with the City and County of Santa Cruz, had sued the DEA, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, and the ONDCP. The most recent court decision rejected the government&#x27;s motion to dismiss, which allowed discovery to move forward. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as &quot;a first-of-its-kind ruling.&quot;

More recently, the DEA has escalated its enforcement efforts on the recently proliferated Los Angeles area medical cannabis collectives. On July 25, 2007, the DEA raided the California Patients Group, Hollywood Compassionate Collective, and Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) in Hollywood, California. Earlier that day, the operators of those collectives participated in a press conference with LA City Council members announcing the city&#x27;s intention to regulate the collectives and asking the DEA to halt raids on collectives while the City drafted regulations. The dispensary operator of Natural Hybrid (NHI Caregivers) was forced to close down the collective due to the tremendous loss caused by the DEA conducted joint task force raid against them.

== Project Cassandra ==
In 2008 the Special Operations part of the agency launched a multi-agency effort named Project Cassandra to investigate Hezbollah for allegations of illicit drug trafficking and terrorist financing. The investigation identified an Iranian cell in the U.S. which worked in concert with a Lebanese bank called the Lebanese Canadian Bank to launder money using the purchase of used automobiles exported to Africa. Project Cassandra also identified hemispheric drug syndicates involved in cocaine trafficking in order to finance Hezbollah activities. The Department of Justice issued several sealed indictments but declined to seize, prosecute, extradite, or further investigate likely targets of these alleged foreign criminal activities operating in the United States due to White House diplomatic objectives involving the international nuclear agreement with Iran. On December 22, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of prior cases in the project.

== DEA Museum ==
In 1999, the DEA opened the Drug Enforcement Administration Museum in Arlington County, Virginia. The original permanent exhibit – Illegal Drugs in America: A Modern History – remains the museum&#x27;s centerpiece. The exhibit features &quot;the more than 150 year history of drugs and drug abuse and the DEA,&quot; including a considerable collection of drug paraphernalia and an image of a smiling drug vendor under the heading &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Joint&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The DEA are commonly featured in crime drama films and TV, as both protagonists and antagonists.
* Hank Schrader is one of the main protagonists in AMC&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. He is both a DEA agent (later promoted to ASAC) and brother-in-law to drug kingpin Walter White, unknowingly investigating Walt&#x27;s alter-ego Heisenberg for the duration of the show.
* Javier Peña and Stephen Murphy are two of the main protagonists in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Narcos&quot;. They are responsible for the capture and killing of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar on December 2, 1993, of which the show was based on.
* Norman Stansfield leads a team of corrupt DEA agents, who along with the NYPD, hunt an assassin in the 1994 movie &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;.
* In the film &quot;Sabotage&quot;, a group of special agents with the DEA&#x27;s Special Operations Team, are hunted down after stealing a large amount of cartel cash during a raid.

<doc id="146727" wikidata="Q1459603" url="?curid=146727" title="State of Euphoria">
<text>State of Euphoria is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released on September 19, 1988, through Megaforce/Island Records. The album was the follow-up to the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Among the Living&quot;, and proved to be even more commercially successful, but less critically successful. 

==Background and Music==
&quot;State of Euphoria&quot; was produced by Anthrax and Mark Dodson, with Alex Perialas engineering. Guitarist Scott Ian has been quoted as saying that the band hired Dodson to produce this album because of his work with Judas Priest and Metal Church.

The song &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; is based on the Stephen King novel &quot;Misery&quot;, while &quot;Now It&#x27;s Dark&quot; was inspired by the David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, specifically the behavior of the sexually depraved, self-asphyxiating, murderous sociopath Frank Booth, as played by Dennis Hopper. The song &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot; is critical of Jim and Tammy Fae Bakker and televangelism in general, a popular target of thrash metal bands of that period. The song specifically mentioned minutiae such as the air-conditioned doghouse and Christian amusement park. The majority of the album&#x27;s music was composed by drummer Charlie Benante while lyrics were composed by rhythm guitarist Scott Ian.

The back cover of the album contains a parody picture of the band drawn by Mort Drucker, a caricaturist best known for his artwork in the magazine &quot;Mad&quot;.
==Release==
The album was released on September 19, 1988. It proved to be even more commercially successful than its predecessor, Among the Living, reaching No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in late 1988 and was the first time the band charted in Australia and Canada. It was certified Gold by the RIAA on February 8, 1989. The songs &quot;Who Cares Wins&quot;, dealing with the plight of the homeless, and &quot;Antisocial&quot; (a cover of the song by the French band Trust) were released as singles with accompanying music videos.

==Reception==
Critical reception for the album was lukewarm upon its release. The album failed to live up to the expectations, set by the band&#x27;s previous releases, &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, &quot;Among the Living&quot; and the &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; EP.

Aside from &quot;Be All, End All&quot; and &quot;Antisocial&quot;, most of the songs on &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; have not appeared on the band&#x27;s live setlists since the album&#x27;s accompanying tour in 1988–1989. The only songs from this album that have never been played live at least once are &quot;Schism&quot;, &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot; and &quot;13&quot;. The members of Anthrax have since spoken about their mixed opinions on &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;, and drummer Charlie Benante has been quoted as saying that the band feels the album was not finished properly.

==Touring and promotion==
Anthrax spent nearly a year touring in support of &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band supported Iron Maiden on their Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in Europe, and opened for Ozzy Osbourne on his &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; tour in the United States from November 1988 to January 1989. The band also opened for Metallica on their Damaged Justice tour.

Anthrax continued touring in 1989, playing six shows in the UK with Living Colour in March, and headlining the Headbangers Ball Tour (with support from Helloween and Exodus) in April–May. Following the Headbangers Ball tour, Anthrax toured Europe with Suicidal Tendencies, King&#x27;s X and M.O.D., which took place in June–July 1989.

<doc id="146728" wikidata="Q49896" url="?curid=146728" title="Military dictatorship">
<text>A military dictatorship, or a military regime, is a type of dictatorship in which power is held by one or more military officers. Military dictatorships are led by either a single military dictator, known as a strongman, or by a council of military officers known as a military junta. They are most often formed by military coups or by the empowerment of the military through a popular uprising in times of domestic unrest or instability. The military nominally seeks power to restore order or fight corruption, but the personal motivations of military officers will vary. 

The balance of power in a military dictatorship depends on the dictator&#x27;s ability to maintain the approval of the military through concessions and appeasement while using force to repress opposition. Military strongmen may seek to consolidate power independently of the military, effectively creating personalist dictatorships. Military dictators are under constant threat of removal by their fellow military officers, and counter-coups are common against military regimes that fail to maintain support. Politicization of the military can also cause factionalism, and the military is often willing to give up power voluntarily rather than have the military destabilized. Military dictatorships are less involved in political affairs than other regimes, with their policy mainly directed toward benefiting the military as an institution. Military rule is maintained by force more so than in other regimes, though military dictators often create separate security forces to maintain political control independently from the military.

Early military dictatorships existed in post-classical Asia, including in Korea and Japan. Modern military dictatorship developed in Latin America during the 19th century, and it expanded in Europe during the early-20th century. It saw a resurgence during the Cold War, and new military dictatorships were established in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in the 1960s. The number of military dictatorships then declined over the next two decades, and most of them dissolved at the end of the Cold War. Few military dictatorships exist in the 21st century, and they are nonexistent outside of Africa and Southeast Asia.

== Formation ==
=== Formation process ===

Most military dictatorships are formed after a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; has overthrown the previous government. These coups typically take place when there is a perceived threat to the military or its interests as an institution, including cuts to military funding or civilian interference in military affairs. Military officers have a vested interest in having increased pay and benefits while preventing political intervention in promotions, and failure to address these issues may cause interest in military-led regime change. These coups are most common in the developing world, where a lack of democracy often necessitates such events for changes in leadership.

Not all dictatorships taken through military force are military dictatorships, for in many cases a civilian dictator will take power following a coup and relegate military officers. In other cases, a civilian leader will exceed the powers granted by a constitution with the backing of the military. In some cases, the military is invested with dictatorial powers during a popular uprising. The military is well-equipped to seek and maintain political power, as it is often more modernized than other institutions in a given country, with access to resources and training not available to civil leaders.

A regime can also be formed by an insurgency, or an informal group of militants that attempt to seize power in a government. When insurgents form a dictatorship, they are not constrained by formal military procedures, but their lack of organization can increase the likelihood of opposing factions developing within the group. Insurgencies sometimes grant military titles to their leaders, but they do not adopt the structure of a true military. Regimes created by insurgencies may or may not be recognized as military dictatorships.

Several justifications can be offered by military leadership for seizing power, including improper behavior of the civilian government, a threat of communist takeover, or disorder in politics. These justifications are often given for any formation of military rule, even if the personal motivations of the officers involve greed, ambition, factionalism, or ethnic conflict. An increase of the military budget is a common goal across regimes. As the military is expected to be apolitical, military dictators may consider themselves to be neutral parties who are better fit to maintain stability during times of political crisis. Military rulers will often justify their intervention as a way to protect the people from political repression or as a response to economic failure. In some cases, an active or former military officer will be asked to seize power as a last resort to end the rule of a worse government, though it is not necessarily the case that a military dictatorship brings about the promised improvement and stability.

=== Factors ===
The military&#x27;s purpose in a given country may affect whether it attempts to seize power. International opponents may prompt stronger national defense. This makes the military more willing to comply with a civilian government as the civilian government is likely to provide for the military. When these opponents are neighboring countries that present territorial threats, however, it can weaken democracy and incentivize the creation of a stronger military. Both of these factors increase the likelihood of a military dictatorship. All of these factors are aggravated in countries with significant natural resources, as these provide an additional financial incentive for the military to seize power. Military dictatorships almost universally form in peacetime, with Kemalist Turkey being the only notable exception by 1980. The economic prosperity of a country does not necessarily indicate the likelihood of military dictatorship.

The previous form of government is also a factor in whether a military dictatorship forms. Democracies are most at risk of becoming military dictatorships shortly after their formation. When a new democracy is formed, the government&#x27;s institutions are fragile and civil government may not have established control over the military. This impending civilian control of the military provides further incentive for military officers to seize power in newly-formed democracies. Oligarchies prevent military dictatorships by maintaining an equilibrium, keeping the military strong enough to maintain the oligarchy while providing incentives to encourage loyalty.

The risk assessment process for military officers considering dictatorial rule is distinct from that of other potential dictators. Military officers engaging in a coup face lower risks compared to other attempts to establish dictatorships, as most officers are typically allowed to retain their positions if the dictatorship does not survive. Only the military dictator and the highest ranking officers face significant risk. Instead, officers in professionalized militaries will consider the risk to the military in its entirety rather than their individual risk, as institutional risk is much higher.

Some factors can mitigate the chance of a military dictatorship forming that can be implemented in regions where military dictatorships are common. Constitutional provisions can be enacted to enforce penalties for military officers involved in coups, paramilitaries may be created to act independently of the conventional military, military officers may be given positions in civil government, or the military may be reduced in size and resources. Such measures have had mixed success.

== Stability ==
=== Duration ===
The duration and stability of military dictatorships vary considerably, even within a single region, and military dictatorships are generally less stable than other regimes. The average military dictatorship lasts only five years, and the average military dictator is only in power for three years. Military dictatorships struggle to build civilian bases of support through mass political participation or a partisan apparatus, which limits the ability for a regime to establish a stable long-term government. When military dictators are toppled, they are often succeeded by further military coups and new military dictators seizing power within the same regime. The most immediate threats to military dictators are the military officers that they depend on, making long term stability difficult.

Individual military dictators become more secure as they spend more time in office, as they are able to shift power away from military institutions by creating civilian and paramilitary forces to keep them in check. Dictators that do not create these institutions are removed more quickly. Highly professional militaries with coherence and discipline benefit from sharing power between military officers, while less professional militaries often find it necessary to build support among the civilian government. Less professional militaries are less stable, meaning they are more prone to corruption and factionalism.

=== Causes of dissolution ===

Military dictatorships are unique among regime types in that those in power often do not wish to remain so. Many military officers will choose to end the military&#x27;s involvement in politics if it appears to be having a negative effect on the military&#x27;s cohesion, its legitimacy, or its interests. When politicization leads to factionalism, it can weaken the military&#x27;s hold on power and discourage leaders from further political involvement. Military rulers are more likely to negotiate and relinquish power willingly than other dictators, as no opposing armed group exists to take power by force, and they typically have the option to return to military life. This allows the leadership to preserve the military as an institution rather than risk its destruction in civil conflict. The legitimacy of a military dictatorship is often contingent on the promise to step down once conditions have been established for a civilian government, and resistance can form against a regime that holds power beyond this point. A prosperous military dictatorship will see increasing calls to restore civilian government as the economy improves.

Military dictatorships are most commonly dissolved following a poor performance in the opinion of elites, causing them to revoke their support for the regime. Civilian demonstrations and strikes rarely have a direct effect on military rule, but widespread public opposition creates opportunities for internal division, and military response against civilians can be destabilizing. Civilian use of force through armed insurgency can also destabilize a military dictatorship, although these are rare. Foreign influence is a common means to end military dictatorship, and powerful countries can end a military regime by exerting diplomatic and economic pressure. This commonly takes place when the dictatorship acts to harm the foreign government or engages in widespread human rights abuses. Foreign countries may also resort to military invasion to end the rule of a military dictator.

=== Democratization ===

As authoritarian regimes, military dictatorships depend on the restriction of democracy to retain power. The centralization of power and the restriction of liberties such as freedom of speech and due process prevent democratic institutions from developing. Despite these restrictions, military dictatorships are more likely to democratize than other forms of dictatorship, particularly if power has not consolidated in the hands of a single officer. Public support for democracy is taken more seriously by military dictatorships than in other regimes, and public unrest may prompt a military dictatorship to initiate democratization to avoid the risk of social or economic destabilization. Human development is correlated with a society&#x27;s capacity and desire for democracy. In turn, human development correlates with a military regime&#x27;s willingness to relinquish power. Urbanization and industrialization support the creation of a middle class that is better equipped for civic engagement. Democratization in regions with lower human development often result in joint civilian-military governance.

The implementation of civilian government does not necessarily lead to democracy, as the military may continue to exert influence and rule in tandem with civilian leadership. Following democratization, a civilian government is immediately faced with the issue of military regulation and to establish civilian control of the military. Such policies must be implemented in a way that does not threaten the military or make the government appear unstable so as to avoid provoking further military intervention. The militarization of police can create long term stability issues after democratization, as military and civilian policing are not immediately compatible. The abolition of military police creates separate issues as it effectively creates mass unemployment of individuals trained in violence. Democracies borne from military dictatorships typically have higher homicide rates than those of other democracies.

== Structure ==
=== Government positions ===

The organization of power in a military dictatorship is heavily influenced by the chain of command used in militaries. In military dictatorships with a single ruler, the dictator is typically the highest ranking officer among those involved in a coup, and the hierarchical structure of a military lends itself to efficient control in a dictatorship led by military officers. The military dictator often holds strong control over the regional leaders that they appoint, as they are subject to the dictator&#x27;s orders under the chain of command. Junior officers sometimes take power through a military coup, particularly when factionalism has broken down the traditional command structure, and most coups led by junior officers defer to senior officers after seizing power. 

The inner circle that carries out the dictator&#x27;s orders in a military dictatorship is made up of other military officers. These officers are responsible for representing the forces under their command in the government and maintaining their loyalty to the regime. Military dictators are often limited in choosing their inner circle, as they are expected to comply with standard procedure for military promotion. As these officers have control over large numbers of soldiers and weapons, dictators have strong incentive to appease them, and they can serve as a constraining force on the dictator. In some cases, military officers may be pressured to retire from the military upon taking power as a check on their ability to control military promotions and postings while ruling as dictator. Because of the political influence of soldiers and officers, policy in a military dictatorship heavily favors the military, often through increased military spending and other benefits for enlisted members.

Civilians are subject to the decisions of military leadership, typically without any role in decision making, and force is used to ensure compliance. Civilian presence in the government is sometimes used to create legitimacy, but this varies between regimes. The military may rule through a civilian government, or there may be no civilian presence in the government at all. Military dictators may also attempt to shift power toward a civilian or party-controlled government over which they have more personal control. A stable civilian bureaucracy is necessary for long term success of a military dictatorship, as military officers often lack the political skills necessary to maintain a government. Civilians with expertise in a given area might be tasked with making political decisions, but this power can be revoked at any time by the military leadership. Some military dictatorships appoint representatives that nominally serve as the civilian voice in government, but these individuals are selected by the military without any input from the people.

=== Classification ===

Different definitions and criteria may be used to determine whether a government can be described as a military dictatorship. Some scholars may classify any authoritarian regime led by a military officer as a military dictatorship. Stricter definitions may require certain standards of the military as a professionalized institution or that the dictator is accountable to the military. Some dictatorships may blend elements of different classifications, allowing for military dictatorships to also be personalist or one-party dictatorships. Subtypes of military dictatorship include military juntas, in which power is shared by several military officers at the highest level, and military strongmen, in which power is held by a single military dictator without meaningful influence from the military as an institution.

A military junta is a type of leadership structure in a military dictatorship in which a committee of military officers rules in unison. The junta typically includes the leader of each branch of the military and sometimes the state police. Many juntas present themselves as restorers of peace, adopting titles such as &quot;Committee of National Restoration&quot;, or &quot;National Liberation Committee&quot;. Juntas frequently appoint one member as the head, effectively making that person the dictator. Officers working alongside this dictator wield considerable political power, and the dictator will often be subject to removal by fellow junta members. The military structure provides stability for such a government, as officers have effective control over their subordinates and can bargain on their behalf. Factionalism can threaten the junta structure, as it incentivizes lower-ranked officers to change their loyalties. As power is not consolidated under a single person, military juntas are subject to political backlash and have to consider the political preferences of their constituents. Unlike democracies, the constituents under a military junta are the junior officers rather than the citizenry.

Strongmen are dictators that rule as both military dictators and personalist dictators. They seize power and rule through the military, but they do not meaningfully share their power with other officers, instead ruling unilaterally. These dictatorships become increasingly personalist as the ruler consolidates power and subjugates rivals, eventually culminating in cults of personality. Other military officers may hold positions in the government, but they have no power to restrain the dictator or influence policy decisions. A military dictator becomes a strongman by securing control of state security forces, allowing the dictator to coerce other officers. Military dictators that seek to personalize their rule must bypass the higher-ranked officers that make up the inner circle, negotiating with the lower-ranked officers directly. Achieving direct control over the military also allows the dictator to appoint loyalists to important positions while excluding competitors. Military officers might demand that the dictator give up their military rank upon taking power for this reason.

== Politics ==
Military dictatorships vary greatly in how they function, what ideologies they proclaim, and what policies they enforce. The level of direct military involvement in governance depends on how the military institution is structured. In some cases, the military may be unable to have its interests heard, depending on how integrated the military is with state actors and whether power is divided among military officers. Similar to absolute monarchies, military dictatorships traditionally adhere to a classical conception of authoritarianism that rejects partisan politics and allows other institutions, such as churches, to exist and hold power. This is contrasted with totalitarianism, which engages in control of all ideological and social elements within the dictatorship. Military dictatorships have a comparatively low tolerance for political activity of any sort, and they rarely construct any form of political apparatus or party system to organize the government. Instead, military regimes will maintain power through political repression. Outside of the political sphere, the regime often does not significantly affect the day-to-day life of citizens.

Military dictatorships rarely see economic prosperity. Poor economic performance is dangerous to a military regime, as it affects the regime&#x27;s legitimacy and may even encourage the military to give up power. On rare occasions when they do see economic success, it can result in the creation of a middle class. This shifts the political dynamic of the regime as the middle class demands more involvement in government. Military dictatorship is distinct from oligarchy, and regimes do not necessarily serve the interests of the upper class as other forms of dictatorship often do. The economic policies of military regimes can diverge significantly, including both pro-capitalist and anti-capitalist regimes. The military generally has the power to redistribute wealth as it sees fit. Accordingly, the military will receive more funding while it is in power. Military regimes are better equipped for budget-maximization than other regimes, as the military is a close group and does not have to share wealth with an expanding bureaucracy. The extent that military riches will increase depends on whether officers prioritize self-enrichment or preserving political power. While in power, the military must ensure its members receive enough spoils to keep them satisfied without giving so much that it destabilizes the government.

Many dictators have chosen to emphasize their strength by incorporating military tradition into their personal styles. This may include adopting military ranks in their formal titles and wearing military uniforms. While common among military dictators, these strategies have also been used by civilian dictators. Other military dictators have avoided demonstrating their allegiance to the military by dressing in civilian clothes and removing their military ranks so as to invoke the legitimacy of a civilian government. Militarism among dictators has become less common in the 21st century as dictators have emphasized public approval over ruling through fear.

=== Policy development and implementation ===
Military dictatorships may rule directly, implementing a specific ideology and vision, or they may rule as arbitrators that see themselves as protectors of the nation and the government. These arbitrator dictatorships tend only to last until civilian government can be restored, while direct rulers seek to consolidate their own power and reject civilian rule as inferior. Policies of a military dictatorship are made through decree from military leadership and enforced by the military in its entirety, sometimes without warning or advance notice. As members of the military are typically concerned with the preservation of the military, internal divisions are often seen as a greater threat than external forces.

Policy goals in a military dictatorship are rarely organized, preventing a regime from implementing policies and programs with a clear objective. Policy preferences of military dictatorships primarily diverge from other forms of dictatorship in their approach to war and political opposition. Military regimes are generally independent from special interests and have no allegiance to any particular social class, as the military is its own institution with competing interests among its members. Military dictators have no unifying ideology, and they may enforce left-wing politics or right-wing politics. Though approximately half of dictatorships hold unfair elections to consolidate power, military dictatorships are less likely to do so, with less than one quarter of military dictatorships holding elections.

Military training emphasizes unity and cohesiveness, and these ideas are reinforced by coordinated action through training and military operations. Factionalism is subject to increase when militaries are not actively engaged in these behaviors and do not have a clear objective. Factions that form among elites within military dictatorships are less likely to have an ideological basis, as military officers are more likely to be aligned in policy preferences and to prioritize military unity, allowing for more efficient implementation of policy. Factionalism affects most military dictatorships, particularly if the regime fails to perform adequately in the eyes of its elites.

=== Use of force ===

Relative to other dictatorships, military regimes rely disproportionately on force in international relations. The individuals running a military dictatorship are more experienced in military means than political or diplomatic means, and a lifelong career in the military leads to a military mindset among its leadership. Military officers are more inclined to view foreign relations as confrontational rather than diplomatic for the same reason. Military activity is seen as routine, and military dictators are less likely to ascribe high cost to the use of military force. This is particularly true of military juntas, where the military mindset of junior officers compounds this effect by applying increased political pressure. Conversely, diplomacy is seen as higher cost as it may strengthen civilian control of the military. Military dictators are also more skeptical of the idea that diplomacy can maintain peace and security, and they often see foreign nations as threats, even if they are nominally allies. The limited capacity for diplomacy means that a military dictatorship might engage in a preemptive war if conflict seems likely. Threats issued by military dictatorships are generally seen as more credible than those of other regimes, and they are less likely to escalate into conflict.

Military dictatorships may be challenged by inefficient police forces, as the military structure must be repurposed for internal suppression and soldiers are often unwilling to fight unarmed civilians. Officers may also be reluctant to engage in domestic operations. Paramilitary forces and civilian police forces are created under military dictatorships to supplement the military for these reasons. Human rights violations and state-sanctioned atrocities in military dictatorships are often carried out by these non-military security forces rather than by the military itself. Military dictatorships have been found to engage in torture more frequently than other regimes.

Despite the heavy influence of military tradition, military dictatorships are not necessarily more militaristic or more prone to external conflict. The use of military force internally restricts the ability to project it externally, and vice versa. As military dictatorships depend on internal use of the military, they are less capable of maintaining combat readiness for conflicts with other countries. The use of the military as an oppressive force reduces civilian support for militarism, resulting in fewer willing enlistments and less war effort collaboration between civilians and the military during times of conflict. The politicization of the military introduces further weakness into the military as a means of projecting power, as political conflict between officers comes at the expense of the soldiers under their command. At the same time, these factors increase the risk of civil conflict relative to other forms of government.

== History ==
=== Early military dictatorships ===

The rule of warlords that seized power over the central government in ancient China have been described as early military dictatorships. These include Dong Zhuo in the 2nd century and Cao Cao in the 3rd century. Korea underwent military dictatorships in the post-classical era. The Goguryeo kingdom fell under the control of military leader Yeon Gaesomun in 642. Yeon took absolute power after having the monarch killed and having another member of the royal family placed on the throne as a figurehead. Another military dictatorship developed in Korea in 1170 when the military officers of the Goryeo dynasty revolted against the expansion of civil service at the expense of the military. The monarch was again replaced with a relative to serve as a figurehead, and a series of military officers ruled over the Goryeo military regime as they sought to undermine and seize power from one another. Power was consolidated by Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;ung-hŏn through a coup in 1196, and his descendants ruled until 1258.

Japan was ruled by a series of military rulers called shoguns, beginning with the formation of the Kamakura shogunate in 1185. While shoguns nominally operated under the Emperor of Japan, they served as &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Japan and the Japanese military. Japan was ruled by shoguns until the Meiji Restoration that brought about the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868. During the Lê dynasty of Vietnam between the 16th and 18th centuries, the country was under &quot;de facto&quot; military rule by two rival military families, the Trịnh lords in the north and the Nguyễn lords in the south, in a form of government that resembled military dictatorship.

The Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell has been described as a military dictatorship by its contemporary opponents and by some modern academics. This government was formed by Cromwell while he was a general in 1649, and his rule was effectively maintained by the military until the Humble Petition and Advice recognized him as a constitutional ruler in 1657. The direct influence held by the military varied throughout Cromwell&#x27;s rule.

=== 19th century and World Wars ===

Latin America was the only region of the world where military dictatorships were common in the 19th century. The Spanish American wars of independence took place in the early-19th century, creating new Latin American governments. Many of these governments fell under the control of &quot;caudillos&quot;, or personalist dictators. Most &quot;caudillos&quot; came from a military background, and their rule was typically associated with pageantry and glamor. Most &quot;caudillos&quot; were nominally constrained by a constitution but had the power to draft a new constitution as they wished. Dictatorships in Latin America persisted into the 20th century, and further military coups established new regimes, often in the name of nationalism. By the 1930s, several Latin American militaries had modernized and integrated themselves into civil society.

Several military dictatorships developed in Eastern Europe after World War I. The rule of Józef Piłsudski in Poland developed in the style of a Latin American dictatorship with a violent military coup, but it became significantly more militant than other military dictatorships due to the perceived threat from the surrounding great powers. Romania became a military dictatorship when power was willingly transferred to the military by Carol II of Romania, establishing Ion Antonescu as a dictator styled as a &quot;Conducător&quot;. Spain became a military dictatorship in 1923. Portugal became a military dictatorship in 1926, lasting until it was replaced by the personalist rule of Antonio Salazar in 1932.

Japan gradually moved toward military rule in the 1930s and 1940s, taking the form of a junta as military officers gained influence amid rising militarism. This period in Japanese history saw power struggles between civilian and military officials, culminating in the appointment of General Hideki Tojo as prime minister in 1941.

=== Postwar military dictatorships ===
Widespread attention to military dictatorship as a form of government developed in the 1960s as militaries seized power in several countries, particularly in South America. Early study focused extensively on what caused military dictatorships. The Cold War caused a surge in military dictatorships, as both the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc tolerated military regimes that promised stability, and both supported regime change against those that did not.

A global reversal of military dictatorships began in the 1970s and 1980s when militaries increasingly gave up power in favor of civilian rule. The system of tolerating military dictatorship ended following the fall of the Eastern Bloc at the end of the Cold War, and the Western Bloc had wider latitude to challenge authoritarianism in military regimes. Since then, the global community has taken a stronger stance against military dictatorships and other forms of undemocratic government. Military coups are virtually nonexistent outside of Africa in the 21st century, with Myanmar being the only exception between 2017 and 2022.

==== Africa ====
Military dictatorships were one of the two regime types that became common in Africa after decolonization in the 1960s through the 1980s, alongside one-party states. At the time of decolonization, no meaningful institutions or national identity existed to maintain democracy or economic growth. Due to the colonial history of African nations and the higher frequency of civil conflict rather than external conflict, militaries in sub-Saharan Africa struggled to develop as institutions, allowing military strongmen to consolidate power more easily. Military oppression had been a common occurrence under colonial rule, and military institutions in Africa were already predisposed to internal control. Several African military dictators, such as Hamani Diori of Niger, Jean-Bédel Bokassa of the Central African Republic, and Idi Amin of Uganda, were at one point involved with colonial militaries. Ethnic conflict has also prompted military officers to carry out regime change, particularly among post-colonial nations where the military and the civilian government had different ethnic makeups.

Between 1959 and 2001, 14 African countries experienced at least three successful military coups. Nigeria was particularly affected, with six military dictators between two separate regimes. The military dictatorship in Nigeria was one of the most prominent in Africa, forming shortly after independence and persisting for most of the century thereafter. By 1975, half of African countries were subject to military rule. Many African militaries traditionally saw themselves as guardians that oversaw the nation, intervening when civilian government exerted authority over the military. Other military dictatorships in Africa sought power simply to provide advantages for its members and its political interests. African military dictators often seized power citing a failure of civilian government, banning all political activity and suspending the constitution. In many cases, former military dictators in Africa later sought election as civilian rulers. Several African military dictators nominally adopted socialist messaging to gain support from neighboring one-party socialist dictatorships.

Public rejection of military dictatorship in Africa significantly increased in the 1980s as pro-democracy protests took place across the continent. Democratization of military dictatorships became more common by 1995, when approximately half of the countries in Africa were democracies. Several of the surviving military dictatorships in Africa also enacted measures to increase citizen participation in local governance. Instances of military dictatorships challenging democracy continued, however, with several military governments cancelling elections and overthrowing democratic governments in the 1990s. As of 2023, Africa is the only continent that sees regular military coups.

==== Arab world ====

In the Arab world, several countries, including Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, experienced numerous military coups during 1950s and 1960s. In Syria, the 1963 coup by the Ba&#x27;athist military committee was followed by a series of coups and counter-coup attempts by rival Ba&#x27;athist factions. The intra-Ba&#x27;athist power struggle persisted until the 1970 coup, when General Hafez al-Assad gained undisputed control of the Syrian military and the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party. Subsequently, he consolidated power by constructing a surveillance state characterized by intense militarism. A similar military dictatorship was also established in Libya under Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s rule during the 1970s.

Military coups have since been infrequent in the Arab world with the exception of Iraq. Following the 1990 Yemeni unification, the Yemen again divided between supporters of military rule and a one-party secessionist state until the military-ruled Yemen Arab Republic seized control of the entire nation in the Yemeni Civil War of 1994. Military coups have since been infrequent in the Middle East with the exceptions of Iraq and Turkey.

In the 21st century, Egypt was placed under temporary military dictatorship following the 2011 Egyptian revolution and again after the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état. Sudan shifted from a personalist dictatorship to a military dictatorship following the 2019 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état.

==== East and Southeast Asia ====
South Korea became a military dictatorship after the May 16 coup in 1961, following years of military buildup and political involvement. The military organized the Democratic Republican Party to hold political power after nominally returning to civilian government in 1963. A series of military dictators ruled until democratization in 1987, though the military remained influential in politics thereafter.

Indonesia underwent a long military dictatorship under the New Order of Suharto from 1966 to 1998. This dictatorship introduced some liberal reforms and saw relative stability until unrest caused by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. 

Myanmar has become an exception among military dictatorships for its long military rule, and it has been recognized as &quot;the most durable military regime worldwide&quot;. The military first seized power from 1958 to 1960 and again from 1962 to 2011, then maintaining indirect rule before seizing control a third time in 2021. 
Neighboring Thailand has seen a similar trend, where the military has ruled directly or indirectly for most years since 1932, with only four civilian governments being formed between 1932 and 2011.

==== Europe ====
In 1967, the military of Greece seized power with the stated intention of ending corruption and demagoguery. The Greek junta ruled until 1974, at which point a political crisis prompted by the Cyprus problem convinced the military to return power to the previous civilian government. In 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland became first secretary of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party, the ruling party of Poland&#x27;s one-party dictatorship. Two months later, he proclaimed martial law, putting the country under military rule and replacing a one-party dictatorship with a military dictatorship. Martial law ended in 1983, but Jaruzelski retained political power.

==== Latin America ====
Military dictatorship surged in Latin America during the 1960s, with unstable economic conditions allowing military juntas to take power. Between 1967 and 1991, 12 Latin American countries underwent at least one military coup, with Haiti and Honduras experiencing three and Bolivia experiencing eight. A large wave of military dictatorships occurred in the 1970s, and most of Latin America was under the rule of military dictatorships by the middle of the decade. Foreign aid to support Latin American militaries was one factor that allowed further military coups, and the political polarization of the Cold War played a role in creating the political instability that incentivized military rule.

Argentina was particularly susceptible to military dictatorship during the Cold War, with ten separate military dictators ruling across four different regimes between 1943 and 1983. Brazil and Guatemala also saw five and six separate military dictators, respectively. The military dictatorship in Brazil was unique both in that it lasted nearly 20 years and that it allowed elections with competing political parties. El Salvador became a dictatorship in 1931, becoming a rare example of a partisan military dictatorship. The country was ruled by the military-run National Pro Patria Party from 1933 to 1944, the Revolutionary Party of Democratic Unification from 1950 to 1960, and the National Conciliation Party from 1962 to 1979.

Reactionary military dictatorships were common in Latin America during the Cold War. These were regimes in which dictators maintained support among the middle class and upper class by implementing economic reforms and strengthening the dictatorship&#x27;s stance in international economics. This included nations such as Chile under Augusto Pinochet. 17 of 20 countries in Latin America experienced reactionary military dictatorship at some point between World War II and the end of the Cold War. Some reformist military dictatorships also existed at this time, maintaining popular support by appealing to labor groups and the working class.

Foreign pressure, particularly from the Carter administration in the United States, prompted the end of several military dictatorships in the region in the late 1970s. Several Latin American countries began to democratize by the early-1980s, and the number of coups declined as well. Military dictatorship had virtually disappeared in Latin America by the end of the Cold War. The Argentine &quot;Carapintadas&quot; were unable to seize power in 1990 because there was strong public opposition to military rule. By the time of the 2009 Honduran coup, such events were considered unusual in the region.

==== South Asia ====
Following a 1977 military coup, General Zia-ul-Haq governed Pakistan as a military dictatorship, in which the military was also incorporated into civil government.

<text>A paramilitary is a military that is not a part of a country&#x27;s official or legitimate armed forces. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the use of the term &quot;paramilitary&quot; as far back as 1934.

== Overview ==
Though a paramilitary is, by definition, not a military, it is usually equivalent to a light infantry or special forces in terms of strength, firepower, and organizational structure. Paramilitaries use combat-capable kit/equipment (such as internal security/SWAT vehicles), or even actual military equipment (such as long guns and armored personnel carriers; usually military surplus resources), skills (such as battlefield medicine and bomb disposal), and tactics (such as urban warfare and close-quarters combat) that are compatible with their purpose, often combining them with skills from other relevant fields such as law enforcement, coast guard, or search and rescue. A paramilitary may fall under the command of a military, train alongside them, or have permission to use their resources, despite not actually being part of them.

== Legality ==
Under the law of war, a state may incorporate a paramilitary organization or armed agency (such as a law enforcement agency or a private volunteer militia) into its combatant armed forces. Some countries&#x27; constitutions prohibit paramilitary organizations outside government use.

== Types ==

Depending on the definition adopted, &quot;paramilitaries&quot; may include:

=== Military organizations ===
* The auxiliary forces of a state&#x27;s military or government, military reserve forces, such as national guard, presidential guard, republican guard, state defense force, home guard, civil guard, imperial guard, and royal guard forces
* Private military contractors and mercenaries
* Irregular military forces, such as militias, partisans, resistance movements, freedom fighters, rebel groups, liberation armies, guerrilla armies, militants, insurgents, and terrorist groups.

=== Law enforcement ===
* Semi-militarized law enforcement units within civilian police, such as police tactical units, SWAT, Emergency Service Units, and incident response teams
* Gendarmeries, such as the French National Gendarmerie, Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police, Dutch Royal Marechaussee, Egyptian Central Security Forces, European EUROGENDFOR, Turkic TAKM, and Chilean Carabineros de Chile
* Border guards, such as the Australian Border Force, Indian Border Security Force, Bangladeshi Border Guard Bangladesh, and Turkish village guards
* Security forces of ambiguous military status, such as internal troops, railroad guard corps, and railway troops
* Branches of government agencies such as intelligence agencies tasked with law enforcement, tactical support, or security operations, such as the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Special Activities Center and Global Response Staff, or the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Federal Protective Forces

=== Civil defense ===
* Lithuanian Riflemen&#x27;s Union
* Chinese Militia

=== Political ===
* Armed, semi-militarized wings of political parties and similar political organizations.

<doc id="146731" wikidata="Q1339948" url="?curid=146731" title="Persistence of Time">
<text>Persistence of Time is the fifth studio album by the American thrash metal band Anthrax. It was released on August 21, 1990, through Megaforce Worldwide/Island Records and was nominated in 1991 for a Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category.

The album included the singles, &quot;Got the Time&quot; (a Joe Jackson cover) and &quot;In My World&quot; (which was performed by the band on the &quot;Married... with Children&quot; episode, &quot;My Dinner with Anthrax&quot;). &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; was the last full Anthrax album to feature vocalist Joey Belladonna until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Worship Music&quot;.

==Album information==
Anthrax returned to the studio in the fall of 1989 with Mark Dodson (who produced the previous album, &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;) to start work on their fifth album. Recording of the album was difficult, with a large structure fire causing the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their rehearsal studio on January 24, 1990. Following this disaster, the band moved to a different studio in late February of that year to finish work on the album.

The album&#x27;s tone is decidedly more contemplative and mature than the bulk of Anthrax&#x27;s previous work. Abandoning the humor and comic book references which were common on their previous albums, the lyrical focus of &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; is the need for tolerance and peace. Reaction to &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; was mixed, with critics and fans alternately panning and praising this darker sound. The band also introduced a progressive side of the music which had not been present in their earlier work, while also placing a reduced emphasis on typical thrash metal elements such as fast tempo and aggression.

This is the last full studio album to feature Joey Belladonna on vocals before John Bush took over vocal duties. Belladonna appeared on several songs on the 1991 EP &quot;Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s&quot; before splitting acrimoniously from the band in 1992. He returned to the band in June 2010 to record the album &quot;Worship Music&quot;, which was released in 2011.

The introduction to the album&#x27;s sixth track &quot;Intro to Reality&quot; featured dialogue from an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; called &quot;Deaths-Head Revisited&quot;. &quot;Keep It in the Family&quot;, &quot;In My World&quot;, and &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot; were later re-recorded with the John Bush/Rob Caggiano line-up for the album &quot;The Greater of Two Evils&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Persistence of Time&#x27;s&quot; highest position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart was No. 24. It was certified gold by the RIAA on January 17, 1991.

Steve Huey of AllMusic gave the album a favorable review, saying that it &quot;rivals &quot;Among the Living&quot; as Anthrax&#x27;s best album&quot;. &quot;The more cartoonish side of the band&quot; is substituted by a &quot;dark, uncompromising examination of society&#x27;s dirty underbelly&quot;, which makes &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; &quot;their most lyrically consistent album&quot;. Kim Neely of the American magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; underlines the social tone of the lyrics and describes &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; as &quot;a foray into the dreary, gray bowels of urban hell&quot;, praising singer Joey Belladonna for &quot;railing against every societal ill known to city-bred man&quot;. He concludes saying that the album &quot;ain&#x27;t the most uplifting thing to listen to, but it&#x27;s real.&quot; A similar concept was explained by a review by &quot;The New York Times&quot; of November 18, 1990, which said that &quot;the music carries the exhilaration of a desperate struggle.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the &quot;admirable Prong/Pantera/Metallica &#x27;90s minimalism at work here&quot;, but found &quot;the overall effect just so dense and relentless that it just wears you out by hangover&#x27;s end.&quot; &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked the album #25 on their list &quot;Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 90&#x27;s&quot;.

<doc id="146732" wikidata="Q2476796" url="?curid=146732" title="Attack of the Killer B's">
<text>Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s is a compilation album of B-sides, covers and rarities by the thrash metal band Anthrax and the band&#x27;s last audio album released before vocalist John Bush replaced longtime Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna in 1992. The album was released in June 1991 by Megaforce Worldwide/Island Entertainment. The &quot;B&#x27;s&quot; in the album&#x27;s title refers to b-sides previously unreleased and compiled for a single release. In 1992 the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Metal Performance.

==Album information==
Though a collection of &quot;B-sides&quot;, the album featured one of their biggest singles; a collaboration/cover of Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;. &quot;Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA. The two live tracks, &quot;Keep It in the Family&quot; and &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;, were recorded during the 1990–91 &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; tour. Also included is an updated version of their 1987 single, &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;, and three songs previously released only in Europe and Japan on the 1989 EP, &quot;Penikufesin&quot; (&quot;Nise Fukin EP&quot;), recorded during the &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; sessions.

Two versions of the album were released: the uncensored version contained full expletives and the song &quot;Startin&#x27; Up a Posse&quot;, and the censored version which excluded the aforementioned track, and in place of the explicit words, a buzzing noise (like bees) is heard. The track &quot;Startin&#x27; Up a Posse&quot; is a tongue in cheek attack on the Parents Music Resource Center. The sample at the end of the track was taken from the final scene of the Marilyn Chambers movie &quot;Insatiable&quot;. The compilation also includes covers of songs by Discharge, Kiss, Trust, and the surf rock staple &quot;Pipeline&quot;, recorded by The Chantays.

The song &quot;N.F.B. (Dallabnikufesin)&quot; was intended to illustrate the band&#x27;s disdain for power ballads, which were very fashionable in the commercial metal scene at the time, and parodies 80s glam metal power ballads. The band also covers two songs (&quot;Milk (Ode to Billy)&quot; and &quot;Chromatic Death&quot;) originally recorded by Stormtroopers of Death, a mid-80s side project by Anthrax members Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, and then-bassist Dan Lilker. The &quot;Billy&quot; referenced in the title is S.O.D. vocalist Billy Milano.

&quot;Bring the Noise&quot; is a collaboration with rap group Public Enemy, making this song one of the first rap metal collaborations (albeit some years after the Aerosmith/Run DMC 1986 collaboration on &quot;Walk This Way&quot;), although Joey Belladonna and Dan Spitz had collaborated with Untouchable Force Organization on a song called &quot;Lethal&quot; in 1987 that was released as a single. &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; has been a live staple since Anthrax first played it on the Headbangers Ball Tour with Helloween and Exodus in 1989, and it later appeared in the videogames &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;.

<doc id="146736" wikidata="Q1268734" url="?curid=146736" title="Sound of White Noise">
<text>Sound of White Noise is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax, released in May 1993 by Elektra Records. It is the band&#x27;s first album to feature vocalist John Bush, who replaced longtime frontman Joey Belladonna in 1992, and the last studio album with longtime lead guitarist Dan Spitz. It was also the second album Bush worked on with producer Dave Jerden.

==Overview==
The album, produced by the band and Dave Jerden, includes the singles &quot;Only&quot;, &quot;Room for One More&quot;, &quot;Black Lodge&quot; and &quot;Hy Pro Glo&quot;. This album marked a significant revision in the band&#x27;s sound, with the departure of lead vocalist Joey Belladonna and the introduction of grunge influences. Jerden was known for producing the likes of Alice in Chains and Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

With &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;, Anthrax moved away from the rapid-fire thrash metal that had defined their earlier output. Their new sound drew on the more straightforward style of Armored Saint (Bush co-wrote all the songs) and often emphasized more melodic songwriting. &quot;White Noise&quot; continued the trend started on 1990&#x27;s &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; of abandoning the humor of Anthrax&#x27;s 1980s albums in favor of a more serious or earnest tone. Songs like the walloping &quot;Only&quot; and stuttering, stop-start dynamics of &quot;Hy Pro Glo&quot; maintained a level of aggression on par with anything else the band recorded, but in a different alternative metal style. Other songs found Anthrax exploring new territory, like the mid-tempo &quot;Room for One More&quot;, and the atmospheric &quot;Black Lodge&quot; (inspired by the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; TV series and featuring keyboardist Angelo Badalamenti). Bush&#x27;s lower-pitched, darker vocal style also was a drastic change from Belladona&#x27;s. During the recording of the album, the band also produced the songs &quot;Poison My Eyes&quot; and a cover of the Smiths song &quot;London&quot; (both would be featured on the soundtracks to the movies &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and &quot;Airheads&quot;, respectively).

==Reception==
Dave Connolly reviewed the album on behalf of AllMusic and called it &quot;surprisingly melodic&quot; but &quot;predictably pummeling&quot; and the music &quot;relentless&quot;. He commends the overall quality of the songs on the album before settling on &quot;Only&quot; as the best overall, but calls out several other tracks for praise as well. Rock journalist Martin Popoff praised the performance of new singer John Bush and the production by Dave Jerden and defined the album&#x27;s music &quot;top-flight, state-of-the-art metal, fortified by the band&#x27;s usual societal concerns, here elevated to eloquent outrage at man&#x27;s crumbling morality.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; critic John Wiederhorn described the album as &quot;a good typical heavy-metal record.&quot; Nevertheless, he also noted that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t wander beyond the sound of its dark, moody intros and tuneful, galloping rhythms.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;a powerful comeback from a group that never went away.&quot;

Among the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Only&quot; has received particular attention; Metallica frontman James Hetfield is said to have referred to &quot;Only&quot; as a &quot;perfect song&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, selling 62,000 copies in its first week. It is Anthrax&#x27;s highest ever chart position. It sold 40,000 more copies in its second week. &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on July 13, 1993.

As of 2002, the album had sold 511,284 copies in the US.

The singles &quot;Only&quot; and &quot;Black Lodge&quot; charted at No. 26 and No. 38 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In the UK, &quot;Only&quot; and &quot;Black Lodge&quot; charted at No. 36 and No. 53 respectively.

<text>In finance and economics, interest is payment from a debtor or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay to the lender or some third party. It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.

For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower.

Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. (Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.)

The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage).

Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number &quot;e&quot;. In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.

==History==
Credit is thought to have preceded the existence of coinage by several thousands of years. The first recorded instance of credit is a collection of old Sumerian documents from 3000 BC that show systematic use of credit to loan both grain and metals. The rise of interest as a concept is unknown, though its use in Sumeria argue that it was well established as a concept by 3000BC if not earlier, with historians believing that the concept in its modern sense may have arisen from the lease of animal or seeds for productive purposes. The argument that acquired seeds and animals could reproduce themselves was used to justify interest, but ancient Jewish religious prohibitions against usury (נשך &quot;NeSheKh&quot;) represented a &quot;different view&quot;.

The first written evidence of compound interest dates roughly 2400 BC. The annual interest rate was roughly 20%. Compound interest was necessary for the development of agriculture and important for urbanization. 

While the traditional Middle Eastern views on interest were the result of the urbanized, economically developed character of the societies that produced them, the new Jewish prohibition on interest showed a pastoral, tribal influence. In the early 2nd millennium BC, since silver used in exchange for livestock or grain could not multiply of its own, the Laws of Eshnunna instituted a legal interest rate, specifically on deposits of dowry. Early Muslims called this &quot;riba&quot;, translated today as the charging of interest.

The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury which was defined as lending on interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% AER). Ninth-century ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity. Catholic Church opposition to interest hardened in the era of the Scholastics, when even defending it was considered a heresy. St. Thomas Aquinas, the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued that the charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to &quot;double charging&quot;, charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.

In the medieval economy, loans were entirely a consequence of necessity (bad harvests, fire in a workplace) and, under those conditions, it was considered morally reproachable to charge interest. It was also considered morally dubious, since no goods were produced through the lending of money, and thus it should not be compensated, unlike other activities with direct physical output such as blacksmithing or farming. For the same reason, interest has often been looked down upon in Islamic civilization, with almost all scholars agreeing that the Qur&#x27;an explicitly forbids charging interest.

Medieval jurists developed several financial instruments to encourage responsible lending and circumvent prohibitions on usury, such as the Contractum trinius.
In the Renaissance era, greater mobility of people facilitated an increase in commerce and the appearance of appropriate conditions for entrepreneurs to start new, lucrative businesses. Given that borrowed money was no longer strictly for consumption but for production as well, interest was no longer viewed in the same manner.

The first attempt to control interest rates through manipulation of the money supply was made by the Banque de France in 1847.

===Islamic finance===

The latter half of the 20th century saw the rise of interest-free Islamic banking and finance, a movement that applies Islamic law to financial institutions and the economy. Some countries, including Iran, Sudan, and Pakistan, have taken steps to eradicate interest from their financial systems. Rather than charging interest, the interest-free lender shares the risk by investing as a partner in profit loss sharing scheme, because predetermined loan repayment as interest is prohibited, as well as making money out of money is unacceptable. All financial transactions must be asset-backed and must not charge any interest or fee for the service of lending.

===In the history of mathematics===
It is thought that Jacob Bernoulli discovered the mathematical constant e by studying a question about compound interest. He realized that if an account that starts with $1.00 and pays say 100% interest per year, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00×1.52 = $2.25.

Bernoulli noticed that if the frequency of compounding is increased without limit, this sequence can be modeled as follows:

: formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of times the interest is to be compounded in a year.

==Economics==
In economics, the rate of interest is the price of credit, and it plays the role of the cost of capital. In a free market economy, interest rates are subject to the law of supply and demand of the money supply, and one explanation of the tendency of interest rates to be generally greater than zero is the scarcity of loanable funds.

Over centuries, various schools of thought have developed explanations of interest and interest rates. The School of Salamanca justified paying interest in terms of the benefit to the borrower, and interest received by the lender in terms of a premium for the risk of default. In the sixteenth century, Martín de Azpilcueta applied a time preference argument: it is preferable to receive a given good now rather than in the future. Accordingly, interest is compensation for the time the lender forgoes the benefit of spending the money.

On the question of why interest rates are normally greater than zero, in 1770, French economist Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune proposed the theory of fructification. By applying an opportunity cost argument, comparing the loan rate with the rate of return on agricultural land, and a mathematical argument, applying the formula for the value of a perpetuity to a plantation, he argued that the land value would rise without limit, as the interest rate approached zero. For the land value to remain positive and finite keeps the interest rate above zero.

Adam Smith, Carl Menger, and Frédéric Bastiat also propounded theories of interest rates. In the late 19th century, Swedish economist Knut Wicksell in his 1898 &quot;Interest and Prices&quot; elaborated a comprehensive theory of economic crises based upon a distinction between natural and nominal interest rates. In the 1930s, Wicksell&#x27;s approach was refined by Bertil Ohlin and Dennis Robertson and became known as the loanable funds theory. Other notable interest rate theories of the period are those of Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes.

==Calculation==
===Simple interest===

Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, or on that portion of the principal amount that remains. It excludes the effect of compounding. Simple interest can be applied over a time period other than a year, for example, every month.

Simple interest is calculated according to the following formula:

:formula_2

where 
:&quot;r&quot; is the simple annual interest rate
:&quot;B&quot; is the initial balance
:&quot;m&quot; is the number of time periods elapsed and
:&quot;n&quot; is the frequency of applying interest.

For example, imagine that a credit card holder has an outstanding balance of $2500 and that the simple annual interest rate is 12.99% &quot;per annum&quot;, applied monthly, so the frequency of applying interest is 12 per year. Over one month,

:formula_3

interest is due (rounded to the nearest cent).

Simple interest applied over 3 months would be

:formula_4

If the card holder pays off only interest at the end of each of the 3 months, the total amount of interest paid would be

:formula_5

which is the simple interest applied over 3 months, as calculated above. (The one cent difference arises due to rounding to the nearest cent.)

===Compound interest===
Compound interest includes interest earned on the interest that was previously accumulated.

Compare, for example, a bond paying 6 percent semiannually (that is, coupons of 3 percent twice a year) with a certificate of deposit (GIC) that pays 6 percent interest once a year. The total interest payment is $6 per $100 par value in both cases, but the holder of the semiannual bond receives half the $6 per year after only 6 months (time preference), and so has the opportunity to reinvest the first $3 coupon payment after the first 6 months, and earn additional interest.

For example, suppose an investor buys $10,000 par value of a US dollar bond, which pays coupons twice a year, and that the bond&#x27;s simple annual coupon rate is 6 percent per year. This means that every 6 months, the issuer pays the holder of the bond a coupon of 3 dollars per 100 dollars par value. At the end of 6 months, the issuer pays the holder:

:formula_6

Assuming the market price of the bond is 100, so it is trading at par value, suppose further that the holder immediately reinvests the coupon by spending it on another $300 par value of the bond. In total, the investor therefore now holds:

:formula_7

and so earns a coupon at the end of the next 6 months of:

:formula_8

Assuming the bond remains priced at par, the investor accumulates at the end of a full 12 months a total value of:

:formula_9

and the investor earned in total:

:formula_10

The formula for the annual equivalent compound interest rate is:

:formula_11

where

:r is the simple annual rate of interest
:n is the frequency of applying interest

For example, in the case of a 6% simple annual rate, the annual equivalent compound rate is:

:formula_12

===Other formulations===
The outstanding balance &quot;Bn&quot; of a loan after &quot;n&quot; regular payments increases each period by a growth factor according to the periodic interest, and then decreases by the amount paid &quot;p&quot; at the end of each period:

:formula_13

where

:&quot;i&quot; = simple annual loan rate in decimal form (for example, 10% = 0.10. The loan rate is the rate used to compute payments and balances.)
:&quot;r&quot; = period interest rate (for example, &quot;i&quot;/12 for monthly payments) 
:&quot;B&quot;0 = initial balance, which equals the principal sum

By repeated substitution, one obtains expressions for &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;, which are linearly proportional to &quot;B&quot;0 and &quot;p&quot;, and use of the formula for the partial sum of a geometric series results in

:formula_14

A solution of this expression for &quot;p&quot; in terms of &quot;B&quot;0 and &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; reduces to

:formula_15

To find the payment if the loan is to be finished in &quot;n&quot; payments, one sets &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0.

The PMT function found in spreadsheet programs can be used to calculate the monthly payment of a loan:

:formula_16

An interest-only payment on the current balance would be

:formula_17

The total interest, &quot;I&quot;&quot;T&quot;, paid on the loan is

:formula_18

The formulas for a regular savings program are similar, but the payments are added to the balances instead of being subtracted, and the formula for the payment is the negative of the one above. These formulas are only approximate since actual loan balances are affected by rounding. To avoid an underpayment at the end of the loan, the payment must be rounded up to the next cent.

Consider a similar loan but with a new period equal to &quot;k&quot; periods of the problem above. If &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; and &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; are the new rate and payment, we now have

:formula_19

Comparing this with the expression for Bk above, we note that

:formula_20

and

:formula_21

The last equation allows us to define a constant that is the same for both problems:

:formula_22

and &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; can be written as

:formula_23

Solving for &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot;, we find a formula for &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; involving known quantities and &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot;, the balance after &quot;k&quot; periods:

:formula_24.

Since &quot;B&quot;0 could be any balance in the loan, the formula works for any two balances separate by &quot;k&quot; periods and can be used to compute a value for the annual interest rate.

&quot;B&quot;* is a scale invariant, since it does not change with changes in the length of the period.

Rearranging the equation for &quot;B&quot;*, one obtains a transformation coefficient (scale factor):

:formula_25 (see binomial theorem)

and we see that &quot;r&quot; and &quot;p&quot; transform in the same manner:

:formula_26
:formula_27.

The change in the balance transforms likewise:

:formula_28,

which gives an insight into the meaning of some of the coefficients found in the formulas above. The annual rate, &quot;r&quot;12, assumes only one payment per year and is not an &quot;effective&quot; rate for monthly payments. With monthly payments, the monthly interest is paid out of each payment and so should not be compounded, and an annual rate of 12·&quot;r&quot; would make more sense. If one just made interest-only payments, the amount paid for the year would be 12·&quot;r&quot;·&quot;B&quot;0.

Substituting &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;B&quot;* into the equation for the &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot;, we obtain

:formula_29.

Since &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 0, we can solve for &quot;B&quot;*: 

:formula_30

Substituting back into the formula for the &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; shows that they are a linear function of the &quot;r&quot;&quot;k&quot; and therefore the &quot;λ&quot;&quot;k&quot;:

:formula_31.

This is the easiest way of estimating the balances if the &quot;λ&quot;&quot;k&quot; are known. Substituting into the first formula for &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; above and solving for &quot;λ&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1, we obtain

:formula_32.

&quot;λ&quot;0 and &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be found using the formula for &quot;λ&quot;&quot;k&quot; above or computing the &quot;λ&quot;&quot;k&quot; recursively from &quot;λ&quot;0 = 0 to &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Since &quot;p&quot; = &quot;rB&quot;*, the formula for the payment reduces to

:formula_33

and the average interest rate over the period of the loan is

:formula_34

which is less than &quot;r&quot; if &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.

==Discount instruments==
* US and Canadian T-Bills (short term Government debt) have a different calculation for interest. Their interest is calculated as (100 − &quot;P&quot;)/&quot;P&quot; where &quot;P&quot; is the price paid. Instead of normalizing it to a year, the interest is prorated by the number of days &quot;t&quot;: (365/&quot;t&quot;)·100. (See also: Day count convention). The total calculation is ((100 − &quot;P&quot;)/&quot;P&quot;)·((365/&quot;t&quot;)·100). This is equivalent to calculating the price by a process called discounting at a simple interest rate.

==Rules of thumb==
===Rule of 78s===

In the age before electronic computers were widely available, flat rate consumer loans in the United States of America would be priced using the Rule of 78s, or &quot;sum of digits&quot; method. (The sum of the integers from 1 to 12 is 78.) The technique required only a simple calculation.

Payments remain constant over the life of the loan; however, payments are allocated to interest in progressively smaller amounts. In a one-year loan, in the first month, 12/78 of all interest owed over the life of the loan is due; in the second month, 11/78; progressing to the twelfth month where only 1/78 of all interest is due. The practical effect of the Rule of 78s is to make early pay-offs of term loans more expensive. For a one-year loan, approximately 3/4 of all interest due is collected by the sixth month, and pay-off of the principal then will cause the effective interest rate to be much higher than the APR used to calculate the payments.

In 1992, the United States outlawed the use of &quot;Rule of 78s&quot; interest in connection with mortgage refinancing and other consumer loans over five years in term. Certain other jurisdictions have outlawed application of the Rule of 78s in certain types of loans, particularly consumer loans.

===Rule of 72===

To approximate how long it takes for money to double at a given interest rate, that is, for accumulated compound interest to reach or exceed the initial deposit, divide 72 by the percentage interest rate. For example, compounding at an annual interest rate of 6 percent, it will take 72/6 = 12 years for the money to double.

The rule provides a good indication for interest rates up to 10%.

In the case of an interest rate of 18 percent, the rule of 72 predicts that money will double after 72/18 = 4 years.
:formula_35

In the case of an interest rate of 24 percent, the rule predicts that money will double after 72/24 = 3 years.
:formula_36

==Market interest rates==

There are markets for investments (which include the money market, bond market, as well as retail financial institutions like banks) that set interest rates. Each specific debt takes into account the following factors in determining its interest rate:

===Opportunity cost and deferred consumption===
Opportunity cost encompasses any other use to which the money could be put, including lending to others, investing elsewhere, holding cash, or spending the funds.

Charging interest equal to inflation preserves the lender&#x27;s purchasing power, but does not compensate for the time value of money in real terms. The lender may prefer to invest in another product rather than consume. The return they might obtain from competing investments is a factor in determining the interest rate they demand.

===Inflation===
Since the lender is deferring consumption, they will &quot;wish&quot;, as a bare minimum, to recover enough to pay the increased cost of goods due to inflation. Because future inflation is unknown, there are three ways this might be achieved:
* Charge X% interest &quot;plus inflation&quot; Many governments issue &quot;real-return&quot; or &quot;inflation indexed&quot; bonds. The principal amount or the interest payments are continually increased by the rate of inflation. See the discussion at real interest rate.
* Decide on the &quot;expected&quot; inflation rate. This still leaves the lender exposed to the risk of &quot;unexpected&quot; inflation.
* Allow the interest rate to be periodically changed. While a &quot;fixed interest rate&quot; remains the same throughout the life of the debt, &quot;variable&quot; or &quot;floating&quot; rates can be reset. There are derivative products that allow for hedging and swaps between the two.

However interest rates are set by the market, and it happens frequently that they are insufficient to compensate for inflation: for example at times of high inflation during, for example, the oil crisis; and during 2011 when real yields on many inflation-linked government stocks are negative.

===Default===
There is always the risk the borrower will become bankrupt, abscond or otherwise default on the loan. The risk premium attempts to measure the integrity of the borrower, the risk of his enterprise succeeding and the security of any collateral pledged. For example, loans to developing countries have higher risk premiums than those to the US government due to the difference in creditworthiness. An operating line of credit to a business will have a higher rate than a mortgage loan.

The creditworthiness of businesses is measured by bond rating services and individual&#x27;s credit scores by credit bureaus. The risks of an individual debt may have a large standard deviation of possibilities. The lender may want to cover his maximum risk, but lenders with portfolios of debt can lower the risk premium to cover just the most probable outcome.

===Composition of interest rates===
In economics, interest is considered the price of credit, therefore, it is also subject to distortions due to inflation. The nominal interest rate, which refers to the price before adjustment to inflation, is the one visible to the consumer (that is, the interest tagged in a loan contract, credit card statement, etc.). Nominal interest is composed of the real interest rate plus inflation, among other factors. An approximate formula for the nominal interest is:

:formula_37

Where
:&quot;i&quot; is the nominal interest rate
:&quot;r&quot; is the real interest rate
:and is inflation.

However, not all borrowers and lenders have access to the same interest rate, even if they are subject to the same inflation. Furthermore, expectations of future inflation vary, so a forward-looking interest rate cannot depend on a single real interest rate plus a single expected rate of inflation.

Interest rates also depend on credit quality or risk of default. Governments are normally highly reliable debtors, and the interest rate on government securities is normally lower than the interest rate available to other borrowers.

The equation:

: formula_38

relates expectations of inflation and credit risk to nominal and expected real interest rates, over the life of a loan, where
:&quot;i&quot; is the nominal interest applied
:&quot;r&quot; is the real interest expected
: is the inflation expected and
:&quot;c&quot; is yield spread according to the perceived credit risk.

===Default interest===
Default interest is the rate of interest that a borrower must pay after material breach of a loan covenant.

The default interest is usually much higher than the original interest rate since it is reflecting the aggravation in the financial risk of the borrower. Default interest compensates the lender for the added risk.

From the borrower&#x27;s perspective, this means failure to make their regular payment for one or two payment periods or failure to pay taxes or insurance premiums for the loan collateral will lead to substantially higher interest for the entire remaining term of the loan.

Banks tend to add default interest to the loan agreements in order to separate between different scenarios.

In some jurisdictions, default interest clauses are unenforceable as against public policy.

===Term===
Shorter terms often have less risk of default and exposure to inflation because the near future is easier to predict. In these circumstances, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates (an upward sloping yield curve).

===Government intervention===
Interest rates are generally determined by the market, but government intervention - usually by a central bank - may strongly influence short-term interest rates, and is one of the main tools of monetary policy. The central bank offers to borrow (or lend) large quantities of money at a rate which they determine (sometimes this is money that they have created &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, that is, printed) which has a major influence on supply and demand and hence on market interest rates.

===Open market operations in the United States===

The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds. Federal funds are the reserves held by banks at the Fed.

Open market operations are one tool within monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve to steer short-term interest rates. Using the power to buy and sell treasury securities, the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York can supply the market with dollars by purchasing U.S. Treasury notes, hence increasing the nation&#x27;s money supply. By increasing the money supply or Aggregate Supply of Funding (ASF), interest rates will fall due to the excess of dollars banks will end up with in their reserves. Excess reserves may be lent in the Fed funds market to other banks, thus driving down rates.

===Interest rates and credit risk===
It is increasingly recognized that during the business cycle, interest rates and credit risk are tightly interrelated. The Jarrow-Turnbull model was the first model of credit risk that explicitly had random interest rates at its core. Lando (2004), Darrell Duffie and Singleton (2003), and van Deventer and Imai (2003) discuss interest rates when the issuer of the interest-bearing instrument can default.

===Money and inflation===
Loans and bonds have some of the characteristics of money and are included in the broad money supply.

National governments (provided, of course, that the country has retained its own currency) can influence interest rates and thus the supply and demand for such loans, thus altering the total of loans and bonds issued. Generally speaking, a higher real interest rate reduces the broad money supply.

Through the quantity theory of money, increases in the money supply lead to inflation. This means that interest rates can affect inflation in the future.

===Liquidity===

Liquidity is the ability to quickly re-sell an asset for fair or near-fair value. All else equal, an investor will want a higher return on an illiquid asset than a liquid one, to compensate for the loss of the option to sell it at any time. U.S. Treasury bonds are highly liquid with an active secondary market, while some other debts are less liquid. In the mortgage market, the lowest rates are often issued on loans that can be re-sold as securitized loans. Highly non-traditional loans such as seller financing often carry higher interest rates due to a lack of liquidity.

==Theories of interest==
===Aristotle&#x27;s view of interest===
Aristotle and the Scholastics held that it was unjust to claim payment except in compensation for one&#x27;s own efforts and sacrifices, and that since money is by its nature sterile, there is no loss in being temporarily separated from it. Compensation for risk or for the trouble of setting up a loan was not necessarily impermissible on these grounds.

===Development of the theory of interest during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries===
Nicholas Barbon (c.1640–c.1698) described as a &quot;mistake&quot; the view that interest is a monetary value, arguing that because money is typically borrowed to buy assets (goods and stock), the interest that is charged on a loan is a type of rent – &quot;a payment for the use of goods&quot;. According to Schumpeter, Barbon&#x27;s theories were forgotten until similar views were put forward by Joseph Massie in 1750.

In 1752 David Hume published his essay &quot;Of money&quot; which relates interest to the &quot;demand for borrowing&quot;, the &quot;riches available to supply that demand&quot; and the &quot;profits arising from commerce&quot;. Schumpeter considered Hume&#x27;s theory superior to that of Ricardo and Mill, but the reference to profits concentrates to a surprising degree on &#x27;commerce&#x27; rather than on industry.

Turgot brought the theory of interest close to its classical form. Industrialists
share their profits with capitalists who supply the funds (&quot;Réflexions&quot;, LXXI). The share that goes to the latter is determined like all other prices (LXXV) by the play of supply and demand amongst borrowers and lenders, so that the analysis is from the outset firmly planted in the general theory of prices.

===The classical theory of the interest rate===
The classical theory was the work of a number of authors, including Turgot, Ricardo, Mountifort Longfield, J. S. Mill, and Irving Fisher. It was strongly criticised by Keynes whose remarks nonetheless made a positive contribution to it.

Mill&#x27;s theory is set out the chapter &quot;Of the rate of interest&quot; in his &quot;Principles of political economy&quot;. He says that the interest rate adjusts to maintain equilibrium between the demands for lending and borrowing. Individuals lend in order to defer consumption or for the sake of the greater quantity they will be able to consume at a later date owing to interest earned. They borrow in order to anticipate consumption (whose relative desirability is reflected by the time value of money), but entrepreneurs also borrow to fund investment and governments borrow for their own reasons. The three sources of demand compete for loans.

For entrepreneurial borrowing to be in equilibrium with lending:
The interest for money... is... regulated... by the rate of profits which can be made by the employment of capital...
Ricardo&#x27;s and Mill&#x27;s &#x27;profit&#x27; is made more precise by the concept of the marginal efficiency of capital (the expression, though not the concept, is due to Keynes), which may be defined as the annual revenue which will be yielded by an extra increment of capital as a proportion of its cost. So the interest rate &quot;r&quot; in equilibrium will be equal to the marginal efficiency of capital &quot;r″&quot;. Rather than work with &quot;r&quot; and &quot;r″&quot; as separate variables, we can assume that they are equal and let the single variable &quot;r&quot; denote their common value.

The investment schedule &quot;i&quot; (&quot;r&quot;) shows how much investment is possible with a return of at least &quot;r&quot;. In a stationary economy it is likely to resemble the blue curve in the diagram, with a step shape arising from the assumption that opportunities to invest with yields greater than &quot;r̂&quot; have been largely exhausted while there is untapped scope to invest with a lower return.

Saving is the excess of deferred over anticipated consumption, and its dependence on income is much as described by Keynes (see The General Theory), but in classical theory definitely an increasing function of &quot;r&quot;. (The dependence of &quot;s&quot; on income &quot;y&quot; was not relevant to classical concerns prior to the development of theories of unemployment.) The rate of interest is given by the intersection of the solid red saving curve with the blue investment schedule. But so long as the investment schedule is almost vertical, a change in income (leading in extreme cases to the broken red saving curve) will make little difference to the interest rate.

In some cases the analysis will be less simple. The introduction of a new technique, leading to demand for new forms of capital, will shift the step to the right and reduce its steepness. Or a sudden increase in the desire to anticipate consumption (perhaps through military spending in time of war) will absorb most available loans; the interest rate will increase and investment will be reduced to the amount whose return exceeds it. This is illustrated by the dotted red saving curve.

====Keynes&#x27;s criticisms====
In the case of extraordinary spending in time of war the government may wish to borrow more than the public would be willing to lend at a normal interest rate. If the dotted red curve started negative and showed no tendency to increase with &quot;r&quot;, then the government would be trying to buy what the public was unwilling to sell at any price. Keynes mentions this possibility as a point &quot;which might, perhaps, have warned the classical school that something was wrong&quot; (p. 182).

He also remarks (on the same page) that the classical theory does not explain the usual supposition that &quot;an increase in the quantity of money has a tendency to reduce the rate of interest, at any rate in the first instance&quot;.

Keynes&#x27;s diagram of the investment schedule lacks the step shape which can be seen as part of the classical theory. He objects that
the functions used by classical theory... do not furnish material for a theory of the rate of interest; but they could be used to tell us... what the rate of interest will have to be, if the level of employment [which determines income] is maintained at a given figure.

Later (p. 184) Keynes claims that &quot;it involves a circular argument&quot; to construct a theory of interest from the investment schedule since 
the &#x27;marginal efficiency of capital&#x27; partly depends on the scale of current investment, and we must already know the rate of interest before we can calculate what this scale will be.

===Theories of exploitation, productivity and abstinence===
The classical theory of interest explains it as the capitalist&#x27;s share of business profits, but the pre-marginalist authors were unable to reconcile these profits with the labor theory of value (excluding Longfield, who was essentially a marginalist). Their responses often had a moral tone: Ricardo and Marx viewed profits as exploitation, and McCulloch&#x27;s productivity theory justified profits by portraying capital equipment as an embodiment of accumulated labor. The theory that interest is a payment for abstinence is attributed to Nassau Senior, and according to Schumpeter was intended neutrally, but it can easily be understood as making a moral claim and was sharply criticised by Marx and Lassalle.

===Wicksell&#x27;s theory===
Knut Wicksell published his &quot;Interest and Prices&quot; in 1898, elaborating a comprehensive theory of economic crises based upon a distinction between natural and nominal interest rates. 
Wicksell&#x27;s contribution, in fact, was twofold. First he separated the monetary rate of interest from the hypothetical &quot;natural&quot; rate that would have resulted from equilibrium of capital supply and demand in a barter economy, and he assumed that as a result of the presence of money alone, the effective market rate could fail to correspond to this ideal rate in actuality. Next he supposed that through the mechanism of credit, the rate of interest had an influence on prices; that a rise of the monetary rate above the &quot;natural&quot; level produced a fall, and a decline below that level a rise, in prices. But Wicksell went on to conclude that if the natural rate coincided with the monetary rate, stability of prices would follow.
In the 1930s Wicksell&#x27;s approach was refined by Bertil Ohlin and Dennis Robertson and became known as the loanable funds theory.

===Austrian theories===
Eugen Böhm von Bawerk and other members of the Austrian School also put forward notable theories of the interest rate.

The doyen of the Austrian school, Murray N. Rothbard, sees the emphasis on the loan market which makes up the general analysis on interest as a mistaken view to take. As he explains in his primary economic work, &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot;, the market rate of interest is but a &quot;manifestation&quot; of the natural phenomenon of time preference, which is to prefer present goods to future goods. To Rothbard, 

Interest is explainable by the rate of time preference among the people. To point to the loan market is insufficient at best. Rather, the rate of interest is what would be observed between the &quot;stages of production&quot;, indeed a time market itself, where capital goods which are used to make consumers&#x27; goods are ordered out further in time away from the final consumers&#x27; goods stage of the economy where consumption takes place. It is &quot;this&quot; spread (between these various stages which will tend toward uniformity), with consumers&#x27; goods representing present goods and producers&#x27; goods representing future goods, that the real rate of interest is observed. Rothbard has said that Rothbard has furthermore criticized the Keynesian conception of interest, saying 

===Pareto&#x27;s indifference===
Pareto held that
The interest rate, being one of the many elements of the general system of equilibrium, was, of course, simultaneously determined with all of them so that there was no point at all in looking for any particular element that &#x27;caused&#x27; interest.

===Keynes&#x27;s theory of the interest rate===
Interest is one of the main components of the economic theories developed in Keynes&#x27;s 1936 &quot;General theory of employment, interest, and money&quot;. In his initial account of liquidity preference (the demand for money), this demand is solely a function of the interest rate; and since the supply is given and equilibrium is assumed, the interest rate is determined by the money supply. He later writes that interest cannot be separated from other economic variables and needs to be analysed together with them (see The General Theory).

==In religious contexts==

===Judaism===

Jews are forbidden from usury in dealing with fellow Jews, and this lending is to be considered tzedakah, or charity. However, there are permissions to charge interest on loans to non-Jews. Several historical rulings in Jewish law have mitigated the allowances for usury toward non-Jews. For instance, the 15th-century commentator Rabbi Isaac Abrabanel specified that the rubric for allowing interest does not apply to Christians or Muslims, because their faith systems have a common ethical basis originating from Judaism. The medieval commentator Rabbi David Kimchi extended this principle to non-Jews who show consideration for Jews, saying they should be treated with the same consideration when they borrow.

===Islam===
The following quotations are English translations from the Qur&#x27;an:



The attitude of Muhammad to usury is articulated in his Last Sermon:

=== Christianity ===
The Old Testament &quot;condemns the practice of charging interest because a loan should be an act of compassion and taking care of one&#x27;s neighbor&quot;; it teaches that &quot;making a profit off a loan is exploiting that person and dishonoring God&#x27;s covenant (Exodus 22:25–27)&quot;.

The first of the scholastic Christian theologians, Saint Anselm of Canterbury, led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. St. Thomas Aquinas, the leading scholastic theologian of the Roman Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to &quot;double charging&quot;, charging for both the thing and the use of the thing. Outlawing usury did not prevent investment, but stipulated that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all, which is usury. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out, for example, any fair administrative charges. The Catholic Church, in a decree of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, expressly allowed such charges in respect of credit-unions run for the benefit of the poor known as &quot;montes pietatis&quot;.

In the 13th century Cardinal Hostiensis enumerated thirteen situations in which charging interest was not immoral. The most important of these was &quot;lucrum cessans&quot; (profits given up) which allowed for the lender to charge interest &quot;to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself&quot;. This idea is very similar to opportunity cost. Many scholastic thinkers who argued for a ban on interest charges also argued for the legitimacy of &quot;lucrum cessans&quot; profits (for example, Pierre Jean Olivi and St. Bernardino of Siena). However, Hostiensis&#x27; exceptions, including for &quot;lucrum cessans&quot;, were never accepted as official by the Roman Catholic Church.

The Westminster Confession of Faith, a confession of faith upheld by the Reformed Churches, teaches that usury — defined as charging interest at any rate — is a sin prohibited by the eighth commandment.

The Roman Catholic Church has always condemned usury, but in modern times, with the rise of capitalism and the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in majority Catholic countries, this prohibition on usury has not been enforced.

The Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a Catholic Christian religious order, teaches that:
