<text>Joseph Walton Losey III (; January 14, 1909 – June 22, 1984) was an American film and theatre director, producer, and screenwriter. Born in Wisconsin, he studied in Germany with Bertolt Brecht and then returned to the United States. Blacklisted by Hollywood in the 1950s, he moved to Europe where he made the remainder of his films, mostly in the United Kingdom. 

Among the most critically and commercially successful were the films with screenplays by Harold Pinter: &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971). His 1976 film &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot; won the César Awards for Best Film and Best Director. His other notable films included &quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot; (1948), &quot;Eva&quot; (1962), &quot;King &amp; Country&quot; (1964), &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1966), &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot; (1970), &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), &quot;Galileo&quot; (1975), and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1979). 

He was also a four-time nominee for both the (winning once) and the Golden Lion, and a two-time BAFTA Award nominee. 

== Early life and career ==

Joseph Walton Losey III was born on January 14, 1909, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he and Nicholas Ray were high-school classmates at La Crosse Central High School. He attended Dartmouth College and Harvard University, beginning as a student of medicine and ending in drama.

Losey became a major figure in New York City political theatre, first directing the controversial failure &quot;Little Old Boy&quot; in 1933. He declined to direct a staged version of &quot;Dodsworth&quot; by Sinclair Lewis, which led Lewis to offer him his first work written for the stage, &quot;Jayhawker&quot;. Losey directed the show, which had a brief run. Bosley Crowther in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;The play, being increasingly wordy, presents staging problems that Joe Losey&#x27;s direction does not always solve. It is hard to tell who is responsible for the obscure parts in the story.&quot;

He visited the Soviet Union for several months in 1935, to study the Russian stage. In Moscow he participated in a seminar on film taught by Sergei Eisenstein. He also met Bertolt Brecht and the composer Hanns Eisler, who were visiting Moscow at the time.

In 1936, he directed &quot;Triple-A Plowed Under&quot; on Broadway, a production of the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Federal Theatre Project. He then directed the second Living Newspaper presentation, &quot;Injunction Granted&quot;.

Losey served in the U.S. military during World War II and was discharged in 1945. From 1946 to 1947, Losey worked with Bertolt Brecht—who was living in exile in Los Angeles—and Charles Laughton on the preparations for the staging of Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Galileo&quot; (&quot;Life of Galileo&quot;) which he and Brecht eventually co-directed with Laughton in the title role, and with music by Eisler. The play premiered on July 30, 1947, at the Coronet Theatre in Beverly Hills. On October 30, 1947, Losey accompanied Brecht to Washington D.C. for Brecht&#x27;s appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Brecht left the US the following day. Losey went on to stage &quot;Galileo&quot;, again with Laughton in the title role, in New York City where it opened on December 7, 1947, at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. More than 25 years later Losey, in exile in England, would direct a film version of Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Galileo&quot; (1975).

Losey&#x27;s first feature film was a political allegory titled &quot;The Boy with Green Hair&quot; (1947), starring a young Dean Stockwell as Peter, a war orphan who is subject to ridicule after he awakens one morning to find his hair mysteriously turned green.

Seymour Nebenzal, the producer of Fritz Lang&#x27;s classic &quot;M&quot; (1931), hired Losey to direct a remake set in Los Angeles rather than Berlin. In the new version, released in 1951, the killer&#x27;s name was changed from Hans Beckert to Martin W. Harrow. Nebenzal&#x27;s son Harold was associate producer of this version.

==Politics and exile==
During the 1930s and 1940s, Losey maintained extensive contacts with people on the political left, including radicals and communists or those who would eventually become such. He had collaborated with Bertolt Brecht and had a long association with Hanns Eisler, both targets of HUAC&#x27;s interest. Losey had written to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in support of a resident visa for Eisler, who had many radical associations. They had collaborated on a &quot;political cabaret&quot; from 1937 to 1939, and Losey had invited Eisler to compose music for a short public-relations film that he had been commissioned to produce for presentation at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, &quot;Pete Roleum and His Cousins&quot;.

Losey had also worked on the Federal Theatre Project, long a target of HUAC. Losey directed the play &quot;Triple-A Plowed Under&quot;, which been denounced by HUAC&#x27;s antecedent, the Dies Committee, as communist propaganda. His Hollywood collaborators included a long list of other HUAC targets, including Dalton Trumbo and Ring Lardner Jr.

Losey&#x27;s first wife Elizabeth Hawes worked with a wide range of communists and anticommunist liberals at the radical newspaper &quot;PM&quot;. After their divorce in 1944, she wrote about working as a union organizer just after World War II, where &quot;one preferred the Communists to the Red-Baiters.&quot; At some point, probably early in the 1940s, the FBI maintained dossiers on both Losey and Hawes, and that of Losey charged that he was a Stalinist agent as of 1945.

In 1946, Losey joined the Communist Party USA. He later explained to a French interviewer:

Losey was under a long-term contract with Dore Schary at RKO when Howard Hughes purchased the company in 1948 and began purging it of leftists. Losey later explained how Hughes tested employees to determine whether they had communist sympathies:

Hughes responded by holding Losey to his contract without assigning him any work. In mid-1949, Schary persuaded Hughes to release Losey, who soon began working as an independent on &quot;The Lawless&quot; for Paramount Pictures. Soon he was working on a three-picture contract with Stanley Kramer. His name was mentioned by two witnesses before HUAC in the spring of 1951. Losey&#x27;s attorney suggested arranging a deal with the committee for testimony in secret. Instead, Losey abandoned his work editing &quot;The Big Night&quot; and left for Europe while his ex-wife Louise departed for Mexico a few days later. HUAC took weeks to try unsuccessfully to serve them with a subpoena compelling their testimony.

After more than a year working on &quot;Stranger on the Prowl&quot; in Italy, Losey returned to the U.S. on October 12, 1952. He found himself unemployable:

He returned briefly to Rome and settled in London on January 4, 1953.

==Career in Europe==

Losey settled in Britain and worked as a director of genre films. His first British film &quot;The Sleeping Tiger&quot; (1954), a noir crime thriller, was made under the pseudonym of Victor Hanbury, because the stars of the film, Alexis Smith and Alexander Knox, feared being blacklisted by Hollywood in turn if it became known they had worked with him. It was financed by Nat Cohen at Anglo-Amalgamated who also financed &quot;The Intimate Stranger&quot; (1956), where Losey carried a pseudonym as well. 

His films covered a wide range from the Regency melodrama &quot;The Gypsy and the Gentleman&quot; (1958) to the gangster film for Cohen, &quot;The Criminal&quot; (1960).

Losey was also originally slated to direct the Hammer Films production &quot;X the Unknown&quot; (1956), but after a few days&#x27; work the star Dean Jagger refused to work with a supposed Communist sympathiser and Losey was removed from the project. An alternative version is that Losey was replaced due to illness. Losey was later hired by Hammer Films to direct &quot;The Damned&quot;, a 1963 British science fiction film based on H.L. Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;The Children of Light&quot;.

In the 1960s, Losey began working with playwright Harold Pinter, in what became a long friendship and initiated a successful screenwriting career for Pinter. Losey directed three enduring classics based on Pinter&#x27;s screenplays: &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963), &quot;Accident&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971).
&quot;The Servant&quot; won three British Academy Film Awards. &quot;Accident&quot; won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury award at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;The Go-Between&quot; won the Golden Palm Award at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, four prizes at the 1972 BAFTA awards, and Best British Screenplay at the 1972 Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain awards. Each of the three films examines the politics of class and sexuality in England at the end of the 19th century (&quot;The Go-Between&quot;) and in the 1960s. In &quot;The Servant&quot;, a manservant facilitates the moral and psychological degradation of his privileged and rich employer. &quot;Accident&quot; explores male lust, hypocrisy and ennui among the educated middle class as two Oxford University tutors competitively objectify a student against the backdrop of their seemingly idyllic lives. In &quot;The Go-Between&quot;, a young middle-class boy, the summer guest of an upper-class family, becomes the messenger for an affair between a working-class farmer and the daughter of his hosts.

Although Losey&#x27;s films are generally naturalistic, &quot;The Servant&quot;″s hybridisation of Losey&#x27;s signature Baroque style, film noir, naturalism and expressionism, and both &quot;Accident&quot;″s and &quot;The Go-Between&quot;″s radical cinematography, use of montage, voice over and musical score, amount to a sophisticated construction of cinematic time and narrative perspective that edges this work in the direction of neorealist cinema. All three films are marked by Pinter&#x27;s sparse, elliptical and enigmatically subtextual dialogue, something Losey often develops a visual correlate for (and occasionally even works against) by means of dense and cluttered &quot;mise-en-scène&quot; and peripatetic camera work.

In 1966, Losey directed &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, a comedy spy-fi film produced in the United Kingdom and released worldwide in 1966. Sometimes considered a James Bond parody, it was based loosely on the popular comic strip &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; by Peter O&#x27;Donnell.&#x27;

Losey directed Robert Shaw and Malcolm McDowell in the British action film &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot; (1970), adapted by Shaw from the novel by Barry England. The film was shot in various locations in Spain.

Losey also worked with Pinter on &quot;The Proust Screenplay&quot; (1972), an adaptation of &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; by Marcel Proust. Losey died before the project&#x27;s financing could be assembled.

In 1975, Losey realized a long-planned film adaptation of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot; released as &quot;Life of Galileo&quot; starring Chaim Topol. &quot;Galileo&quot; was produced as part of the subscription film series of the American Film Theatre, but shot in the UK. In the context of this production, Losey also made a half-hour film based on Galileo&#x27;s life.

Losey&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot; (1976) examined the day in Occupied France when Jews in and around Paris were arrested for deportation. He said he so completely rejected naturalism in film that in this case he divided his shooting schedule into three &quot;visual categories&quot;: Unreality, Reality and Abstract. He demonstrated a facility for working in the French language and &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot; (1976) gave Alain Delon as star and producer one of French cinema&#x27;s earliest chances to highlight the background to the infamous Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup of French Jews in July 1942.

In 1979, Losey filmed Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, shot in Villa La Rotonda and the Veneto region of Italy; this film was nominated for several César Awards in 1980, including Best Director.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Losey told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;d love to work in America again, but it would have to be just the right thing.&quot; He told an interviewer the year before he died that he was not bitter about being blacklisted: &quot;Without it I would have three Cadillacs, two swimming pools and millions of dollars, and I&#x27;d be dead. It was terrifying, it was disgusting, but you can get trapped by money and complacency. A good shaking up never did anyone any harm.&quot;

Dartmouth College, his alma mater, awarded Losey an honorary degree in 1973. In 1983, the University of Wisconsin–Madison did the same.

Losey married four times and divorced thrice. He married Elizabeth Hawes on July 24, 1937. They had a son, Gavrik Losey, in 1938, but divorced in 1944. Gavrik helped with the production on some of his father&#x27;s films. Gavrik&#x27;s two sons are film directors Marek Losey and Luke Losey. 

Later in 1944, Losey married Louise Stuart; they divorced in 1953. From 1956 to 1963, Losey was married to British actress Dorothy Bromiley. They had a son, Joshua Losey, born on July 16, 1957, who became an actor. On September 29, 1970, Losey married Patricia Mohan in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, shortly after finishing shooting &quot;The Go-Between&quot;. Patricia Losey went on to adapt Lorenzo Da Ponte&#x27;s opera libretto for Losey&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and Nell Dunn&#x27;s play for &quot;Steaming&quot;.

He died from cancer at his home in Chelsea, London, on June 22, 1984, aged 75, four weeks after completing his last film.

In &quot;Guilty by Suspicion&quot;, Irwin Winkler&#x27;s 1991 film about the Hollywood blacklist, McCarthyism, and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee, Martin Scorsese plays an American filmmaker named &quot;Joe Lesser&quot; who leaves Hollywood for England rather than face HUAC investigations. The fictional director played by Scorsese is based on Joseph Losey.

<doc id="145855" wikidata="Q451580" url="?curid=145855" title="Ine of Wessex">
<text>Ine or Ini (died in or after 726) was King of Wessex from 689 to 726. At Ine&#x27;s accession, his kingdom dominated much of what is now southern England. However, he was unable to retain the territorial gains of his predecessor, Cædwalla of Wessex, who had expanded West Saxon territory substantially. By the end of Ine&#x27;s reign, the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Essex were no longer under West Saxon sway; however, Ine maintained control of what is now Hampshire, and consolidated and extended Wessex&#x27;s territory in the western peninsula.

Ine is noted for his code of laws (&quot;Ines asetnessa&quot; or &quot;laws of Ine&quot;), which he issued in about 694. These laws were the first issued by an Anglo-Saxon king outside Kent. They shed much light on the history of Anglo-Saxon society, and reveal Ine&#x27;s Christian convictions. Trade increased significantly during Ine&#x27;s reign, with the town of Hamwic (now Southampton) becoming prominent. It was probably during Ine&#x27;s reign that the West Saxons began to mint coins, though none have been found that bear his name.

Ine abdicated in 726 to go to Rome, leaving, in the words of the contemporary chronicler Bede, the kingdom to &quot;younger men&quot;. He was succeeded by Æthelheard.

== Genealogy and accession ==
Early sources agree that Ine was the son of Cenred, and that Cenred was the son of Ceolwald; further back there is less agreement. Ine was born around 670 and his siblings included a brother, Ingild, and two sisters, Cuthburh and Cwenburg. Ingild is given by the Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies as ancestor of king Egbert of Wessex and the subsequent kings of England. Cuthburh was married to King Aldfrith of Northumbria, and Ine himself was married to Æthelburg. Bede tells that Ine was &quot;of the blood royal&quot;, by which he means the royal line of the Gewisse, the early West Saxon tribal name.

The genealogy of Ine is known from the Anglian King-list, the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List (which may share a common source with the Anglian King-list) and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (which certainly drew on and adapted an early version of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, alongside other sources). Both the Regnal List and &quot;Chronicle&quot; were put into their present form in the late ninth century, probably at the court of Alfred the Great, and show scholars at pains both to emphasise that all West-Saxon kings descended from Cerdic and to put Cerdic&#x27;s foundation of the dynasty earlier than their sources claimed, yet nonetheless are often at variance.

Ine&#x27;s predecessor on the throne of Wessex was Cædwalla, but there is some uncertainty about the transition from Cædwalla to Ine. Cædwalla abdicated in 688 and departed for Rome to be baptized. According to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, Ine reigned for 37 years, abdicating in 726. These dates imply that he did not gain the throne until 689, which could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla&#x27;s abdication and Ine&#x27;s accession. Ine may have ruled alongside his father, Cenred, for a period: there is weak evidence for joint kingships, and stronger evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before this time. Ine acknowledges his father&#x27;s help in his code of laws, and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine&#x27;s accession.

== Reign ==
The extent of West Saxon territory at the start of Ine&#x27;s reign is fairly well known. The upper Thames valley on both sides of the river had long been the territory of the Gewisse, though Cædwalla had lost territory north of the river to the kingdom of Mercia before Ine&#x27;s accession. To the west, Ceawlin of Wessex is known to have reached the Bristol Channel one hundred years before. The West Saxons had since expanded further down the southwestern peninsula, pushing back the boundary with the British kingdom of Dumnonia, which was probably roughly equivalent to modern Devon and Cornwall. On the West Saxons&#x27; eastern border was the kingdom of the East Saxons, which included London and what is now Surrey. To the southeast were the South Saxons, on the coast east of the Isle of Wight. Beyond Sussex lay the kingdom of Kent. Ine&#x27;s predecessor, Cædwalla, had made himself overlord of most of these southern kingdoms, though he had not been able to prevent Mercian inroads along the upper Thames.

Ine retained control of the Isle of Wight, and made further advances in Dumnonia, but the territorial gains Cædwalla had made in Sussex, Surrey and Kent were all lost by the end of Ine&#x27;s reign.

=== Kent, Essex, Sussex, and Surrey ===
Ine made peace with Kent in 694 when its king Wihtred gave Ine a substantial sum in compensation for the death of Cædwalla&#x27;s brother Mul, who had been killed during a Kentish rebellion in 687. The value of the amount offered to Ine by Wihtred is uncertain; most manuscripts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; record &quot;thirty thousand&quot;, and some specify thirty thousand pounds. If the pounds are equal to sceattas, then this amount is the equal of a king&#x27;s weregild—that is, the legal valuation of a man&#x27;s life, according to his rank.

Ine kept the South Saxons, who had been conquered by Cædwalla in 686, in subjugation for a period. King Nothhelm of Sussex is referred to in a charter of 692 as a kinsman of Ine (perhaps by marriage). Sussex was still under West Saxon domination in 710, when Nothhelm is recorded as having campaigned with Ine in the west against Dumnonia.

Control of Surrey, which may never have been an independent kingdom, passed between Kent, Mercia, Essex, and Wessex in the years before Ine&#x27;s reign. Essex also included London, and the diocese of London included Surrey; this appears to have been a source of friction between Ine and the East Saxon and Mercian kings until the province was transferred to the diocese of Winchester in 705. Evidence for Ine&#x27;s early control of Surrey comes from the introduction to his laws, in which he refers to Eorcenwald, bishop of London, as &quot;my bishop&quot;. Ine&#x27;s subsequent relations with the East Saxons are illuminated by a letter written in 704 or 705 by Bishop Wealdhere of London to Brihtwold, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The letter refers to &quot;disputes and discords&quot; that had arisen &quot;between the king of the West Saxons and the rulers of our country&quot;. The rulers that Wealdhere refers to are Sigeheard and Swæfred of the East Saxons, and the cause of the discord was the East Saxons&#x27; sheltering of exiles from the West Saxons. Ine had agreed to peace on the condition that the exiles were expelled. A council at Brentford was planned to resolve the disputes. By this point Surrey had clearly passed out of West Saxon control.

Bede records that Ine held Sussex in subjection for &quot;several years&quot;, but in 722 an exile named Ealdbert fled to Surrey and Sussex, and Ine invaded Sussex as a result. Three years later Ine invaded again, this time killing Ealdberht. Sussex had evidently broken away from West Saxon domination some time before this. It has been suggested that Ealdberht was a son of Ine, or a son of Ine&#x27;s brother Ingild.

=== Dumnonia and Mercia ===
In 710, Ine and Nothhelm fought against Geraint of Dumnonia, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;; John of Worcester states that Geraint was killed in this battle. It has traditionally been thought that Ine&#x27;s advance brought him control of what is now Devon, the new border with Dumnonia being the river Tamar. However, this does not match with subsequent events such as the Battle of Hehil or Athelstan driving the Britons from Isca (Exeter). The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, a 10th century chronicle, records that in 722 the British defeated their enemies at the Battle of Hehil. The &quot;enemies&quot; must be Ine or his people, but the location is unidentified; historians have suggested locations in both Cornwall and Devon.

Ine fought a battle at Woden&#x27;s Barrow in 715, either against the Mercians under Ceolred or together with them against an unnamed opponent; the result is not recorded. Woden&#x27;s Barrow is a tumulus, now called Adam&#x27;s Grave, at Alton Prior, Wiltshire. Ine may not have recovered any of the lands north of the Thames that had belonged to the West Saxons under previous kings, but it is known that he controlled the southern bank: a charter dated 687 shows him giving land to the church at Streatley on the Thames and at nearby Basildon.

=== Other conflicts ===
In 721, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; records that Ine slew one Cynewulf, of whom nothing else is known, though his name suggests a connection to the Wessex royal line. A quarrel apparently arose in the royal family soon afterwards: in 722, according to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, Ine&#x27;s queen Æthelburg destroyed Taunton, which her husband had built earlier in his reign, around 710.

== Internal affairs ==
The first mention of the office of ealdorman in Wessex, and the first references to the shires they led, occur during Ine&#x27;s reign. It may have been Ine who divided Wessex into something approximating the modern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, and Dorset, though earlier administrative boundaries might also have influenced these borders. It has also been suggested that these counties began as divisions of the kingdom among members of the royal family.

By about 710, in the middle of Ine&#x27;s reign, the trading settlement of Hamwic had become established on the west bank of the river Itchen; the site is now part of the modern city of Southampton. The goods traded at this port included glass vessels, and finds of animal bones suggest an active trade in hides. Further evidence of trade comes from finds of imported goods such as quernstones, whetstones, and pottery; and finds of sceattas from the town include Frisian coins. Specialist trades carried on in the town included cloth-making, smithying, and metalworking. It is not known whether Ine took an interest in Hamwic, but some of the goods he favoured, including luxuries, were imported there, and the merchants would probably have needed royal protection. The total population of Hamwic has been estimated at 5,000, and this high population itself implies Ine&#x27;s involvement, since no-one but the king would have been able to arrange to feed and house such a large group of people.

The growth of trade after about 700 was paralleled by an expansion of the area of circulation of the sceat, the common coin of the day, to include the upper Thames valley. It is thought that the first West Saxon coinage was minted during Ine&#x27;s reign, though no coins bearing his name have been found—sceattas typically gave no hint of the reigning king.

== Laws ==
The earliest Anglo-Saxon law code to survive, which may date from 602 or 603, is that of Æthelberht of Kent, whose reign ended in 616. In the 670s or 680s, a code was issued in the names of Hlothhere and Eadric of Kent. The next kings to issue laws were Wihtred of Kent and Ine.

The dates of Wihtred&#x27;s and Ine&#x27;s laws are somewhat uncertain, but there is reason to believe that Wihtred&#x27;s laws were issued on 6 September 695, while Ine&#x27;s laws were written in 694 or shortly before. Ine had recently agreed to peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation for the death of Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws. In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes. Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred&#x27;s laws use &quot;gesith&quot;, a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term &quot;eorlcund&quot;. It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms.

Ine&#x27;s laws survive only because Alfred the Great appended them to his own code of laws. The oldest surviving manuscript, and only complete copy, is in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS 173, which contains both Alfred&#x27;s and Ine&#x27;s law codes and the oldest extant text of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Two more partial texts survive. One was originally a complete copy of Ine&#x27;s laws, part of British Library MS Cotton Otho B xi, but that manuscript was largely destroyed in 1731 by a fire at Ashburnham House in which only Chapters 66 to 76.2 of Ine&#x27;s laws escaped destruction. A fragment of Ine&#x27;s laws can also be found in British Library Burney MS 277.

It is possible that we do not have Ine&#x27;s laws in their original 7th century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine&#x27;s laws is complete. Ingrid Ivarsen suggests that the laws were originally composed in Latin and translated into Old English.

The prologue to Ine&#x27;s laws lists his advisors. Three people are named: bishops Eorcenwald and Hædde, and Ine&#x27;s father, King Cenred. Ine was a Christian king, whose intent to encourage Christianity is clear from the laws. The oath of a communicant, for example, is declared to carry more weight than that of a non-Christian; and baptism and religious observance are also addressed. Significant attention is also paid to civil issues—more than in the contemporary Kentish laws.

One of the laws states that common land might be enclosed by several ceorls (the contemporary name for Saxon freemen). Any ceorl who fails to fence his share, however, and allows his cattle to stray into someone else&#x27;s field is to be held liable for any damage caused. This does not mean that the land was held in common: each ceorl had his own strip of land that supported him. It is notable that a king&#x27;s law is required to settle a relatively minor issue; the laws do not mention the role of local lords in obtaining compliance from the ceorls. It is clear from this and other laws that tenants held the land in tenure from a lord; the king&#x27;s close involvement indicates that the relationship between lord and tenant was under the king&#x27;s control.

The laws that deal with straying cattle provide the earliest documentary evidence for an open-field farming system. They show that open-field agriculture was practiced in Wessex in Ine&#x27;s time, and it is probable that this was also the prevalent agricultural method throughout the English midlands, and as far north and east as Lindsey and Deira. Not all of Wessex used this system, however: it was not used in Devon, for example. The law which mentions a &quot;yard&quot; of land is the first documented mention of that unit. A yard was a unit of land equal to a quarter of a hide; a hide was variable from place to place but could be as much as . The yard in this sense later became the standard holding of the medieval villein, and was known as the virgate. One historian has commented that &quot;the beginnings of a manorial economy are clearly visible in Ine&#x27;s laws.&quot;

The fine for neglecting fyrd, the obligation to do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required to serve in the army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is not surprising that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.

Another law specified that anyone accused of murder required at least one high-ranking person among his &quot;oath-helpers&quot;. An oath-helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man, to clear him from the suspicion of the crime. Ine&#x27;s requirement implies that he did not trust an oath sworn only by peasants. It may represent a significant change from an earlier time when a man&#x27;s kin were expected to support him with oaths.

The laws made separate provision for Ine&#x27;s English and British subjects, favouring the former over the latter; the weregilds paid for Britons were half of those paid for Saxons of the same social class, and their oaths also counted for less. The evidence they provide for the incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into placename history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that the western part of Wessex was thinly settled by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued. It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine&#x27;s Germanic subjects is &quot;Englisc&quot;. This reflects the existence, even at this early date, of a common English identity encompassing all the Germanic peoples of Britain.

== Christianity ==
Ine was a Christian king, who ruled as a patron and protector of the church. The introduction to his laws names his advisors, among whom are Eorcenwald, Bishop of London and Hædde, Bishop of Winchester; Ine says that the laws were also made with the advice and instruction of &quot;all my ealdormen, and chief councillors of my people, and also a great assembly of the servants of God&quot;. The laws themselves demonstrate Ine&#x27;s Christian convictions, specifying fines for failing to baptize infants or to tithe. Ine supported the church by patronising religious houses, especially in the new diocese of Sherborne, which had been divided from the diocese of Winchester in 705. Ine had opposed this division, ignoring threats of excommunication from Canterbury, but he agreed to it when Bishop Haedde died.

The first West Saxon nunneries were founded in Ine&#x27;s reign by Ine&#x27;s kinswoman, Bugga, the daughter of King Centwine, and by Ine&#x27;s sister Cuthburh, who founded the abbey of Wimborne at some point after she separated from her husband, King Aldfrith of Northumbria. At the bishop Aldhelm&#x27;s suggestion in 705, Ine built the church which later became Wells Cathedral, and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; also records that Ine built a minster at Glastonbury. This must refer to additional building or re-building since there was already a British monastery at Glastonbury.

Ine has been credited with supporting the establishment of an organized church in Wessex, though it is not clear that this was his initiative. He is also connected with the oldest known West Saxon synods, presiding at one himself and apparently addressing the assembled clerics.

There is a tradition that Ine was a saint, and was the dedicatee of St Ina&#x27;s Church in Llanina near New Quay, Wales. However, a more likely dedicatee for this church is the fifth century Welsh Saint Ina.

== Abdication, succession and life in Rome ==
In 726, Ine abdicated, with no obvious heir and, according to Bede, left his kingdom to &quot;younger men&quot; in order to travel, with his wife Æthelburg, to Rome where they both died; his predecessor, Cædwalla, had also abdicated to go to Rome and was baptized there by the pope. A pilgrimage to Rome was thought to aid one&#x27;s chance of a welcome in heaven, and according to Bede, many people went to Rome at this time for this reason: &quot;... both noble and simple, layfolk and clergy, men and women alike.&quot; Either Ine or Offa of Mercia is traditionally supposed to have founded the Schola Saxonum there, in what is today the Roman rione, or district, of Borgo. The Schola Saxonum took its name from the militias of Saxons who served in Rome, but it eventually developed into a hostelry for English visitors to the city. According to Roger of Wendover, Ine founded the Schola Saxonum in 727.

Ine&#x27;s successor was King Æthelheard; it is not known whether Æthelheard was related to Ine, though some later sources state that Æthelheard was Ine&#x27;s brother-in-law. Æthelheard&#x27;s succession to the throne was disputed by an ætheling, Oswald, and it may be that Mercian support for Æthelheard in the unsettled aftermath of Ine&#x27;s abdication both helped establish Æthelheard as king and also brought him into the sphere of influence of Æthelbald, the king of Mercia.

<doc id="145857" wikidata="Q465515" url="?curid=145857" title="Cynewulf of Wessex">
<text>Cynewulf was the King of Wessex from 757 until his death in 786. He ruled for about 29 years.

He was a direct male descendant of Cerdic. Cynewulf became king after his predecessor, Sigeberht, was deposed. He may have come to power under the influence of Æthelbald of Mercia since he was recorded as a witness to a charter of Æthelbald shortly thereafter. However, it was not long before Æthelbald was assassinated and as a consequence, Mercia fell into a brief period of disorder as rival claimants to its throne fought. Cynewulf took the opportunity to assert the independence of Wessex: in about 758 he took Berkshire from the Mercians. Cynewulf was also often at war with the Welsh.

In 779, Cynewulf was defeated by the new King of Mercia, Offa, at the Battle of Bensington, and Offa then retook Berkshire, and perhaps also London. Despite this defeat, there is no evidence to suggest Cynewulf subsequently became subject to Offa.

== Murder ==
In 786, Cynewulf was the victim of a surprise attack at his mistress&#x27;s house in Merton by Cyneheard, brother of the deposed Sigeberht. Both Cynewulf and Cyneheard were killed. Cynewulf was buried at Winchester.

== Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ==
Entry for the year 755 AD in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle:

A.D. 755. This year Cynewulf, with the consent of the West-Saxon council, deprived Sebright, his relative, for unrighteous deeds, of his kingdom, except Hampshire; which he retained, until he slew the alderman who remained the longest with him. Then Cynewulf drove him to the forest of Andred, where he remained, until a swain stabbed him at Privett river, and revenged the alderman, Cumbra. The same Cynewulf fought many hard battles with the Britons; and, about one and thirty winters after he had the kingdom, he was desirous of expelling a prince called Cyneard, who was the brother of Sebright. But he having understood that the king was gone, thinly attended, on a visit to a lady at Merton, rode after him, and beset him therein; surrounding the stronghold without, ere the attendants of the king were aware of him. When the king found this, he went out of doors, and defended himself with courage; till, having looked at the etheling (prince), he rushed out upon him and wounded him severely. Then were they all fighting against the king, until they had slain him. The king&#x27;s warriors were alerted by the woman&#x27;s cries to the tumult and, whosoever became ready fastest, ran to where the king lay slain. The etheling (prince) immediately offered them life and riches; which none of them would accept, but continued fighting together against him, till they all lay dead, except one British hostage, and he was severely wounded. When the king&#x27;s thanes that were behind heard in the morning that the king was slain, they rode to the spot, Osric his alderman, and Wiverth his thane, and the men that he had left behind previously; and they met the etheling at the town, where the king lay slain. The gates, however, were locked against them, which they attempted to force; but he promised them their own choice of money and land if they would grant him the kingdom; reminding them, that their relatives were already with him, who would never desert him. To which they answered, that no relative could be dearer to them than their lord, and that they would never follow his murderer. Then they offered that their relatives may have safe passage. They replied, that the same request was made to their comrades who were formerly with the king; &quot;And we are as regardless of the result,&quot; they rejoined, &quot;as our comrades who with the king were slain.&quot; Then they continued fighting at the gates, till they penetrated it, and slew the etheling and all the men that were with him; except one, who was the godson of the alderman, and whose life was spared, though he was often wounded. This same Cynewulf reigned one and thirty winters. His body lies at Winchester, and that of the etheling at Axminster. Their proper paternal ancestry goes in a direct line to Cerdic.

<text>Bricket Wood is a village in the county of Hertfordshire, England, south of St Albans city centre (though in said city&#x27;s contiguous built-up area) and north-northeast of Watford.

==History==
The area of Bricket Wood was mostly occupied by farmers until Bricket Wood railway station was built in 1861. In 1889, brothers Henry Gray and William Gray bought up land in the area and built Woodside Retreat Fairground. The fairground attracted hordes of visitors to the area from London and nearby towns and a small village developed around the station. In 1923, a rival fairground named Joyland was built nearby by R.B Christmas. Both resorts were closed in 1929, and Christmas used his leftover land for building bungalows.

During the 1930s, the area became popular with naturists after Charles Macaskie set up the naturist camp Spielplatz on the outskirts of the village. Naturists bought up plots of land on the edge of the village and built their own communities, which at first did not have electricity or running water. The village also began to attract Wiccans after Gerald Gardner set up the Bricket Wood coven.

During the 1950s, housing estates were built for employees of aviation company Handley Page, who had a plant at nearby Radlett. More estates then followed, aimed at commuters desiring housing near the Green Belt with convenient access to London.

==Civil organisation and notable buildings==
Bricket Wood is in the civil parish of St. Stephen, part of the St Albans district which shares provision of local government services with Hertfordshire County Council.

St Luke&#x27;s Church is the Anglican place of worship. The local primary school is Mount Pleasant Lane, situated in grounds that include a small pond.

Close to the village stands Hanstead House, built by Sir David Yule in 1925, who is buried in the grounds. It formerly operated as the Hanstead Stud, breeding Arab horses, as the UK campus of the Worldwide Church of God&#x27;s Ambassador College, and as a corporate training centre. In 2022 it was converted into luxury apartments.

==Transport==
Bricket Wood railway station is served by a West Midlands Trains stopping service on the Abbey Line that runs between and ; both towns are three stops away with a frequent service. The station building was taken into private ownership in 2018, and is being developed into a sympathetic recreation of its original appearance. It will be a village hub and meeting room, as well as a station.

== Morris Dancing ==
The village is home to the Morris Dancing team, Wicket Brood Border Morris.

==Common==
Bricket Wood Common is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Notable residents==
*Frank Turner (1922–2010), three-time Olympic gymnast, died at his home in the village.
*Ralph Coates, footballer who played for England and Tottenham Hotspur, lived in the village until his death in December 2010.

<text>Noel Andrew Stephen Jones (December 22, 1940 – November 21, 1995) was an Indian-born British diplomat, British ambassador to Kazakhstan from 1993 to 1995. He was the first British ambassador to have come from an ethnic minority.

His father, Ernest Walter Jones, was a domiciled European who worked in the Telegraph Department in India; his mother, Merlyn Edith Jones (&quot;née&quot; Jones), was an Anglo-Indian woman, daughter of a Postmaster of Madras.

Noel Jones came to live in England, where he married Jean Rosemary Cheval.

He entered the diplomatic service and was appointed British ambassador to Kazakhstan in 1993. His career was cut short by his death in 1995, at the age of 54. He was survived by his widow, Jean, and his children Mark and Alison.

<text>The heads of British diplomatic missions are persons appointed as senior diplomats to individual nations, or international organizations. They are usually appointed as ambassadors, except in member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations where a high commissioner is appointed. The head of mission to an international organization is usually a permanent representative. For some nations a consul or consul-general is appointed.

The positions have a dual role, being representatives of the British monarchy and the British government; they are recommended by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and then approved by Buckingham Palace.

== Resident heads of mission ==
 


==Non-resident heads of mission==
The United Kingdom does not maintain a full embassy or High Commission in a number of countries. In each of these cases the head of mission to another country, usually a neighbouring one, is also accredited to the other country (except, at present, for the ambassadors to Haiti and Honduras, who are dedicated but non-resident). In most cases a smaller, local mission provides for emergencies, and is headed by a lesser diplomat or a member of the local British community.

In April 2018 the Foreign Secretary announced the opening of nine new diplomatic posts across the Commonwealth. As a result, some countries which currently have non-resident High Commissioners are to receive resident High Commissioners. The expected dates of residence are noted below for those countries where an appointment has been announced.

<doc id="145865" wikidata="Q27084" url="?curid=145865" title="Parts-per notation">
<text>In science and engineering, the parts-per notation is a set of pseudo-units to describe small values of miscellaneous dimensionless quantities, e.g. mole fraction or mass fraction. Since these fractions are quantity-per-quantity measures, they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement. Commonly used are parts-per-million (ppm, ), parts-per-billion (ppb, ), parts-per-trillion (ppt, ) and parts-per-quadrillion (ppq, ). This notation is not part of the International System of Units (SI) system and its meaning is ambiguous.

== Applications ==
Parts-per notation is often used describing dilute solutions in chemistry, for instance, the relative abundance of dissolved minerals or pollutants in water. The quantity &quot;1 ppm&quot; can be used for a mass fraction if a water-borne pollutant is present at one-millionth of a gram per gram of sample solution. When working with aqueous solutions, it is common to assume that the density of water is 1.00 g/mL. Therefore, it is common to equate 1 kilogram of water with 1 L of water. Consequently, 1 ppm corresponds to 1 mg/L and 1 ppb corresponds to 1 μg/L.

Similarly, parts-per notation is used also in physics and engineering to express the value of various proportional phenomena. For instance, a special metal alloy might expand 1.2 micrometers per meter of length for every degree Celsius and this would be expressed as Parts-per notation is also employed to denote the change, stability, or uncertainty in measurements. For instance, the accuracy of land-survey distance measurements when using a laser rangefinder might be 1 millimeter per kilometer of distance; this could be expressed as &quot;Accuracy = 1 ppm.&quot;

Parts-per notations are all dimensionless quantities: in mathematical expressions, the units of measurement always cancel. In fractions like &quot;2 nanometers per meter&quot; so the quotients are pure-number coefficients with positive values less than or equal to 1. When parts-per notations, including the percent symbol (%), are used in regular prose (as opposed to mathematical expressions), they are still pure-number dimensionless quantities. However, they generally take the literal &quot;parts per&quot; meaning of a comparative ratio (e.g. &quot;2 ppb&quot; would generally be interpreted as &quot;two parts in a billion parts&quot;).

Parts-per notations may be expressed in terms of any unit of the same measure. For instance, the expansion coefficient of some brass alloy, may be expressed as 18.7 (μm/m)/°C, or as 18.7 (μ in/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of length.
Similarly, a metering pump that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate is doing so at a rate that may be expressed in a variety of volumetric units, including 125 cm3/m3, etc.

In nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), chemical shift is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument&#x27;s magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely more than a few hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a dimensionless quantity that does not depend on the instrument&#x27;s field strength.

==Parts-per expressions==
*&quot;One part per hundred&quot; is generally represented by the percent sign (%) and denotes one part per 100 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about fourteen minutes out of one day.

*&quot;One part per thousand&quot; should generally be spelled out in full and not as &quot;ppt&quot; (which is usually understood to represent &quot;parts per trillion&quot;). It may also be denoted by the permille sign (‰). Note however, that specific disciplines such as oceanography, as well as educational exercises, do use the &quot;ppt&quot; abbreviation. &quot;One part per thousand&quot; denotes one part per 1,000 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about ninety seconds out of one day.
*&quot;One part per ten thousand&quot; is denoted by the permyriad sign (‱). Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per 10,000 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day. In contrast, in finance, the basis point is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates (although it can also be used in other cases where it is desirable to express quantities in hundredths of a percent). For instance, a change in an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points (per annum). As with interest rates, the words &quot;per annum&quot; (or &quot;per year&quot;) are often omitted. In that case, the basis point is a quantity with a dimension of (time−1).
* &quot;One part per hundred thousand&quot;, &quot;per cent mille&quot; (pcm) or &quot;milli-percent&quot; denotes one part per 100,000 () parts, and a value of . It is commonly used in epidemiology for mortality, crime and disease prevalence rates, and nuclear reactor engineering as a unit of reactivity. In time measurement it is equivalent to about 5 minutes out of a year; in distance measurement, it is equivalent to 1 cm of error per km of distance traversed.

* &quot;One part per million&quot; (ppm) denotes one part per 1,000,000 () parts, and a value of . It is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year or 1 mm of error per km of distance traversed. In mining, it is also equivalent to one gram per metric ton, expressed as g/t.

* &quot;One part per billion&quot; (ppb) denotes one part per 1,000,000,000 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about three seconds out of a century.

* &quot;One part per trillion&quot; (ppt) denotes one part per 1,000,000,000,000 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about thirty seconds out of every million years.

* &quot;One part per quadrillion&quot; (ppq) denotes one part per 1,000,000,000,000,000 () parts, and a value of . This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the age of the Earth (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed. 

== Criticism ==
Although the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (an international standards organization known also by its French-language initials BIPM) recognizes the use of parts-per notation, it is not formally part of the International System of Units (SI). Note that although &quot;percent&quot; (%) is not formally part of the SI, both the BIPM and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) take the position that &quot;in mathematical expressions, the internationally recognized symbol % (percent) may be used with the SI to represent the number 0.01&quot; for dimensionless quantities. According to IUPAP, &quot;a continued source of annoyance to unit purists has been the continued use of percent, ppm, ppb, and ppt&quot;. Although SI-compliant expressions should be used as an alternative, the parts-per notation remains nevertheless widely used in technical disciplines. The main problems with the parts-per notation are set out below.

=== Long and short scales ===

Because the named numbers starting with a &quot;billion&quot; have different values in different countries, the BIPM suggests avoiding the use of &quot;ppb&quot; and &quot;ppt&quot; to prevent misunderstanding. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) takes the stringent position, stating that &quot;the language-dependent terms [...] are not acceptable for use with the SI to express the values of quantities&quot;.

=== Thousand vs. trillion ===
Although &quot;ppt&quot; usually means &quot;parts per trillion&quot;, it occasionally means &quot;parts per thousand&quot;. Unless the meaning of &quot;ppt&quot; is defined explicitly, it has to be determined from the context.

=== Mass fraction vs. mole fraction vs. volume fraction ===
Another problem of the parts-per notation is that it may refer to mass fraction, mole fraction or volume fraction. Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the units out, such as kg/kg, mol/mol or m3/m3, even though they are all dimensionless. The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases, and it is very important to specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas CFC-11 in air (Molar mass of CFC-11 / Mean molar mass of air = 137.368 / 28.97 = 4.74). For volume fraction, the suffix &quot;V&quot; or &quot;v&quot; is sometimes appended to the parts-per notation (e.g. ppmV, ppbv, pptv). However, ppbv and pptv are usually used to mean mole fractions&quot;volume fraction&quot; would literally mean what volume of a pure substance is included in a given volume of a mixture, and this is rarely used except in the case of alcohol by volume.

To distinguish the mass fraction from volume fraction or mole fraction, the letter &quot;w&quot; (standing for &quot;weight&quot;) is sometimes added to the abbreviation (e.g. ppmw, ppbw).

The usage of the parts-per notation is generally quite fixed within each specific branch of science, but often in a way that is inconsistent with its usage in other branches, leading some researchers to assume that their own usage (mass/mass, mol/mol, volume/volume, mass/volume, or others) is correct and that other usages are incorrect. This assumption sometimes leads them to not specify the details of their own usage in their publications, and others may therefore misinterpret their results. For example, electrochemists often use volume/volume, while chemical engineers may use mass/mass as well as volume/volume, while chemists, the field of occupational safety and the field of permissible exposure limit (e.g. permitted gas exposure limit in air) may use mass/volume. Unfortunatelly, many academic publications of otherwise excellent level fail to specify their use of the parts-per notation, which irritates some readers, especially those who are not experts in the particular fields in those publications, because parts-per-notation, without specifying what it stands for, can mean anything.

== SI-compliant expressions ==
SI-compliant units that can be used as alternatives are shown in the chart below. Expressions that the BIPM explicitly does not recognize as being suitable for denoting dimensionless quantities with the SI are marked with !.

Note that the notations in the &quot;SI units&quot; column above are for the most part dimensionless quantities; that is, the units of measurement factor out in expressions like &quot;1 nm/m&quot; (1 nm/m =1 × 10−9) so the ratios are pure-number coefficients with values less than 1.

==Uno (proposed dimensionless unit)==
Because of the cumbersome nature of expressing certain dimensionless quantities per SI guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed the adoption of the special name &quot;uno&quot; (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in dimensionless quantities. In 2004, a report to the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) stated that the response to the proposal of the uno &quot;had been almost entirely negative&quot;, and the principal proponent &quot;recommended dropping the idea&quot;. To date, the uno has not been adopted by any standards organization.

<text>Spielplatz (German for playground) is the longest-operating naturist resort in United Kingdom, and consists of located in the village of Bricket Wood, in the English county of Hertfordshire. As of 2021, the resort consists of 65 houses.

== History ==
Spielplatz was founded in 1929 by Charles Macaskie and his wife Dorothy. They moved from London into a tent on an area of virgin woodland they purchased near Bricket Wood. They called their utopian camp the &quot;Green Monastery&quot; and a &quot;Play Place&quot; (Spielplatz).

They were joined by other couples and individuals on weekends. Among their visitors until 1947 was Ross Nichols, founder of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. In turn he attracted both fellow Druids and Gerald Gardner, who later established his first coven at Bricket Wood in his development of Wicca as a modern religion.

It was at Spielplatz that Ross Nichols first met Gerald Gardner.
Spielplatz has featured in TV and films such as &quot;Naked as Nature Intended&quot; (1961) starring club member Pamela Green, &quot;Nudist Memories&quot; (1959) and &quot;Confetti&quot; (2006).

In 1956, The Naturist Ltd. published &quot;Nudist Life at Spielplatz&quot;, &quot;The Story of a Modern Experiment in the Art of Living&quot; by Charles Sennet, with a supplement of photographs by Stephen Glass. 

In 1957 the documentary series &quot;Out of Step&quot; on ITV, the investigative reporter Dan Farson visited Spielplatz Naturist Club in Bricket Wood and interviewed Charles Macaskie, Mrs. Macaskie, and their daughter Iseult. It is claimed the programme was the first showing of a naked woman on British television.

<doc id="145871" wikidata="Q3110969" url="?curid=145871" title="Æthelnoth (archbishop of Canterbury)">
<text>Æthelnoth (died 1038) was the archbishop of Canterbury from 1020 until his death. Descended from an earlier English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to becoming archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome and brought back saint&#x27;s relics. He consecrated a number of other bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little evidence of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.

==Early life==

Æthelnoth was a son of the Æthelmær the Stout and a grandson of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of King Æthelred of Wessex. In the view of the historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan is said to have prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.

Æthelnoth became a monk at Glastonbury, then was made dean of the monastery of Christ Church Priory, at Canterbury, the cathedral chapter for the diocese of Canterbury. He was also a chaplain to King Cnut of England and Denmark as well as Dean of Canterbury when on 13 November 1020 Æthelnoth was consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury. Æthelnoth&#x27;s elevation probably was a gesture of appeasement, as Æthelnoth&#x27;s brother Æthelweard had been executed in 1017 by Cnut, who also banished a brother-in-law named Æthelweard in 1020. A later story stated that Cnut favoured Æthelnoth because Æthelnoth had bestowed chrism on the king. This may be a garbled account of Æthelnoth&#x27;s participation in Cnut&#x27;s confirmation as a Christian in 1016 or his coronation in 1017. There are some indications that he was a student of Ælfric of Eynsham, the homilist.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

In 1022, Æthelnoth went to Rome to obtain the pallium, and was received by Pope Benedict VIII. On his return trip, he bought a relic of St Augustine of Hippo for 100 silver talents and one gold talent. He gave the relic to Coventry Abbey. He also presided over the translation of the relics of Ælfheah, his predecessor at Canterbury who was regarded as a martyr and saint. In 1022, Æthelnoth consecrated Gerbrand as bishop for the Diocese of Roskilde, which was in Scandinavia. The archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen was the metropolitan of Roskilde, and the fact that Gerbrand was consecrated by an English archbishop later caused friction between the bishop and his metropolitan. Cnut was forced to concede that in the future he would not appoint bishops in Bremen&#x27;s archdiocese without the metropolitan&#x27;s advice. A later tradition held that Æthelnoth consecrated two Welsh bishops, one at Llandaff and one at St. David&#x27;s. He also consecrated Dúnán, the first bishop of Dublin, and other Scandinavian bishops.

The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury praised Æthelnoth&#x27;s wisdom. A story of doubtful authenticity tells how he refused to crown King Harold Harefoot, as he had promised Cnut to crown none but a son of the king by his wife, Emma. He was a leading figure in the third generation of the English Benedictine Reform.

==Death and legacy==

Æthelnoth died in 1038, on either 28 October, 29 October, 30 October, or 1 November. Prior to his death, some of his episcopal functions were performed by a royal priest, Eadsige. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. He is considered a saint, with a feast day of 30 October. While he is listed in Jean Mabillon&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Benedictine Saints&quot; and in the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, there is no contemporary or later evidence of a cult being paid to him at Canterbury or elsewhere.

<text>Margaret Brown (née Tobin; July 18, 1867 – October 26, 1932), posthumously known as the &quot;Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, was an American socialite and philanthropist. She was a survivor of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, which sank in 1912, and she unsuccessfully urged the crew in Lifeboat No. 6 to return to the debris field to look for survivors. 

During her lifetime, her friends called her &quot;Maggie&quot;, but by her death, obituaries referred to her as the &quot;Unsinkable Mrs. Brown&quot;. Gene Fowler referred to her as &quot;Molly Brown&quot; in his 1933 book &quot;Timberline&quot;. The following year, she was referred to as the &quot;Unsinkable Mrs. Brown&quot; and &quot;Molly Brown&quot; in newspapers.

==Early life==
Margaret Tobin was born on July 18, 1867, near the Mississippi River in Hannibal, Missouri, on Denkler&#x27;s Alley. The three-room cottage where she was born is now the Molly Brown Birthplace and Museum; it is on 600 Butler Street in Hannibal. Her parents were Irish Catholic immigrants John Tobin and Johanna (Collins) Tobin. Her siblings were Daniel Tobin, Michael Tobin, William Tobin, and Helen Tobin. Both of Margaret&#x27;s parents had previously been married to other spouses who had died. Brown had two half-sisters: Catherine Bridget Tobin, by her father&#x27;s first marriage, and Mary Ann Collins, by her mother&#x27;s first marriage. Called Maggie by her family, she attended her maternal aunt Mary O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s grammar school, which was across the street from her home. Nearby was also the Hannibal Gas Works where her father worked as a laborer. Their neighborhood was a tight-knit Irish Catholic community, where people traveled westward through the town for the gold fields.

At age 18, Margaret relocated to Leadville, Colorado, with her siblings Daniel Tobin, Mary Ann Collins Landrigan, and Mary Ann&#x27;s husband John Landrigan. Margaret and her brother Daniel shared a two-room log cabin, and she found work sewing carpets and draperies at a dry goods store, Daniels, Fisher and Smith. Daniel was a miner.

==Marriage and children==

In Leadville, she met and married James Joseph Brown (1854–1922), nicknamed &quot;J.J.&quot;, an imaginative, self-educated man. He was not a rich man, and she married J.J. for love. After his death she said,

Margaret and J.J. married in Leadville Annunciation Church on September 1, 1886. They had two children: Lawrence Palmer Brown (1887–1949), known as Larry, and Catherine Ellen Brown (1889–1969), known as Helen. They also raised three of their nieces: Grace, Florence, and Helen Tobin.

==Mining success==
In 1893, the Brown family acquired great wealth when J.J.&#x27;s mining engineering efforts proved instrumental in the exploration of a substantial ore seam at the Little Jonny Mine. His employer, Ibex Mining Company, awarded him 12,500 shares of stock and a seat on the board. In Leadville, Margaret helped by working in soup kitchens to assist miners&#x27; families.
In 1894, the Browns bought a Victorian mansion, now known as the Molly Brown House, in Denver for US$30,000 (). In 1897, they built a summer house, Avoca Lodge, in Southwest Denver near Bear Creek, which gave the family more social opportunities. Margaret became a charter member of the Denver Woman&#x27;s Club, whose mission was the improvement of women&#x27;s lives by continuing education and philanthropy. Adjusting to the trappings of a society lady, Brown became immersed in the arts and fluent in French, German, Italian, and Russian. Brown co-founded a branch in Denver of the Alliance Française to promote her love of French culture. She lobbied for women&#x27;s right to vote.

J.J. was not interested in the social life that Brown enjoyed and the couple began to drift apart. After 23 years of marriage, Margaret and J.J. privately signed a separation agreement in 1909. She received a US$700 monthly allowance () to continue her travels and political work.

Brown assisted in fundraising for Denver&#x27;s Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, which was completed in 1911. She also worked with Judge Ben Lindsey to help destitute children and establish one of the United States&#x27; first juvenile courts.

==Passenger on the &quot;Titanic&quot;==
Brown spent the first months of 1912 in Paris, visiting her daughter and as part of the John Jacob Astor IV party, until she received word from Denver that her eldest grandchild, Lawrence Palmer Brown Jr., was ill. She immediately booked passage on the first available liner leaving for New York, the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Originally, her daughter Helen was supposed to accompany her, but Helen, who had studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, decided to take a side trip to London with friends. Brown boarded the &quot;Titanic&quot; as a first-class passenger on the evening of April 10, conveyed aboard the tender SS &quot;Nomadic&quot; at Cherbourg, France, and sailed for New York City that night.

The &quot;Titanic&quot; sank early on April 15, 1912, at around 2:20 a.m., after striking an iceberg at around 11:40 p.m. the previous night. Brown helped other people board the lifeboats but was finally persuaded to abandon ship in lifeboat no. 6. More than 1,500 aboard RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; perished; there were a total of 2,224 people on the ship. 

After her death in 1932, Brown was called &quot;Molly Brown&quot; and &quot;The Unsinkable Mrs. Brown&quot; by authors because she helped in the ship&#x27;s evacuation, taking an oar herself in her lifeboat and urging the lifeboat crew to go back and save more passengers. Her urgings were met with opposition from Quartermaster Robert Hichens, the crewman in charge of lifeboat 6. Hichens was fearful that if they were to go back, the lifeboat would either be pulled down due to suction, or those in the water would swamp the boat in an effort to get in. After several attempts to urge Hichens to turn back, Brown threatened to throw him overboard.

Upon being rescued by the ship RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot;, Brown proceeded to organize a committee with other first-class survivors. The committee worked to secure basic necessities for the second- and third-class survivors, and even provided informal counseling.

==Later life and death==
In 1914, six years before the Nineteenth Amendment granted women the right to vote, Brown ran for Colorado&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat, but she ended her campaign to serve abroad as the director of the American Committee for Devastated France during World War I. Also in 1914, she contributed to miners and their families after the 1914 Ludlow Massacre and she helped organize the International Women&#x27;s Rights conference that year, which was held in Newport, Rhode Island.

During and after World War I, she worked in France with the Red Cross and later with the American Committee for Devastated France to help wounded French and American soldiers and rebuild areas behind the front line. For her work organizing female ambulance drivers, nurses, and food distributors, Brown was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1932. 

J.J. Brown died on September 5, 1922. Margaret told newspapers, that although she had met royalty and other great people around the world, &quot;I&#x27;ve never met a finer, bigger, more worthwhile man than J.J. Brown.&quot; J.J. Brown left vast, yet complicated, real estate, mining, and stock holdings. It was unknown to the Browns and their lawyers how much was left in the estate. Prior to J.J.&#x27;s death, he had transferred a large amount of money to his children. Their children were also unaware of how much money Margaret had, but were displeased at the large amounts she spent on charity. Margaret Brown and her children fought in court for six years to settle the estate.

In the 1920s, Margaret Brown focused her energy on personal passions, especially the theater. She died in her sleep at 10:55 p.m. on October 26, 1932, at age 65, in New York City&#x27;s Barbizon Hotel. Subsequent autopsy revealed a brain tumor. She was buried next to J.J. at St. Brigid&#x27;s cemetery, now known as Cemetery of the Holy Rood, in Westbury, New York, following a small ceremony on October 31, 1932, attended by close friends and family. There was singing, but no eulogy.

==Legacy==
Brown’s fame as a &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor helped her promote the philanthropic and activism issues she felt strongly about. She was concerned about the rights of workers and women, education and literacy for children, historic preservation, and commemoration of the bravery and chivalry displayed by the men aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot;.
Avoca Lodge, known as The Molly Brown Summer House, is in southwest Denver, Colorado near Bear Creek; the home served as a summer retreat for Brown and her husband James Joseph Brown. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

The three-room cottage where Brown was born is now the Molly Brown Birthplace and Museum; it sat at 600 Butler Street in Hannibal, Missouri until 2024.After dealing with issues of black mold for years, on December 17, 2024 the Molly Brown Birthplace was moved to Main Street in Hannibal, across the street from the Mark Twain boyhood home.

The theme park Disneyland Paris features a 19th-century riverboat attraction, the Molly Brown Riverboat, named after her.

In 1965, astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young named their Gemini spacecraft &quot;Molly Brown&quot; in her honor.

Brown’s Denver, Colorado home has been a museum since 1971. It is called the Molly Brown House Museum. There is a trail marker outside it as part of the National Votes for Women Trail; the marker was stolen in November 2023, but was found later that month.

In 1985, Brown was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="145875" wikidata="Q616117" url="?curid=145875" title="Stigand">
<text>Stigand (died 1072) was an Anglo-Saxon churchman in pre-Norman Conquest England who became Archbishop of Canterbury. His birth date is unknown, but by 1020 he was serving as a royal chaplain and advisor. He was named Bishop of Elmham in 1043, and was later Bishop of Winchester and Archbishop of Canterbury. Stigand was an advisor to several members of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. Excommunicated by several popes for his pluralism in holding the two sees, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror. Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester, where he died.

Stigand served King Cnut as a chaplain at a royal foundation at Ashingdon in 1020, and as an advisor then and later. He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut&#x27;s sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut. When Cnut&#x27;s stepson Edward the Confessor succeeded Harthacnut, Stigand in all probability became England&#x27;s main administrator. Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church, and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand&#x27;s were the royal estates and those of Harold Godwinson.

In 1043 Edward appointed Stigand to the see of Elmham. Four years later he was appointed to the see of Winchester, and then in 1052 to the archdiocese of Canterbury, which Stigand held jointly with Winchester. It was later claimed that five successive popes, including Nicholas II and Alexander II, excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury, but there is no evidence for this. Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066. After Harold&#x27;s death, Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror. On Christmas Day 1066 Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned William King of England. Stigand&#x27;s excommunication meant that he could only assist at the coronation.

Despite growing pressure for his deposition, Stigand continued to attend the royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of the view that the English church was backward and needed reform.

==Early life==
Neither the year nor the date of Stigand&#x27;s birth is known. He was born in East Anglia, possibly in Norwich, to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is shown by the fact that Stigand&#x27;s name was Norse but his brother&#x27;s was English. His brother Æthelmær, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is unrecorded.

Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England (reigned 1016–1035). In that year he was appointed to Cnut&#x27;s church at Ashingdon, or Assandun, which was dedicated by the reforming bishop Wulfstan of York. Little is known of Stigand&#x27;s life during Cnut&#x27;s reign, but he must have had a place at the royal court, as he witnessed occasional charters. Following Cnut&#x27;s death Stigand successively served Cnut&#x27;s sons, Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035–1040) and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042). After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to Emma of Normandy, Cnut&#x27;s widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor. He may have been Emma&#x27;s chaplain, and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive, and that he owed his position at Ashingdon to Emma&#x27;s influence and favour. Because little is known of Stigand&#x27;s activities before his appointment as a bishop, it is difficult to determine to whom he owed his position.

==Bishop of Elmham and Winchester==
Stigand was appointed to the see of Elmham shortly after Edward the Confessor&#x27;s coronation on 3 April 1043, probably on Emma&#x27;s advice. This was the first episcopal appointment of Edward&#x27;s reign. The diocese of Elmham covered East Anglia in eastern England, and was one of the poorer episcopal sees at that time. He was consecrated bishop in 1043, but later that year Edward deposed Stigand and deprived him of his wealth. During the next year, however, Edward returned Stigand to office. The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the simultaneous fall from power of the dowager queen, Emma. Some sources state that Emma had invited King Magnus I of Norway, a rival claimant to the English throne, to invade England and had offered her personal wealth to aid Magnus. Some suspected that Stigand had urged Emma to support Magnus, and claimed that his deposition was because of this. Contributing factors in Emma and Stigand&#x27;s fall included Emma&#x27;s wealth, and dislike of her political influence, which was linked to the reign of the unpopular Harthacnut.

By 1046 Stigand had begun to witness charters of Edward the Confessor, showing that he was once again in royal favour. In 1047 Stigand was translated to the see of Winchester, but he retained Elmham until 1052. He may have owed the preferment to Earl Godwin of Wessex, the father-in-law of King Edward, although that is disputed by some historians. Emma, who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward&#x27;s favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either alone or in concert with Godwin. After his appointment to Winchester, Stigand was a witness to all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052.

Some historians, such as Frank Barlow and Emma Mason, state that Stigand supported Earl Godwin in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor in 1051–1052; others, including Ian Walker, hold that he was neutral. Stigand, whether or not he was a supporter of Godwin&#x27;s, did not go into exile with the earl. The quarrel started over a fight between Eustace of Boulogne, brother-in-law of the king, and men of the town of Dover. The king ordered Godwin to punish the town, and the earl refused. Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin&#x27;s position, and the earl and his family fled England in 1051. The earl returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king. Some medieval sources state that Stigand took part in the negotiations that reached a peace between the king and his earl; the Canterbury manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; calls Stigand the king&#x27;s chaplain and advisor during the negotiations.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

===Appointment to Canterbury and issues with the papacy===
The Archbishopric of Canterbury became drawn into the conflict between Edward and Godwin. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform. Leo first focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony – the buying and selling of clerical and ecclesiastical offices. In 1049 Leo IX publicly pronounced that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. When Archbishop Edsige of Canterbury died in 1051 the monks of the cathedral chapter elected Æthelric, a relative of Earl Godwin&#x27;s, as archbishop. King Edward opposed the election and instead appointed Robert of Jumièges, who was Norman and already Bishop of London. Besides furthering Edward&#x27;s quarrel with Godwin, the appointment signalled that there were limits to Edward&#x27;s willingness to compromise on ecclesiastical reform.

Although not known as a reformer before his appointment, Robert returned in 1051 from Rome, where he had gone to be confirmed by the papacy, and opposed the king&#x27;s choice for Bishop of London on the grounds that the candidate was not suitable. Robert&#x27;s attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king. When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled, following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric. The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand&#x27;s support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the crisis in 1052. Stigand was the first non-monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of Dunstan (archbishop from 959 to 988).

The papacy refused to recognise Stigand&#x27;s elevation, as Robert was still alive and had not been deprived of office by a pope. Robert of Jumièges appealed to Leo IX, who summoned Stigand to Rome. When Stigand did not appear, he was excommunicated. Historian Nicholas Brooks holds the view that Stigand was not excommunicated at this time, but rather was ordered to refrain from any archiepiscopal functions, such as the consecration of bishops. He argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with Stigand, something they would not have done had he been excommunicated. The legates did nothing to alter Stigand&#x27;s position either, although one of the legates later helped depose Stigand in 1070. However Pope Leo IX and his successors, Victor II and Stephen IX, continued to regard Stigand as uncanonically elected.

Stigand did not travel to Rome to receive a pallium, the band worn around the neck that is the symbol of an archbishop&#x27;s authority, from the pope. Travelling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom, practised by a number of his predecessors. Instead, some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges&#x27; pallium. It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment. Owing to the reform movement, Stigand probably knew the request would be unsuccessful. In 1058 Antipope Benedict X, who opposed much of the reform movement, gave Stigand a pallium. However, Benedict was deposed the following year; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope, and nullified all his acts, including Stigand&#x27;s pallium grant. The exact circumstances that led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown, whether it was at Stigand&#x27;s request or was given without prompting.

After his translation to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to his brother Æthelmær but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury may not have been secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II, and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand&#x27;s position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.

Stigand was later accused of simony by monastic chroniclers, but all such accusations date to after 1066, and are thus suspect owing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward. The medieval chronicler William of Poitiers also claimed that in 1052 Stigand agreed that William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, should succeed King Edward. This claim was used as propaganda after the Conquest, but according to the historian David Bates, among others, it is unlikely to be true. The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.

===Ecclesiastical affairs===
The diocese of York took advantage of Stigand&#x27;s difficulties with the papacy and encroached on the suffragans, or bishops owing obedience to an archbishop, normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with Worcester, but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed oversight over the sees of Lichfield and Dorchester. In 1062 papal legates of Alexander II came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop. He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council.

Many of the bishops in England did not want to be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so the charge is suspect.

Stigand was probably the most lavish clerical donor of his period when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale. He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely, and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely, St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and to his cathedral church at Winchester. The crucifixes given to Ely, Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life-size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and John the Evangelist, as is recorded in the monastic histories, and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere. These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a wooden core. No comparably early rood crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive, though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like the German Gero Cross of around 980, and the Volto Santo of Lucca (renewed with a later figure) which is known to have inspired Leofstan, Abbot of Bury (d. 1065) to create a similar figure, perhaps covered in precious metal, on his return from a visit to Rome. To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar, and a chasuble embroidered in gold &quot;of such inestimable workmanship and worth, that none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable&quot;. Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome, there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage. A 12th-century life of Saint Willibrord, written at the Abbey of Echternach in what is now Luxembourg, records that &quot;to this place also came Stigand, the eminent archbishop of the English&quot;. In the work, Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints.

===Advisor to the king===
During Edward&#x27;s reign, Stigand was an influential advisor at court and used his position to increase his own wealth as well as that of his friends and family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.

Stigand may have been in charge of the royal administration. He may also have been behind the effort to locate Edward the Atheling and his brother Edmund after 1052, possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward. His landholdings were spread across ten counties, and in some of those counties, his lands were larger than the king&#x27;s holdings. Although Norman propagandists claimed that as early as 1051 or 1052 King Edward promised the throne of England to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King William the Conqueror, there is little contemporary evidence of such a promise from non-Norman sources. By 1053, Edward probably realised that he would not have a son from his marriage, and he and his advisors began to search for an heir. Edward the Atheling, the son of King Edmund Ironside (reigned 1016), had been exiled from England in 1017, after his father&#x27;s death. Although Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, went to the Continent in search of Edward the Exile, Ian Walker, the biographer of King Harold Godwinson, feels that Stigand was behind the effort. In the end, although Edward did return to England, he died soon after his return, leaving a young son Edgar the Ætheling.

==Final years and legacy==

===Norman Conquest===

King Edward, on his deathbed, left the crown to his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson, the son of Earl Godwin. Stigand performed the funeral services for Edward. Norman writers claimed that Stigand crowned Harold as king in January 1066. This is generally considered false propaganda, as it was in William&#x27;s interest to portray Harold as uncanonically crowned. If Harold was improperly crowned, then William was merely claiming his rightful inheritance, and not deposing a rightful king. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Stigand at Harold&#x27;s coronation, although not actually placing the crown on Harold&#x27;s head. The English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as improper. Current historical research has shown that the ceremony was performed by Ealdred, owing to the controversy about Stigand&#x27;s position. However, one historian, Pauline Stafford, theorises that both archbishops may have consecrated Harold. Another historian, Frank Barlow, writing in 1979, felt that the fact that some of the English sources do not name who consecrated Harold &quot;tip(s) the balance in favour of Stigand&quot;.

Stigand did support Harold, and was present at Edward the Confessor&#x27;s deathbed. Stigand&#x27;s controversial position may have influenced Pope Alexander II&#x27;s support of William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of England. The reformers, led by Archdeacon Hildebrand, later Pope Gregory VII, opposed the older type of bishop, rich and installed by the lay powers.

After the death of Harold at the Battle of Hastings, Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar, as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York, to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne. This plan did not come to fruition, however, due to opposition from the northern earls and some of the other bishops. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at Wallingford in early December 1066, and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066, although the coronation was performed by Ealdred. William took Stigand with him to Normandy in 1067, although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop, as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges, is uncertain. Stigand was present at the coronation of William&#x27;s queen, Matilda, in 1068, although once more the ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred.

===Deposition and death===

After the first rebellions broke out in late 1067 William adopted a policy of conciliation towards the church. He gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Ealdred of York and Æthelwig, Abbot of Evesham. Archbishop Stigand appears on several royal charters in 1069, along with both Norman and English leaders. He even consecrated Remigius de Fécamp as Bishop of Dorchester in 1067. Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand. At a council held at Winchester at Easter 1070, the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II. On 11 April 1070 Stigand was deposed by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, Bishop of Sion in the Alps, and was imprisoned at Winchester. His brother Æthelmær, Bishop of Elmham, was also deposed at the same council. Shortly afterward Aethelric the Bishop of Selsey, Ethelwin the Bishop of Durham and Leofwin Bishop of Lichfield, who was married, were deposed at a council held at Windsor. There were three reasons given for Stigand&#x27;s deposition: that he held the bishopric of Winchester in plurality with Canterbury; that he not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumièges fled but also seized Robert&#x27;s pallium which was left behind; and that he received his own pallium from Benedict X, an anti-pope. Some accounts state that Stigand did appear at the council which deposed him, but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted. The charges against his brother are nowhere stated, leading to a belief that the depositions were mainly political. That spring he had deposited his personal wealth at Ely Abbey for safekeeping, but King William confiscated it after his deposition, along with his estates. The king appointed Lanfranc, a native of Italy and a scholar and abbot in Normandy, as the new archbishop.

King William appears to have left the initiative for Stigand&#x27;s deposition to the papacy and did nothing to hinder Stigand&#x27;s authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand appears to have been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand&#x27;s treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.

Stigand died in 1072 while still imprisoned, and his death was commemorated on 21 February or 22 February. Sometime between his deposition and his death the widow of King Edward and sister of King Harold, Edith of Wessex, visited him in his imprisonment and allegedly told him to take better care of himself. He was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester.

At King Edward&#x27;s death, only the royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers condemned him for his greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth and how it was earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.

Although monastic chroniclers after the Norman Conquest accused him of crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any evidence of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II&#x27;s barons with Stigand&#x27;s fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views tend to see him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his &quot;whole career shows that he was essentially a politician&quot;. Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that &quot;Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power.&quot; Another historian, Eric John, said that &quot;Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom&quot;. However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that &quot;he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held&quot;. Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was &quot;unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms&quot;.

<text>Psychoanalytic theory is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development relating to the practice of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century (particularly in his 1899 book &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;), psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. The psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud&#x27;s death in 1939. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the psyche, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics.

==Definition==
Psychoanalytic and psychoanalytical are used in English. The latter is the older term, and at first, simply meant &#x27;relating to the analysis of the human psyche.&#x27; But with the emergence of psychoanalysis as a distinct clinical practice, both terms came to describe that. Although both are still used, today, the normal adjective is psychoanalytic.

Psychoanalysis is defined in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as
A therapeutic method, originated by Sigmund Freud, for treating mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the patient&#x27;s mind and bringing repressed fears and conflicts into the conscious mind, using techniques such as dream interpretation and free association. Also: a system of psychological theory is associated with this method.

==The beginnings==
Freud began his studies on psychoanalysis in collaboration with Dr. Josef Breuer, most notably in relation to the case study of Anna O. Anna O. was subject to a number of psychosomatic disturbances, such as not being able to drink out of fear. Breuer and Freud found that hypnosis was a great help in discovering more about Anna O. and her treatment. Freud frequently referred to the study on Anna O. in his lectures on the origin and development of psychoanalysis.

Observations in the Anna O. case led Freud to theorize that the problems faced by hysterical patients could be associated with painful childhood experiences that could not be recalled. The influence of these lost memories shaped the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of patients. These studies contributed to the development of the psychoanalytic theory.

==The unconscious==
In psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious mind consists of ideas and drives that have been subject to the mechanism of Repression: anxiety-producing impulses in childhood are barred from consciousness, but do not cease to exist, and exert a constant pressure in the direction of consciousness. However, the content of the unconscious is only knowable to consciousness through its representation in a disguised or distorted form, by way of dreams and neurotic symptoms, as well as in slips of the tongue and jokes. The psychoanalyst seeks to interpret these conscious manifestations in order to understand the nature of the repressed. In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, but rather that which is actively repressed from conscious thought. Freud viewed the unconscious as a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, anxiety-producing wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of consciousness by the mechanism of repression. Such unconscious mental processes can only be recognized through analysis of their effects in consciousness. Unconscious thoughts are not directly accessible to ordinary introspection, but they are capable of partially evading the censorship mechanism of repression in a disguised form, manifesting, for example, as dream elements or neurotic symptoms. Dreams and symptoms are supposed to be capable of being &quot;interpreted&quot; during psychoanalysis, with the help of methods such as free association, dream analysis, and analysis of verbal slips.

==Personality structure==
In Freud&#x27;s model the psyche consists of three different elements, the id, ego, and the superego. The id is the aspect of personality that is driven by internal and basic drives and needs, such as hunger, thirst, and the drive for sex, or libido. The id acts in accordance with the pleasure principle. Due to the instinctual quality of the id, it is impulsive and unaware of the implications of actions. The superego is driven by the morality principle. It enforces the morality of social thought and action on an intrapsychic level. It employs morality, judging wrong and right and using guilt to discourage socially unacceptable behavior.
The ego is driven by the reality principle. The ego seeks to balance the conflicting aims of the id and superego, by trying to satisfy the id&#x27;s drives in ways that are compatible with reality. The Ego is how we view ourselves: it is what we refer to as &#x27;I&#x27; (Freud&#x27;s word is the German &quot;ich&quot;, which simply means &#x27;I&#x27;).

==Defense mechanisms==
The ego balances demands of the id, the superego, and of reality to maintain a healthy state of consciousness, where there is only minimal intrapsychic conflict. It thus reacts to protect the individual from stressors and from anxiety by distorting internal or external reality to a lesser or greater extent. This prevents threatening unconscious thoughts and material from entering the consciousness. The ten different defence mechanisms initially enumerated by Anna Freud are: repression, regression, reaction formation, isolation of affect, undoing, projection, introjection, turning against the self, reversal into the opposite, and sublimation. In the same work, however, she details other manoeuvres such as identification with the aggressor and intellectualisation that would later come to be considered defence mechanisms in their own right. Furthermore, this list has been greatly expanded upon by other psychoanalysts, with some authors claiming to enumerate in excess of one hundred defence mechanisms.

==Psychology theories==

===Psychosexual development===
Freud&#x27;s take on the development of the personality (psyche). It is a stage theory that believes progress occurs through stages as the libido is directed to different body parts. The different stages, listed in order of progression, are Oral, Anal, Phallic (Oedipus complex), Latency, and Genital. The Genital stage is achieved if people meet all their needs throughout the other stages with enough available sexual energy. Individuals who do not meet their needs in a given stage become fixated or &quot;stuck&quot; in that stage.

===Neo-analytic theory===
Freud&#x27;s theory and work with psychosexual development led to Neo-Analytic/Neo-Freudians who also believed in the importance of the unconscious, dream interpretations, defense mechanisms, and the integral influence of childhood experiences but had objections to the theory as well. They do not support the idea that personality development stops at age 6. Instead, they believe development spreads across the lifespan. They extended Freud&#x27;s work and encompassed more influence from the environment and the importance of conscious thought and the unconscious. The most important theorists are Erik Erikson (Psychosocial Development), Anna Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and Karen Horney, and including the school of object relations. Erikson&#x27;s Psychosocial Development theory is based on eight stages of development. The stages are trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generatively vs. stagnation, and integrity vs. despair. These are important to the psychoanalytic theory because they describe the different stages that people go through in life. Each stage has a major impact on their life outcomes since they are going through conflicts at each stage and whichever route they decide to take, will have certain outcomes.

==Criticisms==

Some claim that the theory is lacking in empirical data and too focused on pathology. Other criticisms are that the theory lacks consideration of culture and its influence on personality.

Psychoanalytic theory comes from Freud and is focused on childhood. This might be an issue since most believe studying children can be inconclusive. One major concern lies in if observed personality will be a lifelong occurrence or if the child will shed it later in life.

== Application to the arts and humanities ==
Psychoanalytic theory is a major influence in Continental philosophy and in aesthetics in particular. Freud is sometimes considered a philosopher. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, and the philosophers Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida, have written extensively on how psychoanalysis informs philosophical analysis. Other philosophers such as Alain Badiou and Rafael Holmberg have argued that the meaning of psychoanalysis for philosophy was not immediately clear, but that they have come to reciprocally define each other. 

When analyzing literary texts, the psychoanalytic theory is sometimes used (often specifically with regard to the motives of the author and the characters) to reveal purported concealed meanings or to purportedly better understand the author&#x27;s intentions.

<text>Paleis Het Loo ( , meaning &quot;The &quot;) is a palace in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, built by the House of Orange-Nassau.

==History==
The symmetrical Dutch Baroque building was designed by Jacob Roman and Johan van Swieten and was built between 1684 and 1686 for stadtholder-king William III and his consort Mary II of England. The garden was designed by Claude Desgotz.
After the elder House of Orange-Nassau had become extinct with the death of William III in 1702, he left all his estates in the Netherlands to his cousin Johan Willem Friso of the House of Nassau-Dietz in his Last Will. However, Frederick I of Prussia claimed them, as he also descended from the princes of Orange, and the Houses of Orange-Nassau and Hohenzollern had, a few generations before, made an inheritance contract. Therefore, most of the older properties, though not including Het Loo, were in fact taken over by the Hohenzollerns, who never lived there. Johan Willem Friso&#x27;s son, William IV, Prince of Orange, finally took over Paleis Het Loo, Soestdijk Palace, as well as Huis ten Bosch Palace near The Hague. His widow later bought back several of the older properties in and around The Hague from Frederick William I of Prussia in 1732. 

Het Loo was much beloved by King William I, who remained its owner after he abdicated in the fall of 1840. A few years before, the King had permitted the ancient practice of falconry to be reinstated on the palace grounds. His grandsons William and Alexander became enthusiastic members of the Royal Loo Hawking Club, the latter serving as President from 1840 until his death in 1848. The falconry season drew a crowd of hunting enthusiasts to Het Loo every spring, including British nobles like the 7th Duke of Leeds. They stayed at hotels in Apeldoorn and held their meetings at the castle Het Oude Loo in the vicinity of the palace. After Prince Alexander&#x27;s death in 1848 the club quickly went into decline. It was abolished in 1855. King William III made an effort to keep the practice of falconry alive for a while afterwards, paying a falconer from his private funds. Like his grandfather he loved Het Loo and gladly spent much of his time living there as a country gentleman. William III, who was suffering from a kidney ailment, spent his last months at Het Loo and died there in November 1890.

The palace remained a summer-residence of the House of Orange-Nassau until the death of Queen Wilhelmina in 1962. In 1960 Queen Wilhelmina had declared that when she died the private estate surrounding the palace would go to the state. She did, however, request that it would be returned to her family if the Dutch were to abolish the monarchy. The former crown properties surrounding the palace became property of the Dutch state in 1962 when Wilhelmina died at Paleis Het Loo. Her daughter, Queen Juliana, never lived there, but her younger daughter, Princess Margriet, lived in the right wing until 1975.

The building was renovated between 1976 and 1982. Since 1984, the palace has been a state museum open to the general public, showing interiors with original furniture, objects and paintings of the House of Orange-Nassau. It also houses a library devoted to the House of Orange-Nassau and the &quot;Museum van de Kanselarij der Nederlandse Orden&quot; (Museum of the Netherlands Orders of Knighthood&#x27;s Chancellery) with books and other material concerning decorations and medals. The building is a &quot;rijksmonument&quot; and is among the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites.

==Architecture==

The Dutch Baroque architecture of Het Loo takes pains to minimize the grand stretch of its construction, so emphatic at Versailles, and present itself as just a fine gentleman&#x27;s residence. Het Loo is not a palace but, as the title of its engraved portrait (&quot;illustration, below&quot;) states, a &quot;Lust-hof&quot; (a retreat, or &quot;pleasure house&quot;). Nevertheless, it is situated &quot;entre cour et jardin&quot; (&quot;between courtyard and garden&quot;) as Versailles and its imitators, and even as fine Parisian private houses are. The dry paved and gravelled courtyard, lightly screened from the road by a wrought-iron grille, is domesticated by a traditional plat of box-bordered green, the homely touch of a cross in a circle one might find in a bourgeois garden. The volumes of the palace are rhythmically broken in their massing. They work down symmetrically, expressing the subordinate roles of their use and occupants, and the final outbuildings in Marot&#x27;s plan extend along the public thoroughfare, like a well-made and delightfully ordinary street.

In 2016, an international public competition was held concerning the renovation and extension of the house and the main courtyard. KAAN Architecten’s winning proposal, which opens to the public in April 2023, adds over 5000 square meters of new facilities and amenities, all placed underground and within the existing wings. The grass and gravel courtyard has been replaced with a large central fountain and skylight to a large ‘Grand Foyer’ where visitors can access the main house from new grand staircases as well as new temporary exhibit galleries.

==Garden==

The private &quot;Great Garden&quot; is situated behind the house. This Dutch Baroque garden, often nicknamed the &quot;Versailles of Holland&quot;, actually serves to show more differences than similarities. It is still within the general Baroque formula established by André Le Nôtre: perfect symmetry, axial layout radiating gravel walks, parterres with fountains, basins and statues.
The garden as it appears in the engraving was designed by Le Nôtre&#x27;s nephew, Claude Desgotz. Throughout his military and diplomatic career, William of Orange was the continental antagonist of Louis XIV, the commander of the forces opposed to those of absolute power and Roman Catholicism. André Le Nôtre&#x27;s main axis at Versailles, continued by the canal, runs up to the horizon. Daniel Marot and Desgotz&#x27;s Het Loo garden does not dominate the landscape as Louis&#x27; German imitators do, though in his idealized plan, Desgotz extends the axis. The main garden, with conservative rectangular beds instead of more elaborately shaped ones, is an enclosed space surrounded by raised walks, as a Renaissance garden might be, tucked into the woods for private enjoyment, the garden not of a king but of a stadtholder. At its far end a shaded crosswalk of trees disguised the central vista. The orange trees set out in wooden boxes and wintered in an orangery, which were a feature of all gardens, did double duty for the House of Orange-Nassau.

Outside the garden there are a few straight scenic avenues, for following the hunt in a carriage, or purely for the vista afforded by an avenue. Few of the &quot;green rooms&quot; cut into the woodlands in imitation of the &quot;cabinets de verdure&quot; of Versailles that are shown in the engraving were ever actually executed at Het Loo.

The patron of the Sun King&#x27;s garden was Apollo. Peter the Great would opt for Samson, springing the jaws of Sweden&#x27;s heraldic lion. William opted for Hercules.

In the 18th century, William III&#x27;s Baroque garden as seen in the engraving was replaced by an English landscape garden.

The lost gardens of Het Loo were fully restored beginning in 1970 and completed in time to celebrate the building&#x27;s 1984 tercentenary. Het Loo&#x27;s new brickwork, latticework and ornaments are as raw as they must have been in 1684 and will mellow with time.

<text>Michael William Balfe (15 May 1808 – 20 October 1870) was an Irish composer, best remembered for his operas, especially &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;.

After a short career as a violinist, Balfe pursued an operatic singing career, while he began to compose. In a career spanning more than 40 years, he composed at least 29 operas, almost 250 songs, several cantatas and other works. He was also a noted conductor, directing Italian Opera at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre for seven years, among other conducting posts.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Balfe was born in Dublin and grew up on Pitt Street, which was renamed Balfe Street in 1917 in his honour. His musical gifts became apparent at an early age, and he received instruction from his father, a dancing master and violinist, and from the composer William Rooke. Balfe&#x27;s family moved to Wexford when he was a child. Between 1814 and 1815, Balfe played the violin for his father&#x27;s dancing-classes, and at the age of seven composed a polacca.

In 1817, he appeared as a violinist in public, and in this year composed a ballad, first called &quot;Young Fanny&quot; and afterwards, when sung in &quot;Paul Pry&quot; by Madame Vestris, &quot;The Lovers&#x27; Mistake&quot;. In 1823, upon his father&#x27;s death, the teenaged Balfe moved to London and was engaged as a violinist in the orchestra of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He eventually became the leader of that orchestra. While there, he studied violin with Charles Edward Horn and composition with Charles Frederick Horn, the organist, from 1824, at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

While still playing the violin, Balfe pursued a career as an opera singer. He debuted unsuccessfully at Norwich in Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. In 1825, his wealthy patron Count Mazzara took him to Rome for vocal and musical studies and introduced him to Luigi Cherubini. Balfe also pursued composing: in Italy, he wrote his first dramatic work, a ballet, &quot;La Perouse&quot;. He became a protégé of Rossini&#x27;s, and at the close of 1827, he appeared as Figaro in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; at the Italian opera in Paris.

Balfe soon returned to Italy, where he was based for the next eight years, singing and composing several operas. He met Maria Malibran while singing at the Paris Opera during this period. In 1829 in Bologna, Balfe composed his first cantata for the soprano Giulia Grisi, then 18 years old. She performed it with the tenor Francesco Pedrazzi with much success. Balfe produced his first complete opera, &quot;I rivali di se stessi&quot;, at Palermo in the carnival season of 1829–30.

In Lugano, Switzerland, around 1831, he married Lina Roser (1806–1888), a Hungarian-born singer of Austrian parentage whom he had met at Bergamo. The couple had two sons and two daughters. Their younger son, Edward, died in infancy. Their elder son, Michael William Jr., died in 1915. Their daughters were Louisa (1832–1869) and Victoire. Balfe wrote another opera, &quot;Un avvertimento ai gelosi&quot;, at Pavia, and &quot;Enrico Quarto&quot; at Milan, where he had been engaged to sing in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; with Malibran at La Scala in 1834. An unpopular attempt at &quot;improving&quot; Giacomo Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; by interpolating music of his own compelled Balfe to throw up his engagement at the theatre La Fenice in Venice.

===Composing success===
Balfe returned to London with his wife and young daughter in May 1835. His initial success took place some months later, with the premiere of &quot;The Siege of Rochelle&quot; on 29 October 1835 at Drury Lane. Encouraged by his success, in 1836 he produced &quot;The Maid of Artois&quot;, which was followed by more operas in English.

In July 1838, Balfe composed a new opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, for The Italian Opera House, based on &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, with an Italian libretto by S. Manfredo Maggione. The production starred his friends Luigi Lablache (bass) in the title role, Giulia Grisi (soprano), Giovanni Battista Rubini (tenor), and Antonio Tamburini (baritone). The same four singers had premiered Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; at the Italian Opera in Paris in 1835.

In 1841, Balfe founded the National Opera at the Lyceum Theatre, but the venture was a failure. The same year, he premiered his opera &quot;Keolanthe&quot;. He then moved to Paris, presenting &quot;Le Puits d&#x27;amour&quot; (1843) in early 1843, followed by his opera based on &quot;Les quatre fils Aymon&quot; (1844) for the Opéra-Comique (also popular in German-speaking countries for many years as &quot;Die vier Haimonskinder&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;étoile de Seville&quot; (1845) for the Opéra. Their libretti were by Eugène Scribe and others. Meanwhile, in 1843, Balfe returned to London, where he produced his most successful work, &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, on 27 November 1843 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The piece ran for over 100 nights, and productions were soon mounted in New York, Dublin, Philadelphia, Vienna (in German), Sydney, and throughout Europe and elsewhere. In 1854, an Italian adaptation called &quot;La Zingara&quot; was mounted in Trieste with great success, and it too was performed internationally in both Italian and German. In 1862, a four-act French version titled &quot;La Bohemienne&quot; was produced in France and was also a success.

===Later years===
From 1846 to 1852, Balfe was appointed musical director and principal conductor for the Italian Opera at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, with Max Maretzek as his assistant. There he first produced several of Verdi&#x27;s operas for London audiences. He conducted for Jenny Lind at her opera debut and on many occasions thereafter.
In 1851, in anticipation of The Great Exhibition in London, Balfe composed an innovative cantata, &quot;Inno Delle Nazioni&quot;, sung by nine female singers, each representing a country. He continued to compose new operas in English, including &quot;The Armourer of Nantes&quot; (1863), and wrote hundreds of songs, such as &quot;When Other Hearts&quot;, &quot;I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls&quot; (from &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;), &quot;Come Into the Garden, Maud&quot;, &quot;Killarney&quot;, and &quot;Excelsior&quot; (a setting of the poem by Longfellow). His last opera, nearly completed when he died, was &quot;The Knight of the Leopard&quot; and achieved considerable success in Italian as &quot;Il Talismano&quot;.

Balfe retired in 1864 to Hertfordshire, where he rented a country estate. He died at his home in Rowney Abbey, Ware, Hertfordshire, in 1870, aged 62, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, next to fellow Irish composer William Vincent Wallace, who had died five years before. In 1882, a medallion portrait of him was unveiled in Westminster Abbey. A London County Council plaque unveiled in 1912 commemorates Balfe at 12 Seymour Street, Marylebone.

In all, Balfe composed at least 29 operas. He also wrote several cantatas (including &quot;Mazeppa&quot; in 1862) and a symphony (1829). Balfe&#x27;s most notable opera, and his only large-scale piece that is still performed is &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;.

<doc id="145885" wikidata="Q158173" url="?curid=145885" title="Princess Margaret of Connaught">
<text>Princess Margaret of Connaught (Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah; 15 January 1882 – 1 May 1920) was Crown Princess of Sweden as the first wife of the future King Gustaf VI Adolf. She was the elder daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, and his wife Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. Known in Sweden as Margareta, her marriage produced five children.

==Early life==

Princess Margaret was born at Bagshot Park and baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on 11 March 1882 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were Queen Victoria (her paternal grandmother); the German Emperor (her maternal great-granduncle, who was represented by the German Ambassador, Count Münster); the German Crown Princess (her paternal aunt, who was represented by her sister, Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein); Prince and Princess Friedrich Karl of Prussia (her maternal grandparents, for whom her paternal uncle the Duke of Edinburgh and aunt Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom stood proxy); the Duchess of Cambridge (her paternal great-grandaunt, who was represented by her grandniece Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll); the Prince of Wales (her paternal uncle) and Prince Charles of Prussia (her great-grandfather, for whom her paternal uncle Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany stood proxy). She was known as &quot;Daisy&quot; to her family.

Margaret was also confirmed in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle in March 1898.
Princess Margaret grew up as a member of the British royal family, taking part in family holidays and weddings. She was a bridesmaid along with her sister at the wedding of their paternal cousins the Duke and Duchess of York on 6 July 1893.

==Marriage==
When Princess Margaret of Connaught was 23 and her younger sister Princess Patricia of Connaught was 18, both girls were among the most beautiful and eligible princesses in Europe. Their uncle, Edward VII, wanted his nieces to marry a European king or crown prince. In January 1905, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught visited Portugal, where they were received by King Carlos and his wife, Amélie of Orléans, whose sons, Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, and Prince Manuel, entertained the young British princesses. The Portuguese expected one of the Connaught princesses would become the future Queen of Portugal.

The Connaughts continued their trip to Egypt and Sudan. In Cairo, they met Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, the future Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, grandson of the Swedish King Oscar II. Originally, Margaret&#x27;s sister Patricia had been considered a suitable match for Gustaf Adolf; without his knowledge, a meeting was arranged with the two sisters. Gustaf Adolf and Margaret fell in love at first sight; he proposed at a dinner held by Lord Cromer at the British Consulate in Egypt and was accepted. Margaret&#x27;s parents were very happy with the match. 

Gustaf Adolf and Margaret married on 15 June 1905 in St. George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Margaret&#x27;s bridesmaids were her sister Princess Patricia of Connaught, cousins Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, and first cousin once removed Princess Mary of Wales. The couple spent their honeymoon at Adare Manor in County Limerick, Ireland, and arrived in Sweden on 8 July 1905.

One of Margaret&#x27;s wedding presents was the Connaught tiara, which remains in the Swedish royal jewellery collection today. Newspaper articles reporting on the valuation of her mother&#x27;s estate for Probate in 1917 note that Princess Margaret received a £25,000 marriage settlement from her parents.

The couple had five children:
* Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, who predeceased his father
* Sigvard Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg
* Ingrid, Queen of Denmark
* Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland
* Carl Johan Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg

Margaret was a dedicated mother to her children, and was determined to spend time with them. She was not keen on letting them be raised by nursery staff, as was the convention of the day.

When Gustaf Adolf&#x27;s father, Crown Prince Gustaf, acceded to the throne as King Gustaf V in 1907, the couple became Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden.

==Crown Princess==

The marriage between Margaret and Gustaf Adolf is described as a happy love match. Gustaf Adolf felt great pressure from the &quot;Prussian&quot; military discipline with which he had been raised by his mother, and he was greatly affected by and attracted to Margaret&#x27;s differing English customs. The visiting Infanta Eulalia of Spain wrote that the Crown Princess gave the Swedish court &quot;just a touch of the elegance of the Court of St James&#x27;s&quot; and of how much Margaret loved her life in Sweden.

After her arrival in Sweden, Margaret, who in Sweden was called &quot;Margareta&quot;, received lessons in the Swedish language, and asked to be educated in Swedish history and social welfare. After two years, she spoke good Swedish. She was also eager to find out more about Sweden, and on many occasions went on incognito trips. During her first years in Sweden, Margaret behaved with great seriousness and was therefore regarded as stiff, but the view of her changed because of her great interest in sports, where she showed a more relaxed and natural manner. Margaret took a great interest in many forms of sports; she used the winters for skiing, ice skating and playing hockey (what is nowadays called bandy), and played tennis and golf during the summers. She also corresponded with various relatives.
Margaret was also interested in art, and was an admirer of the works of Claude Monet. She photographed, painted, and took a great interest in gardening. She and her spouse received Sofiero Palace as a wedding gift, and they spent their summers there and made a great effort creating gardens in an English style on the estate; her children participated in their improvement. In 1915, Margaret as &quot;Kronprinsessan Margareta&quot; published the book &quot;Vår trädgård på Sofiero&quot; (&quot;Our Garden at Sofiero&quot;) and two years later also &quot;Från blomstergården&quot; (&quot;From the Flower Garden&quot;) illustrated with her own drawings and photographs, which were sold for the benefit of household schools with childcare.

During World War I, Margaret created a sewing society in Sweden to support the Red Cross. The society was called &quot;Kronprinsessans Centralförråd för landstormsmäns beklädnad och utrustning&quot; (&quot;The Crown Princess&#x27;s central storage for clothing and equipment of the home guard&quot;), which was to equip the Swedish armed forces with suitable underwear. When paraffin supplies ran low she organized a candle collection, and in November 1917 she instituted a scheme to train girls to work on the land. She also acted as intermediary for relatives separated by the war. With her help, private letters and requests to trace men missing in action were passed on. She was also active in her work on behalf of prisoners. She aided prisoners of war in camps around Europe, especially British nationals. Margaret&#x27;s efforts during the war were pro-British, in contrast to her mother-in-law&#x27;s strictly pro-German attitude. In 1917, Margaret organized &quot;Margaretainsamlingen för de fattiga&quot; (&quot;The Margaret fundraiser for the poor&quot;). At the end of the war, when the final steps towards full democracy were taken in Sweden, Margaret&#x27;s positive attitude to reform influenced her husband the Crown Prince. Unlike the attitude of her reform-hostile in-laws, King Gustaf and Queen Victoria, this is believed to have eased political tensions and preserved the Swedish monarchy.

==Death==

At 02:00 on Saturday, 1 May 1920, her father&#x27;s 70th birthday, Crown Princess Margaret died suddenly in Stockholm of &quot;blood poisoning&quot; (sepsis). Sometime before this she had suffered from measles, which aggravated her ear, and she underwent surgery to remove a mastoid. Since the previous Sunday, she had been suffering from pain in her face from something below her eye, and doctors decided to perform another procedure. On Thursday, symptoms of erysipelas appeared under her right ear. She fell gravely ill on Friday night when symptoms of sepsis became evident, and she died within hours. At the time, she was eight months pregnant with her sixth child. In announcing her death during traditional International Workers&#x27; Day celebrations, Swedish Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting said: &quot;the ray of sunshine at Stockholm Palace has gone out&quot; (&quot;Solstrålen på Stockholms slott har slocknat&quot;).

In Britain, there had been reports that Margaret was unhappy in Sweden and there were dubious rumours that her death had been a suicide.

Princess Margaret was buried according to her specific and detailed wishes, written in 1914. She asked to be buried in her wedding dress and her veil, with a crucifix in her hands, in a simple coffin made from English oak and covered in British and Swedish flags. She requested that there should be no lying-in-state after her death.

==Legacy==
In 2021, an exhibition &quot;Daisy. Crown Princess Margareta, 1882–1920&quot; opened at the Royal Palace in Stockholm.

The late British rose breeder David C. H. Austin released &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Crown Princess Margareta&#x27; in 2000. Princess Margaret was an accomplished landscape gardener and had a prominent role in the design and care of the gardens at Sofiero Castle.

The inescutcheon of Saxony was removed by King George V in 1917.

<text>Michel Jean Legrand (; 24 February 1932 – 26 January 2019) was a French musical composer, arranger, conductor, jazz pianist, and singer. Legrand was a prolific composer, having written over 200 film and television scores, in addition to many songs. His scores for two of the films of French New Wave director Jacques Demy, &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967), earned Legrand his first Academy Award nominations. Legrand won his first Oscar for the song &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot; from &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968), and additional Oscars for &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (1971) and Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983).

==Life and career==
Legrand was born in Paris to his father, Raymond Legrand, who was himself a conductor and composer, and his mother, Marcelle Der-Mikaëlian, who was the sister of conductor Jacques Hélian. Raymond and Marcelle were married in 1929. His maternal grandfather was Armenian.

Legrand composed more than two hundred film and television scores. He won three Oscars and five Grammys. He studied music at the Conservatoire de Paris from age 11, working with, among others, Nadia Boulanger and graduated with top honors as both a composer and a pianist. He burst upon the international music scene at 22 when his album &quot;I Love Paris (album)&quot; became a surprise hit. He established his name in the United States by working with such jazz stars as Miles Davis and Stan Getz. His sister Christiane Legrand was a member of The Swingle Singers and his niece Victoria Legrand is a member of the dream pop band Beach House.

Legrand composed music for Jacques Demy&#x27;s films &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964) (from which &quot;Recit de Cassard&quot; came and in turn, in English became the standard &quot;Watch What Happens&quot;) and &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967), from which the relyricized &quot;You Must Believe in Spring&quot; is considered a jazz standard. Legrand appeared and performed in Agnès Varda&#x27;s &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; (1961). He also composed music for Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;Eva&quot; (1962), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968) (which features &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;), &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1968), &quot;The Picasso Summer&quot; (1969), &quot;The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun&quot; (1970), &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (1971), Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Breezy&quot; (1973), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), Orson Welles&#x27;s last-completed film &quot;F for Fake&quot; (1974), TriStar Pictures 1998 family film &quot;Madeline&quot;, and would later compose the score for Welles&#x27;s posthumously released movie &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (2018). He also composed the score for &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983), as well as the film score for Louis Malle&#x27;s film &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980). His instrumental version of the theme from &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; charted 56th in 1972 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s pop chart.

Legrand died of sepsis, during the night of 25–26 January 2019, at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he had been hospitalized for two weeks for a pulmonary infection. His funeral was held in Paris at the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral on 1 February 2019. He was interred at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. He remained active until his death and had concerts scheduled to take place in the spring.

==Musical theatre==
In 1997, Legrand composed the score for the musical &quot;Le Passe-muraille&quot;, with a book by Didier Van Cauwelaert. It premiered on Broadway in 2002 as &quot;Amour&quot; and was translated into English by Jeremy Sams and was directed by James Lapine. This musical was his Broadway debut and he was nominated for a Tony Award in 2003 for Best Score. Later he recorded &quot;Legrand Affair&quot; with Melissa Errico, a 100-piece symphony orchestra that included songs with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman.

The world premiere of the new musical &quot;Marguerite&quot; from Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg, the creators of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, included music by Michel Legrand and lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer. &quot;Marguerite&quot; is set during World War II in occupied Paris, and was inspired by the romantic novel &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; by Alexandre Dumas fils. It premiered in May 2008 at the Haymarket Theatre, London and was directed by Jonathan Kent.

Legrand won three Oscars (from 13 nominations), five Grammys, and was nominated for an Emmy. His first Academy Award win was in 1969 for the song &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;, followed with the Academy Award for his music for &quot;Summer of ’42&quot; in 1972 and for &quot;Yentl&quot; in 1984.

<doc id="145891" wikidata="Q748539" url="?curid=145891" title="420 (cannabis culture)">
<text>420, 4:20 or 4/20 (pronounced four-twenty) is cannabis culture slang for marijuana and hashish consumption, especially smoking around the time 4:20 p.m. (16:20). It also refers to cannabis-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20 (4/20 in U.S. date form).

==Origins==
Five high school students in San Rafael, California, coined the term as part of their 1971 search for an abandoned cannabis crop, based on a treasure map made by the grower. Calling themselves the Waldos, because their typical hang-out spot &quot;was a wall outside the school&quot;, the five students—Steve Capper, Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich—designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 p.m. as their meeting time. The Waldos referred to this plan with the phrase &quot;4:20 Louis&quot;. After several failed attempts to find the crop, the group eventually shortened their phrase to &quot;4:20&quot;, which ultimately evolved into a code-word the teens used to refer to consuming cannabis.

Steven Hager of &quot;High Times&quot; popularized the story of the Waldos. The first &quot;High Times&quot; mention of 4:20 smoking and a 4/20 holiday appeared in May 1991 and erroneously attributed the origin of the term to a police code; this and other spurious incorrect origin stories became common. The connection to the Waldos appeared in December 1998. Hager attributed the early spread of the phrase to Grateful Dead followers—after &quot;Waldo&quot; Reddix became a roadie for the Grateful Dead bassist, Phil Lesh—and called for 4:20 p.m. to be the socially accepted time of the day to consume cannabis.

Another San Rafael group claims to have originated the term before the Waldos.

==International observance of April 20==

April 20 has become an international counterculture holiday based on the celebration and consumption of cannabis. Events typically advocate for cannabis liberalization and legalization. Vivian McPeak, a founder of Seattle&#x27;s Hempfest, states that 4/20 is &quot;half celebration and half call to action&quot;. Paul Birch calls it a global movement and suggests that one cannot stop events like these.

Many marijuana users protest in civil disobedience by gathering in public to smoke at 4:20 p.m.

As marijuana continues to be decriminalized and legalized around the world, cannabis activist Steve DeAngelo notes that &quot;even if our activist work were complete, 420 morphs from a statement of conscience to a celebration of acceptance, a celebration of victory, a celebration of our amazing connection with this plant&quot; which &quot;will always be worthy of celebration&quot;.

===In North America===
North American observances have been held at many locations, including:
*New York City: Washington Square Park in Manhattan
*Boston: Boston Common
*San Francisco: &quot;Hippie Hill&quot; in Golden Gate Park near the Haight-Ashbury
*Santa Cruz: Porter College meadows at the University of California, Santa Cruz
*Washington, D.C.: National Mall, United States Capitol
*Vancouver: The Vancouver Art Gallery and Sunset Beach between 2016 and 2019.
*Montréal: Le Mont Royal George-Étienne Cartier Monument
*Denver: Civic Center Park
*Ottawa: Parliament Hill and Major&#x27;s Hill Park
* Edmonton: The Alberta Legislature Building
*Boulder: campus of the University of Colorado Boulder
*Toronto: Nathan Phillips Square and Yonge-Dundas Square
*Berkeley: campus of the University of California, Berkeley on the Memorial Glade north of the Doe Memorial Library.
*Mexico City: Mexican Senate under the slogan Planton 420.
*Ann Arbor: Hash Bash
*St. Louis, Missouri: Loop 420 Fest at Delmar Loop (University City)

=== In Australia ===
Australian observances have been held at many locations, over many years, including:

*&quot;Who Are We Hurting?&quot; – Sydney City: Martin Place, NSW (2019)
*420 Picnic 2019 – Melbourne, VIC
*&quot;Who Are We Hurting?&quot; – Sydney, NSW (2018)
*&quot;Who Are We Hurting?&quot; – Sydney City: Kings Cross, NSW (2017)
*Happy Birthday Weed Craze Collective- 2016 – Sydney, NSW
* 420 Protest at Sydney Town Hall by Jesse Willesee – 2015 

===Elsewhere===
Events have also been held in Hyde Park in London and Dunedin, New Zealand, at the University of Otago.

In Ljubljana, Slovenia, the University of Ljubljana&#x27;s student organization has carried out several annual cannabis-themed protests that have contributed to the debate on cannabis status in Slovenia and the subsequent legislation proposals in 2018 by gathering responses from various political parties in Slovenia and ranking them accordingly.

In Northern Cyprus, known for strict drug laws and intolerance to cannabis consumption, the first 420 event was held in the capital city Lefkoşa in 2015. On April 20, 2017, a small group of protesters carried out an event near the parliament building and made a public statement, demanding the legalization of cannabis sale, consumption, and production with state regulations.

==Other effects==
===Traffic safety===

Despite two studies reporting a supposed increase in the risk of fatal motor vehicle crashes on April 20, further investigation and analysis found the evidence did not support such claims.

===Stolen signs===

In the US, signs bearing the number 420 have been frequently stolen. In Colorado, the Colorado Department of Transportation replaced the Mile Marker 420 sign on I-70 east of Denver with one reading 419.99 in an attempt to stop the thievery. The Colorado DOT usually will not replace signs that are repeatedly taken, but began the practice of replacing further down the road after &quot;69&quot; mile marker signs were frequently stolen—these were replaced with &quot;68.5 mile&quot; ones. The Idaho Department of Transportation (ITD) replaced the mile marker 420 sign on U.S. Highway 95, just south of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, with mile marker 419.9. The Washington State Department of Transportation implemented similar measures, but only replaced one of the two 420 signs in the state, with the remaining one being subsequently stolen. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, there are eleven 420 mile markers in the US, after three replacements and one stolen and not replaced. In Goodhue County, Minnesota, officials have changed &quot;420 St&quot; street signs to &quot;42x St&quot;. The mile marker 420 sign on U.S. Route 89, the only 420 marker in the state of Utah, is frequently stolen.

===Legislation and other government recognition===
In 2003, California Senate Bill 420 was introduced to regulate medical marijuana use. An unsuccessful 2010 bill to legalize cannabis in Guam was called Bill 420. A North Dakota bill to legalize cannabis was HB 1420, introduced in January 2021.

The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act (which if enacted would decriminalize and deschedule cannabis in the United States) was announced by Senator and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) on April 20, 2018. On January 9, 2019, H.R. 420 was introduced into the 116th Congress by Representative Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon), named the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, which is designed to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and return regulation to the states.

The State of Colorado auctioned off several cannabis-themed personalized license plates in 2021, with the bidding to be closed on April 20 (4/20). The highest bid shortly before the auction closed was over $6,500 for &quot;ISIT420&quot;.

Following the success of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Initiative 71 to legalize cannabis in 2014, Mayor Muriel Bowser granted license plate number 420 to the campaign&#x27;s leader, Adam Eidinger.

===Literature===
Several books about cannabis have &quot;420&quot; in the title, including the cannabis cookbooks &quot;The 420 Cannabis Cookbook&quot;, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, and &quot;The 420 Gourmet&quot; published in 2016 by HarperCollins.

===Commerce===
Some American restaurants offer &quot;420&quot; themed promotions to coincide with April 20.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in 2018 about taking his company private at $420 a share. Musk testified during the trial that any associations with cannabis were coincidental but in the SEC filing he admitted that he had recently discovered the number&#x27;s importance within the cannabis culture and thought his girlfriend would find it funny. Musk purchased Twitter in 2022 at $54.20 per share and the financing documents were signed on April 20, acknowledging the reference to marijuana culture.

<text>28 Days Later is a 2002 British post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy as a bicycle courier who awakens from a coma to discover the accidental release of a highly contagious, aggression-inducing virus has caused the breakdown of society. Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns, and Brendan Gleeson appear in supporting roles.

Garland took inspiration from George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; film series and John Wyndham&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids.&quot; Filming took place in various locations in the United Kingdom in 2001. The crew filmed for brief periods during early mornings and temporarily closed streets to capture recognisable and typically busy areas when they were deserted. John Murphy composed an original soundtrack for the film, with other instrumental songs by Brian Eno, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and other artists also being featured.

&quot;28 Days Later&quot; was released on 1 November 2002 to critical acclaim and financial success. Grossing more than $84.6 million worldwide on its modest budget of $8 million, it became one of the most profitable horror films of 2002. Reviewers praised Boyle&#x27;s direction, the cast&#x27;s performances, Garland&#x27;s screenplay, the atmosphere and soundtrack. 

Despite Boyle not considering it a zombie film, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film and influencing a revival in the genre a decade after its release, with its fast-running infected and character-driven drama. Since its release, it has been featured in several &#x27;best-of&#x27; film lists and maintained a following, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020s.

The film&#x27;s success launched its titular film series, including &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), and &quot;28 Years Later,&quot; which is scheduled for release in 2025. Additional sequels are currently in development, while a graphic novel titled &quot;28 Days Later: The Aftermath&quot;, and the 2009–2011 comic book series &quot;28 Days Later&quot; also expanded the series into other media.

== Plot ==

A group of animal rights activists infiltrate a laboratory in Cambridge which houses ceaselessly aggressive chimpanzees. One activist frees a chimpanzee, despite being warned by a scientist that it is infected with &#x27;rage&#x27;, a highly contagious virus; it attacks her, and within seconds of exposure, she succumbs to the virus and immediately attacks the others, becoming the patient zero of an epidemic. The virus spreads rapidly across Great Britain, resulting in total societal collapse.

Twenty-eight days later, bicycle courier Jim, who had a traffic accident and fell into a coma before the outbreak, awakens in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London to find it deserted. Leaving the hospital, Jim wanders the empty streets of London, discovers newspapers headlining a mass evacuation, and eventually enters a church which contains the aftermath of a massacre. Infected living humans appear and give chase to Jim, but he is rescued by healthy survivors Selena and Mark, who take him to their refuge in a streetside shop. 

At Jim&#x27;s request, the group travel on foot to his parents&#x27; house in Deptford. There, he learns that they died by suicide, leaving a note in which they prayed he did not wake up. As it is too dusky to return to their hideout, the group decide to stay the night. While the others are asleep, Jim lights a candle and reminisces over memories of his family. The infected, attracted by the light, break into the house. Mark is wounded as he fends them off. Before the infection can take hold of Mark, Selena immediately hacks him to death in front of a horrified Jim.

Spotting a makeshift signal from afar, Jim and Selena make their way up Balfron Tower. They encounter cab driver Frank and his young daughter Hannah in one of the flats. Frank shows them a military radio broadcast offering protection and a cure to the virus at a blockade outside Manchester. With supplies dwindling, Frank plans to take Hannah to the blockade, and the four agree to travel together. 

The group set out for Manchester in Frank&#x27;s cab, looting a supermarket along the way, and escaping ambushes when they stop to change a tyre and to refuel. When they find the blockade deserted except by crows, Frank, frustrated, kicks a tall gate on which a dead body is balanced. A drop of blood from the corpse falls into Frank&#x27;s eye, infecting him. Hidden soldiers appear in surrounding vantage points and shoot Frank dead.

The soldiers bring Jim, Selena, and Hannah to a heavily fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West, and treat their guests to a tour and banquet. However, the sanctuary promised by the soldiers turns out to be a ruse. West reveals to Jim that his broadcast was intended to lure female survivors into sexual slavery. Jim and Sergeant Farrell refuse to go along with this scheme, so West orders them to be shot. Two soldiers shoot Farrell and then argue, allowing Jim to escape. 

Jim sees a jet contrail in the sky, showing proof of outside survivors. After luring West away from the mansion with a siren and killing a soldier, he returns and frees Private Mailer, an infected soldier kept chained up for observation, to infect and kill the remaining soldiers. One, Corporal Mitchell, attempts to abduct Selena, but Jim kills him with such ferocity that Selena momentarily fears Jim must be infected, before kissing him, relieved. Jim, Selena, and Hannah attempt to escape in Frank&#x27;s cab, but West, who has hidden in the back seat, shoots Jim in the stomach. Hannah retaliates by putting the cab in reverse, allowing Mailer to pull West through the rear window and kill him, and drives off.

Another twenty-eight days later, Jim recovers at a remote cottage in Cumbria, where the infected are shown lying openly on the roads, showing signs of starvation. As a Hawker Hunter jet flies overhead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah unfurl a huge cloth banner spelling the word &quot;HELLO&quot;. The three survivors wave for the jet and the pilot spots them. Selena then asks Jim, &quot;Do you think he saw us this time?&quot;, as he stares off hopefully.

Additionally, Alex Palmer, Bindu De Stoppani, and Jukka Hiltunen portray the animal liberation activists, while David Schneider portrays a scientist at the laboratory. Christopher Dunne and Emma Hitching appear as Jim&#x27;s parents. Toby Sedgwick plays an infected priest encountered by Jim.

On the DVD commentary, Boyle explains that with the aim of preserving the suspension of disbelief, relatively unknown actors were cast in the film. Cillian Murphy had starred primarily in small independent films, while Naomie Harris had acted on British television as a child, and Megan Burns had only one previous film credit. However, Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson were well-known character actors.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Early influences on Garland included the George A. Romero films &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), which he loved as a child. Garland claimed to have largely forgotten about the zombie genre until he played the video game &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996), which reminded him how much he loved zombies after &quot;having not really encountered zombies for quite a while&quot;. Boyle liked Garland&#x27;s screenplay for a proposed zombie film, having directed the 2000 film adaptation of Garland&#x27;s novel &quot;The Beach&quot;.

Producer Andrew Macdonald had access to funding from the National Lottery, and pitched it to Universal Pictures, who declined to support it. Budget constraints proved to be an issue, with Christopher Eccleston having to take an emergency pay cut.

On the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland frequently call the film post-apocalyptic and a horror film, commenting on scenes that quote from George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy. During the initial marketing of the film, Boyle tried to distance the film from such labels. Boyle identified John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; as Garland&#x27;s original inspiration for the story.

Five months after the film was released in Europe, video game publisher NovaLogic hosted a graffiti competition in a cross-promotion with the game &quot;Devastation&quot;. The connection was owed mainly to the similar theme of a devastated world. The prizes consisted of signed screenplay copies and posters along with DVDs. For the zombies, Boyle took inspiration from real-life diseases, particularly Ebola, with aspects of rabies. James McAvoy auditioned for a role as a zombie.

=== Filming ===

The film features scenes set in normally bustling parts of London, such as Westminster Bridge, Piccadilly Circus, Horse Guards Parade and Oxford Street. To depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually on Sunday mornings. They typically had around 45 minutes after dawn to shoot the locations devoid of members of the public and traffic. 

Portions of the film were shot on a Canon XL1 digital video (DV) camera, which was smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras, which would have been impractical on such brief shoots. The scenes of the empty M1 motorway were also filmed within limited periods, during which a mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently to leave a long section of carriageway empty. The section of the motorway depicted runs near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, around 150 miles southeast of Manchester.

For the London scene in which Jim walks by an overturned double-decker bus, the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished, all within 20 minutes. The crew had asked Westminster City Council for permission to place the bus outside Downing Street, which was denied; when they arrived there at 4am and nobody from the council was present, they placed the bus there anyway.

The September 11 attacks took place during filming. Boyle notes the parallel between the &quot;missing persons&quot; flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks. Boyle said his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off Whitehall for filming after the terrorist attacks.

The mansion used in the film was Trafalgar Park near Salisbury. Many rooms, including the Cipriani-painted music room and the main hall, were filmed with minimal set decoration. The scenes set upstairs were filmed downstairs, as the mansion&#x27;s owner resided upstairs. The old ruins used as the setting for an idyllic interlude in their journey to Manchester were those of Waverley Abbey, Surrey. The end scenes of the film with Jim, Selena and Hannah living in a rural cottage were filmed around Ennerdale in Cumbria.

The production team hired an optometrist to supervise with the red contact lenses needed for cast members playing the infected.

At a certain point, Macdonald announced to the crew that the production had run out of money, and filming ceased without a satisfactory closing sequence having been shot. After several different pitches for a new ending, with the original ending which featured Jim&#x27;s death having tested badly with audiences, the studio granted more funding to shoot the ending eventually used. The crew arranged for a real jet to fly overhead for them to film, as this was cheaper than approximately £70,000 for a computer-generated one.

=== Alternative endings ===
The DVD extras include three alternative endings, all of which conclude with Jim dying. One of these was filmed, which involved Jim dying of his gunshot wounds. In another, Jim dreams of the accident that left him in a coma as he dies from his gunshot wounds. The third, a more radical departure, was presented only in storyboards; instead of Frank being killed by soldiers after being infected, the other survivors tie him up and discover a research laboratory at the blockade, where Jim undergoes a blood transfusion in order to save Frank. The U.S. cinematic release included one of the alternative endings after the film&#x27;s credits in response to intense online debates over whether or not it was a more appropriate conclusion than the official ending.

== Music ==

The film&#x27;s score was composed by John Murphy, featuring electric guitar and atmospheric electronic production. It also features notable tracks from Brian Eno, Grandaddy and Blue States, and was released in a combined score and song compilation in 2003.

A heavily edited version of the track &#x27;East Hastings&#x27; by the post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor appears in the film, but the track is excluded from the soundtrack, because Boyle could only obtain the rights to use it in the film.

&quot;28 Days Later: The Soundtrack Album&quot; was released on 17 June 2003. A modified version of the track &#x27;In The House – In A Heartbeat&#x27; was used as the character Big Daddy&#x27;s theme in the 2010 film &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;. The same song was played in the 2012 advertisement campaign of Louis Vuitton, &#x27;L&#x27;Invitation au voyage&#x27;. In 2019, the song was remixed to include the theme of &quot;The Terminator&quot; by Brad Fiedel for the second trailer of &quot;,&quot; and also eventually again remixed and used in the 2019 video game &quot;Metro Exodus&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;28 Days Later&quot; was a considerable success at the box office and became highly profitable on a budget of about £5 million. In the UK, it took in £6.1 million, while in the US, it became a surprise hit, taking over $45 million despite a limited release at fewer than 1,500 screens across the country. The film garnered over worldwide.

=== Critical reception ===
Critical views of the film were positive. On the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of 235 critics&#x27; reviews gave &quot;28 Days Later&quot; a positive review, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Kinetically directed by Danny Boyle, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is both a terrifying zombie movie and a sharp political allegory.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a rating of 73 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Bravo&quot; awarded it the 100th spot on their list of &#x27;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&#x27; in a four-episode 2004 television series. The commentators explained that making the zombies move fast for the first time was a bright and effective idea. In 2007, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; named it the second-best zombie movie of all time. The film also ranked at number 456 in &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. Bloody Disgusting ranked the film seventh in their list of the Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade, with the article saying &quot;Zombie movie? Political allegory? Humanist drama? &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is all of those things and more—a genuine work of art by a director at the top of his game. What&#x27;s so amazing about the film is the way it so expertly balances scenes of white-knuckled, hell-for-leather horror with moments of intimate beauty.&quot; In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it the 97th-best British film ever.

=== Cultural impact ===

&quot;28 Days Later&quot; had an impact on subsequent horror films, and is credited with starting a revival for the zombie genre, along with the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise. The 2004 remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, for example, was influenced by &quot;28 Days Later&quot;. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; was followed by other infection films such as &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (2006), &quot;Planet Terror&quot; (2007), &quot;Dead Snow&quot; (2009) and &quot;Zombieland&quot; (2009), as well as books such as &quot;World War Z&quot; (2006), &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&quot; (2009) and &quot;Warm Bodies&quot; (2010), and zombie-themed graphic novels and television shows such as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. The zombie revival trend lasted for more than a decade after &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, before eventually declining in popularity by the late 2010s.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, images of a national lockdown in the United Kingdom and stay-at-home orders elsewhere were compared to the opening sequence of &quot;28 Days Later&quot;. In 2021, Megan Burns said of the film, &quot;When I joined the cast of &quot;28 Days Later&quot; I had no idea of how big a cultural impact it would have and what a game-changer it would be to the &#x27;zombie&#x27; genre. Even now after all these years, (or perhaps especially now with the current situation,) people want to talk about the film and that&#x27;s incredible.&quot; Director Christopher Nolan said he cast Murphy as Scarecrow in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005) after being impressed by his performance in &quot;28 Days Later&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
* Best Horror Film (2003 U.S. Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films – Saturn Award)
* Best British Film (Empire Award)

== Subsequent media ==
=== Sequels ===
A sequel, &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, was released on 11 May 2007. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland took producing roles alongside Andrew Macdonald. The plot revolves around the arrival of American troops about seven months after the incidents in the original film, attempting to restore order and revitalise a nearly desolate Britain. The cast includes Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton and Idris Elba.

In March 2007, Danny Boyle said that he would be interested in making a third film in the series, &quot;28 Months Later&quot;. In 2019, he said &quot;Alex Garland and I have a wonderful idea for the third part&quot;.

In January 2024, it was announced that a third film in the series, &quot;28 Years Later&quot;, was in development. It is considered the first installment in a potential trilogy, with Boyle directing the first film and Garland writing all three. With a planned $75 million budget per installment, the duo will also produce the trilogy alongside the original producer Andrew Macdonald and former Fox Searchlight Pictures head Peter Rice. Cillian Murphy will reprise his role as Jim.

=== Comic books ===
Fox Atomic Comics, in association with HarperCollins, released a graphic novel bridging the time gap between &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, titled &quot;28 Days Later: The Aftermath&quot;, written by Steve Niles.

&quot;28 Days Later&quot;, a comic sequel also linking &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Weeks&quot; and produced by Fox Atomic (until its demise) and Boom! Studios, began production in 2009. The series focuses on Selena and answers questions about her in the film and her sequel whereabouts.

== Digital availability ==
By November 2022, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; had become unavailable on Disney-owned streaming services including its removal from Disney+ Star internationally, hinting that Disney had lost rights to it; only its sequel, &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (still owned by Disney), was available on streaming sites.

In February 2024, it was revealed that producer Andrew MacDonald had bought back the rights to the film from Searchlight Pictures, promptly selling it to Sony Pictures along with the upcoming sequel &quot;28 Years Later&quot;. In December 2024, following a largely favourable response from the public to the trailer for &quot;28 Years Later&quot;, Sony announced that it would be making &quot;28 Days Later&quot; available for purchase on digital and rental platforms from 18 December.

<doc id="145893" wikidata="Q188063" url="?curid=145893" title="Fief">
<text>A fief (; ) was a central element in medieval contracts based on feudal law. It consisted of a form of property holding or other rights granted by an overlord to a vassal, who held it in fealty or &quot;in fee&quot; in return for a form of feudal allegiance, services or payments. The fees were often lands, land revenue or revenue-producing real property like a watermill, held in feudal land tenure: these are typically known as fiefs or fiefdoms. However, not only land but anything of value could be held in fee, including governmental office, rights of exploitation such as hunting, fishing or felling trees, monopolies in trade, money rents and tax farms. There never existed a standard feudal system, nor did there exist only one type of fief. Over the ages, depending on the region, there was a broad variety of customs using the same basic legal principles in many variations.

==Terminology==
In ancient Rome, a &quot;benefice&quot; (from the Latin noun , meaning &quot;benefit&quot;) was a gift of land () for life as a reward for services rendered, originally, to the state. In medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service continued to be called a (Latin). Later, the term , or , began to replace in the documents. The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one hundred years earlier. The origin of the and why it replaced has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.

The most widely held theory is put forth by Marc Bloch that it is related to the Frankish term &quot;*fehu-ôd&quot;, in which &quot;*fehu&quot; means &quot;cattle&quot; and &quot;-ôd&quot; means &quot;goods&quot;, implying &quot;a moveable object of value&quot;. When land replaced currency as the primary store of value, the Germanic word &quot;*fehu-ôd&quot; replaced the Latin word . This Germanic origin theory was also shared by William Stubbs in the 19th century.

A theory put forward by Archibald R. Lewis is that the origin of &#x27;fief&#x27; is not (or ), but rather , the earliest attested use being in Astronomus&#x27;s (840). In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious which says , which can be translated as &quot;(Louis forbade that) military provender which they popularly call &#x27;fodder&#x27; (be furnished).&quot;

In the 10th and 11th centuries the Latin terms for &#x27;fee&#x27; could be used either to describe dependent tenure held by a man from his lord, as the term is used now by historians, or it could mean simply &quot;property&quot; (the manor was, in effect, a small fief). It lacked a precise meaning until the middle of the 12th century, when it received formal definition from land lawyers.

In English usage, the word &quot;fee&quot; is first attested around 1250–1300 (Middle English); the word &quot;fief&quot; from around 1605–1615. In French, the term is found from the middle of the 13th century (Old French), derived from the 11th-century terms , . The odd appearance of the second &quot;f&quot; in the form may be due to influence from the verb &#x27;to grant in fee&#x27;. In French, one also finds (land and rights possessed by a or &quot;lord&quot;, 12th century), which gives rise to the expression &quot;seigneurial system&quot; to describe feudalism.

==Early feudal grants==
Originally, vassalage did not imply the giving or receiving of landholdings (which were granted only as a reward for loyalty), but by the 8th century the giving of a landholding was becoming standard. The granting of a landholding to a vassal did not relinquish the lord&#x27;s property rights, but only the use of the lands and their income; the granting lord retained ultimate ownership of the fee and could, technically, recover the lands in case of disloyalty or death. In Francia, Charles Martel was the first to make large-scale and systematic use (the practice had remained sporadic until then) of the remuneration of vassals by the concession of the usufruct of lands (a &quot;beneficatium&quot; or &quot;benefice&quot; in the documents) for the life of the vassal, or, sometimes extending to the second or third generation.

By the middle of the 10th century, fee had largely become hereditary. The eldest son of a deceased vassal would inherit, but first he had to do homage and fealty to the lord and pay a &quot;relief&quot; for the land (a monetary recognition of the lord&#x27;s continuing proprietary rights over the property).

Historically, the fees of the 11th and the 12th century derived from two separate sources. The first was land carved out of the estates of the upper nobility. The second source was allodial land transformed into dependent tenures. During the 10th century in northern France and the 11th century in France south of the Loire, local magnates either recruited or forced the owners of allodial holdings into dependent relationships and they were turned into fiefs. The process occurred later in Germany, and was still going on in the 13th century.

In England, Henry II transformed them into important sources of royal income and patronage. The discontent of barons with royal claims to arbitrarily assessed &quot;reliefs&quot; and other feudal payments under Henry&#x27;s son King John resulted in Magna Carta of 1215.

Eventually, great feudal lords sought also to seize governmental and legal authority (the collection of taxes, the right of high justice, etc.) in their lands, and some passed these rights to their own vassals.

The privilege of minting official coins developed into the concept of seigniorage.

In 13th-century Germany, Italy, England, France, and Spain the term &quot;feodum&quot; was used to describe a dependent tenure held from a lord by a vassal in return for a specified amount of knight service and occasional financial payments (feudal incidents).

However, knight service in war was far less common than:
* castle-guard (called &quot;Burghut&quot; in the Holy Roman Empire), the obligation of a vassal to serve in a castle garrison of the lord;
* suit in court, the vassal&#x27;s obligation to attend the lord&#x27;s court, to give him counsel, and to help him judge disputes;
* attendance in the lord&#x27;s entourage, accompanying the lord when he travelled or attended the court of his lord so as to increase the social status of the lord;
* hospitality to the lord or to his servants (accommodation).

A lord in late 12th-century England and France could also claim the right of:
* wardship and marriage – right to control descent of fee by choosing a husband for a female heir and a guardian for minors (preferably in consultation with the heir&#x27;s closest male adult kinsmen);
* &quot;aids&quot; – payments to aid the lord in times of need (customarily given to the lord to cover the cost of knighting the eldest son, marriage of the eldest daughter, and for ransoming the lord if required);
* escheat – the reversion of the fief to the lord in default of an heir.

In northern France in the 12th and 13th centuries, military service for fiefs was limited for offensive campaigns to 40 days for a knight. By the 12th century, English and French kings and barons began to commute military service for cash payments (scutages), with which they could purchase the service of mercenaries.

==Feudal registers==
A list of several hundred such fees held in chief between 1198 and 1292, along with their holders&#x27; names and form of tenure, was published in three volumes between 1920 and 1931 and is known as &quot;The Book of Fees&quot;; it was developed from the 1302 &quot;Testa de Nevill&quot;.

==The fiefs of Guernsey==

The Bailiwick of Guernsey is a group of several of the Channel Islands that is a Crown Dependency. Guernsey still has feudal law and legal fiefs in existence today. Each fief has a Seigneur or Dame that owns the fief. The Guernsey fiefs and seigneurs existed long before baronies, and are historically part of Normandy. While nobility has been outlawed in France and Germany, noble fiefs still exist by law in Guernsey. The owners of the fiefs actually convene each year at the Court of Chief Pleas under the supervision of His Majesty&#x27;s Government. There are approximately 24 private fiefs in Guernsey that are registered directly with the Crown.

<doc id="145905" wikidata="Q208171" url="?curid=145905" title="Ebionites">
<text>Ebionites (, derived from Hebrew , , meaning &#x27;the poor&#x27; or &#x27;poor ones&#x27;) as a term refers to a Jewish Christian sect that existed during the early centuries of the Common Era.

Since historical records by the Ebionites are scarce, fragmentary and disputed, much of what is known or conjectured about them derives from the polemics of their Gentile Christian opponents, specifically the Church Fathers — Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, and Epiphanius of Salamis — who saw the Ebionites as distinct from other Jewish Christian sects, such as the Nazarenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazarene/Ebionite&quot;&gt;; : &quot;Following the devastation of the Jewish War, the Nazarenes took refuge in Pella, a community in exile, where they lay in anxious wait with their fellow Jews. From this point on it is preferable to call them the Ebionites. There was no clear demarcation or formal transition from Nazarene to Ebionite; there was no sudden change of theology or Christology.&quot;; : &quot;While the writings of later church fathers speak of Nazarenes and Ebionites as if they were different Jewish Christian groups, they are mistaken in that assessment. The Nazarenes and the Ebionites were one and the same group, but for clarity we will refer to the pre-70 group in Jerusalem as Nazarenes, and the post-70 group in Pella and elsewhere as Ebionites.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church Fathers generally agree on key points about the majority of Ebionites, such as their voluntary poverty and rejection of proto-orthodox Christian beliefs in Jesus&#x27; divinity, pre-existence, and virgin birth; they argue these Ebionites believed that Jesus was a mere man, born the natural son of Joseph and Mary, who, by virtue of his righteousness in perfectly following the letter and spirit of the Law of Moses, was adopted as the son of God to be a Messiah.

According to these patristic sources, the Ebionites insisted on the necessity of following both the Law of Moses and the moral teachings of Jesus to be righteous; they revered James the Just, brother of Jesus, as an exemplar of righteousness and the true successor to Jesus (rather than Peter), while rejecting Paul as a false apostle and an apostate from the Law.

However, the Church Fathers diverge on details regarding some specific Ebionite views about Jesus (the nature and mission of Christ), their use of additional scripture to the Hebrew Bible (one, some or all of the Jewish–Christian gospels), and their lifestyle practices (religious vegetarianism, ritual washing, etc.). These variations reflect the evolving and schismatic nature of early Christian sects, as well as the tendency of patristic polemicists to conflate different sects and misattribute unusual views and practices, more typical of Gnostic Christianity than Jewish Christianity, to Ebionites to discredit them.

Some modern critical scholars argue the Church Fathers&#x27; condemnation of Ebionites as &quot;heretics&quot; and &quot;Judaizers&quot; is both ironic and tragic, since many Ebionite views may have been closer to the authentic views of not only the first disciples of Jesus but also of the historical Jesus himself.

==Name==
The hellenized Hebrew term &quot;Ebionite&quot; was first applied by Irenaeus in the second century without making mention of Nazarenes (). Origen wrote &quot;for Ebion signifies &#x27;poor&#x27; among the Jews, and those Jews who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites.&quot; Tertullian was the first to write against a heresiarch called Ebion; scholars believe he derived this name from a literal reading of &quot;Ebionaioi&quot; as &#x27;followers of Ebion&#x27;, a derivation now considered mistaken for lack of any more substantial references to such a figure. The term &quot;the poor&quot; (Greek: &quot;ptōkhoí&quot;) was still used in its original, more general sense. Modern Hebrew still uses the Biblical Hebrew term &quot;the needy&quot; for almsgiving to the needy at Purim.

Scholar James D. Tabor argues that the Ebionites most likely named themselves after the poor, the first of many groups of people mentioned in the Beatitudes of Jesus as blessed and meriting entry in the coming Kingdom of God on Earth.

== History ==
===Emergence===
The earliest reference to a sect that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in Justin Martyr&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; (c. 155-60). Justin distinguishes between Jewish Christians who observe the Law of Moses but do not require its observance upon others and those who believe the Mosaic Law to be obligatory on all. Irenaeus (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term &quot;Ebionites&quot; to name a sect he labeled heretical &quot;Judaizers&quot; for &quot;stubbornly clinging to the Law&quot;. Origen (c. 212) remarks that the name derives from the Hebrew word &quot;evyon&quot;, meaning &#x27;poor&#x27;. Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310–320 – 403) gives the most complete account in his heresiology called &quot;Panarion&quot;, denouncing eighty heretical sects, among them the Ebionites. Epiphanius mostly gives general descriptions of their religious beliefs and includes quotations from their gospels, which have not survived. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Ebionite movement &quot;may have arisen about the time of the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem&quot; (70 CE). The tentative dating of the origins of this sect depends on Epiphanius writing three centuries later and relying on information for the Ebionites from the &quot;Book of Elchasai&quot;, which may not have had anything to do with the Ebionites.

Paul talks of his collection for the &quot;poor among the saints&quot; in the Jerusalem church, but this is generally taken as meaning the poorer members of the church rather than a schismatic sect.

The actual number of sects described as Ebionites is difficult to ascertain, as the contradictory patristic accounts in their attempt to distinguish various sects sometimes confuse them with each other. Other sects mentioned are the Carpocratians, the Cerinthians, the Elcesaites, the fourth century Nazarenes and the Sampsaeans, most of whom were Jewish Christian sects who held gnostic or other views rejected by the Ebionites. Epiphanius, however, mentions that a sect of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name.

As the Ebionites are first mentioned as such in the second century, their earlier history and any relation to the first Jerusalem church remains obscure and a matter of contention. There is no evidence linking the origin of the later sect of the Ebionites with the First Jewish-Roman War of 66–70 CE or with the Jerusalem church led by James. Eusebius relates a tradition, probably based on Aristo of Pella, that the early Christians left Jerusalem just prior to the war and fled to Pella, Jordan beyond the Jordan River, but does not connect this with Ebionites. They were led by Simeon of Jerusalem (d. 107) and during the Second Jewish-Roman War of 115–117, they were persecuted by the Jewish followers of Bar Kochba for refusing to recognize his messianic claims. As late as Epiphanius (310–403), members of the Ebionite sect resided in Nabatea, and Paneas, Moabitis, and Kochaba in the region of Bashan, near Adraa. From these places, they dispersed and went into Asia (Anatolia), Rome and Cyprus.

According to Harnack, the influence of Elchasaites places some Ebionites in the context of the gnostic movements widespread in Syria and the lands to the east.

===Disappearance===
After the end of the First Jewish–Roman War, the importance of the Jerusalem church began to fade. Jewish Christianity became dispersed throughout the Jewish diaspora in the Levant, where it was slowly eclipsed by Gentile Christianity, which then spread throughout the Roman Empire without competition from Jewish Christian sects. Once the Jerusalem church was eliminated during the Bar Kokhba revolt, which ended in 136 CE, the Ebionites gradually lost influence and followers. Some modern scholars, such as Hyam Maccoby, argue the decline of the Ebionites was due to marginalization and persecution by both Jews and Christians. Maccoby&#x27;s views as expressed in his works from the 1980s and 1990s have, however, been nearly universally rejected by scholars. Following the defeat of the rebellion and the subsequent expulsion of Jews from Judea, Jerusalem became the Gentile city of Aelia Capitolina. Many of the Jewish Christians residing at Pella renounced their Jewish practices at this time and joined the mainstream Christian church. Those who remained at Pella and continued in obedience to the Law were labeled heretics. In 375, Epiphanius records the settlement of Ebionites on Cyprus, but by the 5th century, Theodoret of Cyrrhus reported that they were no longer present in the region.

The Ebionites are still attested, if as marginal communities, down to the 7th century. Some modern scholars argue that the Ebionites survived much longer and identify them with a sect encountered by the historian Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad around the year 1000. There is another possible reference to Ebionite communities has them existing around the 11th century in northwestern Arabia, in &quot;Sefer Ha&#x27;masaot&quot;, the &quot;Book of the Travels&quot; of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, a rabbi from Spain. These communities were located in two cities, Tayma and &quot;Tilmas&quot;, possibly Saada in Yemen. The 12th century Muslim historian Muhammad al-Shahrastani mentions Jews living in nearby Medina and Hejaz who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream Christian views. Some scholars propose that interactions between Ebionite communities and early Muslims played a role in shaping the Islamic perspective on Jesus.

==Views and practices==
===Judaism, Gnosticism and Essenism===
Most patristic sources portray the Ebionites as Jews who zealously followed the Law of Moses, revered Jerusalem as the holiest city and restricted table fellowship only to God-fearing Gentiles who converted to Judaism.

Some Church Fathers describe some Ebionites as departing from traditional Jewish principles of faith and practice. For example, Methodius of Olympus stated that the Ebionites believed that the prophets spoke only by their own power and not by the power of the Holy Spirit. Epiphanius of Salamis stated that the Ebionites possessed a separationist Christology, which claimed that Jesus and the Christ are two different beings, and, therefore, the Christ is an angel of God who was incarnated in Jesus when he was adopted as the son of God during his baptism, engaged in excessive ritual washing, denied parts of the Law deemed obsolete or corrupt, opposed animal sacrifice, practiced vegetarianism and celebrated a commemorative meal annually on or around Passover with unleavened bread and water only, in contrast to the daily Christian Eucharist. The reliability of Epiphanius&#x27; account of the Ebionites is questioned by some scholars. Modern scholar Shlomo Pines, for example, argues that the heterodox views and practices he ascribes to some Ebionites originated in Gnostic Christianity rather than Jewish Christianity and are characteristics of the Jewish Elcesaite sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites.

While mainstream biblical scholars do suppose some Essene influence on the nascent Jewish Christian church in some organizational, administrative and cultic respects, some scholars go beyond that assumption. Regarding the Ebionites specifically, a number of scholars have different theories on how the Ebionites may have developed from an Essene Jewish messianic sect. Hans-Joachim Schoeps argues that the conversion of some Essenes to Jewish Christianity after the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE may be the source of some Ebionites adopting Essene views and practices, while some conclude that the Essenes did not become Jewish Christians, but still had an influence on the Ebionites.

===On John the Baptist===
In the &quot;Gospel of the Ebionites&quot;, as quoted by Epiphanius, John the Baptist and Jesus are portrayed as vegetarians. Epiphanius states that the Ebionites had amended &quot;locusts&quot; () to &quot;honey cakes&quot; (). This emendation is not found in any other New Testament manuscript or translation, though a different vegetarian reading is found in a late Slavonic version of Josephus&#x27; &quot;War of the Jews&quot;. Pines and other modern scholars propose that the Ebionites were projecting their own vegetarianism onto John the Baptist.

The strict vegetarianism of the Ebionites may have been a reaction to the cessation of animal sacrifices after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70 CE and a safeguard against the consumption of unclean meat in a pagan environment. James Tabor, however, argues that Ebionite disdain for eating meat and the Temple sacrifice of animals is due to their preference for the ideal pre-Flood diet and what they took to be the original form of worship. In this view, the Ebionites had an interest in reviving the traditions inspired by pre-Sinai revelation, especially the time from Enoch to Noah.

===On Jesus the Nazarene===
The Church Fathers agree that most or all of the Ebionites rejected many of the precepts central to proto-orthodox Christianity, such as Jesus&#x27; divinity, pre-existence, and virgin birth. The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of Joseph and Mary, who, by virtue of his righteousness in perfectly following the letter and spirit of the Law of Moses, was adopted as the son of God to fulfill the Hebrew scriptures.

Origen (&quot;Contra Celsum&quot; 5.61) and Eusebius (&quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; 3.27.3) recognize some variation in the Christology of Ebionite sects; for example, that while all Ebionites denied Jesus&#x27; pre-existence, there was a sub-sect which did not deny the virgin birth. Theodoret, while dependent on earlier writers, draws the conclusion that the two sub-sects would have used different gospels. The Ebionites may have used only some or all of the Jewish–Christian gospels as additional scripture to the Hebrew Bible. However, Irenaeus reports that they only used a version of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot;, which omitted the first two chapters (on the nativity of Jesus) and started with the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist.

The Ebionites viewed Jesus as a Messiah in the mold of a new &quot;prophet like Moses&quot; foretold in Deuteronomy 18:15-19. They believed Jesus came to call all descendants of the Twelve Tribes of Israel who had strayed from the covenant with God, as well as potential converts from all Gentile nations, to repent and follow both the Law of Moses and Jesus&#x27; own expounding of the Law in order to become righteous and merit entry into the coming kingdom of God on Earth. 

According to Epiphanius alone, the Ebionites believed Jesus&#x27; mission as prophet and reformer included proclaiming the abolishment of animal sacrifices, rather than substituting himself for them through intentional self-sacrifice. Consequently, they did not believe Jesus suffered and died for the atonement of the sins of Israelites or mankind. The Ebionites appear to have revered Jesus not as a savior, but as a martyr, who was arrested and sentenced to death by crucifixion, both for his messianic claim and his failed attempt at ending the Temple sacrificial system, in order to establish a more simple form of worship based on authentic repentance and works of mercy. Rejecting the belief in a physical resurrection of the dead, while embracing a belief in immortal human souls, some Ebionites may have believed Jesus was resurrected in a spiritual body, rather than a physical one.

===On James the Just===
Some of the Church Fathers argue that the Ebionites revered James the Just, brother of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem church, as the true successor to Jesus (rather than Peter) and an exemplar of righteousness. One of the popular primary connections of the Ebionites to James is that the &quot;Ascents of James&quot; in the Pseudo-Clementine literature are related to the Ebionites. The other popularly proposed connection is that mentioned by William Whiston in his 1794 edition of Josephus, where he notes that we learn from fragments of Hegesippus that the Ebionites interpreted a prophecy of Isaiah as foretelling the murder of James.

Scholars, including Robert Eisenman, , Will Durant, Michael Goulder, Gerd Ludemann, John Painter and James Tabor, argue for some form of continuity of the Jerusalem church into the second and third centuries and that the Ebionites regarded James as their apostolic founder.

Conservative Christian scholars, such as Richard Bauckham, hold that James and his circle in the early Jerusalem church held a &quot;high Christology&quot; (i.e. Jesus was a pre-existent angelic or divine being) while the Ebionites held a &quot;low Christology&quot; (i.e. Jesus was a mere man adopted by God). As an alternative to the traditional view of Eusebius that the Jewish Jerusalem church gradually adopted the proto-orthodox Christian theology of the Gentile church, Bauckham and others suggest immediate successors to the Jerusalem church under James and the other relatives of Jesus were the Nazarenes who accepted Paul as an &quot;apostle to the Gentiles&quot;, while the Ebionites were a later schismatic sect of the early second century that rejected Paul.

===On Paul the Apostle===
The Ebionites rejected the Pauline Epistles, and, according to Origen, they viewed Paul as an &quot;apostate from the Law&quot;. The Ebionites may have been spiritual and physical descendants of the &quot;super-apostles&quot; — talented and respected Jewish Christian ministers in favour of mandatory circumcision of converts — who sought to undermine Paul in Galatia and Corinth.

Epiphanius relates that the Ebionites opposed Paul, who they saw as responsible for the idea that Gentile Christians did not have to be circumcised or follow the Law of Moses, and named him an apostate from Judaism. Epiphanius further relates that some Ebionites alleged that Paul was a Greek who converted to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of a High Priest of Israel, but apostatized when she rejected him.

==Writings==
No writings of the Ebionites have survived outside of a few quotes by others and they are in uncertain form. The &quot;Recognitions of Clement&quot; and the &quot;Clementine Homilies&quot;, two third century Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely Jewish Christian in origin and reflect Jewish Christian beliefs. The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but Epiphanius&#x27;s description of some Ebionites in &quot;Panarion&quot; 30 bears a striking similarity to the ideas in the &quot;Recognitions&quot; and &quot;Homilies&quot;. Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the &quot;Homilies&quot; as a source document. Some scholars also speculate that the core of the &quot;Gospel of Barnabas&quot;, beneath a polemical medieval Muslim overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document. The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars.

John Arendzen classifies the Ebionite writings into four groups.

===Gospel of the Ebionites===
Irenaeus stated that the Ebionites used the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; exclusively. Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that they used only the &quot;Gospel of the Hebrews&quot;. From this, the minority view of James R. Edwards and Bodley&#x27;s Librarian Edward Nicholson claim that there was only one Hebrew gospel in circulation, Matthew&#x27;s &quot;Gospel of the Hebrews&quot;. They also note that the title &quot;Gospel of the Ebionites&quot; was never used by anyone in the early church. Epiphanius contended that the gospel the Ebionites used was written by Matthew and called the &quot;Gospel of the Hebrews&quot;. Because Epiphanius said that it was &quot;not wholly complete, but falsified and mutilated&quot;, writers such as Walter Richard Cassels and Pierson Parker consider it a different &quot;edition&quot; of Matthew&#x27;s Hebrew Gospel; however, internal evidence from the quotations in &quot;Panarion&quot; 30.13.4 and 30.13.7 suggest that the text was a gospel harmony originally composed in Greek.

Mainstream scholarly texts, such as the standard edition of the New Testament apocrypha edited by Wilhelm Schneemelcher, generally refer to the text Jerome cites as used by the Ebionites as the &quot;Gospel of the Ebionites&quot;, though this is not a term current in the early church.

===Clementine literature===
The collection of New Testament apocrypha known as the Clementine literature included three works known in antiquity as the &quot;Circuits of Peter&quot;, the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; and a work usually titled the &quot;Ascents of James&quot;. They are specifically referenced by Epiphanius in his polemic against the Ebionites. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement&#x27;s &quot;Compendium of Peter&#x27;s itinerary sermons&quot; and in the &quot;Recognitions&quot; attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, such as the primacy of James the Just, brother of Jesus; their connection with the episcopal see of Rome; and their antagonism to Simon Magus, as well as gnostic doctrines. Scholar Robert E. Van Voorst opines of the &quot;Ascents of James&quot; (R 1.33–71), &quot;There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain&quot;. Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin.

===Symmachus===
Symmachus produced a translation of the Hebrew Bible in Koine Greek, which was used by Jerome and is still extant in fragments, and his lost &quot;Hypomnemata&quot;, written to counter the canonical &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot;. Although lost, the &quot;Hypomnemata&quot; is probably identical to &quot;De distinctione præceptorum&quot; mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, &quot;Bibl. Or.&quot;, III, 1). The identity of Symmachus as an Ebionite has been questioned in recent scholarship.

===Elcesaites===
Hippolytus of Rome reported that a Jewish Christian, Alcibiades of Apamea, appeared in Rome teaching from a book which he claimed to be the revelation which a righteous man, Elchasai, had received from an angel, though Hippolytus suspected that Alcibiades was himself the author. Shortly afterwards, Origen recorded a sect, the Elcesaites, with the same beliefs. Epiphanius claimed the Ebionites also used this book as a source for some of their beliefs and practices (&quot;Panarion&quot; 30.17). Epiphanius explains the origin of the name Elchasai to be Aramaic &quot;El Ksai&quot;, meaning &quot;hidden power&quot; (&quot;Panarion&quot; 19.2.1). Scholar Petri Luomanen believes the book to have been written originally in Aramaic as a Jewish apocalypse, probably in Babylonia in 116–117.

==Religious and critical perspectives==

===Christianity===
The mainstream Christian view of the Ebionites is partly based on interpretation of the polemical views of the Church Fathers, who portrayed them as heretics for rejecting many of the proto-orthodox Christian views of Jesus and allegedly having an improper fixation on the Law of Moses at the expense of the grace of God. In this view, the Ebionites may have been the descendants of a Jewish Christian sect within the early Jerusalem church which broke away from its proto-orthodox theology possibly in reaction to the Council of Jerusalem compromise of 50 CE.

===Islam===
Islam charges Christianity with having distorted the pure monotheism of the God of Abraham through the doctrines of the Trinity and through the veneration of icons. Paul Addae and Tim Bowes write that the Ebionites were faithful to the original teachings of the historical Jesus and thus shared Islamic view of Jesus&#x27; humanity and also rejected proto-orthodox theories of atonement. Furthermore, the Islamic view of Jesus is compatible the view of a minor sect within the Ebionites who embraced rather than denied the virgin birth of Jesus.

Hans Joachim Schoeps observes that the Christianity which Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, was likely to have encountered on the Arabian peninsula &quot;was not the state religion of Byzantium but a schismatic Christianity characterized by Ebionite and Monophysite views&quot;:

Irfan Shahîd, a Palestinian Christian scholar in the field of Oriental studies, counters that there is no evidence that the Ebionites remained until the 7th century, much less that they had a presence in Mecca.

===Judaism===
The counter-missionary group Jews for Judaism favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that &quot;Messianic Judaism&quot;, as promoted by missionary groups such as Jews for Jesus, is Pauline Christianity misrepresenting itself as Judaism. In 2007, some Messianic commentators expressed concern over a possible existential crisis for the Messianic movement in Israel due to a resurgence of Ebionitism, specifically the problem of Israeli Messianic leaders apostatizing from the belief in the divinity of Jesus.

<text>The Apache License is a permissive free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties. The ASF and its projects release their software products under the Apache License. The license is also used by many non-ASF projects.

==History==
Beginning in 1995, the Apache Group (later the Apache Software Foundation) released successive versions of the Apache HTTP Server. Its initial license was essentially the same as the original 4-clause BSD license, with only the names of the organizations changed, and with an additional clause forbidding derivative works from bearing the Apache name.

In July 1999, the Berkeley Software Distribution accepted the argument put to it by the Free Software Foundation and retired their &quot;advertising clause&quot; (clause 3) to form the new 3-clause BSD license. In 2000, Apache did likewise and created the Apache License 1.1, in which derived products are no longer required to include attribution in their advertising materials, only in their documentation. Individual packages licensed under the 1.1 version may have used different wording due to varying requirements for attribution or mark identification, but the binding terms were the same.

In January 2004, ASF decided to depart from the BSD model and produced the Apache License 2.0. The stated goals of the license included making it easier for non-ASF projects to use, improving compatibility with GPL-based software, allowing the license to be included by reference instead of listed in every file, clarifying the license on contributions, and requiring a patent license on contributions that necessarily infringe a contributor&#x27;s own patents. This license requires the preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer.

==Licensing conditions==
The Apache License is permissive; unlike copyleft licenses, it does not require a derivative work of the software, or modifications to the original, to be distributed using the same license. It still requires application of the same license to all unmodified parts. In every licensed file, original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices must be preserved (excluding notices that do not pertain to any part of the derivative works). In every licensed file changed, a notification must be added stating that changes have been made to that file.

If a codice_1 text file is included as part of the distribution of the original work, then derivative works must include a readable copy of these notices within a codice_1 text file distributed as part of the derivative works, within the source form or documentation, or within a display generated by the derivative works (wherever such third-party notices normally appear).

The contents of the codice_1 file do not modify the license, as they are for informational purposes only, and adding more attribution notices as addenda to the codice_1 text is permissible, provided that these notices cannot be understood as modifying the license. Modifications may have appropriate copyright notices, and may provide different license terms for the modifications.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contributions submitted by a licensee to a licensor will be under the terms of the license without any terms and conditions, but this does not preclude any separate agreements with the licensor regarding these contributions.

=== Apache License 2.0 ===
The Apache License 2.0 attempts to forestall potential patent litigation in Section 3. The user is granted a patent license from each contributor to &quot;make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.&quot; Through an &quot;in terrorem&quot; clause, if the user sues anyone alleging that the software or a contribution within it constitutes patent infringement, any such patent licenses for that work are terminated.

==Compatibility==
The Apache Software Foundation and the Free Software Foundation agree that the Apache License 2.0 is a free software license, compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, meaning that code under GPLv3 and Apache License 2.0 can be combined, as long as the resulting software is licensed under the GPLv3.

The Free Software Foundation considers all versions of the Apache License to be incompatible with the previous GPL versions 1 and 2. Furthermore, it considers Apache License versions before 2.0 incompatible with GPLv3. Because of version 2.0&#x27;s patent license requirements, the Free Software Foundation recommends it over other non-copyleft licenses. If the Apache License with the LLVM exception is used, then it is compatible with GPLv2.

==Reception and adoption==
In October 2012, 8,708 projects located at SourceForge.net were available under the terms of the Apache License. In a blog post from May 2008, Google mentioned that over 25% of the nearly 100,000 projects then hosted on Google Code were using the Apache License, including the Android operating system.

, according to Black Duck Software and GitHub, the Apache license is the third most popular license in the FOSS domain after MIT License and GPLv2.

The OpenBSD project does not consider the Apache License 2.0 to be an acceptable free license because of its patent provisions. The OpenBSD policy believes that when the license forces one to give up a legal right that one otherwise has, that license is no longer free. Moreover, the project objects to involving contract law with copyright law, stating &quot;...Copyright law is somewhat standardized by international agreements, contract law differs wildly among jurisdictions. So what the license means in different jurisdictions may vary and is hard to predict.&quot;

<text>A lur, also lure or lurr, is a long natural blowing horn without finger holes that is played with a brass-type embouchure. Lurs can be straight or curved in various shapes. The purpose of the curves was to make long instruments easier to carry (e.g. for marching, like the modern sousaphone) and to avoid directing the loud noise at nearby people.

The name lur is used for two distinct types of ancient wind instruments. The more recent type is made of wood and was in use in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages. The older type, named after the more recent type, is made of bronze, dates to the Bronze Age and was often found in pairs, deposited in bogs, mainly in Denmark and Germany. It consists of a mouthpiece and several pieces and/or pipes. Its length can reach between 1.5 and 2 metres. It has been found in Norway, Denmark, South Sweden, and Northern Germany. Illustrations of lurs have also been found on several rock paintings in Scandinavia.

==Wooden lurs==
The earliest references to an instrument called the lur come from Icelandic sagas, where they are described as war instruments, used to marshal troops and frighten the enemy. These lurs, several examples of which have been discovered in longboats, are straight, end-blown wooden tubes, around one metre long. They do not have finger holes, and are played much like a modern brass instrument.

A kind of lur very similar to these war instruments has been played by farmers and milkmaids in Nordic countries since at least the Middle Ages. These instruments, called in English a birch trumpet, were used for calling cattle and signalling. They are similar in construction and playing technique to the war instrument, but are covered in birch, while the war instruments are covered in willow.

==Bronze lurs==
Lurs made of bronze were used as musical instruments in ancient Greece, as well as in northern Europe where a total of 56 lurs have been discovered: 35 (including fragmentary ones) in Denmark, 11 in Sweden, 4 in Norway, 5 in northern Germany, and a single one in Latvia.

==Lurs today==
The word &quot;lur&quot; is still in the Swedish language, indicating any funnel-shaped implement used for producing or receiving sound. For instance, the Swedish word for headphones is &quot;hörlurar&quot; (hearing-lurs), and a telephone might be referred to as a &quot;lur&quot; in contemporary Swedish (derived from &quot;telefonlur&quot;, telephone handset). The Norwegian and Swedish words for foghorn are respectively &quot;tåkelur&quot; and &quot;mistlur&quot;. The Danish butter brand Lurpak is named after the lur, and the package design contains pictures of lurs.

The word &quot;lur&quot; has several other meanings in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish that are not related to sound.

<text>Foederati ( ; singular: foederatus ) were peoples and cities bound by a treaty, known as &quot;foedus&quot;, with Rome. During the Roman Republic, the term identified the &quot;socii&quot;, but during the Roman Empire, it was used to describe foreign states, client kingdoms or barbarian tribes to which the empire provided benefits in exchange for military assistance. The term was also used, especially under the empire, for groups of barbarian mercenaries of various sizes who were typically allowed to settle within the empire.

==Roman Republic==
In the early Roman Republic, &quot;foederati&quot; were tribes that were bound by a treaty (foedus ) to come to the defence of Rome but were neither Roman colonies nor beneficiaries of Roman citizenship (&quot;civitas&quot;). Members of the Latini tribe were considered blood allies, but the rest were federates or &quot;socii&quot;. The friction between the treaty obligations without the corresponding benefits of Romanity led to the Social War between the Romans, with a few close allies, and the disaffected &quot;socii&quot;. A law of 90 BC (&quot;Lex Julia&quot;) offered Roman citizenship to the federate states that accepted the terms. Not all cities were prepared to be absorbed into the Roman &quot;res publica&quot; (Heraclea and Naples). Other &quot;foederati&quot; lay outside Roman Italy such as Gades (Cádiz) and Massilia (Marseille).

==Roman Empire==
The term &quot;foederati&quot; had its usage and meaning extended by the Romans&#x27; practice of subsidising entire barbarian tribes such as the Franks, Vandals, Alans, Huns and the Visigoths, the last being the best known, in exchange for providing warriors to fight in the Roman armies. Alaric I began his career leading a band of Gothic &quot;foederati&quot;.

At first, the Roman subsidy took the form of money or food, but as tax revenues dwindled in the 4th and the 5th centuries, the &quot;foederati&quot; were billeted on local landowners, which became identical to being allowed to settle on Roman territory. Large local landowners living in distant border provinces (see &quot;marches&quot;) on extensive villas, which were largely self-sufficient, found their loyalties to the central authority, which were already conflicted by other developments, further compromised in such situations. As loyalties wavered and became more local, the empire then began to devolve into smaller territories and closer personal fealties.

===4th century===
The first Roman treaty with the Goths was after the defeat of Ariaric in 332, but whether or not it was a &quot;foedus&quot; is unclear.

The Franks became foederati in 358, when Emperor Julian let them keep the areas in northern Roman Gaul, which had been depopulated during the preceding century. Roman soldiers defended the Rhine and had major armies south and west of the Rhine. Frankish settlers were established in the areas north and east of the Romans and helped the Roman defence by providing intelligence and a buffer state. The breach of the Rhine borders in the frozen winter of 406 and 407 ended the Roman presence along the Rhine when both the Romans and the allied Franks were overrun by a massive tribal migration of Vandals and Alans.

In 376, some of the Goths asked Emperor Valens to allow them to settle on the southern bank of the Danube River and were accepted into the empire as &quot;foederati&quot;. The same Goths then revolted in retaliation for abuses and defeated the Romans in the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The critical loss of military manpower thereafter forced the Empire to rely much more on &quot;foederati&quot; levies.

The loyalty of the tribes and their chieftains was never reliable, and in 395, the Visigoths, now under the lead of Alaric, once again rose in rebellion. The father of one of the most powerful late Roman generals, Stilicho, rose from the ranks of the &quot;foederati&quot;.

===5th century===
At the Battle of Faesulae in 406 AD, Stilicho defeated the Gothic king Radagaisus and his combined Vandal and Gothic army only with the support of the Gothic chieftain Sarus and the Hunnic ruler Uldin.

In 423, the general Flavius Aetius entered the service of the usurper Joannes as &quot;cura palatii&quot; and was sent by Joannes to ask the Huns for assistance. Joannes, a high-ranking officer, lacked a strong army and fortified himself in his capital, Ravenna, where he was killed in the summer of 425. Soon, Aetius returned to Italy with a large force of Huns to find that power in the west was now in the hands of Valentinian III and his mother, Galla Placidia. After fighting against Aspar&#x27;s army, Aetius managed a compromise with Galla Placidia. He sent back his Hunnic army and in return obtained the rank of &quot;comes et magister militum per Gallias&quot;, the commander-in-chief of the Roman Army in Gaul.

Around 418 (or 426), Attaces, the king of the Alans, fell in battle against the Visigoths, who were still allies of Rome in Hispania, and most of the surviving Alans appealed to Gunderic. Their request was accepted by Gunderic, who thus became King of the Vandals and Alans.

Late in Gunderic&#x27;s reign, the Vandals themselves began to clash more and more with the Visigothic &quot;foederati&quot; and often got the worse of these battles because the Visigoths were so much more numerous. After Gunderic died early in 428, the Vandals elected his half-brother, Genseric, as the successor, and Genseric left Iberia to the Visigoths to invade Roman Africa.

By the 5th century, lacking the wealth needed to pay and train a professional army, the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s military strength was almost entirely reliant on &quot;foederati&quot; units. In 451, Attila the Hun was defeated only with help of the &quot;foederati&quot;, who included the Visigoths, Franks, Alans and Saxons. The &quot;foederati&quot; would deliver the fatal blow to the dying nominal Western Roman Empire in 476, when their commander, Odoacer, deposed the usurping Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus and sent the imperial insignia back to Constantinople with the Senate&#x27;s request for the 81-year-old west–east subdivision of the empire to be abolished. Even before the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, several kingdoms with the status of &quot;foederati&quot; had managed to gain a full independence that was formally recognised by the Western Roman Empire, such as the Vandals in the peace treaty concluded in 442 between their king, Genseric, and Valentinian III and the Visigoths through the peace treaty concluded in 475 between their king Euric and Julius Nepos.

After the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, the Ostrogoths entered relations with the Eastern Roman Empire and were settled in Pannonia to become &quot;foederati&quot; of the Byzantines. During the latter half of the 5th century, the Ostrogoths&#x27; relationship with the Byzantines started to shift from friendship to enmity, just like the Visigoths before them, and Ostrogoth King, Theoderic the Great frequently led armies that ravaged the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire and eventually threatened Constantinople itself. Eventually, Theoderic and Emperor Zeno worked out an arrangement beneficial to both sides in which Theoderic invaded Odoacer&#x27;s kingdom and eventually conquered Italy.

===6th century===
&quot;Foederati&quot; (transliterated in Greek as Φοιδερᾶτοι or translated as Σύμμαχοι) were still present in the East Roman army during the 6th century. Belisarius&#x27; and Narses&#x27; victorious armies included many &quot;foederati&quot;, but by this time the term in Greek refers to units that may once have included large numbers of non-Romans but have become professional, regular units in the Roman army that included Romans. These armies also included non-Roman elements such as Hunnic archers and Herule mercenaries who were more akin to traditional &quot;foederati&quot; but who were now referred to as symmachoi. At the Battle of Taginae, a large contingent of the Byzantine army was made up of Lombards, Gepids and Bulgars.

In the east, foederati were formed out of several Arab tribes to protect against the Persian-allied Arab Lakhmids and the tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Among these foederati were the Tanukhids, Banu Judham, Banu Amela and the Ghassanids. The term continues to be attested in the Eastern Roman armies until around the reign of Maurice. Although no longer as important as in the sixth century, a unit of &quot;foederati&quot; appear in the Byzantine &quot;thema&quot; of the Anatolikon in the ninth century.

<doc id="145925" wikidata="Q341970" url="?curid=145925" title="Acme (text editor)">
<text>Acme is a text editor and graphical shell from the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system, designed and implemented by Rob Pike. It can use the Sam command language. The design of the interface was influenced by Oberon. It is different from other editing environments in that it acts as a 9P server. A distinctive element of the user interface is mouse chording.

== Overview==
Acme can be used as a mail and news reader, or as a frontend to wikifs. These applications are made possible by external components interacting with acme through its file system interface. Rob Pike has mentioned that the name &quot;Acme&quot; was suggested to him by Penn Jillette of Penn &amp; Teller during a movie night at Times Square when he asked for a suitable name for a text editor that does &quot;everything&quot;.

== Ports ==
A port to the Inferno operating system is part of Inferno&#x27;s default distribution. Inferno can run as an application on top of other operating systems, allowing Inferno&#x27;s port of acme to be used on most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Linux. A project called &quot;acme: stand alone complex&quot; intends to make acme run as a standalone application on the host operating system.

A working port of acme for Unix-like operating systems is included in Plan 9 from User Space, a collection of various ported programs from Plan 9. Currently it has been tested on a variety of operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and SunOS.

== Notable Acme users ==
*Dennis Ritchie
*Russ Cox
*Rob Pike (Acme creator)
*Brian L. Stuart

<doc id="145928" wikidata="Q1143988" url="?curid=145928" title="The Dove (1927 film)">
<text>The Dove is a 1927 American silent romantic drama film directed by Roland West based on a 1925 Broadway play by Willard Mack and starring Norma Talmadge, Noah Beery, and Gilbert Roland.

==Background==
The original story is about Mexican despot Don José (Beery), who falls in love with the dancing girl Dolores (Talmadge) who rejects him. Due to the potential political repercussions of condemning Mexico, it was decided to relocate the plot to some anonymous Mediterranean country. The film was Norma Talmadge&#x27;s first feature for United Artists.

==Plot==
A despot falls for a dancing girl. After she rejects him, she has her other beau framed for murder.

==Cast==
* Norma Talmadge as Dolores
* Noah Beery as Don José María y Sandoval
* Gilbert Roland as Johnny Powell
* Eddie Borden as Billy
* Harry Myers as Mike
* Walter Daniels as The Drunk
* Kalla Pasha as The Comandante
* Michael Vavitch as Gómez
* Brinsley Shaw as The Patriot
* Charles Darvas as The Comandante&#x27;s Captain
* Michael Dark as Sandoval&#x27;s Captain
* Olga Baclanova as Bit Part (uncredited)
* Robert Gleckler as Bit Part (uncredited)
* Mark Hamilton as Prisoner (uncredited)
* Andy MacLennan as Bit Part (uncredited)
* Jack McDonald as Bit Part (uncredited)
* Alice White as Bit Part (uncredited)

==Recognition==
Though the film was not well received, William Cameron Menzies won the first Academy Award for Best Art Direction in 1928 for this film and &quot;Tempest&quot;, though the award was then called &quot;Interior Decoration.&quot;

In 1932, Herbert Brenon directed a new &quot;talkie&quot; version named &quot;Girl of the Rio&quot;, starred by Dolores del Río for RKO Radio Pictures.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;The Dove&quot; won the 1929 Academy Award for Best Art Direction for William Cameron Menzies.

==Preservation==
Prints of &quot;The Dove&quot; are located in the collections of the Library of Congress and Swedish Film Institute. The Library of Congress has reels 1, 3, 4, and 8, and is missing reels 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

<doc id="145930" wikidata="Q19008" url="?curid=145930" title="Arthur Balfour">
<text>Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour (; 25 July 184819 March 1930) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905. As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration of 1917 on behalf of the cabinet, which supported a &quot;home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine.

Entering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management.

In July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish landowners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher&#x27;s naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an agreement that paved the way for improved relations between the two states and their predecessors. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer War (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as &quot;methods of barbarism&quot;) and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (&quot;Chinese slavery&quot;). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George&#x27;s 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911.

Balfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith&#x27;s Coalition Government (1915–1916). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died in 1930, aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopherhe originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truthand was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: &quot;Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all.&quot;

==Background and early life==

Arthur Balfour was born at Whittingehame House, East Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son of James Maitland Balfour and Lady Blanche Gascoyne-Cecil. His father was a Scottish MP, as was his grandfather James; his mother, a member of the Cecil family descended from Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, was the daughter of the 2nd Marquess of Salisbury and his first wife, Mary Frances Gascoyne (born 1802; m. 1821; died 1839), and she was a sister of the 3rd Marquess, the future prime minister. Arthur&#x27;s godfather was the Duke of Wellington, after whom he was named. He was the eldest son, third of eight children, and had four brothers and three sisters. Arthur Balfour was educated at Grange Preparatory School at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire (1859–1861), and Eton College (1861–1866), where he studied with the influential master, William Johnson Cory. He then went up to the University of Cambridge, where he read moral sciences at Trinity College (1866–1869), graduating with a second-class honours degree. His younger brother was the Cambridge embryologist Francis Maitland Balfour (1851–1882).

==Personal life==
Balfour met May Lyttelton in 1870 when she was 19. After her two previous serious suitors had died, Balfour is said to have declared his love for her in December 1874. She died of typhus on Palm Sunday, 21 March 1875; Balfour arranged for an emerald ring to be buried in her coffin. Lavinia Talbot, May&#x27;s older sister, believed that an engagement had been imminent, but her recollections of Balfour&#x27;s distress (he was &quot;staggered&quot;) were not written down until thirty years later.

Historian R. J. Q. Adams points out that May&#x27;s letters discuss her love life in detail, but contain no evidence that she was in love with Balfour, nor that he had spoken to her of marriage. He visited her only once during her serious three-month illness, and was soon accepting social invitations again within a month of her death. Adams suggests that, although he may simply have been too shy to express his feelings fully, Balfour may also have encouraged tales of his youthful tragedy as a convenient cover for his disinclination to marry; the matter cannot be conclusively proven.

In later years mediums claimed to pass on messages from hersee the &quot;Cross-Correspondences&quot;.

Balfour remained a lifelong bachelor. Margot Tennant (later Margot Asquith) wished to marry him, but Balfour said: &quot;No, that is not so. I rather think of having a career of my own.&quot; His household was maintained by his also unmarried sister, Alice. In middle age, Balfour had a 40-year friendship with Mary Charteris (née Wyndham), Lady Elcho, later Countess of Wemyss and March.

Although one biographer writes that &quot;it is difficult to say how far the relationship went&quot;, her letters suggest they may have become lovers in 1887 and may have engaged in sado-masochism, a claim echoed by A. N. Wilson. Another biographer believes they had &quot;no direct physical relationship&quot;, although he dismisses as &quot;unlikely&quot; suggestions that Balfour was homosexual, or, in view of a time during the Boer War when he was seen as he replied to a message while drying himself after his bath, Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s claim that he was &quot;a hermaphrodite&quot; whom no-one saw naked.

Balfour was a leading member of the social and intellectual group The Souls.

==Early career==

In 1874 Balfour was elected Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Hertford until 1885. From 1885 to 1906 he served as the Member of Parliament for Manchester East. In spring 1878, he became private secretary to his uncle Lord Salisbury. He accompanied Salisbury (then Foreign Secretary) to the Congress of Berlin and gained his first experience in international politics in connection with the settlement of the Russo-Turkish conflict. At the same time he became known in the world of letters; the academic subtlety and literary achievement of his &quot;Defence of Philosophic Doubt&quot; (1879) suggested he might make a reputation as a philosopher.

Balfour divided his time between politics and academic pursuits. Biographer Sydney Zebel suggested that Balfour continued to appear an amateur or dabbler in public affairs, devoid of ambition and indifferent to policy issues. However, in fact he actually made a dramatic transition to a deeply involved politician. His assets, according to Zebel, included a strong ambition that he kept hidden, shrewd political judgment, a knack for negotiation, a taste for intrigue, and care to avoid factionalism. Most importantly, he deepened his close ties with his uncle Lord Salisbury. He also maintained cordial relationships with Disraeli, Gladstone and other national leaders.

Released from his duties as private secretary by the 1880 general election, he began to take more part in parliamentary affairs. He was for a time politically associated with Lord Randolph Churchill, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff and John Gorst. This quartet became known as the &quot;Fourth Party&quot; and gained notoriety for leader Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s free criticism of Sir Stafford Northcote, Lord Cross and other prominent members of the Conservative &quot;old gang&quot;.

==Service in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s governments==
===Irish Secretary===

In 1885, Lord Salisbury appointed Balfour President of the Local Government Board; the following year he became Secretary for Scotland with a seat in the cabinet. These offices, while offering few opportunities for distinction, were an apprenticeship. In early 1887, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, resigned because of illness and Salisbury appointed his nephew in his place. The selection was much criticised. It was received with contemptuous ridicule by the Irish Nationalists, for none suspected Balfour&#x27;s immense strength of will, his debating power, his ability in attack and his still greater capacity to disregard criticism. Balfour surprised critics by ruthless enforcement of the Crimes Act. The Mitchelstown Massacre occurred on 9 September 1887, when Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) members fired at a crowd protesting against the conviction under the Act of MP William O&#x27;Brien and another man. Three were killed by the RIC&#x27;s gunfire. When Balfour defended the RIC in the Commons, O&#x27;Brien dubbed him &quot;Bloody Balfour&quot;. His steady administration did much to dispel his reputation as a political lightweight.

In Parliament he resisted overtures to the Irish Parliamentary Party on Home Rule, which he saw as an expression of superficial or false Irish nationalism. Allied with Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s Liberal Unionists, he encouraged Unionist activism in Ireland. Balfour also helped the poor by creating the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1890. Balfour downplayed the factor of Irish nationalism, arguing that the real issues were economic. Regarding ownership and control of the land, he believed that once violence was suppressed and land was sold to the tenants, Irish nationalism would no longer threaten the unity of the United Kingdom. The slogan &quot;to kill home rule with kindness&quot; characterised Balfour&#x27;s new policy toward Ireland. The Liberals had begun land sales to Irish tenants with the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 and this was expanded by the Conservatives in the land purchase scheme of 1885. However the depression in agriculture kept prices low. Balfour&#x27;s solution was to keep selling land and in 1887 lowering rents to match the lower prices, and protected more tenants against eviction by their landlords. Balfour greatly expanded the land sales. They culminated in the final Unionist land purchase programme of 1903, when Balfour was prime minister and George Wyndham was the Irish secretary. It encouraged landlords to sell by means of a 12% cash bonus. Tenants were encouraged to buy with a low interest rate, and payments drawn out over 68 years. In 1909, Liberal legislation required compulsory sales in certain cases. As the landlords sold out, they relocated to Great Britain, giving up their political power in Ireland. Tensions in the countryside dramatically declined as some 200,000 peasant proprietors owned about half the land in Ireland. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party recovered after its bitter post-Parnell split was healed and became the dominant political force in Ireland once again, eventually using its position as Westminster kingmaker to secure the passage of a Home Rule Act when the Liberals returned to power. This led in turn to the Home Rule crisis, the formation of the Ulster Volunteers and Irish Volunteers, and a period of growing nationalist and unionist radicalisation that culminated in the Easter rebellion of 1916 and the subsequent War of Independence.

===Leadership roles===

In 1886–1892 he became one of the most effective public speakers of the age. Impressive in matter rather than delivery, his speeches were logical and convincing, and delighted an ever-wider audience.
On the death of W. H. Smith in 1891, Balfour became First Lord of the Treasurythe last in British history not to have been concurrently prime minister as welland Leader of the House of Commons. After the fall of the government in 1892 he spent three years in opposition. When the Conservatives returned to power, in coalition with the Liberal Unionists, in 1895, Balfour again became Leader of the House and First Lord of the Treasury. His management of the abortive education proposals of 1896 showed a disinclination for the drudgery of parliamentary management, yet he saw the passage of a bill providing Ireland with improved local government under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and joined in debates on foreign and domestic questions between 1895 and 1900.

During the illness of Lord Salisbury in 1898, and again in Salisbury&#x27;s absence abroad, Balfour was in charge of the Foreign Office, and he conducted negotiations with Russia on the question of railways in North China. As a member of the cabinet responsible for the Transvaal negotiations in 1899, he bore his share of controversy and, when the Second Boer War began disastrously, he was first to realise the need to use the country&#x27;s full military strength. His leadership of the House was marked by firmness in the suppression of obstruction, yet there was a slight revival of the criticisms of 1896.

==Prime minister==

With Lord Salisbury&#x27;s resignation on 11 July 1902, Balfour succeeded him as prime minister, with the approval of all the Unionist party. The new prime minister came into power practically at the same moment as the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra and the end of the South African War. The Liberal party was still disorganised over the Boers.

In foreign affairs, Balfour and his foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne, improved relations with France, culminating in the Entente Cordiale of 1904. The period also saw the Russo-Japanese War, when Britain, an ally of the Japanese, came close to war with Russia after the Dogger Bank incident. On the whole, Balfour left the conduct of foreign policy to Lansdowne, being busy himself with domestic problems.

Balfour, who had known Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann since 1906, opposed Russian mistreatment of Jews and increasingly supported Zionism as a programme for European Jews to settle in Palestine. However, in 1905 he supported the Aliens Act 1905, one of whose main objectives was to control and restrict Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe.

The budget was certain to show a surplus and taxation could be remitted. Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. Charles Thomson Ritchie&#x27;s remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with trade preference given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire in the face of growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation. As the session proceeded, the rift grew in the Unionist ranks. Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross. Hoping to split the difference between the free traders and tariff reformers in his cabinet and party, Balfour favoured retaliatory tariffs to punish others who had tariffs against the British, in the hope of encouraging global free trade.
This was not sufficient for either the free traders or the extreme tariff reformers in government. With Balfour&#x27;s agreement, Chamberlain resigned from the Cabinet in late 1903 to campaign for tariff reform. At the same time, Balfour tried to balance the two factions by accepting the resignation of three free-trading ministers, including Chancellor Ritchie, but the almost simultaneous resignation of the free-trader Duke of Devonshire (who as Lord Hartington had been the Liberal Unionist leader of the 1880s) left Balfour&#x27;s Cabinet weak. By 1905 few Unionist MPs were still free traders (Winston Churchill crossed to the Liberals in 1904 when threatened with deselection at Oldham), but Balfour&#x27;s act had drained his authority within the government.

Balfour resigned as prime minister in December 1905, hoping the Liberal leader Campbell-Bannerman would be unable to form a strong government. This was dashed when Campbell-Bannerman faced down an attempt (&quot;The Relugas Compact&quot;) to &quot;kick him upstairs&quot; to the House of Lords. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberals at the general election the following January (in terms of MPs, a Liberal landslide), with Balfour losing his seat at Manchester East to Thomas Gardner Horridge, a solicitor and King&#x27;s Counsel. Only 157 Conservatives were returned to the Commons, at least two-thirds followers of Chamberlain, who chaired the Conservative MPs until Balfour won a by-election for a safe seat in the City of London.

===Achievements===
According to historian Robert Ensor, Balfour can be credited with achievement in five major areas:
# The Education Act 1902 (and a similar measure for London in 1903);
# The Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out the Anglo-Irish landowners;
# The Licensing Act 1904; 
# In military policy, the creation of the Committee of Imperial Defence (1904) and support for Sir John Fisher&#x27;s naval reforms. 
# In foreign policy, the Anglo-French Convention (1904), which formed the basis of the Entente Cordiale with France.

The Education Act lasted four decades and eventually was highly praised. Eugene Rasor states, &quot;Balfour was credited and much praised from many perspectives with the success [of the 1902 education act]. His commitment to education was fundamental and strong.&quot; At the time it hurt Balfour because the Liberal party used it to rally their Noncomformist supporters. Ensor said the Act ranked:
For most of the 19th century, the very powerful political and economic position of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) landowners opposed the political aspirations of Irish nationalists. Balfour&#x27;s solution was to buy them out, not by compulsion, but by offering the owners a full immediate payment and a 12% bonus on the sales price. The British government purchased 13 million acres (53,000 km2) by 1920, and sold farms to the tenants at low payments spread over seven decades. It would cost money, but all sides proved amenable. Starting in 1923 the Irish government bought out most of the remaining landowners, and in 1933 diverted payments being made to the British treasury and used them for local improvements.

Balfour&#x27;s introduction of Chinese coolie labour in South Africa enabled the Liberals to counterattack, charging that his measures amounted to &quot;Chinese slavery&quot;. Likerwise Liberals energised the Nonconformists when they attacked Balfour&#x27;s Licensing Act 1904 which paid pub owners to close down. In the long run it did reduce the great oversupply of pubs, while in the short run Balfour&#x27;s party was hurt.

Balfour failed to solve his greatest political challengethe debate over tariffs that ripped his party apart. Chamberlain proposed to turn the Empire into a closed trade bloc protected by high tariffs against imports from Germany and the United States. He argued that tariff reform would revive a flagging British economy, strengthen imperial ties with the dominions and the colonies, and produce a positive programme that would facilitate reelection. He was vehemently opposed by Conservative free traders who denounced the proposal as economically fallacious, and open to the charge of raising food prices in Britain. Balfour tried to forestall disruption by removing key ministers on each side, and offering a much narrower tariff programme. It was ingenious, but both sides rejected any compromise, and his party&#x27;s chances for reelection were ruined.

Historians generally praised Balfour&#x27;s achievements in military and foreign policy. stress the importance of the Anglo-French Entente of 1904, and the establishment of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Rasor points to twelve historians who have examined his key role in naval and military reforms. However, there was little political payback at the time. The local Conservative campaigns in 1906 focused mostly on a few domestic issues. Balfour gave strong support for Jackie Fisher&#x27;s naval reforms.

Balfour created and chaired the Committee of Imperial Defence, which provided better long-term coordinated planning between the Army and Navy. Austen Chamberlain said Britain would have been unprepared for the First World War without his Committee of Imperial Defence. He wrote, &quot;It is impossible to overrate the services thus rendered by Balfour to the Country and Empire...[Without the CID] victory would have been impossible.&quot; Historians also praised the Anglo-French Convention (1904), which formed the basis of the Entente Cordiale with France that proved decisive in 1914.

Balfour may have been personally sympathetic to extending suffrage, with his brother Gerald, Conservative MP for Leeds Central married to women&#x27;s suffrage activist Constance Lytton&#x27;s sister Betty, but he accepted the strength of the political opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage, as shown in correspondence with Christabel Pankhurst, a leader of the WSPU. Balfour argued that he was &quot;not convinced the majority of women actually wanted the vote&quot;, in 1907. A rebuttal which meant extending the activist campaign for women&#x27;s rights. He was reminded by Lytton of a speech he made in 1892, namely that this question &quot;will arise again, menacing and ripe for resolution&quot;, she asked him to meet WSPU leader, Christabel Pankhurst, after a series of hunger strikes and suffering by imprisoned suffragettes in 1907. Balfour refused on the grounds of her militancy. Christabel pleaded direct to meet Balfour as Conservative party leader, on their policy manifesto for the General Election of 1909, but he refused again as women&#x27;s suffrage was &quot;not a party question and his colleagues were divided on the matter&quot;. She tried and failed again to get his open support in parliament for women&#x27;s cause in the 1910 private member&#x27;s Conciliation Bill. He voted for the bill in the end but not for its progress to the Grand Committee, preventing it becoming law, and extending the activist campaigns as a result again. The following year Lytton and Annie Kenney in person after another reading of the Bill, but again it was not prioritised as government business. His sister-in-law Lady Betty Balfour spoke to Churchill that her brother was to speak for this policy, and also met the Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith in a 1911 delegation of the women&#x27;s movements representing the Conservative and Unionist Women&#x27;s Franchise Association but it was not until 1918 that (some) women were given the right to vote in elections in the United Kingdom, despite a forty-year campaign.

==Later career==
After the general election of 1906 Balfour remained party leader, his position strengthened by Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s absence from the House of Commons after his stroke in July 1906, but he was unable to make much headway against the huge Liberal majority in the Commons. An early attempt to score a debating triumph over the government, made in Balfour&#x27;s usual abstruse, theoretical style, saw Campbell-Bannerman respond with: &quot;Enough of this foolery,&quot; to the delight of his supporters. Balfour made the controversial decision, with Lord Lansdowne, to use the heavily Unionist House of Lords as a check on the political programme and legislation of the Liberal party in the Commons. Legislation was vetoed or altered by amendments between 1906 and 1909, leading David Lloyd George to remark that the Lords was &quot;the right hon. Gentleman&#x27;s poodle. It fetches and carries for him. It barks for him. It bites anybody that he sets it on to. And we are told that this is a great revising Chamber, the safeguard of liberty in the country.&quot; The issue was forced by the Liberals with Lloyd George&#x27;s People&#x27;s Budget, provoking the constitutional crisis that led to the Parliament Act 1911, which limited the Lords to delaying bills for up to two years. After the Unionists lost the general elections of 1910 (despite softening the tariff reform policy with Balfour&#x27;s promise of a referendum on food taxes), the Unionist peers split to allow the Parliament Act to pass the House of Lords, to prevent mass creation of Liberal peers by the new King, George V. The exhausted Balfour resigned as party leader after the crisis, and was succeeded in late 1911 by Bonar Law.

Balfour remained important in the party, however, and when the Unionists joined Asquith&#x27;s coalition government in May 1915, Balfour succeeded Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty. When Asquith&#x27;s government collapsed in December 1916, Balfour, who seemed a potential successor to the premiership, became foreign secretary in Lloyd George&#x27;s new administration, but not in the small War Cabinet, and was frequently left out of inner workings of government. Balfour&#x27;s service as foreign secretary was notable for the Balfour Mission, a crucial alliance-building visit to the US in April 1917, and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter to Lord Rothschild affirming the government&#x27;s support for the establishment of a &quot;national home for the Jewish people&quot; in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire.

Balfour resigned as foreign secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, but continued in the government (and the Cabinet after normal peacetime political arrangements resumed) as Lord President of the Council. In 1921–22 he represented the British Empire at the Washington Naval Conference and during summer 1922 stood in for the foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, who was ill. He put forward a proposal for the international settlement of war debts and reparations (the Balfour Note), but it was not accepted.

On 5 May 1922, Balfour was created Earl of Balfour and Viscount Traprain, of Whittingehame, in the county of Haddington. In October 1922 he, with most of the Conservative leadership, resigned with Lloyd George&#x27;s government following the Carlton Club meeting, a Conservative back-bench revolt against continuance of the coalition. Bonar Law became prime minister. Like many Coalition leaders, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922–1924, but as an elder statesman, he was consulted by the King in the choice of Stanley Baldwin as Bonar Law&#x27;s successor as Conservative leader in May 1923. His advice was strongly in favour of Baldwin, ostensibly due to Baldwin&#x27;s being an MP but in reality motivated by his personal dislike of Curzon. Later that evening, he met a mutual friend who asked &#x27;Will dear George be chosen?&#x27; to which he replied with &quot;feline Balfourian satisfaction,&quot; &quot;No, dear George will not.&quot; His hostess replied, &quot;Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. He will be terribly disappointed.&quot; Balfour retorted, &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know. After all, even if he has lost the hope of glory he still possesses the means of Grace.&quot;

Balfour was not initially included in Baldwin&#x27;s second government in 1924, but in 1925, he returned to the Cabinet, in place of the late Lord Curzon as Lord President of the Council, until the government ended in 1929. With 28 years of government service, Balfour had one of the longest ministerial careers in modern British politics, second only to Winston Churchill.

==Last years==

Lord Balfour had generally good health until 1928 and remained until then a regular tennis player. Four years previously he had been the first president of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. At the end of 1928, most of his teeth were removed and he suffered the unremitting circulatory trouble which ended his life. Before that, he had suffered occasional phlebitis and, by late 1929, he was immobilised by it. Following a visit from Chaim Weizmann, Balfour died at his brother Gerald&#x27;s home, Fishers Hill House in Hook Heath, Woking, where he had lived since January 1929, on 19 March 1930. At his request a public funeral was declined, and he was buried on 22 March beside members of his family at Whittingehame in a Church of Scotland service although he also belonged to the Church of England. By special remainder, his title passed to his brother Gerald.

His obituaries in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; did not mention the declaration for which he is most famous outside Britain.

==Personality==

Early in Balfour&#x27;s career he was thought to be merely amusing himself with politics, and it was regarded as doubtful whether his health could withstand the severity of English winters. He was considered a dilettante by his colleagues; regardless, Lord Salisbury gave increasingly powerful posts in his government to his nephew.

Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary:
Balfour developed a manner known to friends as the &quot;Balfourian manner&quot;. Harold Begbie, a journalist, attacked him for what Begbie considered Balfour&#x27;s self-obsession:
However, Graham Goodlad argued to the contrary:
Churchill compared Balfour to H. H. Asquith: &quot;The difference between Balfour and Asquith is that Arthur is wicked and moral, while Asquith is good and immoral.&quot; Balfour said of himself, &quot;I am more or less happy when being praised, not very comfortable when being abused, but I have moments of uneasiness when being explained.&quot;

Balfour was interested in the study of dialects and donated money to Joseph Wright&#x27;s work on &quot;The English Dialect Dictionary&quot;. Wright wrote in the preface to the first volume that the project would have been &quot;in vain&quot; had he not received the donation from Balfour.

Balfour was into the 1920s a keen player both of lawn tennis and of golf. In the latter sport, he had a handicap of eight at the time he was prime minister, he won the Parliamentary Handicap between members of parliament in 1894, 1897 and 1910, and served as captain both of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1894 and the newly founded Lye club in 1895. Balfour was a patron of Manchester City F.C. He was also a keen motorist and received, as an 80th birthday present, a Rolls-Royce from both Houses of Parliament.

==Writings and academic achievements==
As a philosopher, Balfour formulated the basis for the evolutionary argument against naturalism. Balfour argued the Darwinian premise of selection for reproductive fitness cast doubt on scientific naturalism, because human cognitive facilities that would accurately perceive truth could be less advantageous than adaptation for evolutionarily useful illusions.

As he says:

He was a member of the Society for Psychical Research, a society studying psychic and paranormal phenomena, and was its president from 1892 to 1894. In 1914, he delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, which formed the basis for his book &quot;Theism and Humanism&quot; (1915).

===Views on race===

In 1906, during a House of Commons debate, Balfour argued that the disenfranchisement of the blacks in South Africa was not immoral. He said:
 
Political scholar Yousef Munayyer has claimed that Arthur Balfour&#x27;s antisemitism played a role in the issuance of the Balfour Declaration, citing Balfour&#x27;s presiding over, as prime minister, the passage of the Aliens Act 1905 that mainly aimed to restrict Jewish immigration to Britain from Eastern Europe. Balfour had written in 1919, in his introduction to Nahum Sokolow&#x27;s &quot;History of Zionism&quot;, that the Zionist movement would:

==Artistic==

After the First World War, when there was controversy over the style of headstone proposed for use on British war graves being taken on by the Imperial War Graves Commission, Balfour submitted a design for a cruciform headstone. At an exhibition in August 1919, it drew many criticisms; the commission&#x27;s principal architect, Sir John Burnet said that Balfour&#x27;s cross, if used in large numbers in cemeteries, would create a criss-cross visual effect, destroying any sense of &quot;restful diginity&quot;; Edwin Lutyens called it &quot;extraordinarily ugly&quot;, and its shape was variously described as resembling a shooting target or bottle. His design was not accepted but the Commission offered him a second chance to submit another design which he did not take up, having been refused once. After a further exhibition in the House of Commons, the &quot;Balfour cross&quot; was ultimately rejected in favour of the standard headstone the Commission permanently adopted because the latter offered more space for inscriptions and service emblems.

==Popular culture==
Balfour occasionally appears in popular culture.
* Balfour was the subject of two parody novels based on Alice in Wonderland, &quot;Clara in Blunderland&quot; (1902) and &quot;Lost in Blunderland&quot; (1903), which appeared under the pseudonym Caroline Lewis; one of the co-authors was Harold Begbie.
* The character Arthur Balfour plays a supporting, off-screen role in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, promoting the family patriarch, Richard Bellamy, to the position of Civil Lord of the Admiralty.
* Balfour was portrayed by Adrian Ropes in the 1974 Thames TV production &quot;&quot;.
* Balfour was portrayed by Lyndon Brook in the 1975 ATV production &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;.
* A fictionalised version of Arthur Balfour (identified as &quot;Mr. Balfour&quot;) appears as British prime minister in the science fiction romance &quot;The Angel of the Revolution&quot; by George Griffith, published in 1893 (when Balfour was still in opposition) but set in an imagined near future of 1903–1905.
* The indecisive Balfour (identified as &quot;Halfan Halfour&quot;) appears in &quot;Ministers of Grace&quot;, a satirical short story by Saki in which he, and other leading politicians including Quinston, are changed into animals appropriate to their characters.

==Legacy==
Balfour&#x27;s premiership from July 1902 to December 1905 is unusual among modern prime ministers because it did not mark the culmination of his political career. Instead, it was merely an episode in a long life of public service, and he quickly recovered from the setbacks of his chequered premiership. He continued to serve in government for nearly a quarter of a century after leaving 10 Downing Street, despite being forced from the leadership of his party.

Balfour&#x27;s reputation among historians is mixed. There is agreement about his achievements, as represented by G. M. Trevelyan:
:As the prime author of the Education Act, the Licensing Act, Irish Land Purchase and the Committee of Imperial Defence, Balfour has a strong claim to be numbered among the successful Prime Ministers.

But Trevelyan admits that, &quot;owing to the portentous character of the electoral catastrophe of 1906 that claim is not always been allowed; yet Balfour had done great things on his own initiative and by his own strength of character.&quot; John L. Gordon pays more attention to the defeats he suffered, stating:
:Although Balfour&#x27;s achievements during his brief prime ministry are noteworthy... he is usually seen as an ineffective leader. He was unable to prevent a split in his party over trade policy, and the Unionist-Conservatives suffered a massive defeat in the election of January 1906. Failing to lead his party to victory in the two general elections of 1910, he resigned as leader in 1911.

===Memorials===
Balfouria, a &quot;moshav&quot; in northern Israel, along with many streets in Israel, are named after him. The town of Balfour in Mpumalanga, South Africa, was named after him.

A portrait of Balfour by Philip de László is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge. The 1914 portrait was vandalised (sprayed with red paint and slashed) by an activist of the Palestine Action network during the 2023-24 Israel-Hamas war.

The Lord Balfour Hotel, an Art Deco hotel on Ocean Drive in the South Beach neighbourhood of Miami Beach, Florida, is named after him.

<text>Guy Maurice Marie Louise Verhofstadt (; ; born 11 April 1953) is a Belgian liberal and European federalist politician. He is a former prime minister of Belgium. He was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Belgium from 2009 until 2024. 

He was a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives from 1985 to 2009. He served as deputy prime minister of Belgium and minister of Budget from 1985 to 1992. He was the prime minister of Belgium from 1999 to 2008. During this period, he gradually moved away from neoliberalism and became more of a centrist figure.

In the European Parliament, he was the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) from 2009 to 2019. In 2010, he co-founded the inter-parliamentarian Spinelli Group to support the creation of a European Federation. He was the ALDE Party nominee for President of the European Commission in the 2014 European Parliament election. He served as the European Parliament&#x27;s Brexit Coordinator and Chair of the Brexit Steering Group from 2016 to 2020.

==Early career==
Born in 1953 in Dendermonde, he became president of the Liberaal Vlaams Studententverbond (Liberal Flemish Students&#x27; Association) (1972–1974), while studying law at the University of Ghent. He quickly became the secretary of Willy De Clercq, who was at that time the president of the Flemish liberal party (PVV). In 1982, at age 29, he became president of the party. In 1985, he was elected into the Chamber of Deputies, and became deputy prime minister and minister of budget under Prime Minister Wilfried Martens. Because of his economic views and his young age, he became known as &quot;Baby Thatcher&quot;.

After being ousted from government he became leader of the opposition. After a failed attempt to form a government in November 1991, he changed the PVV into the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). This new party attracted many politicians from other parties, notably from the Volksunie (VU) and the Christian People&#x27;s Party (CVP).

However, despite the fact that many had high expectations, the party did not manage to outstrip the CVP. Verhofstadt resigned and disappeared from the political scene, only to return to the party&#x27;s presidency in 1997, with a less radical image. He gradually moved away from neoliberalism (partly under the influence of his brother Dirk, a social liberal political philosopher), and became more of a centrist figure, a change which especially became clear during his first term as prime minister.

==Prime Minister of Belgium (1999–2008)==
===Verhofstadt I===

Partly because of a food scandal that broke out just before the 1999 elections, the VLD became the largest party in the country, obtaining over 22% of the vote in Flanders. He quickly formed a coalition with the Flemish socialists and greens and the French-speaking counterparts of these parties (a symmetric coalition) in Brussels and Wallonia. He was appointed prime minister on 12 July 1999, the first liberal to hold that office since 1938. It was the first Belgian government without a Christian Democratic party since 1958, and the first one to include green parties.
Verhofstadt was awarded the Vision for Europe Award in 2002 for his work toward a more unified Europe. The economic situation gave him leeway to raise the lowest social benefits and lower taxation. After 2001, the economic situation worsened. The &#x27;Aging Fund&#x27; or &#x27;Silver Fund&#x27; was set up, in order to ensure the maintenance of pensions until 2030.

Much to the disapproval of his coalition partners, Verhofstadt and his VLD opposed granting the right to vote to non-EU residents. Instead, they proposed and were able to liberalise the procedure for obtaining Belgian citizenship. During the prelude to the Iraq crisis of 2003, Belgium joined France, Germany and Russia in opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

===Verhofstadt II===

Following the 2003 general elections, Verhofstadt formed his second cabinet without the green parties, who were virtually annihilated in the election. For various reasons, the formation of the second government was delayed well beyond normal: the economic situation worsened to 1999 levels, both politically similar parties (liberals and socialists) gained approximately the same seats.

Guy Verhofstadt&#x27;s second Government consisted of his liberal Open VLD their sister liberal MR, the Flemish social democratic SP.a and their sister social democratic party PS to form another Purple coalition.

Following international pressure over Belgium&#x27;s War Crimes Law, which asserted universal jurisdiction, allowing anyone to bring war crime charges in Belgian courts, Verhofstadt&#x27;s second government agreed to amend the law in favour of more limited jurisdiction. The law had faced criticism that it was encouraging politically motivated complaints.

In the Flemish regional elections of 13 June 2004, his party lost votes, slipping into third place in Flanders. Though this has had no direct impact upon his position as prime minister, there were rumours that the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V) party that won the elections, would participate in federal government. Verhofstadt was suggested as a candidate to replace Romano Prodi as the next President of the European Commission, but his candidacy was opposed and rejected by a coalition led by Tony Blair and other leaders who had disagreed with Verhofstadt&#x27;s uncompromising criticisms of the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq the previous year.
After this Verhofstadt was faced with a succession of internal crises. The first, coming to a head in the autumn of 2004, was the question whether DHL would invest in Brussels Airport, located in the Flemish municipality of Zaventem. The question which nearly caused the collapse of the cabinet was whether to grant DHL extra landing rights during the night, this being a hot topic of public debate and various court cases. In the end the split between employment and night rest was for nought as DHL had only used the Zaventem option in order to get better conditions from Leipzig.

Following the DHL crisis, Verhofstadt faced a crisis over the allocation of constitutional and administrative powers and responsibilities for the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district (commonly abbreviated as BHV). Division of the powers had been written into the government coalition agreement by the parties controlling the Flemish regional government. This triggered a veto from the Walloon parties. The crisis dragged on until spring 2005, when the matter was shelved till after the federal elections of 2007. By 2005, the Flemish parties participating in the government did not want the government to collapse, given their poor ratings in the opinion polls.

Verhofstadt voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. Verhofstadt said that Israel has the right to defend itself, but has now responded with excessive violence.

On 13 December 2006, a regular programming on the Belgian national television channel &quot;La Une&quot; was interrupted for a news bulletin claiming that the Flemish parliament had issued a unilateral declaration of independence from the Kingdom of Belgium, mimicking the Belgian secession from the Netherlands some 175 years earlier. The broadcast of the report led to widespread alarm and consternation in French-speaking Belgium and Verhofstadt condemned the report as &quot;irresponsible&quot;. In the years coming to the hoax there was rising Flemish separatism and the Vlaams Belang party received strong support in the regional elections. The hoax almost became reality in 2007 after a major political crisis drove many to believe that the partition of Belgium was almost certain.

The constitutional court of Belgium ruled that all elections held after 10 June 2007, would be constitutionally invalid because of the non-separation of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. In the autumn of 2005, Verhofstadt managed to score a success when he was able to negotiate a &quot;Generation Pact&quot; with regard to employment and social reforms, regardless of the opposition and actions of the unions.

Verhofstadt was sworn in as municipal councilor in Ghent in January 2007, as a result of the 2006 municipal elections. In the council, he is seated next to another cabinet minister, Freya Van den Bossche, who was elected a municipal councillor as well. He even postponed a visit to the Russian President Vladimir Putin to be able to go to the first session of the newly elected council. 

===Verhofstadt III===

Verhofstadt led the VLD into the 2007 general election. Already with the 2006 municipal elections, the VLD showed signs of fatigue with the Flemish voter, who seem to have had enough of eight years of Verhofstadt, and the purple coalition governments. In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat and asked for a new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after formation of a new government. However, the formation of a new government was complicated, and in the end, CD&amp;V politician Yves Leterme failed to bring about a new government.

Yet certain policy matters became politically urgent. The King therefore asked Verhofstadt to mediate an &quot;interim government&quot; that would be in office for three months and could propose a 2008 budget. A deal was struck in December, and the &quot;interim government&quot; was set for inauguration on 21 December 2007. Two days later, this interim government won a vote of confidence in parliament, with 97 votes in favor, 46 opposed, and one abstention, assuring its legitimacy for three months.

One of the first decisions of the new government, on 21 December 2007, was to raise the security level after foiling an attempted jail break of an Al Qaeda operative.

Belgium was one of the first countries to recognise Kosovo&#x27;s unilateral declaration of independence on 24 February 2008.

A &quot;permanent government&quot; under leadership of Yves Leterme assumed office on 20 March 2008.

===Senator===
After his premiership Verhofstadt took up the seat of Senator to which he had been elected in 2007.

==As MEP (2009-)==

In the 2009 European Parliament election, Verhofstadt was elected a member of the European Parliament for the term 2009–2014. He has since been appointed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.

On 1 July 2009, Verhofstadt was elected President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group in the European Parliament. In this capacity, he was also a member of the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament until July 2019.

In June 2009 Verhofstadt was put forward as the possible candidate for replacing José Manuel Barroso as the president of the European Commission by a coalition of greens, socialists and liberals. On 15 September 2010, he supported the new Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate the drive for federalisation of the European Union.

In 2010, Belgian Liberal member of the European Parliament and Verhofstadt&#x27;s close ally Louis Michel called King Leopold II of Belgium, the Congo Free State&#x27;s colonial master responsible for the deaths of between 3 million and 10 million Congolese Africans, a &quot;visionary hero&quot;. Verhofstadt, then leader of the Liberals in the European Parliament, refused to comment on Michel&#x27;s controversial remarks.
In 2014, Verhofstadt contested for the role of Spitzenkandidat against a field that included José Bové, Martin Schulz and eventual winner Jean-Claude Juncker.

In September 2016, Verhofstadt was named the European Parliament&#x27;s representative on matters relating to Brexit. In his public statements, Verhofstadt has focused on the rights of EU citizens within the UK and British citizens in the EU. In November 2016, Verhofstadt warned the European Parliament of a coming &quot;ring of autocrats&quot;, citing the increasing assertiveness of Russia and Turkey, and contemplating the (at that time widely discounted) possibility of a Trump presidency.

From 2019, Verhofstadt was a member of the Working Group on the Conference on the Future of Europe. By 2021, the European Parliament appointed him as its chair to lead the Conference on the Future of Europe.

On 8 May 2023 Verhofstadt announced his retirement from politics after the term of the present parliament concluded.

On 11 April 2024 Verhofstadt led the Parliament to deny budgetary resources to the European Council because they had not yet found the air defences that were needed by the Ukrainians, as they fought off the Russian forces of Vladimir Putin. He was supported by 515 yeas against 62 nays and the motion passed.

==Political positions==
===Iraq War===
Verhofstadt opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq. In 2005, during a meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush, Verhofstadt said: &quot;The time has come to draw a line under the tensions of the recent past. It makes little sense to continue arguing about who was right and who was wrong.&quot;

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
As prime minister, Verhofstadt supported &quot;ethical diplomacy&quot;, international law and multilateralism, as well as Louis Michel&#x27;s &quot;équidistance&quot; policy in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Relations with Israel improved after Verhofstadt&#x27;s government in 2003 weakened the so-called genocide law, under which Ariel Sharon could have been tried in Belgium for the Sabra and Shatila massacre. The 2001 Belgian EU presidency semester was considered cautious on the matter.

In 2024, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Verhofstadt called for a &quot;ceasefire now&quot;.

===Bahraini uprising===
Verhofstadt condemned the killings of protesters during Bahrain&#x27;s pro-democracy uprising in 2011. He said: &quot;Protestors were killed, tortured and imprisoned. These incidents need to be properly investigated and brought to justice - not swept under the carpet. Until this has happened, I fully agree that the Formula One Grand Prix should not return to Bahrain.&quot;

===Catalan independence===

In 2017, Verhofstadt opposed the Catalan independence referendum, but also denounced Spain&#x27;s use of violence. Verhofstadt said that &quot;referendum lacked basic democratic legitimacy&quot;. According to Verhofstadt, the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont &quot;left Catalonia in chaos and devastation&quot;.

===Russia===
In April 2015, Verhofstadt criticized Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras over his meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian War and difficult negotiations between the EU/ECB/IMF and Tsipras&#x27;s recently elected Syriza-led government. Via Twitter according to the New York &quot;Times&quot;, Verhofstadt said Tsipras &quot;should stop trying to play Putin against the EU&quot; and that Tsipras &quot;should play according to the common rules and conduct serious reforms&quot;.

In May 2015, news media reported that Verhofstadt was included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

In June 2018, Verhofstadt said there was a &quot;circle of evil around our continent&quot;: Putin&#x27;s Russia, Erdoğan&#x27;s Turkey and Trump&#x27;s United States. Verhofstadt added: &quot;But our problem runs deeper than that, deeper than only foreign policy or external security. Europe has a fifth column in its ranks. ... I call them the cheerleaders of Putin: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage. ... Together with government leaders like Orbán, Kaczyński, Salvini: these people have only one goal and that is to destroy Europe, to kill our liberal democracy.&quot;

===Myanmar===
On 8 September 2017, Verhofstaft branded Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi &quot;a disgrace&quot; following her controversial comments about the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar.

===Turkey=== 

In November 2016, Verhofstadt said &quot;There is broad, broad majority in the house to say you have to freeze accessions talks for the moment and put a number of conditions to restart them once Turkey is compliant.&quot;

In May 2017, he accused President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of cynicism for advocating freedom of speech while journalists are imprisoned in Turkey.

===Migration===
In August 2015, Verhofstadt called for a reform of the EU&#x27;s asylum and migration system, in reaction to the European migrant crisis. He also criticised UK Prime Minister David Cameron and French president François Hollande for opposing the European Commission&#x27;s proposal to distribute asylum requests for migrants over all countries of the European Union. He also called on governments of France, the UK, and Hungary to stop building up walls and border security measures, and to shift their effort on humanitarian assistance. This humanitarian assistance includes asking the dysfunctional countries that source migrants to address their own dysfunction.

===European federalism===
Following the results of 2005 European Constitution referendum in France and The Netherlands, Verhofstadt released his book, Verenigde Staten van Europa (&quot;United States of Europe&quot;). Written in Dutch, the book claims – based on the results of a Eurobarometer questionnaire – that the average European citizen wants &quot;more Europe&quot;.

In September 2019, Verhofstadt gave a speech at the conference of the UK Liberal Democrats in Bournemouth, saying that &quot;the world of tomorrow is not a world order based on nation states or countries. It is a world order that is based on empires. China, is not a nation, it&#x27;s a civilisation. India is not a nation. The US is also an empire, more than a nation. And then finally the Russian Federation. The world of tomorrow is a world of empires in which we Europeans, and you British, can only defend your interests, your way of life, by doing it together, in a European framework and in the European Union.&quot;

===Brexit=== 

In January 2013, three years before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Verhofstadt said &quot;[ Brexit ] is stupidity for a country with 53 percent of its exports going to the Continent and to the rest of Europe. It&#x27;s even so stupid that Britain&#x27;s best friends, the United States, don&#x27;t understand it all.&quot;

In February 2016, in the run-up to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Verhofstadt said &quot;The only winners from a Brexit would be Nigel Farage and Vladimir Putin; who would relish a divided Europe.&quot;

In July 2016, Verhofstadt said &quot;Politically, the UK is already on its way to becoming an , rather than a trusted partner, of the EU… Theresa May actually opposed Brexit, yet her anti-European hostility differs only in degree, not in kind, from that of pro-Brexit politicians… who rejoice at the possibility of additional exit referenda across the EU.&quot;

In October 2017, Verhofstadt claimed that Northern Ireland was stuck in a &quot;frozen conflict&quot;. He said: &quot;There are fences 12 metres high and this is in the 21st Century.&quot;

In a Twitter post on 13 June 2018, Verhofstadt accused Nigel Farage of using &quot;Kremlin money and claimed Aaron Banks &quot;colluded with the Russians to deliver Brexit&quot;. Lawyers, on behalf of Banks, issued Verhofstadt with a legal letter and said the allegations &quot;are false&quot;.

In February 2019, Verhofstadt said that Brexit leaders such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would suffer a similar fate to the leaders of the French Revolution and &quot;end up on the guillotine&quot;.

In May 2019, Verhofstadt made public a private joke between him and the UK&#x27;s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, in which Robbins &quot;joked that he would want EU citizenship after Brexit&quot;.

On 10 May 2019, Verhofstadt joined anti-Brexit supporters in London. He said &quot;We have to stop nationalism and populism the fastest as possible because otherwise, it could be the end of a fantastic project&quot;.

On 25 July 2019, Guy Verhofstadt branded UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s vow to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October as &quot;irresponsible&quot;, due to the possibility of a No-deal Brexit.

In September 2019, Guy Verhofstadt attacked the words used by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, during the Brexit process, calling it &quot;the language of Europe&#x27;s dark past&quot;.

In 2023, Verhofstadt re-iterated his criticisms of Brexit, stating that it paved the path for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Verhofstadt, Putin would have been more wary of invading if there was a more united Europe, especially on defence matters.

<text>Dorothea Jordan (née Bland; 22 November 17615 July 1816) was an Anglo-Irish actress, as well as a courtesan. She was the long-time partner of Prince William, Duke of Clarence (later King William IV), and the mother of 10 illegitimate children by him, all of whom took the surname FitzClarence. She was known professionally as Dorothea Francis and Dorothea Jordan, was informally Dora Jordan, and she was commonly referred to as Mrs Jordan and Mrs FitzClarence.

==Early life==
Dorothea Bland was born near Waterford City in Ireland on 22 November 1761, and was baptised at St Martin in the Fields, Middlesex on 5 December of that year. She was the third of six children born to Francis Bland (1736 – 2 January 1778, in Dover) and his mistress, Grace Phillips (c. 1740 – 1789 in Edinburgh). Her siblings were:
* George Bland (c.1758 – 1807 in Boston, Massachusetts; actor and singer)
* Hester Bland (baptised 2 March 1760 at St Anne Soho, Middlesex – buried at St David&#x27;s, as of Trelethin, 8 March 1848)
* Lucy Bland (1763/64 – 1778 in Trelethin, St David&#x27;s, 1778)
* Francis Bland (; a captain, unmarried and without issue)
* Nathaniel Phillips Bland (1766/67 – buried at St David&#x27;s, Pembrokeshire, 3 June 1830).

Her paternal grandparents were Nathaniel Bland (1695/96, in Killarney, County Kerry – 1760), Vicar General of Ardfert and Aghadoe, and Judge of the Prerogative Court of Dublin, Ireland, and his second wife Lucy (née Heaton). The reports about Jordan&#x27;s maternal ancestry are unproven; Grace Phillips has been described as the daughter of a Welsh clergyman, whose parish was at Trelethyn.

Before April 1774, when she was age 13, Jordan&#x27;s father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family to marry an Irish actress. However, he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money. This allowance was on the condition that the children would not use his last name. Jordan then adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name, Phillips.

==Theatrical career==

The historical record of Jordan&#x27;s first stage appearance is not clear. Some sources claim that she made her debut in 1777 in Dublin as Phoebe in &quot;As You Like It,&quot; whilst others suggest she premiered as Lucy in the Interlude &quot;The Virgin Unmask&#x27;d,&quot; on 3 November 1779. The knowledge of Jordan&#x27;s time and other roles performed in Ireland is fragmentary; however, she is known to have played Priscilla Tomboy in Bickerstaff&#x27;s &quot;The Romp&quot;, Anne in &quot;Richard III&quot;, and Adelaide in the tragedy &quot;The Count of Narbonne.&quot; At the Smock Alley Theatre, under the management of Richard Daly, Jordan began playing male roles in the company&#x27;s &quot;reversed&quot; cast. Documentation shows her last appearance in Dublin came on 16 May 1782 when she spoke &quot;The Maid of Oaks&quot;&#x27; Prologue&quot;.&quot; At the time she was pregnant with the illegitimate child of Daly, who was married.

Rumours spread and she fled to England, specifically Leeds, where she was employed by Tate Wilkinson, manager of the York Company. It was during this move that she adopted the surname &quot;Jordan,&quot; and like all the other women in the company (both unmarried and married), adopted the title &quot;Mrs.&quot; Her first performance in England was the tragic role of Calista in &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot; on 11 July 1782, for which she had been tutored by the scholar Cornelious Swan. Wilkinson paid her 15 shillings a week, and she quickly won over the favour of her audiences, packing theatres. Despite her versatile acting talents, the critics were not pleased with her performing tragedy roles. Dora faced harsh criticism for these roles as she was not considered socially acceptable to play women of a higher standing. Swan wrote to Tate to express his amazement at Jordan&#x27;s talents:

Jordan performed in the Yorkshire Circuit with Wilkinson&#x27;s company from 1782 to 1785. She was able to learn her lines quickly and seemed to have a natural talent, which made the other actresses in the company jealous. In her first few months, she was given the role of Fanny in &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;, which only made her more unpopular with the women in the company.

During this first tour, while in Hull, Jordan gave birth to her first daughter Frances. After the delivery, while she cared for the baby, the actresses of the company &quot;blackened her character among the people of Hull.&quot; When she returned to the stage on Boxing Day playing Calista in &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot;, she was met with strong disapproval. Audiences felt that the similarities between Jordan and Calista were too strong. However, Wilkinson came to Jordan&#x27;s aid to dispel the gossip, painting Jordan as a mild-mannered victim. Through Wilkinson&#x27;s support and Jordan&#x27;s hard work and good nature, she was eventually able to win over the people before the company returned to York.

Some time later, while in York, Sarah Siddons came to visit Wilkinson and saw Dora Jordan perform in one of her popular breeches roles. Siddons, however, was not impressed with Jordan&#x27;s performance and said that she should remain on the Yorkshire Circuit for she was &quot;not up to London.&quot; This remark was soon discounted when William Smith came from London and offered Jordan a salary of £4 per week at Drury Lane. She took the offer and performed for Wilkinson&#x27;s company for a final time on 9 September 1785 before departing to London with her mother, two-year-old daughter, and sister Hester.

Although no specific dates can be sourced, Dora is believed to have performed the role of Lady Teazle in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; before she arrived in London. In 1785, she made her first London appearance at Drury Lane as Peggy in &quot;The Country Girl&quot;. The &quot;Morning Post&quot; the next day reported on her performance:
Gradually, it came to be recognised that her talent lay in comedy. She was acclaimed for her &quot;naturalness&quot; on stage, and called a &quot;child of nature&quot;, a slightly derogatory term for someone who is of illegitimate birth. Audiences also enjoyed her performances in such breeches roles as Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Sir Harry Wildair in &quot;The Constant Couple&quot;, and William in &quot;Rosina&quot;. 

In addition to her being &quot;the most admired comic actress of her time&quot;, Jordan was a competent Shakespearean and tragic actress, playing the roles of Ophelia, Imogen in Cymbeline, Emilia in Othello, and Zara in Aaron Hill&#x27;s play of that name. When she first auditioned for Wilkinson, on being asked whether she preferred &quot;tragedy, comedy, or opera?&quot; she answered &quot;All.&quot;

Play them &quot;all&quot; she did, but Jordan found less success in playing women of higher social standing with some individuals believing that she lacked the &quot;artifice and incisiveness&quot; of other actresses who commonly played such roles.

In addition to playing at Drury Lane and Covent Garden, Jordan continued to return to the provincial circuits. She returned to Wilkinson&#x27;s Circuit in York several times, as well as Edinburgh, Margate, Liverpool, Bath, Bristol, and Manchester.

Her engagement at Drury Lane lasted until 1809, and she played a large variety of parts. During the rebuilding of Drury Lane she played at the Haymarket; she transferred her services in 1811 to Covent Garden. Here, in 1814, she made her last appearance on the London stage, and the following year, at Margate, retired altogether.

During her time on the stage, she wrote the popular song &quot;The Bluebells of Scotland&quot;, published under her name around 1800.

In 1815, the renowned theatre critic, William Hazlitt, wrote:
== Relationships and children ==

=== Charles Doyne ===
While working as a milliner&#x27;s assistant, she received her first proposal of marriage, from a man known to posterity only as Smith, whose father considered her much too young to marry. The next proposal came when she was acting in Waterford, where she spent a summer while the Dublin theatres were closed. There she met Charles Doyne, an army lieutenant. He &quot;felt hopeful&quot; of being accepted, but her mother regarded him as unsuitable, and Jordan returned to Dublin intent on success in the theatre. 

=== Richard Daly ===
She had an affair with Richard Daly, who was manager of Dublin&#x27;s Crow Street Theatre and then of Smock Alley. Daly was married, and she had an illegitimate child with him:
* Frances Daly (also called Fanny; born in September 1782; she later changed her name to Frances Bettesworth in 1806 and married Thomas Alsop in 1807; she died 2 June 1821).

Jordan&#x27;s work with Richard Daly helped establish her as an actress in Dublin until the two separated and she left for England.

She then went to work for the theatre company operated by Tate Wilkinson. It was at this point she adopted the name Mrs. Jordan – a reference to her escape across the Irish Sea, likened to the River Jordan. The name &quot;Mrs Jordan&quot; was also reportedly given to her by Richard Daly for &quot;motherly reasons&quot;, soon after she gave birth to their first illegitimate child. She appeared at Wilkinson&#x27;s York Circuit theatres, including The Theatre, Leeds, where she complained of uncomfortable working conditions.

=== George Inchbald ===
Shortly after her affair with Daly was over, she began an affair with George Inchbald, the male lead in the Wilkinson company. According to biographer Claire Tomalin, Jordan had hopes of their marrying, but he was wary of committing himself; later he regretted this and proposed to her, but she turned him down.

=== Richard Ford ===
In late 1786, Jordan began an affair with Sir Richard Ford, then a police magistrate and lawyer. She moved in with him, believing he intended marriage. They had three illegitimate children:
* Dorothea Maria Ford (born August 1787, married in 1809 to Frederick Edward March, a natural son of Lord Henry FitzGerald).
* A son (who died at birth in October or November 1788).
* Lucy Hester Ford (born 1789, died 1850, married Samuel Hawker—later General and Sir—in 1810).

She left Ford when marriage was no longer possible. Jordan&#x27;s children were placed under the care of her sister Hester, who moved with them to a house in Brompton. According to a settlement dated 4 November 1791, Jordan transferred all her savings to Ford and Hester for the maintenance and education of the children; in addition, she allowed them an annual payment and granted Hester an allowance for her services.

=== William IV ===

In 1790, Jordan became the mistress of Prince William, Duke of Clarence, the third son of King George III. He had met her at Drury Lane. She began living with him first at Clarence Lodge and later, in 1797, at Bushy House. Together they had 10 illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname FitzClarence:
* George FitzClarence (29 January 179420 March 1842), created Earl of Munster in 1831. Married Mary Wyndham.
* Henry Edward FitzClarence (27 March 1795September 1817). Unmarried.
* Sophia FitzClarence (25 August 179610 April 1837), married Philip Sidney, 1st Baron De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley.
* Mary FitzClarence (19 December 179813 July 1864), married General Charles Richard Fox. No issue.
* Lieutenant General Lord Frederick FitzClarence GCH (9 December 179930 October 1854), officer in the British Army. Married Lady Augusta Boyle.
* Elizabeth FitzClarence (17 January 180116 January 1856), married William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll.
* Rear-Admiral Lord Adolphus FitzClarence, Royal Guelphic Order, Aide-de-camp, Royal Navy (18 February 180217 May 1856). Unmarried.
* Augusta FitzClarence (17 November 18038 December 1865) married, firstly, Hon. John Kennedy-Erskine, 5 July 1827, married secondly, Admiral Lord Frederick Gordon-Hallyburton.
* Lord Augustus FitzClarence (1 March 180514 June 1854), rector at Mapledurham in Oxfordshire. Married Sarah Elizabeth Catharine Gordon.
* Amelia FitzClarence (21 March 18072 July 1858), married Lucius Bentinck Cary, 10th Viscount Falkland.

During this time, Jordan was granted a yearly stipend of £1,200 (), but she continued to perform at both Drury Lane and Covent Garden as well as on provincial tours until her 1811 separation from Prince William. In 1811, Jordan was given an annual stipend of £4,400 () by Prince William and custody of their daughters while he retained custody of their sons. Half of her stipend was specifically earmarked for the care of the children with a stipulation stating that in order to continue receiving that money, and retain custody, Jordan must not return to the stage.

== Later life and death ==
In 1814, when her son-in-law, Thomas Alsop, became heavily in debt, Jordan returned to the stage to help pay off that debt. Prince William took legal action and removed their remaining daughters from her care and ended Jordan&#x27;s yearly stipend. Jordan had written letters to British theatres and newspapers pleading with them to rehire her, acknowledging her previous affairs and business dealings with some of her past companions.

Jordan sold her home in 1815 and moved to Boulogne, France, assuming the alias Mrs. James or Madame James or Mrs. Johnson. Not having been summoned back to England, she moved to Versailles by the end of the year. Soon after, she moved to Saint-Cloud, near Paris. While in France, she was defrauded by her eldest daughter, Frances, and son-in-law, Thomas Alsop, after they accumulated large sums of debt in her name. During this time, both her mental and physical health declined, and she suffered from &quot;bilious attacks, pains in her side, swollen ankles, shortness of breath and increasing general weakness&quot;. She wrote in a letter &quot;it is not, believe me, the feelings of pride, avarice, or the absence of those comforts I have all my life been accustomed to, that is killing me by inches; it is the loss of my only remaining comfort, the hope I used to live on from time to time, of seeing my children&quot;.

She died alone on 5 July 1816 from a ruptured blood vessel caused by violent inflammation of the chest. She was buried in the town cemetery of Saint-Cloud.

<doc id="145935" wikidata="Q3441301" url="?curid=145935" title="Tay Road Bridge">
<text>The Tay Road Bridge carries the A92 road across the Firth of Tay from Newport-on-Tay in Fife to Dundee in Scotland, just downstream of the Tay Rail Bridge. At around , it is one of the longest road bridges in Europe, and was opened in 1966, replacing the old Tay ferry.

==Construction==

As part of the modernisation projects of the 1950s, a road bridge across the Tay had been considered for several years. In August 1958 a traffic census was undertaken and test bores were taken in order to establish the most suitable location for a bridge crossing. Despite government opposition to the project, local lobbying, led by Dundee businessman Sir Douglas Hardie, brought a final agreement to the cost of the project.

The bridge was designed by consulting engineers WA Fairhurst &amp; Partners of Glasgow and Dundee, under the direct supervision of the firm&#x27;s founding partner, civil engineer William Fairhurst. Construction began in March 1963 with the infilling of West Graving Dock, King William Dock and Earl Grey docks in Dundee. The civil engineering construction was undertaken by Duncan Logan Construction Ltd. and steelwork by Dorman Long (Bridge and Engineering) Ltd. Controversially, construction required the demolition of Dundee&#x27;s Royal Arch where Queen Victoria had entered the city on a royal visit. Rubble from the Victoria arch was used as foundations for the on-ramp.

The bridge consists of 42 spans with a navigation channel located closer to the Fife side. During the construction of the bridge, 140,000 tons of concrete, 4,600 tons of mild steel and 8,150 tons of structural steel was used. The bridge has a gradient of 1:81 running from above sea-level in Dundee to above sea-level in Fife.

The bridge took 3½ years to build at a cost of approximately £6 million. Following the installation of the final 65 ton girder on 4 July 1966, the completed bridge was officially opened by the Queen Mother on 18 August 1966. A newsreel of this is available in the British Pathe web archive. For four days, many took advantage of the toll-free period to cross the bridge.

A single path for pedestrians and cyclists is located between the two road carriageways. This is accessed by stairs or a lift on the Dundee side and by ramps on the Fife side. Viewing platforms were once a feature of the Bridge, however they were removed in the 1990s.

Traffic lights at each end of the bridge - and barriers on the south end - can be used to close the road to traffic if the conditions are unsafe. The bridge is closed to double-decker buses if the wind speed exceeds 45mph, to lorries, cyclists and pedestrians if the wind speed exceeds 60mph, and to all traffic at 80mph.

In 2002, a Tay FM competition to find a slogan for the bridge was abandoned after the slogan with the most votes – &quot;It&#x27;s all downhill to Dundee&quot; – (reflecting the bridge&#x27;s downward angle) was deemed unsuitable.

In September 2017, after a successful campaign by Wave 102 to give the bridge a nickname, the bridge was officially nicknamed &quot;Steve&quot; by Chris Duke and Councillor Stewart Hunter. The nickname &quot;Steve&quot; won an online poll to nickname the Bridge.

==Former Tay ferry service==

The Tay Road Bridge was built to replace the former Tay ferry service, popularly known in Dundee as &quot;the Fifie&quot;. A passenger and vehicle ferry service across the River Tay operated from Craigie Pier, Dundee, to Newport-on-Tay. Until the opening of the road bridge, three vessels operated the service, namely the &quot;B. L. Nairn&quot; (a paddle steamer built in 1929); the &quot;Abercraig&quot; and the &quot;Scotscraig&quot; (diesel powered, fitted with Voith Schneider propellers and built in the Caledon Shipyard in Dundee). The paddle steamer was only used when the other ferries needed maintenance. The paddle steamer was scrapped while the &quot;Scotscraig&quot; and &quot;Abercraig&quot; ended their days in Malta.

The construction of the southern approach road resulted in the railway line from Tayport to Dundee terminating in Newport. The opening of the road bridge in 1966 eventually led to the closure of the line in 1969.

==Commemorative obelisk==
A obelisk stands at the Newport side, and a smaller one at the Dundee side, to commemorate Willie Logan, managing director of the company that constructed the bridge who was killed in a plane crash near Inverness, and five workers who died during construction. Both of these obelisks are designed as the piers of the bridge, each representing the height of the piers at that end of the bridge.

==50th Anniversary commemoration==
The bridge was opened formally on 18 August 1966, by the Queen Mother, and the bridge authorities organised a day of free events on Sunday 21 August 2016 to celebrate the occasion.

==Tolls==

The bridge was originally a bidirectional toll road with the original 1966 toll for motorcycles, cars and goods vehicles of 1/-, 2/6 and 10/-, respectively. Heavy fines were imposed on drivers who broke down on the bridge if they had run out of petrol. On 1 June 1991, one-way tolls were introduced, for southbound traffic only.

The legislation enabling the levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the responsibility of the Scottish Government) repeatedly, most recently on 1 March 2006, where the toll remained unchanged. Although motorcycles were exempt; the tolls for cars, buses and heavy goods vehicles were 80p, £1.40 and £2.00, respectively. On 31 May 2007, the Scottish Parliament voted to scrap tolls on all bridges in Scotland. This came into effect at midnight on 10 February 2008.

The bridge employs 20 staff comprising the Bridge Manager, Deputy Manager, and 18 others. These employees are mainly housed in a small administration block to the eastern side of the Dundee end of the bridge.

<text>A grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess.

Prior to the early 1800s, the only Grand duchy in Europe was located in what is now Italy: Tuscany (declared in 1569). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt).

In the 21st century, only Luxembourg remains a grand duchy.

==Luxembourg==
The only grand duchy still extant is Luxembourg. It regained its independence from Napoleonic France and became a sovereign grand duchy in 1815 by decision of the Congress of Vienna which dealt with the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars.

In order to act as a sufficient counterbalance to France, the Congress decided to grant the dignity of grand duke of Luxembourg to the monarch of the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands which comprised present-day Netherlands and Belgium. Luxembourg remained in personal union with the crown of the Netherlands until 1890 when William III, King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg, died without leaving a male heir. He was succeeded on the Dutch throne by his daughter Wilhelmina, but she could not become Grand Duchess of Luxembourg under the semi-Salic law established by the Congress of Vienna. In terms of the law, the grand ducal throne had to be passed to a male dynast. If there were no male heirs in a specific branch of the House of Nassau, the throne would go to the next in line from any of the other branches. This resulted in the title of grand duke being bestowed on a distant male cousin of William III, Adolphe, from the elder branch of Nassau-Weilburg (at present &quot;Luxembourg-Nassau&quot;). The current monarch is Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg since 2000.

==History==

The term &quot;grand duchy&quot; is of relatively late invention, used at first in Western Europe in 1569 in the case of Tuscany, to denote either territories of a particularly mighty duke or territories of significant importance in political, economical or military matters without being of sufficient size or importance to be recognized internationally as a kingdom.

The number of duchies had inflated towards the end of the Middle Ages to an extent that included middle-sized towns or relatively small fiefs, as compared to the national, pre-medieval tribal provinces. As a consequence, a new title was needed to make the difference between important and unimportant regional powers: the title grand duke was born.

One of the first examples was the unofficial use of the title for the dukes of Burgundy, who almost succeeded in forming a new kingdom in the historical region of &quot;Lotharingia&quot;. Collectively known as the Burgundian State in modern historiography, they held lands in modern-day eastern France (Burgundy, Franche-Comté, Alsatia, Lorraine, Champagne, Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais) as well as most of modern Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and small parts of western Germany (Burgundian Netherlands).

The first monarchy ever officially titled a &quot;grand duchy&quot; was the Medici sovereignty over Tuscany thanks to a papal bull issued by Pope Pius V, the first rulers receiving the title in 1569. Tuscany remained a grand duchy until 1860, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia which succeeded in establishing a united Kingdom of Italy.

In 1696, the Duchy of Savoy became the Grand Duchy of Savoy when its duke was promoted to grand duke by writ of the emperor. The title was considered a necessary bribe to keep Savoy aligned with the rest of the imperial states during the Nine Years War against France. From 1713, the primary title of the ruler of the Savoyard state became &quot;king&quot; instead (briefly of Sicily, then of Sardinia from 1720 onward).

In the early nineteenth century, Napoléon I occasionally used the title &quot;grand duchy&quot; for several French satellite states given to his relatives or generals. Other allies abandoned the orbit of the Holy Roman Empire to join Napoleon&#x27;s nominally independent Confederation of the Rhine. The elevation of these vassals to the title of grand duke was usually accompanied by an expansion of their realms with additional territory gathered at the expense of subdued powers such as Prussia. Though Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and most of his newly created satellite states abolished, the Congress of Vienna restored some of the previous sovereign duchies and principalities, while recognizing others as grand duchies. As a result, the 19th century saw the creation of a new group of grand duchies in central Europe, such as the grand duchies of Hesse, Baden and Oldenburg.

Historically, in Europe a sovereign grand duke was one of the highest ranks among hereditary rulers after emperor and king, and was equal to that of prince-elector; ranking as royalty, i.e., European rulers and, in Germany, the reigning nobility (). The correct form of address (also for the heir apparent and his wife) is Royal Highness (HRH).

The title of grand duke borne under the Russian Empire by children and grandchildren of its rulers was a non-sovereign honorific, unrelated to any grand duchy, to which was attached the style of Imperial Highness (HIH). Ranking, internationally, no higher than the members of other reigning dynasties whose head held the title of emperor, the usage was an historical anomaly, persisting from the elevation of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy to the tsardom and, later, empire of All Russia, until its collapse in 1917.

==Associated titles==

In several Balto-Slavic languages (such as Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Russian), the term often translated into English as &quot;grand duke&quot; is literally &quot;grand prince&quot;. In some western European languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc.), the term &quot;grand prince&quot; was rare or non-existent, used to refer to some rulers of Transylvania, Russia or Tuscany prior to the 19th century. In German and Scandinavian languages, both titles co-exist: (&quot;grand duke&quot;) and (&quot;grand prince&quot;). is specifically a monarchal title (as used, for example, by the imperial princes () of the Holy Roman Empire and retained by several of the smaller post-1815 German states&#x27; rulers, and still in use today by the Prince of Liechtenstein) and is distinct from , which is used for a member of the dynasty of a monarch; both are translated as &quot;prince&quot; in English.

Emerging from the Middle Ages, the rulers of Ruthenia (modern Ukraine), Lithuania and some Eastern Slavic states, as well as other Eastern European princes and later Russian dynasts, were referred to by the title (, ), whose literal English translation is &quot;grand prince&quot; rather than &quot;grand duke&quot;. Although &quot;grand prince&quot; is found in historical references, since the reign of Catherine the Great, the Russian has usually been translated into English as &quot;grand duke&quot;. Since the 18th century it has also been used to refer to cadets of the imperial House of Romanov who were children or patrilineal grandchildren of a Russian emperor. More remote descendants of emperors were titled &quot;prince&quot; (, ).

The Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire and established in 1809, was referred to in Swedish, Finnish and Russian as a &quot;Grand Principality&quot; (; ; ) ; The Russian Tsar held title as Grand Duke of Finland.

The title of &quot;Grand Prince&quot; (Ukrainian: &quot;Великий Князь&quot;) was used by the supreme Kievan rulers of Kievan Rus&#x27;. After the dissantigration process occurred in the state, different members of the Rurik Dynasty in the northern principalities could compete for the title of Grand Prince of Kiev. Some princes however could add &quot;Grand&quot; to their title without winning the competition, such establishing their principality&#x27;s independence from Kievan metropole. 

The title or &quot;grand duke&quot; () is said to have been used by the rulers of Lithuania, and after rulers from the Jagiellonian dynasty became Kings of Poland, it was found among the titles used by the rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish kings of the Swedish House of Vasa also used this grand-princely title for their non-Polish territories.

On the other hand, the Habsburg (Austrian) is referred to as the Grand Principality of Transylvania in English rather than as a Grand Duchy, since its name/title derives directly from . Until the 18th century it had been simply referred to as in German and the Principality of Transylvania in English, much like the Danubian Principalities.
Junior members of the dynasties of historical grand duchies in Germany sometimes bore the style of Highness, sometimes that of Grand Ducal Highness, and continued to be accorded those styles post-monarchy by courtesy in such reference works as the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; and Burke&#x27;s Peerage.

==List==

Prior to the Napoleonic Wars, only two grand duchies were recognized in Europe. Both were in Italy, the first, Tuscany, was elevated to that status by a papal bull while the second, Savoy, was elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor:

* Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1569–1860, absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy afterwards)
* Grand Duchy of Savoy (1696–1847, fused into the greater Kingdom of Sardinia, which was later absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy)

Other states whose names are translated as &quot;grand duchy&quot; in English were, properly, grand principalities:

* Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Didžioji Kunigaikštystė, Ruthenian: Великое князство Литовське; established /1236, in personal union with the Kingdom of Poland in 1386–1401, 1447–1492, and 1501–1795)
* Grand Duchy of Kiev or Kievan Rus&#x27; (Ruthenian: Вели́ке Кня́зівство Київське; 882–1240)
* Grand Duchy of Rus&#x27; (Ukrainian: Велике Князівство Руське; intended to be a part of Polish-Lithuanian-Ruthenian Commonwealth) 
* Grand Duchy of Finland (, , ; raised from duchy status, from to 1809 as part of the Swedish Empire; conquered by the Russian Empire and held 1809–1917 in personal union with the Russian Empire; later became a fully independent Republic of Finland in 1917)
* Grand Principality of Smolensk (Belarusian: Вялікае Княства Смаленскае; Principality of Kievan Rus&#x27;, raised from duchy status)
* Grand Principality of Transylvania (1765–1867) a realm of the Hungarian Crown and after 1804 an Austrian crown land.
* Grand Duchy of Moscow (Russian: )
* Grand Duchy of Ryazan (Russian: )

The Napoleonic Wars saw several minor ducal titles so elevated, and between then and World War I there were many grand duchies in Europe. Some were created in the Napoleonic era, others were recognized by the Congress of Vienna and were founding members of the German Confederation.

* Grand Duchy of Berg (1806–1813, absorbed into Prussia afterwards)
* Grand Duchy of Würzburg (1806–1814, absorbed into Bavaria afterwards)
* Grand Duchy of Baden (1806–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Hesse (1806–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Fulda (1816–1866) part of the Electorate of Hesse, annexed by Prussia 1866)
* Grand Duchy of Frankfurt (1810–1813, part of several German states afterwards)
* Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (1815–1822 as part of Prussia)
* Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (from 1815 in personal union with the Netherlands until 1890. Extant independently)
* Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Posen (1815–1848 as a &quot;de facto&quot; part of Prussia (nominally ruled in a personal union), )
* Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1815–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Oldenburg (1829–1918, joined the German Empire in 1871)
* Grand Duchy of Cracow (1846–1918 nominally a separate Austrian crown land, administered as part of Galicia and Lodomeria, )

The term &quot;grand duchy&quot; is often, but incorrectly, used in reference to Warsaw between 1807 and 1813, which was in fact the Duchy of Warsaw.

==Metonymy==

In Belgium and to some extent in France, &quot;Grand-Duché&quot; (French for &quot;grand duchy&quot;) is often used as a metonym to refer to the neighbouring country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. This practice helps to avoid confusion with the adjacent Belgian Province of Luxembourg, i.e. the Walloon-speaking part of the portion of Luxembourg which was annexed by Belgium in 1839. It&#x27;s comparable to how &quot;the Republic&quot; is used in the UK and Ireland as a shorthand to refer to the Republic of Ireland instead of the island of Ireland or Northern Ireland.

<doc id="145938" wikidata="Q201727" url="?curid=145938" title="Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors">
<text>According to Chinese mythology and traditional Chinese historiography, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors () were a series of sage Chinese emperors, and the first Emperors of China. Today, they are considered culture heroes, but they were widely worshipped as divine &quot;ancestral spirits&quot; in ancient times. According to received history, the period they existed in preceded the Xia dynasty, although they were thought to exist in later periods to an extent in incorporeal forms that aided the Chinese people, especially with the stories of Nüwa existing as a spirit in the Shang dynasty and Shennong being identified as the godly form of Hou Ji and a founder of the Zhou dynasty.

In myth, the Three Sovereigns were demigods who used their abilities to help create mankind and impart to them essential skills and knowledge. The Five Emperors were exemplary sages who possessed great moral character, and were from a golden age when &quot;communications between the human order and the divine were central to all life&quot; and where the sages embodied the divine, or aided humans in communicating divine forces.

In this period the abdication system was used before Qi of Xia violently seized power and established a hereditary monarchy.

== History ==
Taoist beliefs consisted of parables involving shamanistic themes, as were most ancient stories about the Sovereigns Fuxi, Nüwa, and Shennong.

== Variations ==

There are six to seven known variations on which people constitute the Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors, depending on the source. Many of the known sources were written in much later dynasties.

Groupings of the Three Sovereigns consist of some combination of the following: Fuxi, Nüwa, Shennong, Suiren, Zhu Rong, Gonggong, the Heavenly Sovereign, the Earthly Sovereign, the Human Sovereign (in two varieties), and the Yellow Emperor.

Groupings of the Five Emperors consist of some combination of the following: the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, Shaohao, Taihao, and the Yan Emperor.

===Three Sovereigns===
The Three Sovereigns, sometimes known as the Three August Ones, were said to be god-kings or demigods who used their magical powers, divine powers, or being in harmony with the Tao to improve the lives of their people. Because of their lofty virtue, they lived to a great age and ruled over a period of great peace.

The Sovereigns have elements in common with &quot;xian&quot; from the Taoist pantheon, such as the Human Sovereign&#x27;s cloud-chariot and their supernatural abilities. Upon his death, the Yellow Emperor was &quot;said to have become&quot; a &quot;xian&quot;.

The Yellow Emperor is supposedly the ancestor of the &quot;Huaxia&quot; people. The Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor was established in Shaanxi to commemorate the ancestry legend.

The Three Sovereigns are ascribed various identities in different historical texts, as shown in the table below:

===Five Emperors===
The Five Emperors were traditionally thought to have invented &quot;fire, writing and irrigation&quot;. Like the Three Sovereigns, they are ascribed different identities depending on historical source, as shown in the table below:
=== Five Emperors family tree ===








== Creation myth ==
There is the legend of the Four Clans (四氏) who took part in creating the world, Youchao-shi (有巢氏), Suiren-shi (燧人氏), Fu Xi-shi (伏羲氏), and Shennong-shi (神農氏).

== Legacy ==
These Sovereigns and Emperors are said to have helped introduce the use of fire, taught people how to build houses, and invented farming. The Yellow Emperor&#x27;s wife is credited with the invention of silk culture. The discovery of medicine and invention of the calendar and Chinese script are also credited to the kings. After their era, Yu the Great founded the Xia dynasty, traditionally considered the first dynasty in Chinese historiography.

<text>Libbie Henrietta Hyman (December 6, 1888 – August 3, 1969), was an American zoologist. She wrote numerous works on invertebrate zoology and the widely used &quot;A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy&quot; (1922, revised in 1942).

==Life==
Born in Des Moines, Iowa, she was a child of Jewish parents, Joseph and Sabina ( Neumann) Hyman. Her father, an emigrant from Poland, adopted the surname &quot;Hyman&quot; when he immigrated to the United States as a youth. Her mother was from Germany. Joseph Hyman successively owned clothing stores in Des Moines, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and in Fort Dodge, Iowa, but the family&#x27;s resources were limited. Hyman attended public schools in Fort Dodge. At home, she was required to do much of the housework. She enjoyed reading, especially books by Charles Dickens in her father&#x27;s small den, and she took a strong interest in flowers, which she learned to classify with a copy of Asa Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Botany&quot;. She also collected butterflies and moths and later wrote, &quot;I believe my interest in nature is primarily aesthetic.&quot;

Hyman graduated from high school in Fort Dodge in 1905 as the youngest member of her class and the valedictorian. Uncertain of her future, she began work in a local factory, pasting labels on cereal boxes. The high school teacher who taught English and German persuaded her to attend the University of Chicago, which she entered in 1906 on a one-year scholarship. She continued at the university with further scholarships and nominal jobs. Turning away from botany because of an unpleasant laboratory assistant, she tried chemistry but did not like its quantitative procedures. She then took zoology and was encouraged in it by Professor Charles Manning Child. After receiving a B.S. in zoology in 1910, she acted on Child&#x27;s advice to continue with graduate work at the University of Chicago. Supporting herself as laboratory assistant in various zoology courses, she concluded that a better laboratory text was needed, which in time she was to supply. She received a Ph.D. in zoology in 1915, with a thesis on regeneration in certain annelid worms. Again unsure of her future, she accepted a position as research assistant in Child&#x27;s laboratory, and she taught undergraduate courses in comparative anatomy.

After Joseph Hyman&#x27;s death in 1907, his widow moved to Chicago, bringing her daughter &quot;back into the same happy circumstances which lasted until the death of my mother in 1929. I never received any encouragement from my family to continue my academic career; in fact my determination to attend the University met with derision. At home, scolding and fault-finding were my daily portion&quot; (quoted in Hutchinson, p. 106).

==Work==
At the request of the University of Chicago Press, Hyman wrote &quot;A Laboratory Manual for Elementary Zoology&quot; (1919), which promptly became widely used, to her astonishment. She followed this, again at the publisher&#x27;s request, with &quot;A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy&quot; (1922), which also had great success. She was, however, much more interested in invertebrates. By 1925 she was considering how to prepare a laboratory guide in that field but &quot;was persuaded by [unnamed] colleagues to write an advanced text&quot; (quoted in Hutchinson, p. 107).

While at the University of Chicago, Hyman also wrote taxonomic papers on such invertebrates as the Turbellaria (flatworms) and North American species of the freshwater cnidarian &quot;Hydra&quot;. She published an enlarged edition of her first laboratory manual in 1929.

In 1931, Hyman concluded that she could live on the royalties of her published books, and she also recognized that her mentor Child was about to retire. She therefore resigned her position at Chicago. Hyman toured western Europe for fifteen months and then returned to begin writing a treatise on the invertebrates. Settling in New York City in order to use the library of the American Museum of Natural History, she became, in December 1936, an unpaid research associate of the museum, which provided her with an office for the rest of her life. There, Hyman created her six-volume treatise on invertebrates, &quot;The Invertebrates&quot;, drawing on her familiarity with several European languages and Russian, which she had learned from her father. She compiled notes from books and scientific papers, including those in the many journals to which she subscribed, organized the notes on cards, and wrote an account of each invertebrate group. She took art lessons in order to illustrate her work professionally. She spent several summers studying specimens and drawing illustrations at Bermuda Biological Laboratory, Marine Biological Laboratory, Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, and Puget Sound Biological Station.

Volume I (Protozoa through Ctenophora) of &quot;The Invertebrates&quot;, was published in February 1940. Volume 2 (Platyhelminthes and Rhynchocoela) and Volume 3 (Acanthocephala, Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta), both published in 1951, were followed by Volume 4 (Echinodermata) in 1955, Volume 5 (Smaller Coelomate Groups) in 1959, and Volume 6 (Mollusca I) in 1967. In it, she developed her scientific theory that the phylum Chordata, including all vertebrates, was evolutionarily related to the apparently very different and very much more primitive Echinodermata, such as starfish. This group is now known as the deuterostomes. Her theory was based upon the morphological data of classical embryology, and has since been confirmed by molecular sequence analysis.

In addition to her major project, Hyman extensively revised &quot;A Laboratory Manual for Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy&quot; in 1942 into a textbook as well as laboratory manual; she referred to it as her &quot;bread and butter&quot; for its income. She wrote about 136 papers on physiology and systematics of the lower invertebrates and published technical papers on annelid and polyclad worms and on other invertebrates. She commented in a letter: &quot;The polyclads of Bermuda were so pretty that I could not resist collecting them and figuring out Verrill&#x27;s mistakes&quot; (quoted in Schram, p. 126). Addison Emery Verrill had been an earlier expert in invertebrate classification.

Hyman served as editor of the journal &quot;Systematic Zoology&quot; from 1959 to 1963. In 1960, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was honored in 1961 with membership in the National Academy of Sciences, from which she had received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal in 1951. She also received the gold medal of the Linnean Society of London (1960) and a gold medal from the American Museum of Natural History (1969). She died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease in New York City, aged 80.

<text>Newport-on-Tay is a town in the north-east of Fife in Scotland. The Fife Coastal Path passes through Newport-on-Tay. The area itself has views of the two bridges that cross the River Tay and distant views of the Scottish Highlands.

==History==


The town was established near the endpoint of one part of a ferry route that itself was started in the 12th century.

In 1715 a new pier and inn were built, the work being funded by the Guilds of Dundee which resulted in the settlement being called &quot;New Dundee&quot;. Thomas Telford built a new harbour in the 1820s, and the town expanded and grew into a commuter suburb of Dundee as the prosperous jute manufacturers, industrialists and the middle and upper working class of Dundee established fashionable residences in Newport.

The local war memorial dates from 1920 and was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.

Newport-on-Tay formerly had two railway stations – the East and West stations on what was the Newport Railway. Both stations (and the Tayport-Dundee branch line) closed in 1969, having lost much of their business following the opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966. In fact, trains had ceased to run beyond Newport-on-Tay East station to Tayport on 22 May 1966 so that the railway line could be breached to build the bridge&#x27;s southern approach road. The Dundee – Newport ferry also closed promptly later in 1966 on the opening of the Tay Road Bridge. However, the ferry terminal buildings and slipways still survive at the foot of Boat Hill as a boat repair yard.

==Tayfield House==

The substantial estate of Tayfield was created, almost encompassing the whole landward side of the town, by John Berry (1725–1817) in 1788. The estate stayed in the family for two centuries, with some sections, such as Gowrie Woods, being gifted to the council for public use in 1946. The original house was totally remodelled in 1828 by the architect George Smith, in a Jacobean style, and is now a Listed Building.

==Archaeology==

An excavation carried out by Headland Archaeology in the farm of North Straiton near Newport-on-Tay uncovered part of a Bronze Age cremation cemetery and a line of postholes. Five human cremations were found in a group of scattered disposal pits. Around 25 metres away was a line of postholes, one of which was also associated with cremated human bone. Radiocarbon dates from the features indicated that they had been created in the Bronze Age, from around 1700 to 2000 BC.

The line of posts was substantial and may have been associated with the cremations rather than a building or fence. It is possible that the posts may have been memorials or markers close to the pyre used to burn the dead. Part of a quern stone and some burnt animal bone suggested that the cremation ceremony also involved preparing food. A collection of pottery was found with the cremations. This included a complete accessory vessel and fragments from a larger decorated pot that covered it.

==Present==
Newport currently has a population of about four thousand, mostly living in stone houses built before World War II. The town centre comprises two main streets with a small variety of shops and three public houses. The town has one primary school, Newport Primary School. It was built in 1977 by the then Fife Regional Council Architectural Department, with Donald George Beaton working as the school&#x27;s architect. Older pupils attend secondary school at Madras College in St Andrews, or at Bell Baxter High School in Cupar, or at the nearest independent schools, the High School of Dundee and St Leonards School.

Public bus routes are the 77 to Dundee, 92 to St Andrews, and the X54 to Edinburgh via Glenrothes (and Ninewells Hospital in the other direction)

Newport has been twinned with Zolotarovo, Ukraine since 20 July 2002.

===Local amenities===

Amenities on and around the High Street include food and drink stores, health and beauty outlets, trades and services, a variety of shops, an art gallery and a sports centre.

There are three churches:
*Church of Scotland
*Episcopal Church of Scotland (St Mary&#x27;s)
*Roman Catholic (St. Fillans)

A second Church of Scotland church, St. Fillans, originally a Free Church, was demolished in 1981.

==Newport-on-Tay and the arts==
The arts have played a major role in the shaping of Newport and its neighbourhood. In 1905 the Tayport Artists&#x27; Circle was formed, including James Douglas, Anna Douglas, Alec Grieve, Stewart Carmichael, William Bradley Lamond, Charles Adamson and the so-called &quot;Painter&#x27;s painter&quot; David Foggie. Led by Frank Laing, their aim was to have an influence through art on the industrial environment; this is explained in a letter from Laing to the town planner/architect Patrick Geddes.

Many teachers of fine art in the University of Dundee&#x27;s Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design have migrated towards Newport-on-Tay and its north-west facing position for the incredible quality of light. Such heavy-weights in the Scottish art scene as John Byrne, Will Maclean and Marian Leven are associated with the area. A local community arts centre, The Forgan Arts, provides courses in arts and crafts. The Tatha art gallery opened in Newport-on-Tay in 2014.

<doc id="145943" wikidata="Q1765455" url="?curid=145943" title="Firth of Tay">
<text>The Firth of Tay (; ) is a firth on the east coast of Scotland, into which empties the River Tay (Scotland&#x27;s largest river in terms of flow). The firth is surrounded by four council areas: Fife, Perth and Kinross, Dundee City, and Angus. Its maximum width (at Invergowrie) is .

Two bridges span the firth: the Tay Road Bridge and the Tay Rail Bridge. The marshy Mugdrum Island is the only major island in the firth.

The Firth of Tay in Antarctica was discovered in 1892–1893 by Captain Thomas Robertson of the Dundee whaling expedition and named by him after the one in Scotland. He also named nearby Dundee Island in honour of the main city on the firth.

== Natural heritage ==
The Firth of Tay and the Eden Estuary (which lies to the south of the firth) were designated as Special Protection Areas on 2 February 2000, as Ramsar wetlands a few months later (on 28 July 2000), and as Special Areas of Conservation five years later (on 17 March 2005). Several parts of the firth are within a site of special scientific interest – Inner Tay Estuary, Monifieth Bay, Tayport-Tentsmuir Coast. The Invergowrie Bay section of the firth is a local nature reserve.

The Firth of Tay is noted for its extensive sand and mudflats, its population of common seals, and its wintering birds (such as oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwit, shelduck and velvet scoter). There is good access to much of the shoreline, and the firth offers many good wildlife-watching opportunities.

The reed bed on the north shore of the inner estuary in the firth is about 15 km long; it is thought to be the most extensive reedbed in Britain.

<doc id="145949" wikidata="Q5419010" url="?curid=145949" title="Ewenny Priory">
<text>Ewenny Priory (), in Ewenny in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, was a monastery of the Benedictine order, founded in the 12th century. The priory was unusual in having extensive military-style defences and in its state of preservation; the architectural historian John Newman described it as “the most complete and impressive Norman ecclesiastical building in Glamorgan”. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, parts of the priory were converted into a private house by Sir Edward Carne, a lawyer and diplomat. This Elizabethan house was demolished between 1803 and 1805 and replaced by a Georgian mansion, Ewenny Priory House. The house is still owned by the Turbervill family, descendants of Sir Edward. The priory is not open to the public apart from the Church of St Michael, the western part of the priory building, which continues to serve as the parish church (Church in Wales) for the village. The priory is in the care of Cadw and is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The priory was founded by Maurice de Londres in 1141. Maurice granted the Norman church of St. Michael to the abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester, now Gloucester Cathedral, together with the church of St Brides Major and the chapel at Ogmore &quot;in order that a convent of monks might be formed&quot;. The church had been built in the 12th century by his father, William de Londres, one of the Norman knights of Glamorgan.

There had been an older, monastic cell on the site, of the Celtic church. It is described in the 12th century &quot;Book of Llandaff&quot; as dedicated to Eguenni, an early Welsh saint. De Londres plundered the site with the intent of building a castle on it but was stopped by a decree from Pope Honorius II dated 12 April 1128 which threatened De Londres with excommunication.

The priory was dissolved in 1536 by which time its complement of monks totalled only three. It was leased in the same year to Sir Edward Carne. Carne was a lawyer and diplomat, and held a number of positions at the courts of Henry VIII and of his successors. In 1545 he purchased the priory, along with its possessions and began the construction of Ewenny Priory House, incorporating many of the priory structures. The Carnes also established two deer parks on the estate, one for fallow and one for red deer. The estate descended in the Carne family to Edward Carne (died 1650) who was succeeded by his two daughters and co-heirs, Blanche and Martha. Blanche (died 1685) inherited Ewenny, and married her cousin Colonel Sir John Carne (died 1682), of Corntown. Their son Richard Carne (c.1669-1713) was succeeded by his two sisters and co-heirs, Frances (died 1714), the wife of Edward Turbervill of Sutton, and Jane (died 1741). Edward and Frances Turbervill were succeeded by their son Richard Turbervill, who became the sole owner of the Ewenny estate on the death of his aunt in 1741.

By the late 18th century, the Carne house was in a state of dereliction; John Byng the diarist described it as a “miserable mansion” following a visit in 1787. In 1803-1805 the Elizabethan house was demolished and a new Georgian building constructed by Richard Turbervill Picton. He was succeeded by his son Richard Turvervill Turbervill (died 1848), who was succeeded in turn by his brother Colonel Gervase Powell Turberville, who died childless c.1862. The estate then passed to his great-nephew Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton-Warlow (died 1892), who changed his name to Thomas Picton-Turbervill in 1867 and from him passed down in the Picton-Turbervill family for several generations.

J. M. W. Turner painted the priory during his third tour of Wales in 1795.

The priory church and much of the complex is now in the care of Cadw. Ewenny Priory House and its gardens remain a private residence of the Picton-Turbervill family who also operate the house as a wedding venue. St Michael&#x27;s Church continues to serve as the parish church for the village. The church underwent reconstruction in the early 21st century, including the installation of a glass screen designed by Alexander Beleschenko which divided it from the unused eastern part of the building.

==Architecture and description==
The priory site is broadly rectangular and stands on the southern bank of the Ewenny River. The priory church stands to the east, with walls to the east, north and west. The site was originally fully enclosed but the southern range was destroyed during the construction of Ewenny Priory House in the very early 19th century. The walls are pierced by two gatehouses to the north and south and three towers to the north, west and east. The priory site is generally in a good state of preservation; aside from the building of the house from 1803 to 1805, and a “conservative restoration” undertaken by Thomas Picton Turbervill between 1869 and 1886, it has seen little development. John Newman, in his 1995 edition, &quot;Glamorgan&quot; of the Pevsner Buildings of Wales series, describes the priory church as the “most complete and impressive Norman ecclesiastical building in Glamorgan.”

The scale of the defensive works built around a minor priory has puzzled historians. Michael Salter, in his study &quot;Castles of Gwent, Glamorgan and Gower&quot;, suggests that the extensive defences were primarily for show, citing the absence of any defensive ditch, the weakness of the positioning and the large extent of the complex which would have required a very considerable force to defend. Elisabeth Whittle supports this analysis, describing the complex&#x27;s defences as &quot;a façade, a show of strength built only to impress&quot;, but notes that the scale and solidity of the construction are indeed impressive. Newman also considers the walls were built for display, rather than to “afford serious protection”, but is uncertain as to why “such a small and relatively poor community felt it should put on such an expensive show”.

The priory church is a notable, and rare, example of Romanesque architecture with rounded arches, barrel vaulting and geometric decoration. The cruciform plan of the church is also typical of the period and style. Simon Jenkins critiques the Beleschenko screen, installed in 2004, as breaking the “spatial integrity of the interior”.

===Listing designations===
The priory complex has a large number of listed buildings. Those at Grade I include: the eastern and western parts of the priory church; the original West doorcase, now sited in the East wall of the priory enclosure; the North Tower, and the North and South Gatehouses; and the wall standing on the western side of the site. Buildings designated Grade II* include: Ewenny Priory House; a barn; a medieval fish pond; the wall that encloses the eastern side of the precinct; and the former South East Tower. Those structures listed at Grade II include: the North, West, and East ranges of the stable courtyard; the precinct wall to the north-east; a wall running between the northern and southern gatehouses; and a gateway and wall which forms part of the 19th-century remodelling of the grounds.

The priory is also a scheduled monument, as is the Romanesque Gateway, the dovecote, the North and South Gatehouses, the barn, the stables, the precinct walls, and Ewenny Priory House. The grounds are designated Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

<text>Newstead Abbey, in Nottinghamshire, England, was formerly an Augustinian priory. Converted to a domestic home following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it is now best known as the ancestral home of Lord Byron. The Abbey is on the national buildings at risk register.

==Monastic foundation==
The priory of St. Mary of Newstead, a house of Augustinian Canons, was founded by King Henry II of England about the year 1170, as one of many penances he paid following the murder of Thomas Becket. Contrary to its current name, Newstead was never an abbey: it was a priory.

In the late 13th century, the priory was rebuilt and extended. It was extended again in the 15th century, when the Dorter, Great Hall and Prior&#x27;s Lodgings were added. The priory was designed to be home to at least 13 monks, although there appear to have been only 12 (including the Prior) at the time of the dissolution.

The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1534 gave the clear annual value of this priory as £167 16s. 11½d. The considerable deductions included 20s. given to the poor on Maundy Thursday in commemoration of Henry II, the founder, and a portion of food and drink similar to that of a canon given to some poor person every day, valued at 60s. a year.

Despite the annual value of Newstead being clearly below the £200 assigned as the limit for the suppression of the lesser monasteries, this priory obtained the doubtful privilege of exemption, on payment to the Crown of the heavy fine of £233 6s. 8d in 1537.

The surrender of the house was accomplished on 21 July 1539. The signatures attached were those of John Blake, prior, Richard Kychun, sub-prior, John Bredon, cellarer, and nine other canons, Robert Sisson, John Derfelde, William Dotton, William Bathley, Christopher Motheram, Geoffrey Acryth, Richard Hardwyke, Henry Tingker, and Leonard Alynson.

The prior obtained a pension of £26 13s. 4d., the sub-prior £6, and the rest of the ten canons who signed the surrender sums varying from £5 6s. 8d. to £3 6s. 8d.

The lake was dredged in the late eighteenth century and the lectern, thrown into the Abbey fishpond by the monks to save it during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was discovered. In 1805 it was given by Archdeacon Kaye to Southwell Minster where it still resides.

== Country house ==

Sir John Byron of Colwick in Nottinghamshire was granted Newstead Abbey by Henry VIII of England on 26 May 1540 and started its conversion into a country house. He was succeeded by his son Sir John Byron of Clayton Hall. Many additions were made to the original building. The 13th century ecclesiastical buildings were largely ruined during the dissolution of the monasteries. It then passed to John Byron, an MP and Royalist commander, who was created a baron in 1643. He died childless in France and ownership transferred to his brother Richard Byron. Richard&#x27;s son William was a minor poet and was succeeded in 1695 by his son William Byron, 4th Baron Byron. Early in the 18th century, the 4th Lord Byron landscaped the gardens extensively, and amassed a hugely admired collection of artistic masterpieces.

During the ownership of William, 5th Baron Byron, the Abbey suffered a downturn in fortunes. As a young man, William lavished money on the estate, building picturesque Gothic follies and staging glamorous mock navy battles on the lake. Continuing to take out loans and pursue his pleasures of horse-racing, gambling, and going to the theatre, he found himself financially reliant on a scheme of marrying off his only surviving son and heir to a wealthy heiress. The plan fell apart when his heir eloped with his cousin Juliana Byron, daughter of William&#x27;s brother John Byron.

Though late 18th-century gossip attested that he ruined the estate, felled trees, and killed deer while hellbent on revenge, this is not the case – he simply had no money to pay his debts, and stripped the Abbey and estate of its artistic treasures, furniture, and even its trees, to quickly raise cash. Though he made thousands of pounds it was not enough to pay back the loans he had been taking out since his thirties, and there was no hope of restoring the Abbey to its former glory.

As well as outliving all four of his children William also outlived his only grandson, who was killed by cannon fire in 1794 while fighting in Corsica at the age of 22. The 5th Lord died on 21 May 1798, at the age of 75. Later, 19th-century myths attest that on his death, the great numbers of crickets he kept at Newstead left the estate in swarms. The title and Newstead Abbey were then left to his great-nephew, George Gordon Byron, then aged 10, who became the 6th Baron Byron and later the famous and notorious poet.

==Lord Byron==

The young Lord Byron soon arrived at Newstead and was greatly impressed by the estate. The scale of the estate contributed to Byron&#x27;s extravagant taste and sense of his own importance. However, yearly income had fallen to just £800 and many repairs were needed. He and his mother soon moved to the nearby town of Southwell and neither lived permanently at Newstead for any extended period. His view of the decayed Newstead became one of the romantic ruin, a metaphor for his family&#x27;s fall:

 Thro&#x27; thy battlements, Newstead, the hollow winds whistle;&lt;br&gt;
Thou, the hall of my fathers, art gone to decay.

The estate was leased to the 23-year-old Henry Edward Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn, from January 1803. The lease was for £50 a year for the Abbey and Park for five years, until Byron came of age. Byron stayed for some time in 1803 with Lord Grey, before they fell out badly.

In 1808, Lord Grey left at the end of his lease and Byron returned to live at Newstead and began extensive and expensive renovations. His works were mainly decorative, however, rather than structural, so that rain and damp obscured his changes within just a few years.

Byron had a beloved Newfoundland dog named Boatswain, who died of rabies in 1808. Boatswain was buried at Newstead Abbey and has a monument larger than his master&#x27;s. The inscription, from Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Epitaph to a Dog&quot;, has become one of his best-known works:







Byron had wanted to be buried with Boatswain, although he would ultimately be buried in the family vault at the nearby Church of St Mary Magdalene, Hucknall.

He was determined to stay at Newstead—&quot;Newstead and I stand or fall together&quot;—and he hoped to raise a mortgage on the property, but his advisor John Hanson urged a sale. This would be a preoccupation for many years and was certainly not resolved when Byron left for his Mediterranean travels in 1809. Upon his return to England in 1811, Byron stayed in London, not returning to see his mother who had been living in Newstead. She died, leaving him distraught at his own negligence of her. He lived again at the Abbey for a time but was soon drawn to life in London.

For the next few years, Byron made several attempts to sell the Abbey. It was put up at auction in 1812 but failed to reach a satisfactory price. A buyer was found, however, who offered £140,000, which was accepted. By spring 1813, though, the buyer, Thomas Claughton, had only paid £5,000 of the agreed down-payment. Byron was in debt and had continued to spend money on the expectation that the house would be sold. Negotiations began to degenerate and Byron accused Claughton of robbing the wine cellar. By August 1814, it was clear that the sale had fallen through, and Claughton forfeited what he had paid of the deposit. Byron was now without settled financial means and proposed marriage to the heiress Anne Isabella Milbanke. Claughton did return with new proposals involving a reduced price and further delays. Byron turned him down.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;Lines Suggested on Visiting Newstead Abbey&quot; accompanies an engraving of Newstead Abbey after a painting by Thomas Allom (Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839). This poem is mainly a reflection on Byron and what it means to be a poet. Miss Landon may have visited Newstead Abbey on one of her visits to her uncle in Aberford, Yorkshire.
==Later owners==
===Colonel Thomas Wildman===

In July 1815, Newstead was once again put up for auction but failed to reach its reserve, bought in at 95,000 guineas. It was only during Byron&#x27;s exile in Italy, in 1818, that a buyer was found. Thomas Wildman, who had been at Harrow School with Byron and was heir to Jamaican plantations, paid £94,500, easing Byron&#x27;s financial troubles considerably.

Wildman too spent a great deal of money on the Abbey and its contents, restoring it to some greatness. The architect John Shaw Sr. designed new parts of the abbey for Wildman.

===William Frederick Webb===
 In 1861, William Frederick Webb, African explorer, bought the Abbey from Wildman&#x27;s widow. People including David Livingstone, Abdullah Susi, James Chuma and Jacob Wainwright all visited the Abbey at different times during the period Webb lived there. Under Webb, the chapel was redecorated, but the rest of the house remained largely unaltered. After his death in 1899, the estate passed to each of his surviving children and finally to his grandson Charles Ian Fraser. Fraser sold Newstead to local philanthropist Sir Julien Cahn, who presented it to Nottingham Corporation in 1931.

===Today===
Owned by Nottingham City Council, the Abbey is on the at risk register due to water ingress at the roofs and around the tower. As of January 2025, the council is seeking a £250,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for remedial works expected to last until 2028.

The Abbey houses a museum containing Byron memorabilia, and hosts weddings and other events.

<doc id="145955" wikidata="Q1148460" url="?curid=145955" title="Lacock Abbey">
<text>Lacock Abbey in the village of Lacock, Wiltshire, England, was founded in the early 13th century by Ela, Countess of Salisbury, as a nunnery of the Augustinian order. The abbey remained a nunnery until the Dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century; it was then sold to Sir William Sharington who converted the convent into a residence where he and his family lived. It was fortified and remained loyal to the crown during the English Civil War, but surrendered to the Parliamentary forces once Devizes had fallen in 1645.

The house was built over the old cloisters and its main rooms are on the first floor. It is a stone house with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout the life of the building, many architectural alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that the house is a mish-mash of different periods and styles. The Tudor stable courtyard to the north of the house has retained many of its original features including the brewhouse and bakehouse.

The house later passed into the hands of the Talbot family, and during the 19th century was the residence of William Henry Fox Talbot. In 1835 he made what may be the earliest surviving photographic camera negative, an image of one of the windows.

In 1944 artist Matilda Theresa Talbot gave the house and the surrounding village of Lacock to the National Trust. The abbey houses the Fox Talbot Museum, devoted to the pioneering work of William Talbot in the field of photography. The Trust markets the abbey and village together as &quot;Lacock Abbey, Fox Talbot Museum &amp; Village&quot;. The abbey is a Grade I listed building, having been so designated on 20 December 1960.

== History ==

Lacock Abbey, dedicated to St Mary and St Bernard, was founded in 1229 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury, widow of William Longespee, an illegitimate son of Henry II. Ela laid the abbey&#x27;s first stone in Snail&#x27;s Meadow, near the village of Lacock on 16 April 1232. The first of the Augustinian nuns were veiled in 1232, and Ela joined the community in 1228.

Lacock Abbey prospered throughout the Middle Ages. The rich farmlands which it had received from Ela ensured it a sizeable income from wool.

Following the dissolution of the monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII sold the abbey to Sir William Sharington for £783. He demolished the abbey church, using the stone to extend the building, and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So as not to be disturbed by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across the leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.

In the 16th and early 17th centuries, Nicholas Cooper has pointed out, bedchambers were often named for individuals who customarily inhabited them when staying at a house. At Lacock, as elsewhere, they were named for individuals &quot;whose recognition in this way advertised the family&#x27;s affinities&quot;: the best chamber was &quot;the duke&#x27;s chamber&quot;, probably signifying John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, whom Sharington had served, while &quot;Lady Thynne&#x27;s chamber&quot;, identified it with the wife of Sir John Thynne of Longleat, and &quot;Mr Mildmay&#x27;s chamber&quot; was reserved for Sharington&#x27;s son-in-law Anthony Mildmay of Apethorpe in Northamptonshire.

Anne of Denmark came to Lacock in May 1613 during her progress to Bath. She was in pain from gout, and her physician Théodore de Mayerne examined her and made prescriptions. During the English Civil War the house was garrisoned by Royalists. It was fortified by surrounding it with earthworks. The garrison surrendered (on agreed terms) to Parliamentarian forces under the command of Colonel Devereux, Governor of Malmesbury, within days of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s capture of the nearby town of Devizes in late September 1645.

The house eventually passed to the Talbot family. It is most often associated with amateur scientist and inventor William Henry Fox Talbot, who in 1835 made what may be the earliest surviving photographic camera negative: an interior view of the oriel window in the south gallery of the abbey. Talbot&#x27;s experiments eventually led to his invention of the more sensitive and practical calotype or &quot;Talbotype&quot; paper negative process for camera use, commercially introduced in 1841.

==Architecture==

When Sir William Sharington purchased the remains of the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and rubble stone, the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house is a blend of different styles but lacks a cohesive plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, but the house cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen from inside the house. The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period by Sanderson Miller.

The basement consists of an arcade of cloisters on three sides, surrounding several vaulted rooms including the sacristy, chapter house, and warming house. These rooms were situated under the original dormitory. At the other end of the building, below what was formerly the abbess&#x27; chambers and the great hall, are two rooms and the main passage. On the north side, underneath the original refectory, is the undercroft.

The west front has two flights of broad, balustraded steps leading up to the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are octagonal turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington&#x27;s tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade, and stair turret.
The east front looks more medieval than the other sides but probably dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To the north of the house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.

==Today==
Lacock Abbey is now the property of the National Trust, to which it was given in 1944 by Matilda Gilchrist-Clark, who had inherited the estate from her uncle Charles Henry Fox Talbot in 1916. The abbey is a Grade I listed building.

The Fox Talbot Museum forms part of the ground floor. It celebrates the life of William Henry Fox Talbot, and his contributions to photography, and includes exhibits on the man himself, his mousetrap camera (so-called by his wife because he scattered the little wooden boxes round the house), the chemical processes involved in obtaining images and the early history of photography. Exhibitions showing the works of various photographers are sometimes held in a gallery on the first floor. The Fenton Collection, an historic photographic collection, was transferred to the museum from the British Film Institute in 2017.

==In film and television==

Some interior sequences in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002) were filmed at Lacock, including the cloister walk where Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised and when he comes out from Professor Lockhart&#x27;s room after serving detention and hears the basilisk. Scenes from &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2009) and &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; (2018) were also shot here.

The abbey was one of two major locations for the 2008 film version of the historical novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; by Philippa Gregory, directed by Justin Chadwick. Parts of the 2010 American horror film &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins and directed by Joe Johnston, were shot at the abbey. The interior of the abbey was used in the 1995 BBC/A&amp;E production of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and the BBC adaptation of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;, and scenes for the BBC&#x27;s historical TV serial &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, by Hilary Mantel, were filmed here in 2014.

<doc id="145956" wikidata="Q1230765" url="?curid=145956" title="Lacock">
<text>Lacock is a village and civil parish in the county of Wiltshire, England, about 3 miles (5 km) south of the town of Chippenham, and about outside the Cotswolds area. The village is owned almost in its entirety by the National Trust and attracts many visitors by virtue of its unspoiled appearance.

The parish includes Bowden Hill, a small village to the east of Lacock, and the hamlets of Bewley Common, Notton and Reybridge. The Chippenham–Melksham section of the A350 primary route crosses the parish from north to south, as does the River Avon.

A scarecrow festival is held annually in Lacock and is popular with visitors from the local area. All funds raised are donated to Lacock Primary School.

==History==

Lacock is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, with a population of 160–190; with two mills and a vineyard. Lacock Abbey was founded on the manorial lands by Ela, Countess of Salisbury and established in 1232; and the village – with the manor – formed its endowment to &quot;God and St Mary&quot;. Lacock was granted a market and developed a thriving woollen industry during the Middle Ages. Reybridge, and a packhorse ford, remained the only crossing points of the River Avon until the 18th century.

At the dissolution, the Abbey and estate, including the village, were sold to William Sharington, later passing into the Talbot family by marriage. The Lacock estate was home to photography pioneer Henry Fox Talbot from 1800 to 1877.

In 1916 Henry Fox Talbot&#x27;s son Charles bequeathed the Lacock estate to his niece, Matilda Gilchrist-Clark, who took the name of Talbot. The estate – comprising , the Abbey and the village – was given to the National Trust in 1944 by Matilda Talbot. Lacock has three public houses and a number of shops in its High Street including a grocery store, a bakery, gift shops and a National Trust shop.

== Notable buildings and structures ==
Most of the surviving houses in the village are 18th century or earlier in construction. Lacock Abbey, the 14th-century St Cyriac&#x27;s Church and a 14th-century tithe barn are Grade I listed. Elsewhere in the parish, the country houses at Bewley Court (14th century, restored 1920) and Bowden Park (1796) are also Grade I listed.
There are four Grade II* listed structures: The Sign of the Angel (late 15th-century house, now an inn); a village cross (late medieval, re-erected outside the school in the late 19th century); a pair of bridges carrying the Bowden Hill road over the Avon (late medieval, 17th and 19th century); and a 16th-century conduit house, part of the abbey&#x27;s water supply, opposite Bowden Hill church. Next to the tithe barn is a small lock-up from the late 18th century.

Ray Mill House, north of the village on the left bank of the Avon beyond Reybridge, is a country house built in Italianate style around 1860. Since 1996 it has been a residence of Camilla Parker Bowles, later Queen Camilla.

Further north and also overlooking the Avon, Lackham House was built in 1791–1796 for James Montagu, naval officer. It is a three-storey country house in Palladian style.
== Education ==
A school was provided on a central site in Lacock village by Henry Fox Talbot in 1824, with accommodation for 100 pupils. Another classroom was added in 1852 and around this time it became a National School; by 1858 there were about 120 pupils. The school was rebuilt on the same site in 1859, again at the expense of the Talbot family, for 220 pupils and 80 infants. Numbers declined in the 20th century; 135 attended in 1955 when the school gained voluntary controlled status. Children of all ages were educated until the early 1960s when older pupils were transferred to Chippenham.

Since 1946 there has been an agricultural college at the Lackham estate, in the north of the parish towards Chippenham. With its farm it is now part of Wiltshire College.

== Filming location ==
The village has been used as a film and television location, notably for the 1995 BBC production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and the 2007 BBC production of &quot;Cranford&quot;. It also made brief appearances in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,&quot; and in the spin-off film &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.&quot; In the spring of 2012, it was a filming location for the fantasy adventure film &quot;Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box&quot;.

In 2015, Lacock was used for an episode of the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; TV series, portraying a livestock market of the 1920s; Lord Grantham, his family and some of the staff appeared in this location. Not long after, the village was featured in two episodes of the &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; series, based on the novels by Hilary Mantel. Scenes for the 2017 film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; were shot here, and in late 2018, scenes for the film version of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; included a royal parade; the film was released in September 2019.

The village was also used for the music video for the song I Believe (In Love), a 1971 hit for the British band Hot Chocolate.

== Notable people ==
Lacock was the childhood home of Zoe Sugg and Joe Sugg, siblings who both run YouTube channels.

<doc id="145957" wikidata="Q210677" url="?curid=145957" title="Chinese mythology">
<text>Chinese mythology () is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in literature throughout the area now known as Greater China. Chinese mythology encompasses a diverse array of myths derived from regional and cultural traditions. Populated with engaging narratives featuring extraordinary individuals and beings endowed with magical powers, these stories often unfold in fantastical mythological realms or historical epochs. Similar to numerous other mythologies, Chinese mythology has historically been regarded, at least partially, as a factual record of the past.

Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an important part of Chinese folk religion and Taoism, especially older popular forms of it. Many narratives recounting characters and events from ancient times exhibit a dual tradition: one that presents a more historicized or euhemerized interpretation, and another that offers a more mythological perspective.

Numerous myths delve into the creation and cosmology of the universe, exploring the origins of deities and heavenly inhabitants. Some narratives specifically address the topic of creation, unraveling the beginnings of things, people, and culture. Additionally, certain myths are dedicated to the genesis of the Chinese state. A subset myths provides a chronology of prehistoric times, often featuring a culture hero who taught people essential skills ranging from building houses and cooking to the basics of writing. In some cases, they were revered as the ancestor of an ethnic group or dynastic families. Chinese mythology is intimately connected to the traditional Chinese concepts of &quot;li&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;. These two foundational concepts are deeply entwined with socially oriented ritual acts, including communication, greetings, dances, ceremonies, and sacrifices.

== Mythology and religion ==

Significant interplay exists between Chinese mythology and the philosophical traditions of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Elements of pre-Han dynasty mythology such as those in Classic of Mountains and Seas were adapted into these belief systems as they developed (in the case of Taoism), or were assimilated into Chinese culture (in the case of Buddhism). Conversely, teachings and beliefs from Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have, in turn, become integral components of Chinese mythology. For example, the Taoist belief of a spiritual paradise became incorporated into mythology as the place where immortals and deities dwell. Sometimes mythological and religious ideas have become widespread across China&#x27;s many regions and diverse ethnic societies. In other cases, beliefs are more limited to certain social groups, for example, the veneration of white stones by the Qiang. One mythological theme that has a long history and many variations involves a shamanic world view, for example in the cases of Mongolian shamanism among the Mongols, Hmong shamanism among the Miao people, and the shamanic beliefs of the Qing dynasty from 1643 to 1912, derived from the Manchus. Politically, mythology was often used to legitimize the dynasties of China, with the founding house of a dynasty claiming a divine descent.

== Mythology and philosophy ==
Elaborations on the &quot;wuxing&quot; are not really part of mythology, although belief in five elements could appear. The Hundred Schools of Thought is a phrase suggesting the diversity of philosophical thought that developed during the Warring States of China. Then, and subsequently, philosophical movements had a complicated relationship with mythology. However, as far as they influence or are influenced by mythology, divides the philosophical camps into two rough halves, a Liberal group and a Conservative group. The liberal group being associated with the idea of individuality and change, for example as seen in the mythology of divination in China, such as the mythology of the dragon horse that delivered the eight &quot;bagua&quot; diagrams to Fu Xi, and methods of individual empowerment as seen in the &quot;Yi Jing&quot; (&quot;Book of Changes&quot;). The Liberal tendency is towards individual freedom, Daoism, and Nature. The relationship of the Conservative philosophies to mythology is seen in the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons, mythology about the emperors and central bureaucratic governance, Confucianism, written histories, ceremonial observances, subordination of the individual to the social groups of family and state, and a fixation on stability and enduring institutions. The distinction between the Liberal and Conservative is very general, but important in Chinese thought. Contradictions can be found in the details, however these are often traditional, such as the embrace by Confucius of the philosophical aspects of the &quot;Yi Jing&quot;, and the back-and-forth about the Mandate of Heaven wherein one dynasty ends and another begins based according to accounts (some of heavily mythological) where the Way of Heaven results in change, but then a new ethical stable dynasty becomes established. Examples of this include the stories of Yi Yin, Tang of Shang and Jie of Xia or the similar fantastic stories around Duke of Zhou and King Zhou of Shang

==Mythology and ritual==
Mythology exists in relationship with other aspects of society and culture, such as ritual. Various rituals are explained by mythology. For example, the ritual burning of mortuary banknotes (Hell Money), lighting fireworks, and so on.

===Yubu===
A good example of the relationship between Chinese mythology and ritual is the Yubu, also known as the Steps or Paces of Yu. During the course of his activities in controlling the Great Flood, Yu was supposed to have so fatigued himself that he lost all the hair from his legs and developed a serious limp. Daoist practitioners sometimes incorporate a curiously choreographed pedal locomotion into various rituals. Mythology and practice, one explains the other: in these rituals, the sacred time of Yu merges with the sacral practice of the present.

==Cosmology==

Various ideas about the nature of the earth, the universe, and their relationship to each other have historically existed as either a background or a focus of mythologies. One typical view is of a square earth separated from a round sky by sky pillars (mountains, trees, or undefined). Above the sky is the realm of Heaven, often viewed of as a vast area, with many inhabitants. Often the heavenly inhabitants are thought to be of an &quot;as above so below&quot; nature, their lives and social arrangements being parallel to those on earth, with a hierarchical government run by a supreme emperor, many palaces and lesser dwellings, a vast bureaucracy of many functions, clerks, guards, and servants. Below was a vast under ground land, also known as Diyu, Yellow Springs, Hell, and other terms. As time progressed, the idea of an underground land in which the souls of the departed were punished for their misdeeds during life became explicit, related to developments in Daoism and Buddhism. The underground world also came to be conceived of as inhabited by a vast bureaucracy, with kings, judges, torturers, conductors of souls, minor bureaucrats, recording secretaries, similar to the structure of society in the Middle Kingdom (earthly China).

===Mythological places and concepts===

The mythology of China includes a mythological geography describing individual mythological descriptions of places and the features; sometimes, this reaches to the level of a cosmological conception. Various features of mythological terrain are described in myth, including a Heavenly world above the earth, a land of the dead beneath the earth, palaces beneath the sea, and various fantastic areas or features of the earth, located beyond the limits of the known earth. Such mythological features include mountains, rivers, forests or fantastic trees, and caves or grottoes. These then serve as the location for the actions of various beings and creatures. One concept encountered in some myths is the idea of travel between Earth and Heaven by means of climbing up or down the pillars separating the two, there usually being four or Eight Pillars or an unspecified number of these Sky Ladders.

====Directional====
The Four Symbols of Chinese cosmology were the Azure Dragon of the East, the Black Tortoise of the North, the White Tiger of the West, and the 
Vermillion Bird of the South. These totem animals represented the four cardinal directions, with a lot of associated symbolism and beliefs. A fifth cardinal direction was also postulated: the center, represented by the emperor of China, located in the middle of his Middle Kingdom (Zhong Guo, or China). The real or mythological inhabitants making their dwellings at these cardinal points were numerous, as is associated mythology.

====Heavenly realm====

The Heavenly realm is described by the Chinese word &quot;Tian,&quot; which can be translated into English as both &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;sky.&quot; Sometimes this was personified into a deity (sky god). In some descriptions, this was an elaborate place ruled over by a supreme deity, or a group of supreme deities, Jade Emperor being associated with Daoism and Buddhas with Buddhism. Many astronomically observable features were subjects of mythology or the mythological locations and settings for mythic scenes. These include the sun, stars, moon, planets, Milky Way (sometimes referred to as the River of Heaven), clouds, and other features. These were often the home or destination of various deities, divinities, shamans, and many more. Another concept of the Heavenly realm is that of the Cords of the Sky. Travel between Heaven and Earth was usually described as achieved by flying or climbing. The Queqiao () was a bridge formed by birds flying across the Milky Way, as seen in The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl mythology surrounding the Qixi Festival. The hazy band of stars of the Milky Way was referred to as the &quot;Silvery River&quot; or the &quot;River of Heaven&quot;.

====Subterranean realm====


According to mythology, beneath the Earth is another realm—an underground world generally said to be inhabited by the souls of dead humans and various supernatural beings (see hun and po). This hell is known by various names, including Diyu or the Yellow Springs. In more recent mythology, the underground inhabitation of the dead is generally described as somewhat similar to the land above: it possesses a hierarchical government bureaucracy, centered in the capital city of Youdu. The rulers of the underground realm are various kings, whose duties include parsing the souls of the dead according to the merits of their life on earth, and maintaining adequate records regarding that process. (An example of one such ruler is Yánluó wáng (&quot;King Yanluo&quot;)). Souls are parsed and adjudicated for torturous punishment by balancing ones&#x27; crimes in life against any merits earned through good deeds. Various other functions within Diyu are performed by minor officials and minions, examples of whom are Ox-Head and Horse-Face, humanoid devils with animal features. In some versions of mythology or Chinese folk religion, souls are returned from Diyu and reincarnated after being given the Drink of Forgetfulness by Meng Po.

====Earthly realm====

Much mythology involves remote, exotic, or hard-to-get-to places. All sorts of mythological geography is said to exist at the extremes of the cardinal directions of earth. Much of the earthly terrain has been said to be inhabited by local spirits (sometimes called fairies or genii loci), especially mountains and bodies of water. There are Grotto Heavens, and also earthly paradises.

=====Seas, rivers, and islands=====
Various bodies of water appear in Chinese mythology. This includes oceans, rivers, streams, ponds. Often they are part of a mythological geography, and may have notable features, such as mythological islands, or other mythological features. There are mythological versions of all the major rivers that have existed in China in between ancient and modern China (most of these rivers are the same, but not all). Sometimes these rivers are said to originate from the Milky Way or Kunlun. Anyway, they are said to flow west to east because Gonggong wrecked the world pillar at Buzhou, tilting Earth and Heaven away from each other at that sector. Examples of these mythologized rivers include the Yangzi (including various stretches under different names), the Yellow River, the mythological Red River in the west, near Kunlun, and the Weak River, a mythological river in &quot;the west&quot;, near &quot;Kunlun&quot;, which flowed with a liquid too light in specific gravity for floating or swimming (but unbreathable). Examples of features along mythological rivers include the Dragon Gates (Longmen) which were rapid waterfalls where select carp can transform into dragons, by swimming upstream and leaping up over the falls. Examples of islands include Mount Penglai, a paradisaical isle in the sea, vaguely east of China but sometimes conflated with Japan.

=====Mountains and in-between places=====
Various other mythological locales include what are known as fairylands or paradises, pillars separating Earth and Sky, ruined or otherwise. The Earth has many extreme and exotic locales – they are separated by pillars between Earth and Heaven, supporting the sky, usually four or eight. Generally, Chinese mythology regarded people as living in the middle regions of the world and conceived the exotic earthly places to exist in the directional extremes to the north, east, south, or west. Eventually, the idea of an eastern and western paradise seems to have arisen. In the west, according to certain myths, there was Kunlun. On the eastern seacoast was Feather Mountain, the place of exile of Gun and other events during or just after the world flood. Further east was Fusang, a mythical tree, or else an island (sometimes interpreted as Japan). The geography of China, in which the land seems to be higher in the west and tilt down toward the east and with the rivers tending to flow west-to-east was explained by the damage Gonggong did to the world pillar Mount Buzhou, mountain pillars separating the sky from the world (China), which also displaced the Celestial Pole, so that the sky rotates off-center.

=====Kunlun=====

In the west was Kunlun, although it is also sometimes said to be towards the south seas. Kunlun was pictured as having a mountain or mountain range, Kunlun Mountain where dwelt various divinities, grew fabulous plants, home to exotic animals, and various deities and immortals (today there is a real mountain or range named Kunlun, as there has in the past, however the identity has shifted further west over time). The Qing Niao bird was a mythical bird, and messenger of Xi Wangmu to the rest of the world. Nearby to Kunlun, it was sometimes said or written and forming a sort of protective barrier to the western paradise or &quot;fairyland&quot; named Xuánpǔ () where also was to be found the jade pool Yáochí (), eventually thought to exist on mount Kunlun (which itself was thought to possess cliffs insurmountable to normal mortals was the Moving Sands, a semi-mythological place also to the west of China (the real Taklamakan Desert to the west of or in China is known for its shifting sands). There were other locations of mythological geography around the area of Kunlun such as Jade Mountain and the various colored rivers which flew out of Kunlun. For example, the Red, or Scarlet River was supposed to flow to the south of Kunlun.

==Mythological and semi-mythological chronology==
Mythological and semi-mythological chronology includes mythic representations of the creation of the world, population (and sometimes re-populations) by humans, sometimes floods, and various cultural developments, such as the development of ruling dynasties. Many myths and stories have been recounted about the early dynasties, however, more purely historical literature tends to begin with the Qin dynasty (for example, see Paladin 1998). On the other hand, accounts of the Shang, Xia, and early Zhou dynasties tend to mythologize. By a historical process of euhemerism many of these myths evolved over time into variant versions with an emphasis on moral parables and rationalization of some of the more fantastic ideas.

===Mythology of time and calendar===

Mythology of time and the calendar includes the twelve zodiacal animals and various divine or spiritual genii regulating or appointed as guardians for years, days, or hours.

====Twelve zodiacal animals====

In China and surrounding areas, a calendrical system consisting of measuring time in cycles of twelve represented by twelve has an ancient historical past. The exact line-up of animals is sometimes slightly different, but the basic principle is that each animal takes a turn as the emblematic or totem animal for a year or other unit of time in a cycle of one dozen. This is explained by various myths.

The zodiacs in order are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig

===Correlation of mythological and real time===
Some Chinese mythology becomes specific about chronological time, based on the &quot;ganzhi&quot; system, numbers of human generations, or other details suggesting synchronization between the mythological chronology and the ideas of modern historians. However, real correlation begins in the Year of the Metal Monkey, Zhou dynasty, 841 BC, a since validated claim by Sima Qian. However, although historians take note of this, subsequent mythology has not tended to reflect this quest for rational, historical timelining.

==Creation myths==

Various ideas about the creation of the universe, the earth, the sky, various deities and creatures, and the origin of various clans or ethnic groups of humans have circulated in the area of China for millennia. These creation myths may include the origins of the universe and everything, the origins of humans, or the origins of specific groups, such as a Han Chinese in descent from Yandi and Huangdi (as , &quot;Descendants of the Flame and Yellow Emperors&quot;). Various myths contain explanations of various origins and the progress of cultural development.

===Pangu===

One common story involves Pangu. Among other sources, he was written about by Taoist author Xu Zheng c. 200 CE, as claimed to be the first sentient being and creator, &quot;making the heavens and the earth&quot;.

==Age of heroes==
Various culture heroes have been said to have helped or saved humanity in many ways, such as stopping floods, teaching the use of fire, and so on. As mythic chronology is inherently nonlinear, with time being telescopically expanded or contracted, there are various contradictions. The earliest culture heroes were sometimes considered deities and other times heroic humans, but often little distinction was made. Examples of early culture heroes include Youchao (&quot;Have Nest&quot;) who taught people how to make wooden shelters) and Suiren (&quot;Fire Maker&quot;) who taught people the use of fire and cooking thus saving them from much food-poisoning, in addition to developing cuisine. Another example of a mythological hero who provided beneficial knowledge to humanity involves sericulture, the production of silk: an invention credited to Leizu, for one. An example of a non-Han ethnicity culture hero is Panhu. Because of their self-identification as descendants from these original ancestors, Panhu has been worshiped by the Yao people and the She people, often as King Pan, and the eating of dog meat was tabooed. This ancestral myth has also been found among the Miao people and Li people. Some of the first culture heroes are the legendary emperors who succeeded the times of the part-human, part-serpent deities Nuwa and Fuxi; these emperors tend to be portrayed as more explicitly human, although Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor, is often portrayed as part-dragon during life.

===Mythological emperors===
====Historicity====
Some historicized versions of semi-historical and undeniably mythologized accounts of ancient times were used by those who have attempted to apply actual BCE dates to the mythological chronology. Traditional Chinese accounts of the early emperors chronologically locate the Yellow Emperor as having lived in the Northern Chinese plain around 2698 to 2599 BCE, about seventeen generations after the time of Shennong. A major difference between the possible historicity of material embedded in mythological accounts is that through the time of the last Flame Emperor (Yandi) information was recorded using knotted ropes, whereas the introduction of writing is associated with the reign of Huang Di (although the historical continuity of written tradition beginning at that time is a matter of discussion by experts). The most prominent of the first emperors include, in chronological order, Huangdi, Gaoyang (Zhuanxu), Gaoxin (Di Ku), Yao, and Shun. These emperors were said to be morally upright and benevolent, and examples to be emulated by latter-day kings and emperors. Sometimes approximate calculations of times have been made based on the claimed number of generations from one significant mythological figure to the next, as in the case of the legendary founder of the Ji family, Hou Ji, whose descendants would rule generations after his mythological appearance as the historical Zhou dynasty, beginning around 1046 BCE. Despite various assignments of dates to the accounts of these Emperors, fantastic claims about the length of their reigns are common. The average reign-lengths that these numbers imply are improbable, and there is a lack of consensus regarding these dates by modern historians. Their historical use may be limited to establishing a relative chronology.

===Houji===

Houji was a cultural hero, of the agricultural type.

===Chiyou===

Chiyou (also known as Ch&#x27;ih Yu) was a metallurgical engineer, specializing in weaponry.

===Three Primeval Emperors, Five Premier Emperors, and Three Dynasties===
The mythological history of people (or at least the Han Chinese people) begins with two groups, one of three and one of five. The numbers are symbolically significant, however, the actual membership of the two groups is not explicated. There are different lists. The older group is the Three Primeval Emperors, who were followed by the Five Premier Emperors. After that came the Three Dynasties: these were the Xia dynasty, Shang dynasty, and the Zhou dynasty. These three are all historically attested to, but separating the myth from the history is not always clear; nevertheless, there is a lot of mythology around the Three Primeval Emperors, Five Premier Emperors, and Three Dynasties. An age of Three Primeval Emperors followed by the age of the Five Premier Emperors (&quot;Sānhuáng-Wǔdì&quot;) contrasts with the subsequent treatment of chronology by dynasties, up to recent times. Since the time the Qin emperor titled himself &quot;huangdi&quot; by combining two previous titles into one, &quot;huangdi&quot; was the title for Chinese emperors for ages.

====Three Primeval Emperors====

=====Title=====
The title of the Three Primeval Emperors is &quot;huang&quot;, in Chinese. The original connotation of this title is unknown, and it is variously translated into English. Translations include &quot;Sovereign&quot;, &quot;Emperor&quot;, and &quot;August&quot;.

=====Names=====
The names of the Three Primeval Emperors include Youchao (&quot;Have Nest&quot;), Suiren (&quot;Fire Maker&quot;), Paoxi/Fuxi (&quot;Animal Domesticator&quot;), and Shennong (&quot;Divine Husbandman&quot;). Sometimes Huangdi is included.

====Five Premier Emperors====

=====Title=====
The title of the Five Premier Emperors is &quot;di&quot;, in Chinese. The original connotation of this title is unknown, or how it compares or contrasts with the term &quot;huang&quot;, and it is variously translated into English. Translations include &quot;Sovereign&quot;, &quot;Emperor&quot;, and &quot;Lord&quot;.

=====Names=====
Names of the Five Premier Emperors include Huangdi, Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Di Ku, Yao, and Shun.

===Nuwa and Fuxi===

Nuwa and Fuxi (also known as Paoxi) are sometimes worshiped as the ultimate ancestor of all humankind and are often represented as half-snake, half-humans. Nuwa&#x27;s companion, Fuxi, was her brother and husband.

====Nuwa saves the world====

After Gong-Gong was said to have damaged the world pillar holding the earth and sky apart, the sky was rent causing fires, floods (the Flood of Nuwa) and other devastating events which were only remedied when Nüwa repaired the sky with five colored stones. The figure of Nüwa, also referred to as Nü Kwa, appeared in literature no earlier than c. 350 BCE. It is sometimes believed that Nüwa molded humans from clay to populate or re-populate the world, thus creating modern humans.

====Fuxi and the Yellow River map====
The production of the Yellow River Map is associated mythologically with Fuxi but is also sometimes placed in subsequent eras.

===Shennong and Yan Emperor(s)===
Shennong is variously translated as &quot;Divine Farmer&quot; or &quot;Divine Peasant&quot;, or &quot;Agriculture God&quot;, and also known as the Wugushen (Spirit of the Five Grains) and Wuguxiandi &quot;First Deity of the Five Grains&quot;. Shennong is a mythological Chinese deity in Chinese folk religion and venerated as a mythical sage ruler of prehistoric China. Shennong&#x27;s descendants began to style themselves as Yan Emperor (&quot;Yandi&quot;), or Flame Emperor. &quot;Yandi&quot; is often considered an important mythological emperor, although &quot;Yandi&quot; is sometimes considered as series of emperors bearing the same title, the &quot;Yan Emperor(s)&quot; or &quot;Flame Emperor(s)&quot;. &quot;Yan&quot; literally means &quot;flame&quot;, implying that Yan Emperor&#x27;s people possibly uphold a symbol of fire as their tribal totems. K. C. Wu speculates that this appellation may be connected with the use of fire to clear the fields in slash and burn agriculture. And, Yandi is also a Red Emperor.

===Yellow Emperor and Leizu===
One of the more important figures in Chinese mythology is the Yellow Emperor, or Huang Di. His original name was Yellow Soil or Huangdi where di was the Chinese word for soil or ground. He was named after the Yellow Soil in the Yellow River Basin area where Chinese civilization was thought to have originated. Future generations later changed it to di or emperor in order to give Huangdi a more sovereign-sounding name. He also appears as Xuanyuan. Huang Di is also referred to as one of the Five August ones, and one of the few consistent members of the list. There were also other colored emperors, such as Black, Green, Red, and White. According to some mythology, Huang Di was the son of Shaodian, who was the half-brother of Yan Di. Huang Di&#x27;s mother was said to be Fubao. Huang Di&#x27;s wife Leizu is supposed to have invented sericulture. In some versions Cangjie invented writing during the reign of Huang Di. The Yellow Emperor is said to have fought a great battle against Chiyou. Huangdi had various wives and many descendants, including Shaohao (leader of the Dongyi).

===Di Ku===

Ku, Di Ku, Ti K&#x27;u, or Diku, is also known as Kao Hsin or Gāoxīn. Diku is an important mythological figure, as signified by his title &quot;Di&quot; (), basically signifying possession of some sort of imperial divinity, as in the sense of the Roman title &quot;&quot;; something sometimes translated as &quot;emperor&quot;. Diku is sometimes considered to descend from Huangdi and to be ancestral to the ruling family of the Shang dynasty of the second millennium BCE. Diku is credited with the invention of various musical instruments along with musical pieces for them to accompany. Diku is said to have consorted with the semi-divine females Jiang Yuan and Jiandi.

===Yao and Shun===
Yao and Shun were important mythological rulers, exemplars of propriety in rulership. The Great Flood began during the reign of Yao and continued through the time of Shun (the successor of Yao, who had passed over his own son and made Shun his successor because of Shun&#x27;s ability and morality). Historically, when Qin Shi Huang united China in 221 BCE, he used propaganda to acclaim his achievements as surpassing those of mythological rulers who had gone before him. He combined the ancient titles of &quot;Huáng&quot; () and &quot;Dì&quot; () to create a new title, &quot;Huángdì&quot; (); thus, the Qin emperor used mythology to bolster his claims to be the legitimate and absolute ruler of the whole earth. This reflected what was to become a longstanding belief that all civilized people should have one government, and that it should be Chinese.

===Gun, Yu, and the Great Flood===

Shun passed on his place as emperor to Yu the Great. The Yellow River, prone to flooding, erupted in a huge flood in the time of Yao. The flood disrupted society and endangered human existence, as agricultural fields drowned, hunting game disappeared, and the people were dislocated to hills and mountains. Yu&#x27;s father, Gun, was put in charge of flood control by Yao, but failed to alleviate the problem after nine years. In some versions Gun was executed by Shun&#x27;s minister Zhurong for this failure, but according to others Gun was merely exiled for opposing the elevation of Shun as co-emperor. In more purely mythological versions, the story is more along the lines that Gun transformed into an animal shape to escape the wrath of Heaven (for having dared to go to Heaven and steal the flood-fighting expanding earth &quot;xirang&quot;). He fled to Feather Mountain and was struck dead by the fire god Zhurong on behalf of Heaven. After three years, his son Yu appeared out of his belly, usually said to be in the form of some fantastic animal. Yu took his father&#x27;s place fighting the flood, leading the people to build canals and levees, often said to be with the help of Xirang. After thirteen years of toil, Yu abated the flood. Why the Xirang failed to work when Gun used it and he was punished by Heaven, but when Yu used it he was able to stop the flood and was rewarded by Heaven, is a question frequently made in the myths. The mythology of Yu and his associates during their work in controlling the flood and simultaneously saving the people can be seen in various ways to symbolize different societal and cultural developments, such as innovations in hunting, agriculture, well-digging, astronomy, social and political organizing, and other cultural innovations that occur during the course of the mythology around the flood stories. For example, a historicized version of &quot;xirang&quot; explains this soil may represent an innovative type of raised garden, made up of soil, brushwood, and similar materials. Thus, Yu and his work in controlling the flood with &quot;xirang&quot; would symbolize a societal development allowing a large scale approach to transforming wetlands into arable fields. Yu was said to be the founder of the Xia dynasty.

===First dynasties===
The first three dynasties have especial significance in mythology.

====Xia dynasty====

The Xia dynasty is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese historiography as known through literary accounts. However, many of these accounts contain elements of a clearly semi-mythological, and in some versions completely mythological or fanciful. The founding mythology of the early dynasties tends to have certain common general features, including the divine assistance obtained in the founding and the reasons for it. The fighter of the Great Flood, Yu &quot;the Great&quot; had served Yao and Shun and they enfeoffed him as the Prince of Xia, an area of land. Upon Yu&#x27;s death questions arose regarding the method of imperial succession, which would be a key factor as an example for Chinese culture for millennia. The question was who would succeed Yu upon his death. It could be his son, Qi of Xia, also known as Kai, or the deputy that competently and diligently helped in the work against the great flood, a mighty hunter who helped feed the people during a time when agriculture had been rendered impossible, Bo Yi. The mythological variants are much concerned with the relative merits between the two. Qi&#x27;s succession broke the previous convention of meritorious succession in favor of hereditary succession, thus initiating a dynastic tradition. The new dynasty was called &quot;Xia&quot; after Yu&#x27;s centre of power.

====Shang dynasty====

The Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional Chinese history firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Yet, as in common with the founding of Xia, there is mythological material regarding how the previous dynasty turned to evil and unworthy ways, and the founder (of miraculous birth or ancestry) overthrew it. The mythology of the Shang dynasty is distinct from philosophical and historical accounts. Significant mythology includes the origin of its founders, the miraculous birth by Jiandi of Shang founder Qi, also known as Xie of Shang, after she became pregnant upon swallowing or holding in her bosom a bird&#x27;s egg. After several generations, Xie (or Qi)&#x27;s descendant Tang became king of Shang by overthrowing Jie, the last king of the Xia dynasty, said to be a very drunken and bloodthirsty tyrant. The fifth book of the philosopher Mozi describes the end of the Xia dynasty and the beginning of the Shang:
After discussing the end of Xia and the beginning of Shang, Mozi describes the end of Shang and the beginning of the succeeding Zhou dynasty:
The mythological events surrounding the end of the Shang dynasty and the establishment of the Zhou greatly influenced the subject and story told in the popular novel &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;.

====Founding of the Zhōu dynasty====
The origins of the Ji dynastic founding family of the Zhōu dynasty is replete with mythological material, going back to its legendary founder Houji (who was originally named Qi, but a different Qi than the Shang founder known as Xie or Qi). Myths about Houji include those of his mythical origins, of which there are two main myths. The end of the Shang overlaps the rise of the Zhōu, so there is shared material. Once established, the Zhōu were characterized by their volume of literature, in the beginning much of it justifying their overthrow of the Shang. However, it was not long before much historical material appeared, of a rational, rationalized, philosophical, or otherwise non-mythological nature.

=====Bagua=====
One of the main legacies of the rise of Zhou was the dissemination of the classic book &quot;I Ching&quot;, however the eight trigrams must be from a far earlier period than Wengong, and even more than the editing and commentary by Confucius – mythology references the culture hero sometimes named Fuxi.

===Subsequent dynasties===
Dynasties succeeding Zhou had notable mythological material, such as the accumulation of legend around the Jian&#x27;an transition between Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms contention, reflected in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. From the Tang dynasty on, legends occur around the monk Xuanzang&#x27;s quest for Buddhist scriptures (sutras) from the area more-or-less corresponding to modern India, which influenced the Ming dynasty novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

== Important deities, spirits, and mythological people ==

There are various important deities, spirits, and mythological people in Chinese mythology and folk religion. Some are clearly divine, such as the Jade Emperor (and even he is sometimes said to have begun life as a mortal). However, in Chinese language many beings are referred to as &quot;shen&quot;. (Sometimes Chinese mythology is called – Mandarin Chinese: &quot;Zhōngguó Shénhuà&quot;). Due to the ambiguity of this word when translated into English, it is not always clear how to classify in English the entities described as &quot;shen&quot;. The category &quot;shen&quot; is rather comprehensive and generic in Chinese myth and religion, &quot;shen&quot; may be &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;goddesses&quot; or &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;ghosts&quot;, or other. Another important concept is the classification of immortals (&quot;xian&quot;). Immortals are more a category of quality than a description of an actual type. Immortals are defined by living for a long time (maybe forever). However, this is not a static quality, since Daoist adepts, shamans, or others are said to become immortals through right effort and various practices. Another example is the immortality sometimes obtained by the lohans, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas of Buddhist religion and mythology (this contrasts with indefinitely prolonged series of unenlightened re-births). Chinese mythology often tends to not make a clear differentiation between Buddhist and Daoist types. Various deities, spirits, and immortals (&quot;xian&quot;) are encountered in various myths. Some of these are particularly associated with Daoism. Some immortals or others became incorporated into Daoism as it developed as a phenomenon, deriving from ancient shamanic cults or other sources. The line between Daoism and folk religion is not clear. Other mythological beings are clearly derived through the process of the introduction of Buddhism into China.

===Major deities===
The concept of a principal or presiding deity has fluctuated over time in Chinese mythology.

====Shangdi====

Shangdi, also sometimes &quot;Huángtiān Dàdì&quot; (), appeared as early as the Shang dynasty. In later eras, he was more commonly referred to as &quot;Huángtiān Shàngdì&quot; (). The use of &quot;Huángtiān Dàdì&quot; refers to the Jade Emperor and &quot;Tian&quot;.

====Jade Emperor====

Chinese mythology holds that the Jade Emperor was charged with running of the three realms: heaven, hell, and the realm of the living. The Jade Emperor adjudicated and meted out rewards and remedies to saints, the living, and the deceased according to a merit system loosely called the Jade Principles Golden Script (, &quot;Yù lǜ jīn piān&quot;). When proposed judgments were objected to, usually by other saints, the administration would occasionally resort to the counsels of advisory elders. The Jade Emperor appeared in literature after the establishment of Taoism in China; his appearance as &quot;Yu Huang&quot; dates back to beyond the times of Yellow Emperor, Nüwa, or Fuxi.

====Tian====

Tian can be either a sky deity by that name or Heaven – the Sky itself. Tian appeared in literature c. 700 BCE, possibly earlier as dating depends on the date of the Shujing (&quot;Book of Documents&quot;). There are no creation-oriented narratives for Tian. The qualities of Tian and Shangdi appear to have merged in later literature and are now worshiped as one entity (&quot;&quot;, Huángtiān Shàngdì) in, for example, the Beijing&#x27;s Temple of Heaven. The extent of the distinction between Tian and Shangdi is debated. The sinologist Herrlee Creel claims that an analysis of the Shang oracle bones reveals Shangdi to have preceded Tian as a deity, and that Zhou dynasty authors replaced the term &quot;Shangdi&quot; with &quot;Tian&quot; to cement the claims of their influence.

====Nüwa====

Nüwa (or Nügua) is considered a mother goddess of Chinese mythology. She was involved in the creation of humanity and repairing the Pillars of Heaven. Nüwa is often depicted as half snake, half human, and is sometimes considered one of the Three Sovereigns, along with her brother and husband Fuxi.

====Fuxi====

Fuxi is the first of the Three Sovereigns. He created humanity alongside his sister and wife Nüwa, and like her, is depicted as half snake, half human. Fuxi is closely associated with the I Ching.

===Daoism and Chinese mythology===
Over time certain aspects of folk religion and belief coalesced and were refined into a group of formal religious beliefs, practices, and philosophy known as Daoism. One of the founders of Daoism was Old Man Laozi, who himself entered into legend or mythology. There is much overlap between religion and mythology, and between Chinese folk religion and Daoism. However, certain beings or concepts of Chinese mythology have a particularly strong association with religious or philosophical Daoism. For example, the Jade Emperor, Yùhuáng, is a major actor in many myths. In Daoist-related mythology there is often a strong presence of sorcery and magic, such as spells, charms, magical abilities, and elixirs. The development of Daoism as it came to be called was a lengthy one, with various strands including both rationalist ethical philosophy and a magico-religious stand informed by mythology. As Daoism developed as a concept from its traditional roots in Chinese folk religion and mythology, its legitimacy was bolstered by claims of originating with Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor. For example some of the &quot;Huangdi Sijing material&quot;, the &quot;Huangdi Yinfujing&quot;, and the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; are Daoist classics with claims to a scriptural legacy going back to Huangdi.

===Buddhist influences===

Buddhism was historically introduced to China, probably in the first century CE, accompanied by the import of various ideas about deities and supernatural beings including Kṣitigarbha who was renamed Dizang. the Four Heavenly Kings, the main Buddha himself Shakyamuni Buddha (, Shìjiāmóunífó), Avalokiteśvara who after a few centuries metamorphosized into Guanyin (also Kuanyin) a bodhisattva of compassion, and Hotei the Laughing Buddha. New Buddhist material continued to enter China, with a big spike in the Tang dynasty, when the monk Xuanzang brought over 600 texts from India. Over time, Guanyin also became a Daoist immortal and was the subject of much mythology.

====Guanyin====

Guanyin is also known as Kwan Yin, Guanshiyin, the Goddess of Mercy and many other names. The mythology around Guanyin is two-fold, one based on the Avalokitasvara/Avalokiteśvara tradition from India and one based on an alleged Chinese young woman&#x27;s life, as appears in the legend of Miaoshan. Guanyin is worshiped as a goddess, yet has a most impressive mythological résumé. Many myths and legends exist about Guan Yin. In all of them she is exceptionally compassionate.

====Kṣitigarbha====
Kṣitigarbha was a Buddhist deity from the area of India who was renamed Dizang, In China. He usually appears as a monk with a halo around his shaved head, he carries a staff to force open the gates of hell and a wish-fulfilling jewel to light up the darkness.

====Four Heavenly Kings====
There are a group known as the Four Heavenly Kings, one for each cardinal direction. Statues of them can be encountered in the Hall of the Heavenly Kings of many Buddhist temples.

====Laughing Buddha====

The depiction of a fat, laughing Buddha developed in China.

===Confucian influence===
A major factor in Chinese mythology is shown in the development of the tradition known as Confucianism, named after a writer and school master who lived around 551–479 BCE. Confucius embraced the traditions of ancestor veneration. He came to be a major figure of worship in Daoism, which had its genesis in traditional Chinese religion. The legitimacy of the Confucian movement was bolstered by the claim that its origins could be found in the mythology (often claimed to be history) of Yao and Shun.

===Sharing between folk religion and mythology===
Modern and ancient Chinese culture had plenty of room for both religion and mythology. Certain deities or spirits receive special attention. These include divinities of wealth, longevity, fertility. Mythologically, it is possible to attain many desires through ritual activity involved with mythological themes. For example, many stores and restaurants in China or of the Chinese diaspora have shrines to Guan Yu, also known as Guandi.

====Guandi====
Guandi began as a Three Kingdoms general, Guan Yu. Over the subsequent centuries, Guan Yu became promoted by official decree to be the god Guandi. He is a god primarily of brotherhood and social organizations such as businesses, although this is sometimes seen in connection with martial power and war. According to mythology, Guan Yu made a famous covenant of brotherhood in a peach orchard.

====Three Star deities====

=====Star God of Longevity=====

An example of Sharing between folk religion and mythology is the Star God of Longevity.

===Afterlife and family===

Much Chinese mythology concerns the afterlife, explaining what happens to people after they die. This is related to ancestor veneration, the mythological geography of heaven and hell, the rituals at family tombs, and so on.

====Immortals (&quot;xiān&quot;)====

Sometimes, in mythology, certain humans develop the ability to live indefinitely, avoiding death, and becoming divine &quot;xiān&quot;. Such humans generally also are said to develop special powers. Generally, these abilities are said to develop through such practices of Chinese alchemy, obtaining an Elixir of life, and/or various austerities of diet or sexuality. Symbolic associations with immortality include a spotted deer, cranes, the Lingzhi mushroom, and a gourd and bat. often Immortals are mythologically located in Mountain Paradises, such as Kunlun. Various common English translations of &quot;xiān&quot; exist, such as Immortal, Fairy, and Sage. An example of a Daoist immortal is Wong Tai Sin, who began as a fourth century CE hermit and developed into a divine healer.

=====Magu=====

Magu is a legendary Taoist &quot;xian&quot; (transcendent&quot;), still currently worshiped. Magu is associated with the elixir of life, and is a symbolic protector of females in Chinese mythology. Stories in Chinese literature describe Magu as a beautiful young woman with long birdlike fingernails, while early myths associate her with caves. Magu&#x27;s name literally compounds two common Chinese words: &quot;ma&quot; &quot;cannabis; hemp&quot; and &quot;gu&quot; &quot;aunt; maid&quot;.

====Ghosts or spirits of the deceased====
Common beliefs and stories in Chinese mythology involve a soul or spirit that survives after the death of someone&#x27;s body. There are many types.

====Living dead====
Jiangshi are a type of re-animated corpse.

=====Zhong Kui=====
In the mythological folklore, Zhong Kui is regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. He committed suicide upon being unfairly stripped of his title of &quot;Zhuangyuan&quot; (top-scorer) of the Imperial Examinations by the emperor, due to his disfigured and ugly appearance. His spirit was condemned to Hell because suicide was considered a grave sin, but Yama (the Chinese Hell King) judged him worthy of the title &quot;King of Ghosts&quot; in Diyu (Hell). Yama tasked him to hunt, capture, take charge of, and maintain discipline and order of all ghosts. On Chinese New Year&#x27;s eve, Zhong Kui returned to his hometown to repay the kindness of his friend Du Ping ().

====Holidays and festival rituals====
Abundant mythology is associated with religious holidays and folk festivals.

=====Qingming Festival=====
The Qingming festival is a good example of a Chinese holiday that involves family activities associated with a seasonally-recurring annual event; and, also, ancestor veneration.

=====Qixi Festival=====
The seasonally-recurring annual holiday of Qixi involves love and romance. A main mythological tale is &quot;The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&quot;.

===Weather deities===
Various deities or spirits are associated with weather phenomena, such as drought or thunder. Dragons are often associated with rain. Examples include the deity or mythological person Ba, also known as Hànbá or Nuba. Ba is the daughter of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi) whom she aided during his Battle at Zhuolu against Chiyou: after Chiyou had fielded a wind god (Feng Bo) and a rain god (Yu Shi), Ba descended from heaven to use her drought power to defeat their wind and rain powers. She is one of the first goddesses attested to in Chinese literature, appearing in the early collection of poetry, the &quot;Shijing&quot;, as well as in the later &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;. At least up through the middle of the twentieth century, ceremonies to produce rain were held in many regions of China. The basic idea of these ceremonies, which could last several hours, was to drive Ba out of the region. Another example, is Lei Gong, god of thunder.

===Astronomical deities===
Various goddesses, gods, or spirits are especially associated with certain astronomical objects.

====Sun (and Suns)====
Various mythology involves the sun. One solar deity is Xihe, goddess of the sun. There is a myth of Kua Fu, a giant who followed the sun, during the course of his chase he drained all of the waters dry including the Yellow River, and after he died of thirst was transformed into a mountain range or a forest. Known as 
sānzúwū are three-legged raven or ravens associated with the sun, or the ten suns, of which Houyi shot down nine. Sometimes mythology portrays there being more than one sun.

=====Houyi and the Ten Suns=====
It was said that there were ten suns, each one taking a turn on its allotted day to cross the sky (this has been thought evidence of a ten-day week used at one time). There is a mythological account of how at one on a certain morning ten suns all rose into the sky together. The oppressive heat lead to drought, the plants began to wither, and humans and animals were all on the verge of death. A mighty archer Yi, or Houyi, shot down all but one of them, saving humanity.

====Moon====

Chang&#x27;e (or in older versions Chang&#x27;O) is goddess of the moon. Another lunar deity is Changxi, probably an older version of Chang&#x27;e with the name changed due to a naming taboo. Chang&#x27;e is modern.

=====Chang&#x27;e=====
In mythology it was said that Chang&#x27;e had been married to the heroic archer Houyi, but one day she swallowed a Pill of Immortality and floated up to the moon. Now it is said Chang&#x27;e lives in a cold crystal palace on the moon. Every year during a full moon toward harvest time, Chang&#x27;e is worshiped. This is the Mid-Autumn Festival, families gather under the moonlight and celebrate in honour of the moon. Although somewhat lonely, Chang&#x27;e is not alone on the moon.

=====Wu Gang and the Magic Tree=====
A magical tree grows on the moon. It is possibly an osmanthus tree (&quot;Osmanthus fragrans&quot;), some type of laurel (Lauraceae), such as a cassia such as (&quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot;), but more likely a unique specimen of a magical tree. Every month the &quot;xian&quot; Wu Gang cuts away at the tree, chopping it smaller and smaller. Then, just when he just has it chopped completely down, it magically grows back. Once it has grown back Wu Gang returns to his chopping, in an endless monthly cycle.

=====Rabbit in the Moon=====
An alchemical hare or rabbit lives on the moon. The lunar rabbit can be seen when the moon is full, busy with mortar and pestle, preparing the Elixir of Immortality.

=====Three-legged toad=====

(See Liu Haichan for Chinese characters)

A three-legged toad lives on the moon. During full moons the three-legged Golden Toad Jin Chan frequents near houses or businesses that will soon receive good news generally in the form of wealth. Also known as a Money Toad, statuettes of this toad are used as a charm in Fengshui. The mythology of the Immortal Liu Haichan (who seems to be a form of Caishen/Zhao Gong, God of Wealth) is associated with this tripedal toad.

===Deities of places===
Various goddesses, gods, spirits, fairies, or monsters are associated with specific places, such as particular rivers, mountains, or the ocean. Some of these locations are associated with real geography, others are known only through mythological imagination.

====Xi Wangmu====
Xi Wangmu, meaning Queen Mother of the West, predates organized Daoism, yet is now strongly identified with Daoism. Xi Wangmu is generally mythologically located in a western wonderland &quot;to the west&quot;, now identified with the Kunlun of mythology. Thus, she is the ruler of a passageway between Earth and Heaven.

=====Mazu=====
Mazu is a major goddess. She is a goddess of the sea. Mazu worship is credited with leading to miraculous salvations at sea, protecting sailors and travelers from drowning. She is a tutelary deity of seafarers, including fishermen and sailors, especially along coastal China and areas of the Chinese diaspora.

====Xiang River goddesses====

The two Xiang River goddesses are ancient in mythology. They are associated with the Xiang River in the former Chu area of China. They are also mythologically credited with causing a certain type of bamboo to develop a mottled appearance said to resemble tear-drops (&quot;lacrima&quot; &quot;deae&quot;).

The welfare of the family was mythologically-related to the perceived help of helpful deities and spirits, and avoiding the baneful effects of malicious ones. Of these household deities the most important was the kitchen god Zao Jun. The Kitchen God was viewed as a sort of intermediary between the household and the supreme god, who would judge, then reward or punish a household based on the Kitchen God&#x27;s report. Zao Jun was propitiated at appropriate times by offerings of food and incense, and various mythological stories about him exist. Lesser deities or spirits were also thought to help out the household through their intervention. For example, the guardians of the doors, the Menshen pair and others.

====Heroes====
=====Xingtian=====
Xingtian is a headless giant decapitated by the Yellow Emperor as punishment for challenging him; his face is on his torso as he has no head.

== Mythological creatures ==

Non-divine mythological beings are sometimes divided into several parts each ruled over by a particular type of being—humans ruled over by the Emperor, winged creatures ruled over by the phoenix, and scaly, finned, or crawly creatures ruled over by the dragon. However, whatever the approach, mythological taxonomy is not a rigorous discipline, not even as clear as folk taxonomy, much less the scientific efforts which result in modern biological taxonomy. Often, mythological creatures inhabit the furthest reaches of the exotic imagination.

===The Four Symbols===
The Four Symbols were four species of animals of particular intelligence (not considering humans). Each one represented and ruled over a class of animals. They are the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West, and the Black Tortoise (also called &quot;Black Warrior&quot;) of the North.

=== Dragons, dragon-like and related creatures ===
The Chinese dragon is one of the most important mythical creatures in Chinese mythology, considered to be the most powerful and divine creature and the controller of all waters who could create clouds with their breath. The dragon symbolized great power and was very supportive of heroes and gods. The conventional dragon has a certain description, however there are other dragons or dragon-like beings that vary from this description. For example, the Chi of mythology lacks horns. Dragons often chase or play with a mystical or flaming pearl. A dragon-fenghuang pairing is a common motif in art, the fenghuang often being called a &quot;phoenix&quot;.

One of the most famous dragons in Chinese mythology is Yinglong, the god of rain. Many people in different places pray to Yinglong to receive rain. Chinese people use the term (&quot;Descendants of the Dragon&quot;) as a sign of their ethnic identity. Shenlong is a master of storms and bringer of rain. Zhulong the Torch Dragon is a giant red solar deity. Sometimes he appears in composite snake-like, human-dragon form. There were various dragon kings. They mostly lived undersea and were of the Ao family, such as Ao Guang.

Various mythology accounting human-dragon relationships exist, such as the story of Longmu, a woman who raise dragons.

Specific dragons, or types of dragon, include: Dilong, the earth dragon; Fucanglong, the treasure dragon; Jiaolong, dragon of floods and sea; Teng, a flying creature, sometimes considered a type of snake or dragon-snake; Tianlong, the celestial dragon, sometimes associated with centipede qualities; Yinglong, the water dragon, a powerful servant of the Yellow Emperor.

The fourteenth monarch of the Xia dynasty is said to be Kong Jia, who, according to mythology, raised dragons.

===Fish and fish-like===

Various mythology of China involves fish or fish-like beings. Part human, part sea creatures of the Mermaid () type appear. The Kun (or Peng) was a giant monstrous fish transformation of the Peng bird. Carp that leapt the dragon gate falls of the Yellow River were said to transform into dragons. This was used as a symbol for a scholar&#x27;s successful graduation in the Imperial examination system.

===Snakelike and reptilian===
Various snakes and reptilians appear in Chinese mythology, folklore, and religion. These range from divine or semi-divine to merely fantastic types of the bestiary sort. Sometimes the dragon is considered part of this category, related to it, or the ruler of all the swimming and crawling folk. This may include the giant marine turtle or tortoise Ao, the Bashe snake reputed to swallow elephants, a nine-headed snake monster reminiscent of the hydra known as Xiangliu, and the White Serpent from the novel &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot;.

Some &quot;xian&quot; were thought to have reptile and birdlike features in the Han Dynasty.

===Birds===



Various birds are found in Chinese mythology, some of them obviously based on real birds, other ones obviously not, and some in-between. The Crane is an example of a real type of bird with mythological enhancements. Cranes are linked with immortality, and may be transformed &quot;xian&quot; immortals, or ferry an immortal upon their back. Early depictions of immortals also had a birdlike appearance. The Vermilion Bird is iconic of the south. Sometimes confused with the Fenghuang, the vermilion bird of the south is associated with fire. The Peng was a gigantic bird phase of the gigantic Kun fish. The Jingwei is a mythical bird which tries to fill up the ocean with twigs and pebbles symbolizing indefatigable determination. The Qingniao was the messenger or servant of Xi Wangmu.

Other birds include the Bi Fang bird, a one-legged bird. &quot;Bi&quot; is also number nineteen of the Twenty-Eight Mansions of traditional Chinese astronomy, the Net (Bi). There are supposed to be the Jiān (; jian1): the mythical one-eyed bird with one wing; Jianjian (): a pair of such birds dependent on each other, inseparable, hence representing husband and wife. There was a Shang-Yang rainbird. The Jiufeng is a nine-headed bird used to scare children. The Sù Shuāng (; su4shuang3) sometimes appears as a goose-like bird. The Zhen is a poisonous bird. There may be a Jiguang (; &quot;jíguāng&quot;).

===Mythological humanoid===
Mythological humanoids include the former human, the part-human and the human-like, although these sometimes merge into other categories. Examples include Kui: one-legged mountain demon or dragon who invented music and dance; also Shun&#x27;s or Yao&#x27;s Music Master, Xiāo (; xiao1) mountain spirit(s) or demon(s), and Yaoguai demons.

Xian are immortal humanoid beings with a variety of depictions, usually with human features.

===Mythological mammalians===

Various mythological mammals exist in Chinese mythology. Some of these form the totem animals of the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese language of mythology tends not to mark words for gender or number, so English language translations can be problematic. Also, species or even genera are not always distinguished, with the named animal often being seen as the local version of that type, such is as the case with sheep and goats, or the versatile term sometimes translated as &quot;ox&quot;.

====Fox spirits====

Fox spirits feature prominently in mythology throughout the mythology of East Asia. In China, these are generally known as Huli jing. There are various types, such as the nine-tailed fox.

====Dogs====

Various dogs appear in the mythology of China, featuring more prominently in some ethnic cultures more than others. The zodiacal dog is featured in the Chinese zodiac.

====Bovidae====

The Bovidae appearing in the mythologies of China include oxen (including the common cow, buffalo, and the yak), sheep and goats, and perhaps antelopes (some times &quot;unicorns&quot; are thought to be types of antelopes).

=====Ox=====

References to oxen may include those to the common cow, the buffalo, and the yak. The zodiacal ox is one of the twelve zodiacal signs in the twelve-year calendar cycle. Yak tails are mentioned as magical whisks used by Daoist sorcerers. The ox appears in various agricultural myths.

=====Sheep and goats=====

Sheep (and/or goats) appear in various myths and stories. The zodiacal sheep is one of the twelve zodiacal signs in the twelve-year calendar cycle. A semi-mythical, semi-historical story involves the adventures of the Han diplomat Su Wu held captive among the Xiongnu for nineteen years and forced to herd sheep and/or goats.

====Horses====

Horses frequently gallop through Chinese mythology. Sometimes the poets say that they are related to dragons. The zodiacal horse is one of the twelve zodiacal signs in the twelve-year calendar cycle.

====Unicorns====
Various types of &quot;unicorns&quot; can be found in the myths, designated by the term &quot;lin&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;unicorn&quot;. They possess many similarities to the European unicorn, although not necessarily having only one horn. There are six types of &quot;lin&quot;. One type of &quot;lin&quot; is the Qilin, a chimeric or composite animal with several variations. Xu Shen in his early 2nd century CE) dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; defines what is represented by this particular &quot;lin&quot; as &quot;an animal of benevolence, having the body of an antelope, the tail of an ox, and a single horn.&quot; Also, according to the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, the horn was sometimes said to have been frightening in appearance to scare off would be attackers, but really flesh-tipped so as to cause no harm. &quot;Lin&quot;, or unicorns appear only during the reign of benevolent rulers. In 451 BCE, Confucius recorded that a unicorn had appeared, but was slain in a ducal hunt. Confucius was so upset upon reporting this that he set aside his brush and wrote no more. The giraffe was not well known in China and poorly described: about 1200 CE the &quot;lin&quot; and the giraffe began to trade characteristics in their mythological conceptions. It is possible that the unicorns resulted from different descriptions of animals which later became extinct, or they no longer ranged in the area of China.

====Cats====
Various cats appear in Chinese mythology, many of them large. Examples are Pixiu, resembled a winged lion, and Rui Shi (, &quot;Ruì Shī&quot;), guardian lions. Sometimes they are found pulling the chariot of Xiwangmu. The cat is one of the twelve annual zodiacal animals in Vietnamese and related cultural calendars, having the place of the rabbit found in the Chinese system.

====Non-bovid ungulates====
Various non-bovid ungulates are encountered. Xīniú: a rhinoceros, became mythologized when rhinoceroses became extinct in China. Depictions later changed to a more bovine appearance, with a short, curved horn on its head used to communicate with the sky.

====Simian====

Various beings with simian characteristics appear in Chinese mythology and religion. The Monkey King was a warder of evil spirits, respected and loved, an ancient deity at least influenced by the Hindu deity Hanuman. The Monkey god is still worshiped by some people in modern China. Some of the mythology associated with the Monkey King influenced the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. The xiao of mythology appears as a long-armed ape or a four-winged bird, making it hard to categorize exactly; but this is true of various composite beings of mythology.

====Draconid mammalian====
The Longma is a composite beast, like a winged horse similar to the Qilin, with scales of a dragon.

===Four Fiends===
The Four Fiends:

Some of these in Heaven or Earthly Paradises, some of them in particularly inaccessible or hard-to-find areas of the Earth; examples include the Fusang world tree habitation of sun(s), the Lingzhi mushrooms of immortality, the Peaches of Immortality, and the magical Yao Grass. Also encountered are various plants of jasper and jade growing in the gardens of the Paradises.

Various mythological objects form a part of Chinese mythology, including gems, pearls, magical bronzes, and weapons. Examples include a wish-fulfilling jewel; various luminous gemstones, the Marquis of Sui&#x27;s pearl, auspicious pearls associated with dragon imagery; and, the Nine Tripod Cauldrons which conferred legitimacy to the dynastic ruler of the Nine Provinces of China. The weaponry motif is common in Chinese mythology, for example, the heroic archer Yi is supposed to have shot down nine problematic suns with a magical bow and arrows given to him by Di Jun.

===Jewels===
Jewels include a wish-fulfilling jewel; various luminous gemstones, the Marquis of Sui&#x27;s pearl, auspicious pearls associated with dragon imagery.

Weapons include Guanyu&#x27;s pole weapon, sometimes known as the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Also: the shield and battleaxe of Xingtian, Yi&#x27;s bow and arrows, given him by Di Jun, and the many weapons and armor of Chiyou.

==Major sources==
Some myths survive in theatrical or literary formats as plays or novels, others are still collected from the oral traditions of China and surrounding areas. Other material can be gleaned from examining various other artifacts such as Chinese ritual bronzes, ceramics, paintings, silk tapestries and elements of Chinese architecture. The oldest written sources of Chinese mythology are short inscriptions, rather than literature as such. The earliest written evidence is found in the Oracle bone script, written on scapulae or tortoise plastrons, in the process of the divination practices Shang dynasty (ended approximately 1046 BCE). A copious and eclectic source of information on Chinese mythology is the written materials recovered from the Dunhuang manuscripts library, now scattered in libraries around the world.

===Shells and bones===

The earliest known written inscriptions of Chinese mythology are found on the shells and bones from about 3000 years before present. These shells and bones were inscribed with records of divinatory processes during the late Shang dynasty, also known as the Yin dynasty after its capital at Yin, near modern Anyang, in Hebei province. The use of these artifacts in the study of mythology is limited to fragmentary references, such as names, at best. No actual mythological narrative is known from the Shang oracle bones and shells.

===Bronzes===
Very ancient bronze pieces have also been found, especially beginning in the Zhou dynasty (founded about 3,000 years before present), with allusions or short descriptions adding to modern knowledge of Ancient Chinese mythology. The sacred or magical attitude towards some of these cast inscriptions is shown in that they sometimes appear in places almost inaccessible to being read, such as the inside of a vessel (often quite large and heavy, often covered with a lid, and perhaps meant to store food). However, there was a widespread belief that such writings were read by gods or spirits. One such vessel (a &quot;xu&quot; (), with the characters appearing on the inside-bottom) is a Zhou bronze with a 98-character description of the deeds of Yu draining the flood.

===Literary sources===
Various Chinese literature addresses the subject area of Chinese mythology. In some cases, some preservation of mythology occurs, either deliberately or incidentally. In other cases, the mythology inspires literary works which are not strictly of a mythological nature, for example works of fiction, didactic works of philosophy, or, more modernly, computer games and the names associated with Chinese explorations into outer space, the deep ocean, or the north and south polar regions. Approaching a rough organization of the topic of literature relating to Chinese mythology may be chronologic. The early textual materials mainly survive from the later Zhou dynasty; that is, Eastern Zhou, from about 450 to 221 BCE. Although these texts are relatively less editorial treated than some later texts, they are not the same as the original pre-literary myths. The next major period of textual sources for Chinese mythology dates from the start of the Qin dynasty (221 BCE), through the end of the Han dynasty (220 CE), and continuing through the end of the subsequent periods of disunity (581 CE). The surviving texts from this era often reflect evolution of the mythological substratum. Beginning with the establishment of the Sui dynasty and continuing through the subsequent Tang dynasty, Song dynasty, and Ming dynasty (ended 1644). During this period Chinese mythology developed into what now may be considered to be its traditional form. The Song literature is particularly valuable for the often verbatim transcriptions of mythological material from otherwise unpreserved earlier sources. In modern times, Chinese mythology has both become the subject of global study and inspiration, including popular culture.

====&quot;Chuci&quot; and poetry sources====
Some information on Chinese mythology is found in the verse poetry associated with the ancient state of Chu such as &quot;Lisao&quot;, &quot;Jiu Ge&quot;, and &quot;Heavenly Questions&quot;, contained in the &quot;Chuci&quot; anthology, traditionally attributed to the authorship of Qu Yuan of Chu. The &quot;Chuci&quot; (together with some of its commentaries) in the form known today was compiled during Han, but contains some older material, dating back at least to the waning days of the Zhou dynasty (the Warring States period), prior to the 221 BCE defeat of Chu (state) during the rise of the Qin dynasty. Later poetic sources also address this mythology as a continuation of this poetic tradition, for example, Tang poetry.

====Zhou dynasty literature====

Some information can be found in the Confucian Classics, such as the &quot;Shijing&quot; and &quot;Yijing&quot;, and other Zhou dynasty era material, especially &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, but also the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;. The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; contains some Chinese myths.

====Literature of Qin-Han to Sui====

=====Han dynasty=====
The Han dynasty existed from 206 BCE – 220 CE (with a brief intermission separating it into two halves). Han was preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty, 221 to 206 BC, which has some important surviving literature. In the Qin and Han periods, besides the &quot;Chuci&quot;, useful historical documents include the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, completed by Han historian Sima Qian before his death in about 220 CE. Legends were passed down for over a thousand years before being written in books such as &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; (&quot;Shanhaijing&quot;), basically a gazetteer mixing known and mythological geography. Another major Han source on mythology is the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;.

=====Post-Han, pre-Sui disunity period=====
The mythologically relevant book &quot;Soushen Ji&quot; dates to the Jin dynasty (266–420), during the Sixteen Kingdoms era. Also known as &quot;In Search of the Supernatural&quot; and &quot;A Record of Researches into Spirits&quot;, it is a 4th-century compilation of stories and hearsay concerning spirits, ghosts, and supernatural phenomena, some of which being of mythological importance, including a &quot;great deal&quot; of pre-Han mythological narrative.

====Sui, Tang, and Ming====

=====Tang dynasty=====
The Tang dynasty had a flourishing literature, including prose and poetry involving mythological content. One important, partially-surviving work is &quot;Duyizhi&quot; by Li Rong.

=====Song dynasty=====
Surviving Song dynasty literature informative on Chinese mythology includes the
encyclopedic work known as &quot;Taiping Yulan&quot;.

====Vernacular novels and new media====

Some myths were passed down through oral traditions literature, and art, such as theater and song before being recorded as novels. One example is &quot;Epic of Darkness&quot;. Books in the &quot;shenmo&quot; genre of vernacular fiction revolve around gods and monsters. Important mythological fiction which allude to these myths, include &quot;Fengshen Bang&quot; (&quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;), a mythological fiction dealing with the founding of the Zhou dynasty; &quot;Journey to the West&quot; attributed to Wu Cheng&#x27;en, published in the 1590s, a fictionalized account of the pilgrimage of Xuanzang to India to obtain Buddhist religious texts in which the main character and his companions such as Sun Wukong encounter ghosts, monsters, and demons, as well as the Flaming Mountains; and, &quot;Baishe Zhuan&quot; (&quot;Madame White Snake&quot;), a romantic tale set in Hangzhou involving a female snake who attained human form and fell in love with a man. &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot;, by Pu Songling contains many stories of fox spirits, and other phenomena. Another example is &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot;, a collection of supernatural stories compiled during the Qing dynasty.

==== Literary genres ====
Certain genres of literature are notable for dealing with themes from mythology or tales of the supernatural; for example, the Zhiguai () literary genre that deals with strange (mostly supernatural) events and stories.

====India====
The literature of India contains material about Chinese mythology, due to the influence of textual sources imported into China, and translated into Chinese and the ideas widely adopted by Chinese people. This was primarily in regard to Buddhist texts, containing Buddhist mythology from the area in and around the area now known as India. Some Hindu material may have been more directly imported.

==Comparative mythology==
Many insights have developed through the examination of Chinese mythology as part of the field of comparative mythology, which is the comparison of myths from different cultures in order to identify shared themes, motifs, or other features. Early exponents of comparative mythology which are informative to the study of Chinese mythology include Georges Dumézil and James Frazer.

Ancient Chinese myths from various family and people groups survived for hundreds of years after they were first told and were integrated into Chinese Manichaeism.

==In popular culture==

Thousands of years of the development of Chinese mythology has resulted in Chinese mythology in popular culture, in the sense of popular culture affected or inspired by this tradition. This includes television shows, cinema, and video games. Also, many of the vehicles associated with the modern Chinese space program are named after mythology, such as the lunar explorer Chang&#x27;e 4 that achieved the first soft landing on the far side of the Moon, on 3 January 2019, and named after the lunar goddess Chang&#x27;e associated and with a communications relay satellite Queqiao, named after the lovers bridge over the Milky Way formed by magpies.

<text>Dymock is a village and civil parish in the Forest of Dean district of Gloucestershire, England, about four miles south of Ledbury. In 2014 the parish had an estimated population of 1,205.

Dymock is the origin of the Dymock Red, a cider apple, and Stinking Bishop cheese.

==History==
In the village of Dymock there are several interesting buildings which include cruck beam cottages; &quot;The White House&quot;, which was the birthplace of John Kyrle, the &quot;Man of Ross&quot;, in 1637; Ann Cam School of 1825 and St Mary&#x27;s Church, a patchwork history in brick and stone with Anglo-Norman origins, and is a Grade I listed building. Nearby stands the only remaining village pub, which was purchased by Parish Council to help preserve a thriving village. The pub is rented and run by a landlord and supported by a local fundraising and social committee &quot;Friends of the Beauchamp Arms&quot; (FOBA). A former pub, The Crown, closed in 1993.

Dymock was served by the Hereford &amp; Gloucester Canal, opened in 1845; this closed in 1881 and the section between Ledbury and Gloucester converted into a railway line, a branch line of the Great Western Railway, though a stretch between Dymock and Newent was by-passed as it was decided not to take the line through the 2,192 yard Oxenhall Tunnel. Dymock railway station was on this line which closed in 1959, but the canal (including the tunnel), is now being restored.

Dymock is the ancestral home of the Dymoke family who are the Royal Champions of England. It is thought that the Dymokes first lived at Knight&#x27;s Green, an area just outside the village of Dymock.

==Governance==
The village falls in the &#x27;Bromesberrow and Dymock&#x27; electoral ward. This ward starts in the north at &quot;Dymock&quot; and ends in the south at Kempley. The ward total population taken at the 2011 census was 1,901.

==Popular culture==
Dymock gave its name to a school of Romanesque sculpture first described in the book &quot;The Dymock School of Sculpture&quot; by Eric Gethyn-Jones (1979). The school is noted for its use of stepped volute capitals and its stylised &quot;tree of life&quot; motif on tympana. A lead tablet inscribed with an elaborate 17th-century curse against a woman called Sarah Ellis was found in a home in Wilton Place. It is preserved in Gloucester&#x27;s museum collection as &quot;The Dymock Curse&quot;.

It was the eponymous home of the Dymock poets from the period 1911–1914. The homes of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, Lascelles Abercrombie and the American-born Robert Frost can still be seen there. Dymock is renowned for its wild daffodils in the spring, and these were probably the inspiration for the line &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood&quot; in Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;, which was a gentle satire on his great friend, and fellow Dymock Poet, Edward Thomas. In 2011 the village featured on &quot;Countryfile&quot;, where the Dymock poets were looked into in more detail.

===Daffodil Way===
The Daffodil Way is a circular walk through the ′Golden Triangle&#x27;, best in late February and March when wild daffodil (&quot;Narcissus pseudonarcissus&quot;) are flowering in the fields around Dymock and Kempley.

<text>The Dymock poets were a literary group of the early 20th century who made their homes near the village of Dymock in Gloucestershire, in England, near to the border with Herefordshire.

==Significant figures and events==

The &#x27;Dymock Poets&#x27; are generally held to have comprised Robert Frost, Lascelles Abercrombie, Rupert Brooke, Edward Thomas, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson and John Drinkwater, some of whom lived near the village in the period between 1911 and 1914. Eleanor Farjeon, who was involved with Edward Thomas, also visited. The group published their own quarterly, titled &quot;New Numbers&quot;, containing poems such as Brooke&#x27;s &quot;The Soldier&quot;, published in 1915.

During the First World War Edward Thomas joined the army, on 19 July 1915, with the initial rank of private. After just two years, on 9 April 1917, he was promoted to second lieutenant but shortly after, at the age of thirty- eight, he was killed in the British offensive at Arras by the blast of a shell. The death of Thomas saw the break-up of the community.

Abercrombie, Brooke, Drinkwater and Gibson were poets who had contributed to &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; and were considered Georgian poets. The &#x27;Georgian&#x27; style, particularly its versification, fell out of favour in the 1920s and 1930s, but at the time was considered &#x27;advanced&#x27;, and a precursor of &#x27;modernism&#x27;. It used simple language and took as its subjects ordinary events and people. Abercrombie died in 1938 while Gibson lived on until 1962. Edward Marsh, the group&#x27;s artistic and literary patron, edited the five volumes of &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; which were published by Harold Monro.

Drinkwater had close connections with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre at the Old Rep in Station Street, which opened in 1913. He was its first manager, and wrote several plays for the company, mainly historical pieces and light comedies. Robert Frost, who became the most successful of the men, returned to America on 13 February 1915. During his career as a poet he received four Pulitzer Prizes and was honoured twice by the Senate. During the presidential inauguration of John F. Kennedy, Frost recited his poem &quot;The Gift Outright&quot;, the first time that a poet had been so honoured during an inauguration.

<text>Lascelles Abercrombie, (9 January 1881 – 27 October 1938) was a British poet and literary critic, one of the &quot;Dymock poets&quot;. After the First World War he worked as a professor of English literature in a number of English universities, writing principally on the theory of literature.

==Biography==
Abercrombie was born in Ashton upon Mersey, Sale, Cheshire. He was educated at Malvern College, and at Owens College, Manchester.

Before the First World War, he lived for a time at Dymock in Gloucestershire, part of a community of poets, including Robert Frost, and often visited by Rupert Brooke, and Edward Thomas. The Dymock poets were included among the &quot;Georgian poets&quot;, and Abercrombie&#x27;s poetry was included in four of the five volumes of Georgian Poetry (edited by Edward Marsh, 1912–1922). During the pre-War years, he earned his living reviewing books, and started his poetry writing. His first book, &quot;Interludes and Poems&quot; (1908), was followed by &quot;Mary and the Bramble&quot; (1910) and the play &quot;Deborah&quot;, and later by &quot;Emblems of Love&quot; (1912) and &quot;Speculative Dialogues&quot; (1913). His critical works include &quot;An Essay Towards a Theory of Art&quot; (1922), and &quot;Poetry, Its Music and Meaning&quot; (1932). &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1930) was followed by &quot;The Sale of St. Thomas&quot; (1930), a dramatic poem.

During World War I, he served as a munitions examiner, after which he was appointed to the first lectureship in poetry at the University of Liverpool. In 1922 he was appointed Professor of English at the University of Leeds in preference to J. R. R. Tolkien, with whom he shared, as author of &quot;The Epic&quot; (1914), a professional interest in heroic poetry. In 1929 he moved on to the University of London, and in 1935 to the prestigious Goldsmiths&#x27; Readership at the University of Oxford, where he was elected as a Fellow of Merton College. He wrote a series of works on the nature of poetry, including &quot;The Idea of Great Poetry&quot; (1925) and &quot;Romanticism&quot; (1926). He published several volumes of original verse, largely metaphysical poems in dramatic form, and a number of verse plays. Abercrombie also contributed to &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; and several of his verse plays appeared in &quot;New Numbers&quot; (1914). His poems and plays were collected in &#x27;Poems&#x27; (1930).

Lascelles Abercrombie suffered in his later years from serious diabetes, and died in London in 1938, aged 57.

At the end of the Second World War, it was discovered that, despite his death, Abercrombie&#x27;s name had been mistakenly included in &quot;The Black Book&quot; or &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot; list of Britons who were to be arrested in the event of a Nazi invasion of Britain.

===Family===
Abercrombie was the brother of architect and noted town planner Patrick Abercrombie. In 1909 he married Catherine Gwatkin (1881–1968) of Grange-over-Sands. They had 4 children, a daughter and three sons. Two of the sons achieved prominence, David Abercrombie as a phonetician and Michael Abercrombie as a cell biologist. The latter&#x27;s son Nicholas Abercrombie is a sociologist. A grandson, Jeffrey Cooper, produced an admirable bibliography of his grandfather, with brief but important notes, while a great-grandson is author Joe Abercrombie.

Arthur Ransome dedicated his second children&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;Swallowdale&quot; to Lascelles&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth. He was a close friend of her father, Lascelles, who was often his walking/hiking companion during the 1900/1910s. He had previously dedicated his 1909 anthology, &quot;The Book of Friendship&quot; to Lascelles Abercrombie.

==Poetry and plays==
Abercrombie&#x27;s poetry consists very largely of long poems in blank verse, mainly in dramatic form. They treat the extremes of imagined rather than actual experience, from ecstasy to anguish and malice, with little in between, in verse full of sharp, gem-like imagery and generally rugged in sound and metre. Admired for a time by good judges such as Charles Williams, Oliver Elton and Una Ellis-Fermor, and respected by his fellow &#x27;Georgian&#x27; poets, it was never popular, and by the 1930s no longer corresponded to what readers sought in modern verse.

His &#x27;Four Short Plays&#x27; of 1922 have fared better and still receive some attention, particularly &#x27;The Staircase&#x27;, because of their more realistic characters and setting. They compare favourably to the poetic plays of the other Georgian poets, such as John Drinkwater and John Masefield.

==Archives==
A collection of literary and other manuscripts relating to Abercrombie is held by Special Collections in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds. The collection contains drafts of many of Abercrombie&#x27;s own publications and literary material; lecture notes, including those of his own lectures and some notes taken from the lectures of others, and a printed order of service for his Memorial Service in 1938.

Special Collections in the Brotherton Library also holds correspondence relating to Lascelles Abercrombie and his family. Comprising 105 letters, the collection contains letters of condolence to Catherine and Ralph Abercrombie on the death of Lascelles, as well as Abercrombie family letters from various correspondents, chiefly to Ralph Abercrombie.

<text>John Drinkwater (1 June 1882 – 25 March 1937) was an English poet and dramatist. He was known before World War I as one of the Dymock poets, and his poetry was included in all five volumes of &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; (edited by Edward Marsh, 1912–1922). After World War I, he achieved fame as a playwright and became closely associated with Birmingham Repertory Theatre.

== Life and career ==
John Drinkwater was born in Leytonstone, Essex (now Greater London), to actor/author Albert Edwin Drinkwater (1851–1923) and Annie Beck (&quot;née&quot; Brown), and worked as an insurance clerk. In the period immediately before the First World War, he was one of the group of poets associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock, along with Rupert Brooke, Lascelles Abercrombie, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson and others.

In 1918, he had his first major success with his play &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. He followed it with others in a similar vein, including &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; and &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. In 1927, the George H. Doran Company published Drinkwater&#x27;s book &quot;Oliver Cromwell: A Character Study&quot;.

He had published poetry since &quot;The Death of Leander&quot; in 1906; the first volume of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 1923. He did also compile anthologies and wrote literary criticism (e.g. &quot;Swinburne: an estimate&quot; (1913)), and later became manager of Birmingham Repertory Theatre.

He married concert violinist Daisy Kennedy, the ex-wife of Benno Moiseiwitsch, in December 1924. Their daughter, Penny Drinkwater, went on to become a wine writer and member of the circle of wine writers.

John Drinkwater made recordings in Columbia Records&#x27; International Educational Society Lecture series. They include Lecture 10 – a lecture on &quot;The Speaking of Verse&quot; (four 78 rpm sides, Cat no. D 40018-40019), and Lecture 70 &quot;John Drinkwater reading his own poems&quot; (four 78 rpm sides, Cat no. D 40140-40141).

== Death and commemoration ==

John Drinkwater died in London in 1937 at the age of 54. He is buried at Piddington, Oxfordshire, where he had spent summer holidays as a child.

A road in Leytonstone, formerly a 1960s council estate, is named after John Drinkwater, as is a small development of modern houses in Piddington.

== Archives ==
Papers of John Drinkwater are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham. This includes a collection of photographs and photograph albums relating to Drinkwater. There are also some Drinkwater papers in the Ashley Library in the British Library and in Vestry House Museum in Walthamstow, as well as a large amount of correspondence held at Yale University.

<text>The Federal District ( ) is one of 27 federative units of Brazil. Located in the Center-West Region, it is the smallest Brazilian federal unit and the only one that has no municipalities, being divided into 35 administrative regions. The federal capital of Brazil, Brasília, which is also the seat of government of the Federal District, is located in its territory. The Federal District is almost completely surrounded by the state of Goiás, but it shares a small border with Minas Gerais.

==History==

From the first republican constitution there was already a device that foresaw the move of the federal capital from Rio de Janeiro, at that time in the former Federal District (1889–1960), to the interior of the country. In 1891 the Exploration Commission of the Central Highlands of Brazil was appointed, led by astronomer Luiz Cruls and composed of doctors, geologists and botanists, who made a study on topography, climate, geology, flora, fauna and other material resources of the region of the Central Highlands The area was known as Quadrilateral Cruls and was presented in 1894 to the Republican Government.

In 1922 a commission of the Federal Government established the location in Goiás, but the project was closed. Only in 1955, during a few elections, the then presidential candidate Juscelino Kubitschek said he would transfer the capital. Elected president, he established the construction of Brasília as a meta-synthesis of his &quot;Plano de Metas&quot;.

In 1956, after being elected to the presidency, JK, on his own initiative, sent a message to Congress proposing the creation of the New Capital Urbanization Company (Novacap). After the congress approved the project, in September of the same year, the president signed the law that created the company.

As a result, Novacap, a public company, was given the task of planning and executing the construction of the federal capital in the region delimited by General José Pessoa. After a public competition to select the city&#x27;s pilot plan, a judging committee chose the urban design by architect Lúcio Costa, which was unanimously approved by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. This also made the name Brasília official, as well as the choice of Oscar Niemeyer as architect and Joaquim Cardozo as structural engineer.

Construction began that same year, under the supervision of Oscar Niemeyer and Israel Pinheiro. The Bandeirante Nucleus was then formed, with candangos (workers who worked on the construction of Brasília, initially from Goiás, Minas Gerais and mainly the Northeast). Earthworks began in November 1956. Thirty thousand workers built Brasília in 41 months. Israel Pinheiro was appointed the first mayor of the Federal District on April 17, 1960, shortly before its inauguration on April 21, 1960, the date chosen by Juscelino Kubitschek in honor of Tiradentes.

The capital of Brazil was transferred from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília on 21 April 1960 and its new territory, split off from Goiás state on the border with the Minas Gerais state, became the current Federal District. After the transfer the old Federal District, containing the city of Rio de Janeiro, became the state of Guanabara. This state existed from 1960 until 1975, when it merged with the state of Rio de Janeiro. With the merger the capital of Rio de Janeiro state was transferred back from Niterói to Rio de Janeiro itself (as it had been until 1834 when the empire created the Neutral Municipality).

==Demographics==
According to the IBGE census of 2007, there were 2,393,000 people residing in the Federal District. The population density was .
* Urbanization: 94% (2006).
* Population growth: 2.8% (1991–2000).
* Houses: 697,000 (2006).

===Subdivisions===

The Federal District is subdivided into 35 administrative regions.

===Education===
====Educational institutions====
* Universidade de Brasília (UnB) (University of Brasília)
* Universidade Católica de Brasília (UCB) (Catholic University of Brasília)
* Centro Universitário de Brasília (UniCEUB)
* Centro Universitário do Distrito Federal (UniDF)
* Centro Universitário Euroamericano (UNIEURO)
* Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasília (IESB)
* Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde (ESCS)
* União Pioneira da Integração Social (UPIS)
* Universidade Paulista (UniP) (Paulista University)
* Federal Institute of Brasília (IFB)

==Geography==
The Federal District is located in the Brazilian Highlands, having an altitude between 600 and 1,100 meters above sea level, with its highest point being the Pico do Roncador, in Serra do Sobradinho. In area, the Federal District is more than double the size of Tokyo (Japan) or the island of Maui (Hawaii, United States). Comparing dry land areas, it is slightly larger than French Polynesia, the US State of Rhode Island, or Cape Verde. It is slightly smaller than Bali (Indonesia) or Trinidad and Tobago. The District is surrounded in almost its entirety by Goiás except for a short stretch along the Preto River with Minas Gerais. The District&#x27;s eastern boundary is marked by the aforementioned Preto River, an eventual tributary of the São Francisco, and its western boundary by the Descoberto, an eventual tributary of the Río de la Plata. The northern and southern boundaries are roughly straight lines.

===Climate===
The Federal District has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot; according to the Köppen system), with a rainy season from October to April, and a dry season from May to September. The altitude moderates temperatures, which throughout the year are very warm rather than uncomfortably hot: maxima range from throughout the year. During the dry season (winter), the humidity can reach very low level with dangerous fire risks, mainly during the peak hours of the hottest days. The artificial Paranoá Lake, with almost and of water, was built to minimize the severe drought and consequent flammability of the dry season in the cerrado region.

==Government and politics==

The politics and administration of the Federal District are distinguished from the other units of the federation in some particular points, as defined in the Brazilian Constitution of 1988:

* The Federal District is governed by an organic law, typical of municipalities, and not by a state constitution. It builds up the legislative powers reserved to states and municipalities, which are not forbidden by the Constitution.
* The hybrid character of the Federal District is observable by its Legislative Chamber, a mixture of Municipal Chamber and Legislative Assembly.
* The Legislative Power of the Federal District is exercised by the Legislative Chamber, with 24 elected district deputies; being that the head of the Executive Power is the governor.

The Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil, of a nature &quot;sui generis&quot;, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but a special entity that accumulates the legislative powers reserved to the states and the municipalities, as provided in art. 32, § 1º of the CF, which gives it a hybrid nature of state and municipality.

Article 32 of the 1988 Brazilian Constitution expressly prohibits the Federal District from being divided into municipalities, being considered one. The executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.

The legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature represents a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.

The judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories. Brazil does not have territories currently, therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.

Part of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais. By 2015, the forecast was of 12.4 billion Reais, with more than half (6.4% of the total) billion for public security expenditures.

==Tourism and recreation==

;The Parque da Cidade
Located in Brasília, the &quot;Parque da Cidade&quot; (&quot;City Park&quot;), officially the &quot;Parque da Cidade Sarah Kubitschek&quot;, is named after the wife of Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek, extends over four million square meters. It includes landscape works of Burle Marx, and wall tiles that decorate restrooms in the park designed by Athos Bulcão. Equipped with sports courts, a horse track, a racing kart track, skate tracks, playgrounds for children, bicycle tracks and trails for walks and jogging, the City Park attracts thousands of people everyday, specially on weekends. The park&#x27;s main entrance is located in the Monumental Axis South, but there are secondary exits that lead to other areas in the city&#x27;s south wing.

;The Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasília
Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, it was inaugurated in 1970. Its shape is circular horizontally and structured around 16 curved pillars, forming a crown filled with futuristic and/or spatial stained-glass works in a triangular shape. The pillars evoke reversed praying hands that deconstruct the gothic traditional church window pattern, but conserves the triangular vaginal shape of the stained-glasses. The curves present in many of Niemeyer&#x27;s works pay homage to the beautifully built bodies of Brazilian women.

The stained-glasses were designed by Marianne Peretti. Their disposition ensures natural lighting into the aisle, which was built below street level. Around the church, in the outside area, visitors can see Alfredo Ceschiatti&#x27;s sculptures — the four evangelists — and inside, suspended angels. There are also paintings by Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, representing the stages of the Passion of Christ, and paintings by Athos Bulcão. The cathedral is located in the Eixo Monumental mall, at the entry to the Esplanada dos Ministérios, or Ministries Sector.

;The &quot;Three Powers Square&quot;
&quot;Praça dos Três Poderes&quot; concentrates some of the most important and significant buildings in the work and career of Oscar Niemeyer — the Planalto Palace, headquarters of Brazilian Presidency; the National Congress, hosting the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate; and the Higher Courts of Justice. The Square also hosts: the &quot;Panteão da Pátria&quot; (Pantheon of the Fatherland), the Lúcio Costa Space and three important sculptures — &quot;Pombal&quot;, by Niemeyer; &quot;Justice&quot;, by Alfredo Ceschiatti; and &quot;Os Candangos&quot;, by Bruno Giorgi. In the central plaza, a giant Brazilian national flag is supported by a triangular black and high pole. It is located at the end of the Esplanada dos Ministérios.
==Infrastructure==
*Vehicles: 910,502 (March/2007)
*Mobile phones: 2.7 million (April/2007)
*Telephones: 884 thousand (April/2007)
*Cities: 31

==Economy==
In addition to being the political center, the Federal District is also an important economic center, being the seventh federal unit with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) in Brazil (171.2 billion reais - 2012) and the highest GDP per capita in the country, 64,653 reais (2012).

The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 92.5%, followed by the industrial sector at 7.1%. Agriculture represents 0.4% of GDP (2004). Federal District exports: soybean 77.1% and gold 16.4% (2002). The Federal District&#x27;s share of the Brazilian economy is 3.7% as of 2005.
==Transport==
===International Airport===

Brasília International Airport is the third largest in Brazil in terms of passenger movement. Because of its strategic location it is considered a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to have to wait in the holding pattern to land. Following the airport&#x27;s master plan, Infraero built a second runway in 2005. In 2003, the fourth phase of the passenger terminal expansion was completed. It raised its capacity to 7.4 million passengers a year. The third floor of the main building, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. There are a total of 136 shop spots at the Brasília Airport.

===Metro===

There is a rapid transit system, the Federal District Metro, serving some cities. It is operated by &quot;Companhia do Metropolitano do Distrito Federal&quot; (Metro Company of the Federal District) and was inaugurated in 2001. The system has 29 stations (24 in operation) on two lines, and operates from 06:00 to 23:30, Monday to Friday and from 07:00 to 19:00 on weekends. It serves the southern half of Brasília and the main cities to the west. Its main problem is the large distance between many of the stations caused by the low housing density for such a system. This makes it a small component in the Federal District transit system where a low-efficiency bus network is still predominant. Águas Claras is well served by the metro, making it one of the fastest growing areas and the most dense in the Federal District.
The non-operational stations include stations under construction and mothballed stations (complete and under construction) awaiting higher density.

==Sports==
The Federal District is home to two nationally-recognized football clubs: Brasiliense Futebol Clube (from Taguatinga) and Sociedade Esportiva do Gama (or simply Gama), both of which have played in the first division of the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the best result in their history being Brasiliense&#x27;s runner-up finish in the 2002 edition of the Copa do Brasil. The main soccer stadiums are the Estádio Nacional de Brasília Mané Garrincha, the Estádio Elmo Serejo Farias (Serejão) and the Estádio Walmir Campelo Bezerra (Bezerrão). The Edson Arantes do Nascimento Stadium (Pelezão) was the city&#x27;s first and main stadium at the time of its inauguration, but was abandoned and demolished in 2009.
The Federal District is a departing point for the practice of free flying sports, a sport that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports say that because of the district&#x27;s dry weather it offers strong thermal winds and great &quot;cloud-streets&quot; – which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners. The district hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship – one of the categories of free flying – in 2003. In August 2005, it hosted the 2nd stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.

Brasília was one of the six host cities for the 2013 Confederations Cup matches and one of the twelve for the 2014 World Cup, whose matches took place at the Mané Garrincha National Stadium in Brasília. The stadium is located in the Ayrton Senna Multisport Complex (formerly the Sports Sector), which also includes the Nilson Nelson Sports Gymnasium, which has hosted matches for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball teams and the 2008 Futsal World Cup.

In the Federal District, the city of Brasília is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race that was scheduled to occur at the circuit was cancelled at the last minute in 2015 due to financial problems. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023 by the state-owned Banco de Brasília.

==Flag==
The white background of the flag stands for peace, and gives the idea of infinity, or the vast Brazilian territory. The green and yellow colours in the middle refer to the most commonly used of the four colours of the national flag to represent Brazil. The four yellow arrows symbolize the native nations of Brazil, whereas their pointing into the four cardinal directions of the compass stands for the centralized emanating political power of Brasília, as the capital of the country. The yellow arrows also form a cross, which symbolizes both the Southern Cross, a constellation seen only in the Southern Hemisphere and the Roman Catholic or Christian symbol of redemption brought by Pedro Álvares Cabral and under whose shadow the first Mass in Brazil was celebrated in 1500 in Bahia. With their feathers, the arrows form a lozenge in the middle, a reference to yellow lozenge of the national flag, that stands for Brazil&#x27;s mineral riches.

The flag was created by the poet and herald Guilherme de Almeida, and was adopted by decree n.o 1090 on August 25, 1969.

==Voting rights==
The Federal District has eight seats in the Chamber of Deputies and three in the Federal Senate. Its population also votes its governor and district deputies (which function as both state deputies and aldermen in the municipalities), but not regional administrators, which are appointed by the governor itself, respecting the government centrality of the Federal District.

<text>A market town is a settlement most common in Europe that obtained by custom or royal charter, in the Middle Ages, a market right, which allowed it to host a regular market; this distinguished it from a village or city. In Britain, small rural towns with a hinterland of villages are still commonly called market towns, as sometimes reflected in their names (e.g. Downham Market, Market Rasen, or Market Drayton).

Modern markets are often in special halls, but this is a relatively recent development. Historically the markets were open-air, held in what is usually called (regardless of its actual shape) the market square or market place, sometimes centred on a market cross (mercat cross in Scotland). They were and are typically open one or two days a week. In the modern era, the rise of permanent retail establishments reduced the need for periodic markets. 

==History==
The primary purpose of a market town is the provision of goods and services to the surrounding locality. Although market towns were known in antiquity, their number increased rapidly from the 12th century. Market towns across Europe flourished with an improved economy, a more urbanised society and the widespread introduction of a cash-based economy. Domesday Book of 1086 lists 50 markets in England. Some 2,000 new markets were established between 1200 and 1349. The burgeoning of market towns occurred across Europe around the same time.

Initially, market towns most often grew up close to fortified places, such as castles or monasteries, not only to enjoy their protection, but also because large manorial households and monasteries generated demand for goods and services. Historians term these early market towns &quot;prescriptive market towns&quot; in that they may not have enjoyed any official sanction such as a charter, but were accorded market town status through custom and practice if they had been in existence prior to 1199. From an early stage, kings and administrators understood that a successful market town attracted people, generated revenue and would pay for the town&#x27;s defences. In around the 12th century, European kings began granting charters to villages allowing them to hold markets on specific days.

Framlingham in Suffolk is a notable example of a market situated near a fortified building. Additionally, markets were located where transport was easiest, such as at a crossroads or close to a river ford, for example, Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan. When local railway lines were first built, market towns were given priority to ease the transport of goods. For instance, in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, several market towns close together were designated to take advantage of the new trains. The designation of Halifax, Sowerby Bridge, Hebden Bridge, and Todmorden is an example of this.

A number of studies have pointed to the prevalence of the periodic market in medieval towns and rural areas due to the localised nature of the economy. The marketplace was the commonly accepted location for trade, social interaction, transfer of information and gossip. A broad range of retailers congregated in market towns – peddlers, retailers, hucksters, stallholders, merchants and other types of trader. Some were professional traders who occupied a local shopfront such as a bakery or alehouse, while others were casual traders who set up a stall or carried their wares around in baskets on market days. Market trade supplied for the needs of local consumers whether they were visitors or local residents.
Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of European market towns between the 13th and 15th century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Over time, permanent shops began opening daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets, while peddlers or itinerant sellers continued to fill in any gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and bartering systems were commonplace. Shops had higher overhead costs, but were able to offer regular trading hours and a relationship with customers and may have offered added value services, such as credit terms to reliable customers. The economy was characterised by local trading in which goods were traded across relatively short distances. Braudel reports that, in 1600, grain moved just ; cattle ; wool and woollen cloth . However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar – calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.

The importance of local markets began to decline in the mid-16th century. Permanent shops which provided more stable trading hours began to supplant the periodic market. In addition, the rise of a merchant class led to the import and exports of a broad range of goods, contributing to a reduced reliance on local produce. At the centre of this new global mercantile trade was Antwerp, which by the mid-16th century, was the largest market town in Europe.

A good number of local histories of individual market towns can be found. However, more general histories of the rise of market-towns across Europe are much more difficult to locate. Clark points out that while a good deal is known about the economic value of markets in local economies, the cultural role of market-towns has received scant scholarly attention.

== By country ==

=== Czech Republic ===
=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, the concept of the market town () emerged during the Iron Age. It is not known which was the first Danish market town, but Hedeby (part of modern-day Schleswig-Holstein) and Ribe were among the first. As of 1801, there were 74 market towns in Denmark (for a full list, see this table at Danish Wikipedia). The last town to gain market rights () was Skjern in 1958. At the municipal reform of 1970, market towns were merged with neighboring parishes, and the market towns lost their special status and privileges, though many still advertise themselves using the moniker of &quot;købstad&quot; and hold public markets on their historic market squares.
=== German-language area ===
The medieval right to hold markets () is reflected in the prefix &quot;Markt&quot; of the names of many towns in Austria and Germany, for example, Markt Berolzheim or Marktbergel. Other terms used for market towns were &quot;Flecken&quot; in northern Germany, or &quot;Freiheit&quot; and &quot;Wigbold&quot; in Westphalia.

Market rights were designated as long ago as during the Carolingian Empire. Around 800, Charlemagne granted the title of a market town to &quot;Esslingen am Neckar&quot;. Conrad created a number of market towns in Saxony throughout the 11th century and did much to develop peaceful markets by granting a special &#x27;peace&#x27; to merchants and a special and permanent &#x27;peace&#x27; to market-places. With the rise of the territories, the ability to designate market towns was passed to the princes and dukes, as the basis of German town law.

The local ordinance status of a market town (&quot;Marktgemeinde&quot; or &quot;Markt&quot;) is perpetuated through the law of Austria, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian province of South Tyrol. Nevertheless, the title has no further legal significance, as it does not grant any privileges.

===Hungary===
In Hungarian, the word for market town &quot;mezőváros&quot; means literally &quot;pasture town&quot; and implies that it was unfortified town: they were architecturally distinguishable from other towns by the lack of town walls. Most market towns were chartered in the 14th and 15th centuries and typically developed around 13th-century villages that had preceded them. A boom in the raising of livestock may have been a trigger for the upsurge in the number of market towns during that period.

Archaeological studies suggest that the ground plans of such market towns had multiple streets and could also emerge from a group of villages or an earlier urban settlement in decline, or be created as a new urban centre.

Frequently, they had limited privileges compared to free royal cities. Their long-lasting feudal subordination to landowners or the church is also a crucial difference. 

The successors of these settlements usually have a distinguishable townscape. The absence of fortification walls, sparsely populated agglomerations, and their tight bonds with agricultural life allowed these towns to remain more vertical compared to civitates. The street-level urban structure varies depending on the era from which various parts of the city originate. Market towns were characterized as a transition between a village and a city, without a unified, definite city core. A high level of urban planning only marks an era starting from the 17th-18th centuries. This dating is partially related to the modernization and resettlement waves after the liberation of Ottoman Hungary.

=== Iceland ===
While Iceland was under Danish rule, Danish merchants held a monopoly on trade with Iceland until 1786. With the abolishment of the trading monopoly, six market town (Icelandic &quot;kaupstaður&quot;) were founded around the country. All of them, except for Reykjavík, would lose their market rights in 1836. New market towns would be designated by acts from in the 19th and 20th century. In the latter half of the 20th century, the special rights granted to market towns mostly involved a greater autonomy in fiscal matters and control over town planning, schooling and social care. Unlike rural municipalities, the market towns were not considered part of the counties.

The last town to be granted market rights was Ólafsvík in 1983 and from that point there were 24 market towns until a municipal reform in 1986 essentially abolished the concept. Many of the existing market towns would continue to be named &quot;kaupstaður&quot; even after the term lost any administrative meaning.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, the medieval market town (Norwegian: &quot;kjøpstad&quot; and &quot;kaupstad&quot; from the Old Norse &quot;kaupstaðr&quot;) was a town which had been granted commerce privileges by the king or other authorities. The citizens in the town had a monopoly over the purchase and sale of wares, and operation of other businesses, both in the town and in the surrounding district.

Norway developed market towns at a much later period than other parts of Europe. The reasons for this late development are complex but include the sparse population, lack of urbanisation, no real manufacturing industries and no cash economy. The first market town was created in 11th century Norway, to encourage businesses to concentrate around specific towns. King Olaf established a market town at Bergen in the 11th century, and it soon became the residence of many wealthy families. Import and export was to be conducted only through market towns, to allow oversight of commerce and to simplify the imposition of excise taxes and customs duties. This practice served to encourage growth in areas which had strategic significance, providing a local economic base for the construction of fortifications and sufficient population to defend the area. It also served to restrict Hanseatic League merchants from trading in areas other than those designated.

Norway included a subordinate category to the market town, the &quot;small seaport&quot; (Norwegian &quot;lossested&quot; or &quot;ladested&quot;), which was a port or harbor with a monopoly to import and export goods and materials in both the port and a surrounding outlying district. Typically, these were locations for exporting timber, and importing grain and goods. Local farm goods and timber sales were all required to pass through merchants at either a small seaport or a market town prior to export. This encouraged local merchants to ensure trading went through them, which was so effective in limiting unsupervised sales (smuggling) that customs revenues increased from less than 30% of the total tax revenues in 1600 to more than 50% of the total taxes by 1700.

Norwegian &quot;market towns&quot; died out and were replaced by free markets during the 19th century. After 1952, both the &quot;small seaport&quot; and the &quot;market town&quot; were relegated to simple town status.

=== Poland ===

Miasteczko () was a historical type of urban settlement similar to a market town in the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the partitions of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th-century, these settlements became widespread in the Austrian, German and Russian Empires. The vast majority of &quot;miasteczkos&quot; had significant or even predominant Jewish populations; these are known in English under the Yiddish term &quot;shtetl&quot;. &quot;Miasteczkos&quot; had a special administrative status other than that of town or city.

=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===
==== England and Wales ====
From the time of the Norman conquest, the right to award a charter was generally seen to be a royal prerogative. However, the granting of charters was not systematically recorded until 1199. Once a &quot;charter&quot; was granted, it gave local lords the right to take tolls and also afforded the town some protection from rival markets. When a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.

Until about 1200, markets were often held on Sundays, the day when the community congregated in town to attend church. Some of the more ancient markets appear to have been held in churchyards. At the time of the Norman conquest, the majority of the population made their living through agriculture and livestock farming. Most lived on their farms, situated outside towns, and the town itself supported a relatively small population of permanent residents. Farmers and their families brought their surplus produce to informal markets held on the grounds of their church after worship. By the 13th century, however, a movement against Sunday markets gathered momentum, and the market gradually moved to a site in town&#x27;s centre and was held on a weekday. By the 15th century, towns were legally prohibited from holding markets in church-yards.


Archaeological evidence suggests that Colchester is England&#x27;s oldest recorded market town, dating to at least the time of the Roman occupation of Britain&#x27;s southern regions. Another ancient market town is Cirencester, which held a market in late Roman Britain. The term derived from markets and fairs first established in 13th century after the passage of Magna Carta, and the first laws towards a &quot;parlement&quot;. The Provisions of Oxford of 1258 were only possible because of the foundation of a town and university at a crossing-place on the River Thames up-river from Runnymede, where it formed an oxbow lake in the stream. Early patronage included Thomas Furnyvale, lord of Hallamshire, who established a Fair and Market in 1232. Travelers were able to meet and trade wares in relative safety for a week of &quot;fayres&quot; at a location inside the town walls. The reign of Henry III witnessed a spike in established market fairs. The defeat of de Montfort increased the sample testing of markets by Edward I the &quot;lawgiver&quot;, who summoned the Model Parliament in 1295 to perambulate the boundaries of forest and town.

Market towns grew up at centres of local activity and were an important feature of rural life and also became important centres of social life, as some place names suggest: Market Drayton, Market Harborough, Market Rasen, Market Deeping, Market Weighton, Chipping Norton, Chipping Ongar, and Chipping Sodbury &quot;chipping&quot; was derived from a Saxon verb meaning &quot;to buy&quot;. A major study carried out by the University of London found evidence for least 2,400 markets in English towns by 1516.

The English system of charters established that a new market town could not be created within a certain travelling distance of an existing one. This limit was usually a day&#x27;s worth of travelling (approximately ) to and from the market. If the travel time exceeded this standard, a new market town could be established in that locale. As a result of the limit, official market towns often petitioned the monarch to close down illegal markets in other towns. These distances are still law in England today. Other markets can be held, provided they are licensed by the holder of the Royal Charter, which tends currently to be the local town council. Failing that, the Crown can grant a licence.
As the number of charters granted increased, competition between market towns also increased. In response to competitive pressures, towns invested in a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors such as covered accommodation. By the thirteenth century, counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built market halls for the sale of cloth. Specific market towns cultivated a reputation for high quality local goods. For example, London&#x27;s Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as &quot;Bristol red&quot;, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses.

A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers&#x27; perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases.

As traditional market towns developed, they featured a wide main street or central market square. These provided room for people to set up stalls and booths on market days. Often the town erected a market cross in the centre of the town, to obtain God&#x27;s blessing on the trade. Notable examples of market crosses in England are the Chichester Cross, Malmesbury Market Cross and Devizes, Wiltshire. Market towns often featured a market hall, as well, with administrative or civic quarters on the upper floor, above a covered trading area. Market towns with smaller status include Minchinhampton, Nailsworth, and Painswick near Stroud, Gloucestershire.

A &quot;market town&quot; may or may not have rights concerning self-government that are usually the legal basis for defining a &quot;town&quot;. For instance, Newport, Shropshire, is in the borough of Telford and Wrekin but is separate from Telford. In England, towns with such rights are usually distinguished with the additional status of borough. It is generally accepted that, in these cases, when a town was granted a market, it gained the additional autonomy conferred to separate towns. Many of the early market towns have continued operations into recent times. For instance, Northampton market received its first charter in 1189 and markets are still held in the square to this day.

The National Market Traders Federation, situated in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, has around 32,000 members and close links with market traders&#x27; federations throughout Europe. According to the UK National Archives, there is no single register of modern entitlements to hold markets and fairs, although historical charters up to 1516 are listed in the &quot;Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales&quot;. William Stow&#x27;s 1722 &quot;Remarks on London&quot; includes &quot;A List of all the Market Towns in England and Wales; with the Days of the Week whereon kept&quot;.

==== Ireland ====
Market houses were a common feature across the island of Ireland. These often arcaded buildings performed marketplace functions, frequently with a community space on the upper floor. The oldest surviving structures date from the mid-17th century.

==== Scotland ====
In Scotland, borough markets were held weekly from an early stage. A King&#x27;s market was held at Roxburgh on a specific day from about the year 1171; a Thursday market was held at Glasgow, a Saturday market at Arbroath, and a Sunday market at Brechin.

In Scotland, market towns were often distinguished by their mercat cross: a place where the right to hold a regular market or fair was granted by a ruling authority (either royal, noble, or ecclesiastical). As in the rest of the UK, the area in which the cross was situated was almost always central: either in a square; or in a broad, main street. Towns which still have regular markets include: Inverurie, St Andrews, Selkirk, Wigtown, Kelso, and Cupar. Not all still possess their mercat cross (market cross).

== In art and literature ==
Dutch painters of Antwerp took great interest in market places and market towns as subject matter from the 16th century. Pieter Aertsen was known as the &quot;great painter of the market&quot; Painters&#x27; interest in markets was due, at least in part, to the changing nature of the market system at that time. With the rise of the merchant guilds, the public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the &quot;meerseniers&quot; which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the &quot;koopman,&quot; which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. Paintings of every day market scenes may have been an affectionate attempt to record familiar scenes and document a world that was in danger of being lost.
