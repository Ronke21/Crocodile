<text>Appomattox is a town in Appomattox County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,733 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Appomattox County.

Appomattox is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The town is named for the Appomattox River, which was named after the Appomattoc Native American tribe, one of the Algonquian-speaking Powhatan Confederacy, historically based in the coastal area and encountered by the English before the tribes of the Piedmont. The Appamatuck historically lived somewhat to the east of the present town, around the area of present-day Petersburg. At the time of European encounter, the area of Appomattox County above the Fall Line was part of the territory of the Manahoac tribe, who spoke a Siouan language. 
At the time of the Civil War, the present community of Appomattox was the site of a railroad depot, called Appomattox Station on the line between Petersburg and Lynchburg, a stop on the Southside Railroad. The station is three miles west of the restored historic village of Appomattox Court House, the site of Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865, which essentially ended the American Civil War. The area is preserved as Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and is administered by the National Park Service.

The town was first named &quot;Nebraska&quot; in 1855. In 1895 it was renamed &quot;West Appomattox&quot;. The first postmaster of &quot;Nebraska, Virginia&quot;, was Samuel D. McDearmon.

Near the end of the Civil War, Robert E. Lee made a last attempt to reach the depot, hoping to transport the Army of Northern Virginia south by railroad to meet Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s larger Army of Tennessee, then located in Greensboro, North Carolina. The arrival of Federal troops and their blocking Lee&#x27;s army from the depot led to Lee&#x27;s surrender in the home of Wilmer McLean, on April 9. Johnston later surrendered 98,270 Confederate troops (the largest surrender of the war) on April 26, 1865.

Today, each April, the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park commemorates this event with a luminary ceremony, wherein a lantern is lit for each of the 4,600 slaves freed in Appomattox County alone.

The railroad became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870. The inconvenience of the railroad&#x27;s location to the original Appomattox Court House in the village of Clover Hill led to the decline of the courthouse community. After fire destroyed the courthouse building in 1892, the county relocated the court to the depot area, which formally became the county seat in 1894. The railroad became a line in the Norfolk and Western Railway and then the Norfolk Southern Railway.

In 1990, there were 11,971 residents reported for Appomattox County; the Town of Appomattox had 1,703 residents.

In addition to Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, the Appomattox River Bridge, Appomattox Historic District, Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center, and Holliday Lake State Park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The 2010 Appomattox shootings occurred from January 17 to 20 and left eight people dead.

<text>Craigsville is a town in Augusta County, Virginia, United States. The population was 923 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Staunton–Waynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Craigsville School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The history of Craigsville can be traced back to 1721 when a Scotch-Irish couple, William and Jeanette Craig, Scottish immigrants, received a land grant from the government for the purpose of farming. They were the first settlers on the land, which eventually came to be named for them. The area grew, however remaining a farming community from 1721 to the 1850s.

Mr. &amp; Mrs. Craig raised a family which consisted of two (2) sons, Robert and James. Mr. Craig gave his sons the farm, dividing it equally between them. Robert inherited the eastern half while James inherited the western half.

More Recently:

Since incorporation in 1960, the Town has been able to supply water and sewer services to almost everyone in the Town and even some residents in the county. The water and sewer systems have been updated with the assistance from Community Development Block Grants. The Town operated the street lights which have been increased to over 100.

The early 1960s saw the advent of many changes to this community. The county school system moved the high school from Craigsville to Buffalo Gap. The elementary school later moved from its former location to the old high school building with the elementary school building no longer being used. The building has since been renovated and converted into apartments.

Many of the former stores such as the bakery, laundry mat, barber shop, drug store, theater and hotel have long since closed. However, there are still stores which provide almost any item desired or required by the Town residents.

The Lehigh Portland Cement Company closed in 1968 as well as the Craigsville division of the Stillwater Worsted Mill Industry. The building that was formerly Stillwater is currently used for storage.

On the positive side, the Augusta Correctional Center moved into Estaline Valley. The town supplies water services to the prison, which pays for the service on a monthly basis and offers many employment opportunities. However, the prison’s permanent closure was announced in December 2023 by the Virginia Department of Corrections. Craigsville’s economic livelihood is at stake; the town will lose key water revenue from the prison, and local businesses could also take a financial blow with fewer people coming into town.

==Geography==
Craigsville is located at (38.079439, −79.381224).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

==Transportation==
The only significant highway providing access to Craigsville is Virginia State Route 42. To the northeast, the road connects with U.S. Route 250 and, via Virginia State Route 254, Interstate 81 near Staunton. To the southwest, the road connects to Interstate 64.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 979 people, 413 households, and 272 families living in the town. The population density was 495.5 people per square mile (190.9/km2). There were 474 housing units at an average density of 239.9 per square mile (92.4/km2).

<text>Crimora is a census-designated place (CDP) in Augusta County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,209 at the 2010 census, a 23% increase from the 1,796 reported in 2000. It is part of the Staunton–Waynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Crimora is located at (38.160845, −78.839088).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2), all land.

==History==
What put Crimora on the map was the open-pit Crimora Manganese Mine that started in 1866. The mineral manganese was used in the production of steel. Mining at Crimora continued intermittently under a series of owners until March 1946. The Crimora deposit is about 500 feet wide, 200 feet deep, and half a mile long and consists of clay with scattered lumps of manganese ore. It lies under a layer of clay and quartz fragments about 15 feet thick. The Crimora deposit produced more manganese than any other single deposit in the United States and, at one time, the mining operations there were among the largest in the world.

The mines are located at the foothills of the mountains of the Shenandoah National Park. They are two miles east of Crimora Station on the Norfolk Southern Railway formerly known as the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Crimora Station was located at milepost 136.9 but the station is no longer there. The remains of the mine consist of three adjoining man-made lakes that range from 20 to 100 feet deep, with underwater shafts connecting multiple water sources around the Crimora area.

The Coiner House and Crimora School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==
Crimora is located roughly five miles north of Waynesboro on U.S. Route 340, known as Eastside Highway. It is a U.S primary and has locally been called &quot;The Bloody Highway&quot; because of the above average crash statistics for Augusta County. Route 340 was widened to a five-lane, unlimited access highway in 2002 in Crimora&#x27;s village center but it is only 0.6 mile in length. VDOT plans to eventually widen North 340 from Waynesboro to Grottoes.

==Points of interest==
Turk Mountain is the prominent landmark of Crimora and has a giant boulder on the north end of its summit. The boulder is accessible by foot from the Shenandoah National Park and The Appalachian Trail; the overlook has views of Crimora and surrounding areas. Turk Mountain lane is a collector road that has a terminus directly below the Turk Mountain overlook and is the southern limit of Crimora&#x27;s CDA (Community Development Area).90% of Crimora&#x27;s newest housing stock has sprung up near Turk mountain lane in Northwood and Vesper View Subdivisions. The final phase of Vesper view is not yet built.

Other landmarks include Davis Mountain and Wildcat ridge seen on the northern end of Crimora&#x27;s Sampson area. The Crimora Overlook is an automobile friendly pull off that lies directly on the Shenandoah National Park and can be seen above Wildcat ridge on a summit further east. The Crimora Community Center is a historic landmark that was built as a school in 1920. Around 2005 Augusta County built a town park beside the Community center on the banks of the South River.

A local landmark is the Purple Cow Drive-In, a former ice-cream stand currently unoccupied. The old Purple Cow sign—a cow head on a pole, painted in purple and white—still exists and led to the street name Purple Cow Road.

<text>Greenville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Augusta County, Virginia, United States. The population was 887 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Staunton–Waynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
As early as 1794, Greenville was platted and divided into 14 lots of and sold by Thomas and Jane Steele. Greenville soon became a very busy stagecoach stop. This was because there were 3 major roads all intersecting at or near Greenville. One road connected Greenville with Staunton, another ran from Waynesboro to Middlebrook, and the south road led to Midway (now Steeles Tavern), Fairfield, and Lexington. The town slowly grew, and by 1810, the population had grown to 162, comparing to Staunton&#x27;s 1225, and Waynesboro&#x27;s 250. An 1835 account of Greenville said that it had an extensive manufacturing flour mill and a woolen manufactory, two physicians in the area, contained 50 dwelling houses, 3 general stores, 2 taverns, 1 academy, 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 2 tailors, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 cabinet maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 saddle tree maker, 3 house carpenters, 1 hatter, and 4 boot and shoe makers. The population was about 250 in 1928.

<text>Stuarts Draft is a census-designated place (CDP) in Augusta County, Virginia, United States. It is part of the Staunton–Waynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area and adjacent to the South River. Its population was 12,142 as of the 2020 census.

Stuarts Draft has a history as an agricultural community, dating back to the 1730s. Today, the community also includes a processing and manufacturing cluster that includes Hershey, Hollister Incorporated, McKee Foods, NIBCO, Regal Rexnord, Ply Gem - Cornerstone, and a Target Corporation Distribution Center. As one writer notes, &quot;A visitor to Stuarts Draft can see these imposing plants with cattle grazing in a nearby field...&quot;

== History ==
Before the arrival of European settlers, the area was the territory of the Shawanee; none of their settlements are known to have existed in Stuarts Draft. Two non-residents tribes were frequent visitors to the area: the Delaware from the north and the Catawba from the south. When European settlers first moved into Augusta County in 1732, these three tribes were in the midst of a war. As a result, armed war parties were a common sight in the white settlements.

In 1736, William Beverly received a patent from Virginia&#x27;s Governor William Gooch for in what became Augusta County. At the time, this was the &quot;outermost limits of Virginia&quot;. Beverly sold parcels of land to settlers, including property that is now in Stuarts Draft. One settler was Archibald Stuart, a Scotch Presbyterian, who arrived in the area in 1738. Stuart settled about three miles east of Tinkling Spring Presbyterian Church which he helped found in 1744. This property became known as the Pratt Farm and is located on what is now U.S. 340 near Northgate Avenue. Other early settlers who purchased land from Beverly in what is now Stuarts Draft include Robert Alexander, James Bell, John Black, John Christian, John Colter, Samuel Davidson, William Long, Finley McClure, Joseph Mills, Robert Moffet, and James Patton.

These early settlers built houses and cleared the land for farming. The most successful crops were hemp, corn, wheat, and flax which was mixed with wool to make linsey-woolsey clothes. Farmers experimented with tobacco and cotton but found hemp the most successful cash crop, supplying raw material for naval rope. Robert Stuart operated a chopping mill in Stuarts Draft.

In 1749, Archibald Stuart&#x27;s son Thomas purchased a patent near the South River. The tract was bound by Robert Stuart&#x27;s patent to the north, Samuel Davidson&#x27;s patent to the south, John Black&#x27;s patent to the west, and James Patton&#x27;s patent to the east. There, Thomas lived with his wife Elizabeth (née Moore) and their nine children. The property had a small valley or cove, regionally called a draft.

There was fighting in Augusta County during the French and Indian War (1754–1763), smaller conflicts with Native Americans in 1764 and 1774, and minor skirmishes through 1794. When Thomas Stuart died, his sons were not living nearby, and his widow left the patent or land grant, making it available for resale. The Stuart property was purchased by John Harper in 1800, with some parts being owned by Joseph McComb and Jacob Farror at a later date.

Before 1800, the roads to Stuarts Draft were poor, limiting travel to horseback or sleds rather than wheeled wagons. The settlement did not have a post office until 1837. The first post office was in the former Thomas Stuart cabin, a hewed-pine log structure then on the Harper property. As a result, the name Stuarts Draft was chosen for the post office and the community. Later, the post office moved three miles west of town and was operated by postmaster James M. Hall.

In the 1850s, the Howardsville Turnpike was built through Stuarts Draft. Funded by stock as a commercial venture, the turnpike allowed Stuarts Drafts&#x27; farmers to take their wheat and other goods by horse-drawn wagons to the trading post in Howardsville, Virginia. The trip took a week but yielded trade goods such as flour, sugar, and other staples. Howardsville was located in Albemarle County on the James River; from there, trade goods went to Richmond by barge.

In 1856, Stuarts Draft&#x27;s first doctor arrived; James M. Watson was a graduate of the University of Virginia&#x27;s medical school in nearby Charlottesville. Watson traveled on horseback to visit patients. Other families moving to Stuarts Draft include Caldwell, Churchman, Forrer, Grass, Harnsberger, Hicks, Johnson, Kindig, Patterson, Prior, Van Lear, and Wilson.

During the Civil War, Stuarts Draft&#x27;s residents provided supplies and men to the Confederate Army. The community&#x27;s first school was established before the Civil War in Barterbrook, four miles from Stuarts Draft. This one-room schoolhouse was replaced by another schoolhouse behind today&#x27;s Finley Memorial Presbyterian Church in Stuarts Draft. The new school started with one room but later was expanded to five rooms as the number of students grew.

The post office moved back to town in 1881 when the Shenandoah Valley Railroad was under construction. The railroad began stopping in Stuarts Draft in 1882 and connected the town with Roanoke and Hagerstown. The railroad brought growth and prosperity to the farming community, making it one of the wealthiest sections of August County. A village or commercial area formed along the railroad track, expanding to about a mile south of the tracks. A train depot was constructed in 1891 (and demolished in 1975). By 1885, Charles H. Cohron opened C. H. Cohron&#x27;s Store alongside the tracks, while Fox&#x27;s Store was located on Howardsville Turnpike. In 1886, the J. B. McChesney Store opened beside the railroad. Cohron built the Stuarts Draft Mill along the railroad tracks in 1893, followed by a warehouse. In 1891, the Shenandoah Valley Railroad was purchased by the Norfolk and Western Railway, further expanding Stuart Draft&#x27;s reach.

George Samuel Etter opened his Etter Funeral Home in Stuarts Draft in 1895. Other businesses that opened in Stuarts Draft in 1895 include a barrel factory and a chair factory. Also in 1895, the Fishersville, Barterbrook, and Stuarts Draft Telephone Company was established. Its first telephones were operational in May 1897. In 1904, the Stuarts Draft post office included two delivery routes, serving 1,200 people. Stuarts Draft School was the first school in Augusta County to operate for a nine-month term in 1906. The Citizens Educational League raised funds to expand the school building and add a playground, library, and organ.

In 1907, the People&#x27;s Bank opened in Stuarts Draft and was operated by cashier S. H. Moore. In 1913, B. B. Kube opened a blacksmith shop in the Stuart Draft village area; he rebuilt his shop after the original structure burned in 1928. Dr. William Baldwin Dodge, a physician for railroad employees, became Stuart Draft&#x27;s doctor and a businessman. He opened the Dodge Inn on Main Street (now Draft Avenue), providing accommodations and packed lunches for travelers. Dodge also developed Mountain Lake, now called Shenandoah Acres, in the 1939s.

In the early 20th century, Stuarts Draft was a farming community specialized in livestock and fruit. In the 1920s, fruit production included apples, peaches, and pears. At that time, the average apple production from Stuarts Draft was 200 to 400 railroad car loads. Stuart Drafts&#x27; main apple producers were Alta Vista, Robert Black, Cisco Orchards, William Baldwin Dodge, George Harper, Samuel B. Harper, Charles I. Keyt, Linda Vista, and Virginia Valley—with each growing 1,000 to 6,000 barrels each annually. Dodge was the only large-scale grower of cranberries south of New Jersey, yielding 500 to 1,000 bushels a year. Cattle was the most common commercial livestock, although farmers in Stuarts Draft also raised hogs, sheep, and poultry. Most of the community&#x27;s households produced eggs. There was also a large incubator in Stuarts Draft that produced 50,000 to 75,000 eggs annually.

In the 1940s, a number ofGerman–speaking members of Old Order Amish moved to Stuart’s Draft from Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, Stuarts Draft entered the modern industrial era with the opening of Draftco and the J. K. Porter plant (now NIBCO). In the 1970s, other manufacturers moved to Stuarts Draft, including Hollister, Mastic Corporation/Alcoa (now PlyGem Industries), and P. T. Components (now Rexnord). This was followed by a Hershey Company plant and McKee Foods in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively.

Manufacturing significantly increased the population and development of Stuarts Draft. In 2017 and 2018, the community held a series of public meetings to create a Stuart Draft Small Area Plan. The process included elected officials and consultants. Spanning 2019 through 2039, the resulting plan addresses land use, development, and transportation needs. It also defines areas for urban development (business, industrial, public use, and residential) and agricultural and rural conservation.

=== Notes ===
== Geography ==
The Stuarts Draft CDP is located in southeast Augusta County on the northwest side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is located in the Shenandoah Valley, part of the valley belt of Silurian limestone. The area features a flat valley or cove, regionally called a draft. The soil is rich and fertile, well suited for agricultural purposes.

Stuarts Draft is eight miles south of Staunton and seven miles southwest of Waynesboro. According to the 2020 United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 29.31 square miles (75.9 km2). This is an increase from 2010 when the area was listed as being 19.82 acres. The CDP includes the Christians Creek and the South River watersheds and parts of the Beverley Manor, Riverheads, and the South River magisterial districts. The South River is a tributary of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. Major streams in Stuarts Draft include Barterbrook Branch, Cole&#x27;s Run, Deep Pond Run, Falling Rock Creek, Folly Mills Creek, Goose Creek, Johns Runs, Loves Run, Pine Run, and Stony Run.

The George Washington National Forest is at the southern border of Stuarts Draft. The forests consist primarily of oaks, including white, black, red, post, and chestnut oaks.

Stuarts Draft includes several natural and man-made ponds. Lake Wilda is Green Pond is a naturally occurring high-elevation pond on the Big Levels Ridge. It is five acres in size during the wet season. The Virginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries constructed the Maple Flats Ponds in the late 1950s to serve migrating waterfowl. However, this project failed because water levels were too low seasonally. These ponds are now stocked with bass, bluegill, and catfish for recreational use, There are naturally occurring sinkhole ponds near the Maple Flats Ponds, including Spring Pond and Twin Ponds that are home to a botanically significant range of plants.

Adjacent to the national forest, Shenandoah Acres includes a small spring-fed lake. Historically, the property included a cranberry bog, one of the sinkhole ponds in the Maple Flats area. The cranberry bog was well-known by botanists as a site for several rare plants and orchids, including the rose pogonia and grass pink orchids. In the journal &quot;Claytonia&quot;, the botanist Lloyd Carr described the pond as a sea of pink when the orchids were in bloom. However, the bog was destroyed to create Shenandoah Acres, and many of the rare species became locally extinct.

The Stuarts Draft CDP includes agricultural conservation areas and rural conservation areas. The Cowbane Natural Area Preserve includes 1 with calcareous spring marshes, mesic prairies, and wet prairies. These three landscapes were historically common in the area but were reduced over time by agriculture and development.

<text>Forest is a census-designated place (CDP) in eastern Bedford County, Virginia, United States. The population was 11,709 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Forest is located at (37.370723, −79.266801).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.89%, is water.

==Economy==
Forest is a suburban part of metropolitan Lynchburg, containing many subdivided properties carved from and around surrounding farms and woodlands. The Ivy Hill community is the largest development and is built around the Ivy Hill Golf Course. The community has been experiencing rapid growth and development over the past 20 years, especially after U.S. Route 221 (Forest Road) was widened to four lanes in 2009. The growth of commercial businesses and housing, which slowed during the Great Recession, is expected to continue into the near future.

Forest has no real town center since the original one was torn down without a trace, but the area along Forest Road from the post office to the Forest Library is generally regarded as the central part of the community; however, the community extends all the way along Forest Road from the middle school to Graves Mill Shopping Center. The political attitudes of the majority of the population are conservative. There are a few older homes along a loop behind the library and two churches that would have been in close proximity to the former Norfolk &amp; Western rail station, which was torn down in the late 2010s. This might have been considered the main stop for Forest prior to sub-urbanization and commercial development along Forest Road.

Liberty University&#x27;s Center for Engineering Research and Education (CERE) in the New London Business &amp; Technology Center park on U.S. Route 460 in New London is a small but increasingly significant engineering center developed with partnerships by private industry, regional governments, the Tobacco Commission, in addition to the University. Existing businesses in the park include Simplimatic Automation, NanoSeptic Technologies, and a 40,000 square foot shell building is available for sale or lease.

<text>Fincastle is a town in Botetourt County, Virginia, United States. The population was 755 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Botetourt County. It is part of the Roanoke metropolitan area.

==History==
The town of Fincastle was originally settled by Scotch-Irish and German immigrants from Pennsylvania who arrived in the region in the mid-18th century. John Miller erected a sawmill which became the nucleus of the early village of Fincastle. In 1770, Botetourt County was separated from Augusta County, and Miller&#x27;s home was selected as the meeting place for the court. Two years later, Israel Christian donated of land and laid out the streets and lots for the new town of Fincastle. The town&#x27;s name was selected to honor George, Lord Fincastle, the eldest son of Virginia&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, Lord Dunmore.

In 1773, the first log courthouse was built on the designated court square at the center of Fincastle. Around the same time, a brick church was constructed on land donated by Israel Christian to serve as the established (Anglican) house of worship for the town. The church closed after the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Virginia during the Revolutionary War and was later occupied by Presbyterians who rebuilt the structure to its present Greek Revival style. By the early-19th century, the village had grown into an important regional center of commerce, especially for the wool industry, aided by the construction of taverns, hotels, and shops. A second courthouse was erected in 1818 and replaced by a third, a larger brick structure of Greek Revival style in 1850. This courthouse continues to serve Botetourt County today, having been rebuilt after a disastrous fire in 1970.

The Bowyer-Holladay House, Breckinridge Mill, Fincastle Historic District, Greenfield, Hawthorne Hall, Prospect Hill, Santillane, Wheatland Manor, and Wiloma are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Alberta is a town in Brunswick County, Virginia, United States. The population was 302 at the 2020 census. It is home to the Christanna Campus of Southside Virginia Community College.

==History==
For much of the 20th century, Alberta marked the junction of two railroad mainlines. The Richmond, Petersburg and Carolina Railroad from Petersburg, Virginia to Ridgeway Junction (today Norlina, North Carolina) was completed in 1900, at which point it was merged into the Seaboard Air Line (SAL). By 1914, the population of Alberta was estimate by the railroad to be somewhere around 100. The Seaboard line (dubbed the &quot;S-line&quot; after later mergers) continued to operate into the 1980s, and today Alberta is along the abandoned portion of the CSX Norlina Subdivision. The Virginian Railway opened in 1907 from Norfolk to Victoria, Virginia, passing through Alberta (with through-service from the coalfields of Appalachia starting in 1909). The Virginian continued in use until it was gradually abandoned following a merger with Norfolk and Western in the later half of the 20th century.

Hobson&#x27;s Choice and Rocky Run Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137524" wikidata="Q1374023" url="?curid=137524" title="Lawrenceville, Virginia">
<text>Lawrenceville is a town in Brunswick County, Virginia, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,014. Located by the Meherrin River, it is the county seat of Brunswick County. In colonial times, Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood had a stockade built nearby, called Fort Christanna, where converted Native American allies were housed and educated.

Saint Paul&#x27;s College, a historically black college affiliated with the Episcopal Church, was founded here in 1888. It operated until 2013.

Lumber, tobacco, livestock, and other farm products are grown in the area. In a county along the southern border of the state, the town is near the northernmost area for cotton growing.

==History==
The first recorded foray by Anglo colonists into what is now Brunswick County occurred in 1650.

During the 17th and 18th colonial centuries, the county was developed for labor-intensive tobacco production. Later many planters converted to mixed farming, still relying mostly on enslaved Black workers. By the early 19th century, most enslaved African Americans had been born in the United States.

1700s

Explorers left Fort Henry (Petersburg) to follow the Occoneechee trail on an expedition for trading with the Indians to the south. By 1714 the area was known well enough that it was selected by Governor Alexander Spotswood as the site of Fort Christanna, which was largely a trading depot. Officials also ran a school for Indian children.

In 1720 the General Assembly passed an act for “erecting the Counties of Spotsylvania and Brunswick”, which directed “That five hundred pounds…be paid by the Treasurer to Nathaniel Harrison, esq., Jonathan Allen, Henry Harrison, and William Edwards, gentlemen… for a church, courthouse, prison, pillory and stocks, where they shall think fit.”

The first courthouse was constructed circa 1732 on a site near Cochran. Moved to the east in 1746, the county seat was moved again in 1783 to be established at the present site. A wood-frame courthouse, described by a visitor in 1835 as “a very handsome building”, was built in 1784. It has been replaced on this site by the Brunswick County Museum.

1800s

The Town was created officially by an act of the General Assembly on January 22, 1814. The act directed that twenty acres of land belonging to Peggy Williams be laid off into lots and be known as Lawrenceville. Legend has it that the name was inspired by a famous racehorse, Lawrence, owned by a prosperous landowner who had built a nearby racetrack at the end of the eighteenth century.

By 1836 the town was served by at least two stage routes, as noted on the &quot;Tourist&#x27;s Pocket Map of the State of Virginia&quot; published that year. One ran north and south between Petersburg, Virginia and Warrenton, North Carolina, daily. The other, ran east and west between Lawrenceville and Halifax Courthouse three times a week.

After the Civil War, southern businessmen invested in construction of railroads and factories. The coming of the railroad in 1890 gave an impetus for growth. The establishment of the Atlantic and Danville Railway shops in Lawrenceville provided the town with a significant industrial base.

With the resulting good economic times over the next four decades, mercantile buildings along Main and Hicks streets were transformed from one- and two-story wood-frame buildings into two- and three-story brick masonry buildings. Residential areas quickly developed to satisfy the demand for housing. In 1907 the population was described as about 2,000 “law-abiding and God-fearing people.&quot;

n 1846 the town was Idescribed thus: “It is a neat village, pleasantly situated on a branch of the Meherrin River, and contains 2 churches and about 25 dwellings.” St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal, constructed in 1829, continues to serve its parishioners as the oldest public building extant in Lawrenceville.

Richard H. Sharp gave land on Church Street in 1847 for the construction of the Lawrenceville Methodist Church. The original building was replaced by the present sanctuary in 1906.

The Greek Revival courthouse, which remains on Courthouse Square, was constructed in 1854 to succeed the late 18th-century structure. County court records were maintained on the first floor there until the completion of the adjacent Clerk&#x27;s Building in 1893. These two buildings are included in the Brunswick County Courthouse Square Historic District listed in 1974 on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Town of Lawrenceville was incorporated in 1874. Charles E. May later recalled the town of that era as “a very small village consisting of a courthouse, a few small stores, two blacksmith shops, a shoe maker’s shop and several dwellings.”

In 1888 James Solomon Russell, an Episcopal priest born into slavery in 1857, established a parish school for black children. By 1893 the school was incorporated and developed as Saint Paul&#x27;s Normal and Industrial School, a private school for Black students. Dr. Russell&#x27;s efforts had continued success.

The school was accredited as Saint Paul&#x27;s College in 1957; it has attracted students from around the globe. Three of the early buildings remaining on campus have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

20th century to present

A bond issue was passed in 1912 to fund the construction of a water filtration plant and distribution system, a gravity sewage system, and an electric generating plant. The newly organized volunteer fire department constructed a firehouse on Sharp Street adjacent to the then new 100,000-gallon elevated water tank.

The original fire alarm bell was moved to the grounds of the Municipal Building on Main Street in 1980. It rests next to an old road marker of 1819 inscribed “45 miles from the Brunswick Courthouse to Petersburg.”

Lawrenceville continued as the major market center for the rich agricultural areas of Brunswick County. The town had tobacco warehouses, cotton gins, creameries, and other facilities to process the important commodity crops of the area.

In 1924 the streets were paved with concrete. The sale of the electric generating plant in 1925 provided money to replace the wood plank sidewalks with concrete. During the depression years of the thirties, federal funds were used to build a baseball field and a swimming pool for the use of city youth.

In the late 20th century, the town began a Main Street beautification project which involves replacing downtown sidewalks with brick and installing new streetlights. The new Albertis S. Harrison, Jr., Courthouse housing Brunswick&#x27;s Circuit, General District, and Juvenile and Domestic Relations courts was dedicated on April 18, 1999. Documentation and field work has been completed for the Lawrenceville Historic District and the nomination was submitted in the fall of 1999 to the State Historic Preservation Office.

Downtown Lawrenceville is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district connects with the developing Tobacco Heritage Trail. This is part of the national rails to trails movement, in which public and private interests have redeveloped abandoned rail lines for trails. These amenities attracts horseback riders, bikers, joggers, wildlife enthusiasts, and hikers.

<doc id="137525" wikidata="Q1028061" url="?curid=137525" title="Grundy, Virginia">
<text>Grundy is a town in Buchanan County, Virginia, United States, an area located within the Appalachian Mountains region. It is the county seat of Buchanan County. The town is home to the Appalachian School of Law. The population was 875 at the 2020 census.

Legislation establishing Buchanan County in 1858 designated a plot of land at the confluence of the Levisa Fork River and Slate Creek as the seat of government for the county and directed the erection of the county courthouse on the plot, which marked the beginnings of what would be Grundy.

Although originally developed along the Levisa Fork River, which provided a transportation and power waterway, the town suffered from nine major floods since 1929 that have caused extensive damage, the last of which occurred in 1977. It is notable for having major businesses relocated in the 21st century to higher ground to prevent such damage in the future. A mountain opposite the historic town was blasted to provide a kind of plateau where much of the town was relocated and redeveloped. The federal project included construction of bridges and a flood wall, as well as the relocation of some roadways.

During the American Civil War, the town served as a stop-over for Union troops on their way to the Battle of Saltville.

==History==
The town, founded in 1858 upon the formation of Buchanan County, was named for Felix Grundy (1777–1840), United States Attorney General (1838–1839) and United States Senator from Tennessee (1839–1840). It was incorporated in 1876. The present courthouse dates from 1905 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. Since the late 19th century, this area depended on coal mining as the basis of its economy. The decline in mining resulted in a loss of jobs and population.

===Civil War events===
In October 1864, Union raiders under Brigadier General Stephen G. Burbridge passed through Grundy on their way to destroy the saltworks near Saltville in Smyth County. There they were met by Confederate troops commanded by Brigadier General Alfred E. Jackson at the Battle of Saltville. The Union troops were defeated in the battle, but returned later and succeeded in destroying the saltworks.

===Red Jacket Mine explosion===
On April 25, 1938, a catastrophic mine explosion happened in the Keen Mountain Coal Mine. 45 were killed and 3 injured. This is widely regarded as one of the worst mining disasters in Virginia&#x27;s history. The disaster was reported in the &quot;Charleston Gazette&quot;.

===Grundy Flood-Control Project===
Since 1929, Grundy has suffered nine major floods of the adjoining Levisa Fork River. After the inundation of April 4, 1977, many businesses did not reopen, and owners abandoned the buildings that housed them. In 1984 many businesses flooded again.

A 21st-century project to relocate much of the town to higher ground has been completed. The project started in 2001. The mountain on the other side of the Levisa Fork was blasted to create of relatively level land. After a few years of blasting, utilities were placed and new bridges were built across the river. A new town center on the west bank features a multi-level Walmart with a parking deck.

Buildings backing on the river have been demolished, and a new flood wall protects the county courthouse. U.S. Route 460 was relocated to the top of the flood wall. Businesses formerly located downtown were relocated to an industrial building located just outside town. State Route 83 will be rerouted to meet U.S. Route 460 down the street where U.S. Route 460 originally took a directional split to go through downtown Grundy. Additional work upriver is under study to reroute U.S. Route 460 inland from its current path.

===Base of a regional grocery store chain===
Grundy was the home of the predecessor to the Food City Stores, when Jack Smith opened a Piggly Wiggly franchise in 1955. The store was Smith&#x27;s first and the chain has now grown to 150 stores, primarily located in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee Georgia and Alabama. The chain is known for sponsoring the Food City 500 NASCAR race at Bristol Motor Speedway. The Grundy store remained open one day short of 50 years. It closed in November 2005. A new store opened up just outside the town limits in Vansant. The Grundy store was re-opened on June 29, 2011, as one of the KVAT Food City Stores. It is a Super Dollar Foods Center location.

===Education as a new sustaining industry===
Grundy is home to the Appalachian School of Law, which opened in 1997, and the Appalachian College of Pharmacy, which opened in 2005. Buchanan County chose Grundy as the site for the ASL to revitalize the town, which had been in a steady economic decline since the Flood of 1977. The ASL has generated $12 million for the local economy. Its presence has increased demand for construction of rental homes and stimulated the opening of additional businesses in the area. Additionally, ASL has successfully demonstrated the concept of creating institutions of higher education as an economic development tool.

This success contributed to the founding of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy, located in Oakwood. Like the Appalachian School of Law, it was created as part of a continuing economic redevelopment effort in the region. ACP is forecast to add $20 million per year to the local economy.

===Appalachian School of Law shooting===

On 16 January 2002, Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and 1L student Angela Dales were shot and killed on the campus of the Appalachian School of Law by student Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of Nigeria. Odighizuwa was found to be mentally competent at his trial. He pleaded guilty to the murders to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.

<doc id="137528" wikidata="Q1373836" url="?curid=137528" title="Altavista, Virginia">
<text>Altavista is an incorporated town in Campbell County, Virginia. The town is in the Lynchburg Metropolitan Area, and its population was 3,378 at the 2020 census. It was founded in 1907 by John Edward Lane and Henry L. Lane of the Lane Company, and was chartered in September 1912.

==History==

=== Colonial Period ===

==== Pre-colonial ====
Prior to the colonization of Virginia, the area around what would be Altavista was inhabited by the native Saponi people, in a tribal town that was called &quot;Sapon Town&quot;, near what is now the Staunton River. The Saponi cleared out large networks of paths through the forests to connect their villages, inadvertently enabling colonists to come through the area with ease. The more hostile Occaneechi people were also present in the area, and killed some of the first colonizers in the area. Cherokee and Iroquois people also came through the area.

===Founding===
In 1905, John and Henry Lane&#x27;s firm, The Lane Brothers Construction Company, had been awarded a contract to build 51 kilometers of railroad between Leesville and The Mansion for the Tidewater Railway Company, which was incorporated by William Nelson Page and Henry Huttleston Rogers. This railroad would also intersect the Southern Railway.

Recognizing the excellent location for a new town, the Lane Company bought 2000 acres of land around the intersection and started planning a town named Lane&#x27;s Siding. On September 9, 1907, the first settlers arrived to the town of Lane&#x27;s Siding in a small red caboose. A firsthand account of the early settlement of the town was written by Mrs. E. G. Fitzgerald:When I first came to Altavista there wasn&#x27;t hardly any body living there. There was the foundation to two stores. Then people began to come and build houses and stores. Then they built a hold and two depots. After awhile some people built a house and used it for a church. They used it for a school house too. Now there are about one thousand people here.Between July 1908 and May 1909 the town of Lane&#x27;s Siding which, after a hat toss in one of the company bungalows, was renamed to Altavista after the Lane family farm near Charlottesville, had grown rapidly, with a &quot;$100,000 machine shop, a $20,000 foundry and iron working plant, a $15,000 wood working plant, a $15,000 brick and tile making plant, a banking building and the home office of a $2,000,000 contracting and railway building company, a half dozen stores, a water works plant, an electrict lighting plant, a $30,000 hotel nearing completion, and about fifty residences&quot; all being built in under a year. 
In September 1912, the town of Altavista had been incorporated
==== Lane Home Furnishings ====
In March 1912, John Edward Lane had bought a small box company which had gone bankrupt in an auction for $500, and put his son Edward Hudson Lane in charge of the facility even though he had no experience in the field. Because of how uncertain this new venture was, it was simply incorporated as the Standard Red Cedar Chest Company.

During World War I, the company was contracted to build ammunition boxes for the military. To meet demand, an &quot;efficient assembly system&quot; was introduced at the factory. Although the war was a setback for the company, they were able to sustain itself with capital from the Peoples Bank of Charlottesville, and after the war, they enjoyed great success mass-producing cedar chests. In 1922, the company was renamed to The Lane Company. The company expanded to television cabinets, tables, bedroom furniture, and recliners throughout the mid-20th century.

The Lane Company was most famous for their Lane cedar chests made at the original plant in Altavista. In 1992, The Lane Company&#x27;s parent company, Furniture Brands International, filed for bankruptcy, and the Lane Company was slated for transfer abroad. In the summer of 2001, the last Lane Cedar Chest was manufactured, and the plant was shut down. The plant is now currently a brownfield, with some of the buildings being used by other companies. In 2006, a fire occurred in a vacant section of the plant.

<text>Brookneal is an incorporated town in Campbell County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,090 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

On January 14, 1802, &quot;Brooke Neal&quot; was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in Chapter 65 of the Acts of Assembly. It was named after John Brooke and his wife, Sarah (née Neal) Brooke, who established a tobacco warehouse which became known as &quot;Brooke&#x27;s Warehouse&quot;. It was located near the boat landing and ferry crossing on the Staunton River.

The &quot;Town of Brookneal&quot; was incorporated and a charter issued in 1908. Later to become the smallest incorporated town in the Central Virginia region, Brookneal served as the closest center of commerce for portions of Campbell, Charlotte, and Halifax counties. As transportation modes developed, Brookneal&#x27;s location offered proximity to waterways, roads and railroads.

From the earliest days of settlement of the area by Europeans in the Colony of Virginia, through the Revolutionary War era, and extending through most of the first half of the 19th century in Virginia, waterways were a major transportation resource for commerce. Roads were primitive and poorly maintained. Upstream from the fall line, which marked the western reaches of the coastal plain of Virginia (and adjacent areas of North Carolina), canals and other improvements were constructed to aid navigation upriver by batteaux and other watercraft. In the later 19th century, railroads supplanted river transportation in the Piedmont region east of the mountains.

Just south of Brookneal lies the Roanoke River (also known as the Staunton River), which flows east to its mouth at Plymouth, North Carolina, and the Atlantic Ocean via the sounds in eastern North Carolina. Through the efforts of the Roanoke Navigation Company, established with the assistance of both states in 1815, passage was made possible to as far west as Salem in Roanoke County. By 1828, boats were traversing of &quot;tolerable good and safe navigation&quot; of the Roanoke River between Brookneal and Salem.

Patrick Henry, the first Governor of Virginia after statehood, was an early advocate of the waterway. In 1794 he retired to the nearly 3,000-acre Red Hill Plantation, located near Brookneal in rural Charlotte County. (The plantation is now operated as a historic museum known as the Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial). He established a ferry on the Staunton River to connect Red Hill Plantation with Campbell and Halifax counties on the other side.

By the 1850s, the new technology of railroads was rapidly overtaking the canal systems in many areas; it provided access to additional places. In 1887 the construction of the Lynchburg and Durham Railroad began at Lynchburg, passing south through Brookneal. Just south of town, the railroad crossed the Staunton River into Halifax County. It was completed in 1892, and almost immediately was leased to the Norfolk and Western Railway, and merged into it in 1896. In 1904, the Tidewater Railway was formed by the industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, to transport bituminous coal from southern West Virginia to coal piers on the ice-free harbor of Hampton Roads. Planned by William Nelson Page of Campbell County, the right-of-way selected for favorable grades passed along the north bank of the river, crossing the L&amp;D track. In 1907, the Tidewater Railway was combined with the Deepwater Railway (initially a West Virginia short line railroad) to form the new Virginian Railway. By 1908, construction was nearing completion, and the new line officially began service on July 1, 1909. In 1959, the Virginia Railway was merged with the Norfolk and Western. Each later became part of the modern Norfolk Southern system in the early 1980s.

In the late 19th century, Brookneal became the site of textile mills that used the water power of the river. These were important to the Piedmont economy for decades. The town of Brookneal suffered a series of disasters in 1912, culminating in a fire that destroyed much of the town. When residents rebuilt, they constructed substantial brick houses to replace many of the old wooden structures. Soon, the small town resumed its growth.

Served for many years by passenger trains and freight service on both railroad lines, and later by U.S. Highway 501 and State Route 40, Brookneal developed a diverse economy with manufacturing, agriculture, service firms and retail offerings. The proximity to the river enhanced its recreational opportunities for residents and visitors as well.

Brookneal has suffered an economic downturn due largely to the dissolution of the Virginia Tobacco Co-Op, which made tobacco warehouses defunct, and the late-20th century decline of the American textile industry, which resulted in the closing of the Dan River mill in Brookneal. The Dan River textile mill employed nearly 400 workers.

Along with Red Hill, the Brookneal Historic District, Cat Rock Sluice of the Roanoke Navigation, Staunton Hill, and Westview are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137532" wikidata="Q1375212" url="?curid=137532" title="Bowling Green, Virginia">
<text>Bowling Green is an incorporated town in Caroline County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,111 at the 2010 census.

The county seat of Caroline County since 1803, Bowling Green is best known as the &quot;cradle of American horse racing&quot;, the home of the second-oldest Virginia Masonic Lodge, and the current location of the oldest continuously inhabited residence in Virginia.

==History==
The town of Bowling Green was earlier known as New Hope. One of the earliest stage roads in the colony ran through the area from Richmond to the Potomac River, where a ferry crossing was operated to Charles County, Maryland. One of the first stage lines in the United States to maintain a regular schedule operated along this road. New Hope Tavern was built along the road in the 18th century and the area around it became known as New Hope.

The town was renamed for &quot;The Bowling Green&quot; which was the plantation of town founder, Dache Carmine, who donated the land and funds for a new courthouse when the community became the county seat in 1803. The origin of the plantation&#x27;s name is not definitive but may be based on the green sward in front of the plantation house itself. The Bowling Green Estate was the site of one of the first tracks built to race horses in America. The plantation house, pre-Georgian tidewater colonial in style, was built circa 1741. A prominent colonial landmark, it is one of the oldest houses in original condition in Virginia and is listed on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places.

The present Caroline County Court House was built in 1835 and Bowling Green was incorporated as a town about 2 years later, in 1837. The town is best known as the &quot;cradle of American horse racing&quot; and as the home of the second-oldest Masonic Lodge in Virginia, Kilwinning Crosse, No. 2-237 .

The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (chartered in 1834) was built through nearby Milford (just west of town) and reached Fredericksburg by 1837. This important rail link between several major northern railroads at Washington, DC and other major southern railroads at Richmond was long partially owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and became part of CSX Transportation in the 1990s. It is a major freight railroad line for north–south traffic and the corridor also hosts many Amtrak trains. Although the closest Virginia Railway Express (VRE) commuter passenger rail service to Northern Virginia is currently accessed at Fredericksburg, future VRE extensions southward may include service at Milford which would be very convenient for Bowling Green and the surrounding area.

In 1855, a gazetteer described the town as having &quot;2 churches, 3 stores, 2 mills, and about 300 inhabitants&quot;.

Today, Bowling Green is located along Virginia State Route 2, one of the two earlier highways between Richmond and Fredericksburg. In later years, U.S. Route 301 was built through the area, connecting Richmond with Baltimore, Maryland with what was effectively an eastern bypass of the Washington, DC area for north–south traffic along the U.S. east coast. A new road, Virginia State Route 207 was established from Bowling Green west to Carmel Church, where it intersects Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1, major north–south highways. The musician Jason Manns is from Bowling Green.

In 1941, the United States government acquired of Caroline County to the north and east of Bowling Green and established the A.P. Hill Military Reservation. Now known as Fort Walker, it was originally named for a Virginia military hero, U.S. Army and later Confederate General Ambrose Powell Hill, who was killed just prior to the end of the War in 1865. The installation&#x27;s name was changed in 2023 to honor Mary Edwards Walker, an American abolitionist, prohibitionist, prisoner of war, and surgeon. She is the only woman to receive the Medal of Honor. At the massive complex, thousands of regular military and reserve troops undergo training each year. It has also been the site of national Jamboree gatherings of the Boy Scouts of America.

In addition to &quot;The Bowling Green,&quot; Auburn, the Bowling Green Historic District, Caroline County Courthouse, and Green Falls are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137533" wikidata="Q1373887" url="?curid=137533" title="Port Royal, Virginia">
<text>Port Royal is an incorporated town in Caroline County, Virginia, United States. The population was 126 at the 2010 census.

Port Royal was established in the mid-17th century in the Colony of Virginia primarily as a port at the head of the navigable reach of the Rappahannock River for export of tobacco, Virginia&#x27;s cash crop. The town developed along an early stage road, which brought passengers and freight for embarkation on ships at the river. It is near the crossroads of the busy modern highways of U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 301.

==History==
===17th century origins===
Port Royal is one of the area&#x27;s oldest colonial settlements. It was first established in 1652 by English colonists as a port at the head of sea-going navigation on the Rappahannock River. Waterways were the fastest and easiest method of transportation of people and property in the British colony of Virginia. It was an important point for export of tobacco, Virginia&#x27;s cash crop.

Local tradition holds that Port Royal was named after the Roy family. Dorothy Roy and her husband John owned a warehouse chartered by the crown, a ferry service across the Rappahannock River to King George County, and a tavern. In the 21st century, the chimneys of the Roy house are preserved landmarks in the town.

Port Royal was incorporated as a town in 1744. The &quot;town green&quot;, where the Town Hall and the firehouse stand today, was forever reserved &quot;for public and civic use&quot;.

===19th-20th centuries===
Shipping of property from the port began to decline after completion of competing railroads in Virginia, beginning in the 1830s. But the last scheduled passenger ship service ended in 1932, supplanted by highways. However, Port Royal was served by the new highways which became U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 301, with their crossroads at Port Royal.

Port Royal&#x27;s most notable claim to fame is that John Wilkes Booth was killed about two miles outside town by Sgt. Boston Corbett, part of a contingent of federal troops, at the now obsolete Garrett farmstead on April 26, 1865. Booth had assassinated United States President Abraham Lincoln on the night of April 14, 1865 at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, DC.

Booth initially escaped through southern Maryland, fleeing to Virginia across the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. He was cornered in a tobacco barn on the Garrett farm at sunrise. Shot through the neck and instantly paralyzed, Booth died on the porch of the Garrett house, where he was carried from the barn. David Herold, one of his accomplices, was with him and captured at the Garrett farm. He was tried, convicted, and hanged on July 7, 1865, in Washington, DC, along with other conspirators.

== Carroll County Courthouse shooting ==
On March 12, 1912, a gunfight broke out in the Carroll County Courthouse after the conviction of Floyd Allen, wealthy landowner and patriarch of the then-powerful Allen clan. The story made national headlines until it was eclipsed by the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; on April 12, 1912. Floyd Allen was on trial for illegal rescue of prisoners, assault and battery, and interfering with deputies. The charges stemmed from an altercation during which he freed his nephews—who had been arrested for brawling and disrupting a religious service, fled to North Carolina, but were recaptured and being taken to the Carroll county jail—and pistol-whipped a deputy sheriff with his own malfunctioning gun, leaving the officer unconscious.

Arrogant and short-tempered, Floyd had vowed he would never spend a day in jail. He had previously avoided jail time for other crimes, including killing a black man who was supposedly hunting on his property in North Carolina, nearly killing the successful purchaser of a farm he wanted, and even attempting to kill his own brother. Prosecutor William Foster (who had won his elective office by defeating another Allen clan member) received death threats but proceeded to trial beginning on March 12. However, the jury was deadlocked and therefore kept overnight in a local hotel. The next morning, after Floyd was convicted, Judge Thornton Massie refused to set aside the verdict (as had happened in an earlier case), and sentenced Floyd Allen to a year in jail and a $1000 fine, at which point Allen stood up and openly refused to go.

Gunfire erupted between lawmen and Floyd and several Allen family members present at the trial who came to his &quot;aid&quot;. Researchers continue to disagree as to who fired the first shot. An estimated fifty shots were exchanged before more than 100 witnesses; Judge Massie, prosecutor Foster, Sheriff Lewis Webb, and the jury foreman were shot dead, and a witness died of her wounds the following day. Floyd, his brother Sidna, the court clerk, a deputy, another juror and two spectators were wounded.

Floyd and his family initially escaped. Because Virginia law at the time said deputies&#x27; law enforcement powers depended on their sheriff being alive, the assistant court clerk S. Floyd Landreth telegraphed Governor William Hodges Mann, who sent deputies employed by the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency by train from Roanoke.

The wounded Floyd Allen and his son Victor had stayed in a Hillsville hotel overnight and were arrested the next morning. Other members of the Allen clan were soon captured. However, Sidna Allen and his cousin Wesley Edwards escaped, and were captured months later in Des Moines, Iowa.

For their parts in the fatal melee, Floyd and Claude Allen eventually received the death penalty, and were electrocuted in late March 1913. Victor Allen was later acquitted: Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle pardoned two Allen cousins in 1922, and Governor Harry F. Byrd pardoned Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards in 1926.

Its name means &quot;good air,&quot; reflecting its role as a resort getaway that wealthy Richmonders enjoyed for its fresh air as opposed to the dirty air of Richmond&#x27;s industrial downtown of the late 19th century.

==Definition and Boundaries==
&lt;mapframe text=&quot;Bon Air is bounded by Huguenot Road to the north and west, Powhite Pkwy and Chippenham Pkwy to the east, and Robious Road and Midlothian Turnpike to the South. &quot; width=425 height=300 zoom=12 latitude=37.52 longitude=-77.53/&gt;

Bon Air is located entirely within Chesterfield County, Virginia and mostly within the 23235 zip code. It is bounded to the north by Huguenot Road, to the east by the city of Richmond, to the south by Midlothian Turnpike, and to the southwest by Robious Road.

==History==
===Pre-resort settlement===

Prior to the advent of the 1877 resort in Bon Air, the area had some settlements. Brown Road and Belleau Drive each follow portions of the old Warwick Road that dates back to the 18th century Warwick plantation. The Bon Air area came to be known as Brown&#x27;s Summit, probably named for the Brown family farm which was located near the southwest corner of present-day intersection of Jahnke Road and Brown Road.

In the first half of the 18th century, Anderson Edwards owned a large plantation on the current site of Bon Air. He sold parts of it to Nathaniel and James Duval in 1840. The Duvals&#x27; two portions of Anderson Edwards&#x27; land would eventually comprise large parts of modern-day Bon Air.

The R&amp;D railway came through the area around 1850, connecting Manchester to Robious and the Coal Mines. An 1864 map shows a small cluster of buildings labeled &quot;Pawhite Stop&quot; on the &quot;Railroad to Coal Mines&quot; line near the site of historic Bon Air village. Another Civil War era map shows an area owned by &quot;Cogbill&quot; which is in the vicinity of the area near Buford Road near current day Bon Air Elementary School and Grand Summit subdivision. Early maps also lists a &quot;Powhite Station&quot; 1/2 mile east of Robiou&#x27;s Station.

===Bon Air: the resort era===
In the 19th century, it was believed that the higher elevation and distance from the urban area of Richmond provided a more healthful atmosphere, particularly in the hot summer months in central Virginia. With its nearby location and greater elevation, Bon Air offered these features nearby, and was founded as a summer resort town about outside of Richmond by railroad. One of the founders was Colonel Algernon S. Buford, of Chatham, Virginia, who is best known for his presidency of the Richmond and Danville Railroad during its massive postwar expansion, which ended in 1894 with the formation of the Southern Railway System (now part of Norfolk Southern). Bon Air&#x27;s connections with the railroad&#x27;s leaders could possibly be evidenced by the fact that over many of the years until passenger service ended in 1957, the community simultaneously had three stops within of trackage.

Colonel Buford was a graduate of the University of Virginia. He became a lawyer, and represented Pittsylvania County in the Virginia House of Delegates during 1853 and 1854. During the Civil War, Buford served the Confederacy in Richmond at Virginia Depot, although the title &quot;Colonel&quot; is believed to have been honorary, a southern custom common in the post-slavery years. With the support of Virginia Governor Francis H. Pierpont, on September 13, 1865, Buford became president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&amp;D).

Around 1875, Buford purchased portions of a large tract of land from Nathaniel and James Duval, a tract of land on the south side of the R&amp;D right-of-way known as the old Anderson Edwards plantation. He personally (as well as through the R&amp;D Railroad) helped in the development of Brown&#x27;s Summit, which was renamed Grand Summit, then Bon Air, after the French expression for &quot;good air&quot;. This choice may also have been related to the earlier settlement by French Huguenots, a group of religious refugees, slightly to the west. In 1877, Richmond jeweler Lewis G. Jahnke bought the other 153-acre portion of the Edwards estate from the Duval brothers and two years later sold this farm it to his brother A. Franz Jahnke Sr. This 350-acre estate, at 7737 Jahnke Road, would be known as Shady Echo. The Jahnke family, including jeweler Minnie Jahnke, were very involved in Bon Air life, from the fledgling Bon Air Presbyterian Church to the Bon Air Chautauqua Society founded by Reverend Hazen in 1885. 
In 1877, Buford was among the first investors and officers in the Bon Air Land and Improvement Company. Other R&amp;D officials involved in the development of Bon Air were General Thomas M. Logan, Andrew Talcott, and his son, Thomas Mann Randolph Talcott. In addition to these names, other early settlers contributed their names to the roads within the old Bon Air village. Col. Buford is honored by the naming of the thoroughfare Buford Road in Bon Air. Logan Street is named for General Logan. Polk Street is named for Bon Air resident Polk Miller, a pharmacist and highly acclaimed banjo player who founded what became Sergeant&#x27;s Pet Care Products while creating treatments for his favorite hunting dog, Sergeant. Other prominent residents included Dr. Hunter McGuire who was affiliated with the Medical College of Virginia and several other important hospitals and medical schools (and for whom McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center in Richmond was named), his wife Mary Stuart McGuire, and their 10 children, many of whom also went into the field of medicine.

In 1889, the tract (with an antebellum farmhouse which was earlier known as &quot;The Old Burton Place&quot;) was purchased by J.R.F. Burroughs, a Confederate civil war veteran from Lynchburg, (then in Campbell County), and his wife Lucy. A childless couple, a few years later the Burroughs opened an orphanage which was originally called &quot;The Home for Friendless Children&quot;, and was incorporated in 1898. Religiously devout, the couple never solicited for funds for the orphanage, but there are tales of the support they received anyway. When Mr. Burroughs died in 1915, he was buried at a site now surrounded by neighboring apartments, where his tombstone reads &quot;Faithful unto Death&quot;. Burroughs Street in Bon Air was named for the couple.

Rail continued to serve as the primary means of transportation to and from Bon Air until the automobile era. The original Southern Railway Station was a building brought to Bon Air from the International Cotton Exposition which had been held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1881. (This station was replaced in 1917, and portions of the original station were used in an old home on the south side of the tracks, still existent in 2005). Other early stops in the Bon Air area include &quot;The Steps&quot;, located on the north side of the tracks near the current Buford Road Bridge, a stop for the Bon Air Inn south of the Inn site on Burroughs Street, and a stop near the current subdivision of Woodmont for the Wherry Farm. This latter station was the only private station on this section of the railroad and was known as Lee Park. The early railroad alignment through Bon Air may have been to take advantage of a kaolin clay mine said to have been located on the south side of the tracks near the current Buford Road bridge. A plant built in Manchester to process the clay from Bon Air burned before it could go into production, ending the project.

===Village period===
In the 20th century, as the residential area around Richmond grew, Bon Air evolved into a middle-class neighborhood, occupied year round versus just being a summer resort.

The oldest lending Library in Chesterfield County was built in 1902 by the Bon Air Association as a Memorial to Dr. James K. Hazen, minister of Bon Air Presbyterian Church and a literary and educational leader of the community.

In 1911, the new Westham Bridge crossed the James River between Henrico County and Chesterfield County about upstream from Richmond. Built as a toll bridge, it was named for the nearby Westham Station of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1911. The privately owned Westham Bridge was financed by a group headed by developer George Craghead Gregory, who resided at Granite Hall, an estate about a mile from Williams Dam, where he had a mansion erected which was faced with stone quarried nearby. Gregory was also involved with plans to extend a streetcar line from an existing line at Westhampton Park (now the University of Richmond) to Bon Air, which he saw as becoming a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of Richmond. Between the James River and Bon Air, Gregory controlled large land areas along the proposed rail line which he hoped to develop. However, despite his plans, aside from grading of right-of-way all the way from the Westham Bridge to Bon Air, Gregory&#x27;s planned streetcar line did not materialize. This may have been due to weight issues at the Westham Bridge and/or right-of-way matters in Henrico County. However, portions of the planned and partially improved route can be seen in modern times with the gentle slopes found on present-day Southampton Road and along Mohawk Drive.

After Burroughs died in 1915, the Bethany Home was taken over by others, including Bon Air Presbyterian Church, until the home closed for good during the 1940s. Over a thousand children had known the farm as &quot;home&quot;, maintaining an average of 50 boys and girls at a time.

After 1933, State Route 147 was routed across the Westham Bridge. It connected River Road and Westham Parkway in Henrico with Southampton Road and the new Huguenot Road in Chesterfield. In 1950, the Westham Bridge, which had been subject to flooding and was inadequate for traffic in the growing suburban area, was replaced by the new Huguenot Memorial Bridge (named in honor of the French Huguenot settlers who came to the area in the eighteenth century to escape religious persecution in France).

The old bridge was dismantled, but the abutments were still visible at each end, and overhead power and telephone lines continued to mark the route for many years. Traces of the old streetcar right-of-way may be seen along gently sloped Southampton Road and Mohawk Drive near Forest Hill Avenue (which was formerly known as Granite Road), and on Logan Street and Hazen Street in Bon Air, where a washboard surface was long rumored by local lore to be the remnants of the streetcar project. Gregory&#x27;s old mansion, Granite Hall, now located in the Cherokee Estates subdivision near Williams Dam, was still in use as a private residence in 2008. The C&amp;O&#x27;s Westham Station was relocated to a Richmond city park at Robin Hood Road and Hermitage Road in 1961.

===1950s Suburban Development Boom ===
&lt;mapframe text=&quot;Suburbanization: As suburban development progressed to the southwest along US-60, VA-76, and VA-150, the Southside Plaza (A) became overshadowed by Cloverleaf Mall (B) in 1972 and further eclipsed by the Chesterfield Mall (C) in 1978. In 1988 the Powhite Parkway Extension opened, enabling fast travel from the Chippenham Parkway out to the new Virginia State Route 288. The Stony Point Fashion Park (D) was built in 2003. &quot; width=550 height=300 zoom=12 latitude=37.52 longitude=-77.53&gt;

By the mid-1950s, Bon Air experienced a suburban population boom. The Bon Air Shopping center was built at Buford and Forest Hill Ave, and subdivisions like Crestwood Farms, Highland Hills, Brighton Green, and Brookwood Estates welcomed new residents. The burgeoning population also resulted in infrastructure and civic amenities being built. The Highland Hills community consisted mainly of pre-fabricated, contemporary (now described as “mid-century modern”) homes designed by noted architect Charles M. Goodman for National Homes Corporation.

Bon Air&#x27;s elementary school was already in its second home, but most high school students had to travel to Manchester or Midlothian high schools. In the 1960s, a new high school and later a middle school were built by Chesterfield County Public Schools on part of the former Bethany home property. Huguenot High School opened on September 6, 1960. The first principal was G. H. (Gurney Holland) Reid, a longtime principal of Manchester High School, for whom G. H. Reid Elementary School in another section of the county had been named. A fourteen classroom addition was completed around 1964. G. H. Reid retired at the end of the 1968–69 school year, the last before the city annexed the land occupied by the school the following January 1. Also on the former Burroughs land, Fred D. Thompson Middle School, named for a long-time county educator, was completed in 1965, and was one of the first county schools feature central air conditioning.

The Southern Railway ended commuter service to Richmond in 1957, and the Bon Air station was dismantled.

In 1967 Chesterfield County began to operate the Hazen Library and moved the location in 1975, according to a plaque on the building.

===1970 Richmond-Chesterfield annexation===
A portion of what was then considered Bon Air was annexed by the City of Richmond in 1970. In the Bon Air area, Huguenot High School, Thompson Middle School, and J.B. Fisher Elementary School (named for a Midlothian-area physician) were among approximately a dozen schools, support buildings, and future school sites conveyed to the City of Richmond along with of territory as the result of a compromise negotiated during the annexation suit by the City of Richmond against Chesterfield County in the late 1960s. The annexation became effective January 1, 1970. The original Bon Air Elementary School and the newer building and Bon Air Primary School were allowed to remain in the county.

=== 1970s - present: Additional Suburbanization and Historic Preservation of Bon Air===
When Chippenham Parkway was built, construction severed the old Warwick Road route in the mid-1960s when it was built between present-day Jahnke Road and Midlothian Turnpike.

As Bon Air became increasingly suburbanized, Mary Anne Claflin published a 144-page book documenting Bon Air called &quot;Bon Air: A History&quot; in 1977, the Bon Air Historical Society was founded in 1978, and in 1988 the society assisted in generating an application for the Bon Air Historic District submitted to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1987, the traffic patterns changed when the Powhite Parkway Extension cut across southern Bon Air from Chippenham Parkway to Jahnke Road on Midlothian Turnpike. Further, when the Willey Bridge opened in 1988 near Bon Air, Southsiders had significantly improved ability to access the West End of Richmond. In 1985, the Stony Point Shopping Center opened, anchored by a Ukrops store. The 1990s, Arboretum and The Boulders office park developments popped up south of Bon Air, and the Shoppes at Bellgrade (northwest of Bon Air) opened in 1990. The Stony Point Fashion Park opened in 2004, which competed with other retail centers and malls (Chesterfield Town Center and Cloverleaf Mall) nearby to Bon Air.

==Bon Air in the 2000s==

While remnants of the 1916 village-era post office, 1902 Hazen Library, and Hotel Grounds (currently the Bon Air Community Association) still linger at the intersection of Rockaway and McRae Roads, current day &quot;Old Town&quot; Bon Air is generally not a tourism attraction. The privately owned and restored Hazen House Library contains artifacts from Bon Air&#x27;s history but is open only by appointment. While one can drive by numerous 1880s era houses on Buford Road that show an architectural style signature of the Bon Air resort era, these are all private dwellings that do not regularly offer access to the public. The &quot;historic&quot; bridge built over the railroad tracks by the Bon Air Historical Society enable one to look out over existing railroad tracks and see where &quot;the Steps&quot; once disembarked train visitors to the Bon Air Hotel, but most actual evidence of the train era in Bon Air has all but disappeared. The Bon Air Historical Society and Chesterfield County Parks and Recreation Department do offer infrequent tours of the resort era houses, and once a year, Bon Air residents and cultural institutions celebrate Bon Air&#x27;s resort era history by hosting a &quot;Victorian Days&quot; community parade and general celebration on the first weekend in May.

Bon Air is largely a residential bedroom community surrounded by suburban shopping centers. In some cases, these shopping centers house independent businesses (butchers, coffee shops, restaurants) that are spinoffs from downtown Richmond&#x27;s thriving independent business and restaurant scene. As families from the Fan District and other Richmond neighborhoods leave the city in search of a better school system and affordable housing, many settle in the inner suburb of Bon Air with 10-minute access to the city or the West End via the Powhite Parkway and/ or Chippenham Parkway.

==Geography==
Bon Air is located at (37.519947, −77.568768). The elevation is . The community is located in the Eastern Standard time zone.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.38%, is water.

Just west of the fall line, which divides Virginia&#x27;s Tidewater and Piedmont geological regions, the average elevation in the Bon Air area is approximately above sea-level, which is significantly higher than most of Richmond, only to the east. The two branches of Powhite Creek originate nearby, which flows into the James River just upstream from downtown Richmond.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 16,213 people, 6,308 households, and 4,459 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 1,834.1 people per square mile (708.1/km2). There were 6,502 housing units at an average density of 735.5/sq mi (284.0/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 86.91% White, 8.43% African American, 0.16% Native American, 2.53% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.85% from other races, and 1.10% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.73% of the population.

There were 6,308 households, out of which 32.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.6% were married couples living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.3% were non-families. 24.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 2.97.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 26.6% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.9 males.

==Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center==
An area just outside of the Bon Air CDP is also home two facilities of the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice: Central Admission and Placement Unit (CAP), and Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center. At CAP, juveniles from across the state are evaluated, processed and assigned to a unit at Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center.

=== Facilities ===
Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center consists of the minimum security wing, with several open cottages for offenders with lesser crimes and shorter stays. The Expansion is a Level 5 Maximum security wing for all types of offenders. The Expansion has 8 units on two different housing wings. It has three dedicated units for sex offenders, with the other four being regular wards and one for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

While incarcerated at Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center, residents receive mental health and rehabilitative counseling services. Specialized treatment programs include substance abuse, aggression management, sex offender, and intensive therapeutic programming. Academic and career readiness training are provided on campus. Residents are able to earn a high school or high school equivalency diploma.

=== Potential Closure ===
In the late 2010s, the Commonwealth of Virginia began a process of Juvenile Prison reform with expertise from the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The program involves closing youth prisons and using the savings to build and support more localized rehabilitative programs across the state. The Central Admission and Placement (CAP) unit was established upon the closure of the Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), BAJCC is the last of the state youth prisons, and in 2018 Governor Northam&#x27;s administration is attempting to close the state-owned 420-acre facility by building other regional facilities. This would eventually free the Bon Air property for development or conservation. the closure plan has been contingent upon identifying these smaller locations, but attempts to build a 60-bed facility in Chesapeake and near Isle of Wight County have met local resistance. In late March 2019, the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s negotiations with the Isle of Wight board of Supervisors over funding seemed to cast doubt on the plan to build in Isle of Wight. Soon after, Andrew K. Block Jr. (the architect of Virginia&#x27;s Juvenile Justice Reform initiative) announced he would be stepping down effective April 19 to be replaced by Valerie Boykin (previously deputy director of community programs at the juvenile justice department). On April 5, 2019, DJJ and Isle of Wight reached a provisional agreement to split funding of several costs that had held up the deal. The Isle of Wight Board of Supervisors was to take a final up/down vote on the measure April 18 on whether to transfer 20 acres of farmland to the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice in order to construct the $13.5 million facility. On Thursday April 18, the Isle of Wight Board of Supervisors voted 3–2 to reject the plan, leaving the closure of Bon Air in limbo. RISE for Youth, a Richmond-based advocacy organization, had also pushed heavily against the Isle of Wight project. as well as previous efforts to build a similar facility in Chesapeake, Virginia.

==Education==
The Chesterfield County Public Schools serving the area are Bon Air Elementary School, Crestwood Elementary School, Greenfield Elementary School, Robious Middle School and James River High School. The independent St. Michael&#x27;s Episcopal School, Riverside School Inc., St. Edward-Epiphany Catholic School, and Stony Point School are also located in Bon Air. Bon Air Elementary was the inspiration for a series of children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Kids of the Polk Street School&quot; by Patricia Reilly Giff.

The Richmond Japanese School (リッチモンド（VA）補習授業校 &quot;Ritchimondo Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a Japanese weekend supplementary school, is held at the Bon Air Baptist Church in Bon Air. It was established in 1988.

==Religious life==
Places of worship in Bon Air include Buford Road Baptist, Bon Air Presbyterian, St. Joseph Roman Catholic, St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church, Bon Air Baptist, Bon Air Christian, Bon Air United Methodist, St. Michael&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Stony Point Reformed Presbyterian, Unity of Bon Air, and the Islamic Center of Richmond.

<text>Ettrick is a census-designated place (CDP) in Chesterfield County, Virginia, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 7,241. The town is home to Virginia State University and the Petersburg Amtrak train station.

Most of Ettrick has a Petersburg mailing address, ZIP code 23803, although the community is not part of the city of Petersburg.

==History==
Ettrick was named around 1765 by the foreign merchant Neil Buchanan, who dubbed the eventual village Ettrick Banks for its similarities to his native Ettrick area of Selkirk, Scotland.

Capt. Christopher Newport led expeditions in this area. Near Petersburg, which developed as an industrial city, Ettrick also developed industry. It had cotton mills, as it was on the Fall Line and could use water power.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate Army established a large hospital here. In the late nineteenth century, the biracial state legislature established the first state-supported black college, founded here in 1882 as Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (now Virginia State University). John Mercer Langston, who founded the Law School at Howard University, was its first president. He was elected as a US Congressman from Virginia from here. Vawter Hall and Old President&#x27;s House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

One of the longstanding landmarks is Campbell&#x27;s Bridge, first built around 1810. It has been reconstructed several times and is the only direct thoroughfare from the village across the river into Petersburg.

==Ettrick today==
Currently there is an active Historical Society, gathering for many annual events including a &quot;Burns Night&quot;, which celebrates the life&#x27;s works of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. The evening includes a traditional dinner of haggis. Heritage Day is observed every second Saturday in April, complete with pipe and drums, food, clans, and Native American, Civil War, and pirate re-enactors.

<text>Matoaca is a census-designated place (CDP) in Chesterfield County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,725 at the 2020 census. It is named after the Pamunkey princess Matoaka who was better known by her nickname &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. It was near the site of an Appomattoc village Matoka or Matoks, which was reputedly her girlhood home, and the palace town of the &quot;weroansqua&quot; Oppussoquionuske.

In 2016 it was listed as No. 42 in CNN Money&#x27;s Top 50 Places to Live in the United States.

==History==
Olive Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The Appomattox River is a nearly 160-mile-long water source once used as a pathway for early colonists. Its name is derived from the Indian tribe that once inhabited its banks. Because the Appomattox runs into the James River, it was a crucial port in Virginia during the Civil War as it allowed for larger ships to dock when necessary. In the spring of 1865, after the town of Petersburg had been taken over and destroyed during the Appomattox Campaign, the Confederates attempted to slow the persecution by the Union Army by burning the high bridge that ran across the Appomattox River. Failing to do so, the Confederate Army was later forced to surrender at Appomattox Court House.

==Geography==
Matoaca is located at (37.228138, −77.470437).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.49%, is water.

<text>Berryville is an incorporated town in and the county seat of Clarke County, Virginia, United States. The population was 4,574 at the 2020 census, up from 4,185 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Berryville was founded at the intersection of the Winchester Turnpike and Charlestown Road. The land was first granted by the Crown to Captain Isaac Pennington in 1734, and George Washington surveyed it on October 23, 1750. In 1754, Pennington sold the land to Colonel John Hite.

According to legend, Daniel Morgan would engage in combat with young toughs at the intersection, having first piled large stones nearby to use as ammunition in case of need. Because of this story, and a rowdy tavern nearby, the area was first given the informal name of &quot;Battle Town&quot;.

Hite sold the tract in 1765 to his son-in-law, Major Charles Smith. Smith named his estate &quot;Battle Town&quot;, and on the site of the former tavern he built a clapboard homestead. This structure still stands on what is now Main Street and is now known as &quot;The Nook&quot;.

Daniel Morgan returned to the area after distinguishing himself in the Revolution, living at Saratoga, and briefly at Soldier&#x27;s Rest. He was one of the frequent (and reputedly most quarrelsome) patrons of the new tavern (where now stands the Battletown Inn).

Major Smith&#x27;s son, John Smith, in 1797 sold of his inheritance to Benjamin Berry and Sarah (Berry) Stribling, who divided it into lots for a town. It was established as the town of Berryville on January 15, 1798.

By 1810, the town had at least 25 homes, three stores, an apothecary (pharmacy), two taverns, and an academy (school). It was not much larger when it was designated as the county seat of newly formed Clarke County in 1836. An 1855 gazetteer described it as &quot;a small town&quot; that &quot;has some trade, and contains an academy and 1 or 2 churches.&quot;

In the Gettysburg Campaign, the town was used as an outpost supporting Winchester during Second Battle of Winchester. In 1864 General Jubal A. Early briefly had his headquarters in the town. Not long afterward the Battle of Berryville was fought in and around the town during the Valley Campaigns of 1864.

The railroad reached the town in the 1870s.

Virginia governor and U.S. senator Harry F. Byrd long resided in Berryville. A state senator in 1916, he built a log cabin named &quot;Westwood&quot; (a name he also gave his daughter) in Berryville at a family-owned orchard. The cabin was constructed from chestnut logs prior to the chestnut blight. In 1926, Byrd purchased Rosemont, an estate adjacent to his family&#x27;s apple orchards in Berryville. He moved there with his family after his term as governor ended in 1929.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 25.8% under the age of 18, 5.2% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $48,333, and the median income for a family was $52,000. Males had a median income of $35,179 versus $21,354 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,041. About 6.5% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.5% of those under age 18 and 16.7% of those age 65 or over.

== Town history ==

===Incorporation===
The town of Boyce was incorporated by the Circuit Court for the County of Clarke on November 28, 1910, with a recorded population of 312.

The first election for mayor and four councilmen was held on December 20, 1910, through which W. M. Gaunt was elected Mayor and George W. Garvin, M. O. Simpson, J. T. Sprint and Geo. B. Harrison were elected Councilmen; and the Council duly organized on December 24, 1910, and elected Geo. B. Harrison as Recorder.

===Railroad===

The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway passes through the center of the business portion of the town, which at the time of the building of the railroad in 1881 was dense woods. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway erected a large station in the town in 1912.

The Shenandoah Valley Railroad (known as the Norfolk and Western for many years, now known as the Norfolk Southern) was constructed in Clarke County in 1879. It started in Hagerstown, Maryland, and went south to Roanoke, Virginia. The railroad opened its route from Hagerstown to Berryville on October 1, 1879.

The town of Boyce, located southwest of Berryville, began in 1881 with the arrival of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Located at the railroad crossing with the Millwood Turnpike, Boyce remains much as it was in the early 20th century. The town was named after Colonel Upton L. Boyce, who lived at the nearby Tuleyries estate and who was very influential in persuading the railroad to pass through Clarke County.

Previous to the current railroad station, there was a much smaller one located on the same side of the tracks but right along the Millwood Turnpike. The railroad was apparently upgrading some of their railroad stations during the early 1910s and were going to replace the original station in Boyce. The new building was to be a small wooden one, and sit along the west side of the tracks at its intersection with the Millwood Turnpike. According to local tradition and some historical accounts, the citizens of Boyce (and neighboring Millwood) wanted a larger, more ornate building and also wanted it to be located on the east side of the tracks. They apparently raised money on their own and gave it to the Norfolk and Western to upgrade to a larger station.

A December 11, 1912, article in &quot;The Clarke Courier&quot; entitled &quot;New Depot for Boyce&quot; states:

&quot;The public spirit of the citizens of Boyce has again scored a victory. Some time ago the N &amp; W Railway Company announced that it would erect a new passenger station at Boyce.

&quot;The plans submitted by the railway company did not entirely suit the Boyce people, and they at once started a movement to secure a better piece of ground in order that a more pretentious station might be erected.

&quot;The old buildings have been removed from the Page-Manning lot, and work on a new and commodious passenger station, of concrete construction, will be started at once.

&quot;This is the spirit which builds cities.

&quot;The Boyce people are quick to go down in their pockets and contribute to any and every cause which will advance their town...&quot;

The train station was completed in late 1913. A November 26, 1913, article in &quot;The Clarke Courier&quot; states:

&quot;The new N &amp; W station, with fine concrete platforms, and promenade, long train shed, electric-lighted throughout, with all modern conveniences for the comfort of patrons, is a great addition to the town.&quot;

In a December 23, 1914, article in &quot;The Clarke Courier&quot;, entitled &quot;The Hustling Town of Boyce,&quot; the railroad station is described:

&quot;...water is now piped to the magnificent railroad station. The handsome railroad station of tile and concrete construction with its of train shed, and of concrete platform, with its of grounds and tracks, is a noble response by the officials of the railway to the requests of our people, and furnishes ample railroad facilities.&quot;

In 1913, George B. Harrison, a town councilman, wrote about Boyce and described the train station in the following manner:

&quot;The Norfolk and Western Railway in kind response to the request of the community has erected a magnificent station of latest design and material with spacious grounds and facilities, fully equipped and provided with electric light and water.&quot;

Undeniably, the Boyce train station is a surprisingly large building for a community the size of Boyce. It was much bigger than the Berryville (county seat) station, constructed at about the same time. The reason for such an elegant station can probably be attributed to the wealth of many of the local citizens around Boyce and Millwood. Early in the twentieth century, Clarke County experienced an influx of wealthy settlers from the west and north. They were drawn to the county because of the presence of fox hunting, cheap land, and good climate. Many purchased older homes and restored them. Horsebreeding and cattle raising became very popular. The local citizenry of Boyce and Millwood wanted a more elegant train station than what the N &amp; W initially proposed, and they wanted it larger because they were transporting thoroughbreds and cattle on it.

The Boyce Railroad Station is thus an example of a rare instance where the citizens of the community wanted a larger and more pretentious facility than what the railroad company was willing to provide, and helped to fund the construction of the building themselves.

It appears that the N&amp;W owned the building, although there is a metal sign on the central part of the station&#x27;s polygonal bay that identifies its location as &quot;H-461-A&quot; and one that says &quot;Not N&amp;W&quot;. According to oral tradition, this means that the N &amp; W did not own the building. However, when Mr. Kenneth Gilpin, Jr., purchased the building in the 1950s, he bought it from the Norfolk and Western. Since then the building has conveyed through several owners. The land on which the building sits, however, is still owned by the railway and is only leased to the owner of the building.

In recent years, several of the more substantial railroad stations on the Norfolk and Southern line in the Lower Shenandoah Valley have been demolished. The Boyce train station is thus one of a few surviving examples of a large and elegant station in this pan of Virginia. It is definitely the finest surviving one in Clarke County, as the Berryville station was demolished in the late 1980s. Not only is the Boyce train station a reminder of the influence of the railroad on this area, it is a testament to the hard work of the local citizens who partially paid for its construction.

===Facilities===
The main street of the town is piped with water, and the fire department is located at the intersection of Main Street and U.S. Route 340. In addition to the public well, the town owns an electric plant and a lot on the railway in the center of the town, and has added thereto an alternating current plant with ninety kilowatt dynamo, so as to meet any possible demand for light or power; a switch will bring the coal to the powerhouse.

===Churches===

In 1914, the town contained an Episcopal and a Methodist church, and a Baptist parsonage (the Episcopal church being electrically lighted); a brick high school with seven teachers and an enrollment of about two hundred scholars; a brick bank with a capital of $15,000; a hotel and two livery stables; one pinning mill and two lumber yards; two grain elevators; nine stores-one being a department store; a butcher shop; a harness shop; and a barber shop. Adjoining the town is a large cattle plant, and the town is a large stock-shipping station. Including the then-incorporated town of Millwood, the population of the two towns was computed to be about eight or nine hundred. However, the large stone Episcopal Church complex has recently been deconsecrated and is currently being renovated, congregants traveling to the nearby churches including Christ Chapel in Millwood. The Baptist and Methodist (consecrated 1916) churches remain active.

==Historic sites==
The Boyce Historic District, Blandy Experimental Farm Historic District, Greenway Historic District, Annefield, Huntingdon, Millwood Colored School, Saratoga—the home of Gen. Daniel Morgan—and Scaleby are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==
The primary highway serving Boyce is U.S. Route 340. US 340 is oriented northeast to southwest, generally parallel to Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11, which lie to the west. To the southwest, US 340 connects with U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 50. To the northeast, it connects with Virginia State Route 7 and West Virginia Route 9.

==Education==
A public elementary school (Boyce Elementary School) and a PK-8 private school (Powhatan School) are located in Boyce.

<text>Culpeper (formerly Culpeper Courthouse, earlier Fairfax) is an incorporated town located in Virginia, United States. The population was 20,062 at the 2020 census, up from 16,379 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Culpeper County.

==History==
After establishing Culpeper County, Virginia in 1748, the Virginia House of Burgesses voted to establish the Town of Fairfax on February 22, 1759. The name honored Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron
(1693–1781) who was proprietor of the Northern Neck peninsula, a vast domain north of the Rappahannock River; his territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia.

The original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper&#x27;s downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington, who at age 17 was a protege of the 6th Lord Fairfax. In 1795, the town received a U.S. Post Office under the name Culpeper Court House, although most maps continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names, coupled with the existence to the northeast of Fairfax Court House and Fairfax Station post offices in Fairfax County, was finally resolved when the Virginia General Assembly formally renamed the town as simply Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154).

During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-Independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper Courthouse. They organized in what was then known as &quot;Clayton&#x27;s Old Field,&quot; near today&#x27;s Yowell Meadow Park.

During the Civil War (1861-1865), Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union and Confederate forces occupying the town by turn. In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main Street (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where &quot;The Gallant Major&quot; John Pelham died after sustaining a wound at the Battle of Kelly&#x27;s Ford.

In 1974, the town had a Choral Society, an Odd Fellows Hall, and an American Legion Hall.

Culpeper began to grow dramatically in the 1980s, becoming a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of more densely populated Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. suburbs. A growing number of residents of the town and county of Culpeper once lived and continue to work in those areas.

In 2011, East Davis Street in downtown Culpeper was named as a 2011 America&#x27;s Great Place by the American Planning Association.

Downtown Culpeper was one of the communities most affected by the August 23, 2011 Virginia earthquake. Several buildings along Main Street and East Davis Street suffered structural damage, and some were later condemned. The earthquake led to the temporary evacuation of the Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation, which at the time was hosting a town hall event for U.S. Senator Mark Warner.

In 2014, the Museum of Culpeper History moved into the town&#x27;s historic train depot.

==Geography==
Culpeper is in the Piedmont region of Virginia, approximately 70 miles (113 km) southwest of Washington, D.C. and 50 miles (80 km) north of Richmond, Virginia. The town lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 29 and U.S. Route 15, two major highways that provide important access to central and northern Virginia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Culpeper has a total area of 6.3 square miles (16.3 km²), of which 6.2 square miles (16.1 km²) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km²), or 1.52%, is water.

===Climate===
Culpeper has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with very warm, humid summers and cool winters. Precipitation is abundant and well spread (although the summer months are usually wetter), with an annual average of .


==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the town was 61.5% White, 21.9% Black, 0.6% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, and 4.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.0% of the population.

The town&#x27;s population included 25.7% under the age of 18, 10.0% from 18 to 24, 30.3% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 15.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years.

<doc id="137555" wikidata="Q1374125" url="?curid=137555" title="Haysi, Virginia">
<text>Haysi ( ) is a town in Dickenson County, Virginia, United States. The population was 498 at the 2010 census, up from 186 at the 2000 census, over which time period the town&#x27;s area tripled.

==History==

Haysi is located at the confluence of Russell Prater Creek, the McClure River, and the Russell Fork river. The area where Haysi is located used to be known as &quot;The Mouth of McClure&quot;. As late as 1911, Haysi was only sparsely populated and was often referred to as a laurel bed.

The first store was constructed within the present town limits of Haysi by Paris Charles for workers of the Yellow Poplar Lumber Company. Haysi began to grow with the construction of the Clinchfield Railroad between 1912 and 1915 as stores sprang up to serve the railroad workers. The railroad was constructed to export natural resources such as timber and coal from the area, and thus later growth of the town centered on workers for the coal mines which began operating around 1916. However, businesses in the town also accommodated travelers, as the rail system was a popular form of transportation at the time, and Haysi was located on a line of the Clinchfield that linked eastern Kentucky with northeast Tennessee, western North Carolina, and South Carolina. Notable early businesses included the McClure Bottling Company, Inc. (established 1914) and the Haysi Supply Company (established 1916). By 1920 Haysi businesses included a hotel, bank, hardware store, and various other retail merchants. By 1930 Main Street was lined with businesses, and the town was incorporated on February 17, 1936.

Local folklore says that in the pioneer days, prior to the establishment of bridges, a ferry boat operator named Si (Silas) shuttled people across the water in that area. It is said that when one arrived at the river and found the ferry on the opposite bank, it was common to shout &quot;Hey Si!&quot; to capture his attention and request passage. Thus, the town which grew around the location of this ferry service became known as &quot;Haysi&quot;.

The myth concerning the town&#x27;s origins is popular and widely accepted among area residents, but local historians dispute this explanation. The name &quot;Haysi&quot; is said to have originated from a post office established at a general store owned by Charles M. Hayter and Otis L. Sifers (1878-1921). The owners chose &quot;Haysi&quot; as a blend of their own surnames when it was necessary to provide a name to the U.S. Post Office.

<text>McKenney is an incorporated town in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, United States. The population was 483 at the 2010 census.

==History==
McKenney is located along a former railroad mainline. The Richmond, Petersburg and Carolina Railroad, passing through McKenney from Petersburg, Virginia to Ridgeway Junction (today Norlina, North Carolina), was completed in 1900, at which point it was merged into the Seaboard Air Line (SAL). By 1914, the population of McKenney was estimated by the railroad to be about 300. 

This line (dubbed the &quot;S-line&quot; after later mergers) continued to operate until the 1980s and was then abandoned by the CSX Norlina Subdivision. Today McKenney is isolated by this abandonment.

<text>Tappahannock is the oldest town in Essex County, Virginia, United States. The population was 2,375 at the 2010 census, up from 2,068 at the 2000 census. Located on the Rappahannock River, Tappahannock is the county seat of Essex County. Its name comes from an Algonquian language word &quot;lappihanne&quot; (also noted as &quot;toppehannock&quot;), meaning &quot;Town on the rise and fall of water&quot; or &quot;where the tide ebbs and flows.&quot; The Rappahannock is a tidal estuary from above this point and downriver to its mouth on Chesapeake Bay.

In 1608 English explorer John Smith landed in Tappahannock and fought with the local Rappahannock people. After defeating them, he later made peace.

==History==
In the mid 1660s, Captain Richard Hobbs had rights to 800 acres south of Gilson&#x27;s Creek at the Rappahannock River. In 1680, Virginia law required warehouses to be established in port towns, and that year surveyor George Morris created a survey showing Hobbs His Hole Harbour. &quot;Hole&quot; refers to where a ship could drop anchor in a deep part of the water, and thus it was Capt. Hobbs who parked his ship &quot;Elizabeth and Mary&quot; here in the vicinity of present-day Tappahannock. This area became known as Hobbs Hole.

The settlement was platted for , divided into half-acre squares. The port was established at Hobbs Hole and called New Plymouth, later changed back to the Native American name Tappahannock. As part of the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730, public warehouses for inspection and exportation of tobacco, the colony&#x27;s commodity crop, were established at Hobbs Hole. Ocean-going ships could reach this port.

During the War of 1812, the town was seized by British naval forces under the command of Captain Robert Barrie on December 2, 1814. The British left the town two days later, after burning down the courthouse and two jails.

The Tappahannock Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the Tornado outbreak of February 23–24, 2016, the town was hit by an EF3 tornado on February 24, causing massive damage and injuring more than two dozen people.

On July 15, 2022, a fire destroyed many businesses along Prince Street as well as multiple homes in downtown Tappahannock, burning nearly half the town block. The cause of the fire, which started at the back of the Martin-Sale Furniture Company, remains unknown as of 2023. No deaths were reported aside from a pet cat belonging to one of the displaced residents. Since that time, the restaurant, furniture store, and art studio have been rebuilt and reopened.

In July 2023, Maltese Brewing Company 2 opened in Tappahannock as the town&#x27;s first brewery. Founded by owners who are firefighters, the brewery produces craft beer and is part of the local food and beverage industry.

In October 2023, 1710 Tavern opened in Tappahannock, Virginia, in a building originally constructed in 1710 that is considered the oldest tavern in the state. The historic structure retains many original features, including centuries-old floors, windows, ceilings, and fireplaces. Historically, the building served as an &quot;ordinary&quot;—a combination of a tavern and inn—where travelers could pay for food and lodging with money or trade tobacco. The structure predates the current road network in the area and functioned as a key stop along the main port. The upper floor originally contained three small rooms that accommodated up to five guests each, with doors locked overnight for security and an external ladder provided for emergency exit.

During its restoration, efforts were made to blend historic authenticity with modern updates. The project incorporated elements such as bar floors made from 150-year-old wood salvaged from a former hardware store in Warsaw, Virginia; seating constructed from 125-year-old church pews from Newport, Virginia; and a bar counter fashioned from 300-year-old walnut sourced from Oakalona in Occupacia, Virginia. The reopening of 1710 Tavern offers visitors an opportunity to experience aspects of Virginia’s colonial past alongside contemporary hospitality.

In August 2024, the first phase of Tappahannock Central Park was completed, establishing a 2-acre recreational area that includes three pickleball courts, a tennis court, a playground, and a splash pad. The second phase, scheduled to begin in 2025, will expand the park&#x27;s amenities with the addition of restrooms and entertainment areas.

<doc id="137558" wikidata="Q1375477" url="?curid=137558" title="Annandale, Virginia">
<text>Annandale () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia. The population of the CDP was 43,363 as of the 2020 United States Census. It is home to the oldest and largest branch of the Northern Virginia Community College system, and to one of the D.C. area&#x27;s Koreatowns.

==History==
When Europeans arrived in the 17th century, the area around Annandale, which became Fairfax County, was inhabited by an Algonquian-speaking sub-group called the &quot;Taux&quot;, also known as the Doeg or Dogue.

In 1685, an Englishman, Col. William H. Fitzhugh, purchased over 24,000 acres (37.5 square miles) of wilderness in the area and converted it into one of the largest tobacco plantations in Northern Virginia. It stretched from current day Fairfax City to Springfield and Falls Church and south to Pohick Church. Fitzhugh&#x27;s descendants later named it &quot;Ravensworth.&quot; For over six generations, the Fitzhugh family farmed at Ravensworth and slowly sold off portions of the land.

In 1830, the community of Annandale was named by a Scottish settler, after the town named Annan located at the mouth of the River Annan. Annandale followed nearby Dumfries to become the second place in Dumfriesshire to become the name of a settlement in Virginia. In 1806, the Little River Turnpike (now Virginia State Route 236) had been completed through the community, connecting it with Alexandria and Fairfax. In 1808, the Columbia Pike (now Virginia State Route 244) was built, connecting the District of Columbia with Little River Turnpike in what is now Annandale. The first businessman to locate in Annandale was William Garges, who built a blacksmith shop and a livery stable at the intersection of Columbia Pike, Little River Turnpike and Backlick Road, which would become the center of town. Garges became the first postmaster at the Annandale Post Office, which opened in 1837. Small farms and businesses grew up around the town and its first church, the Annandale Methodist Chapel, was built in 1846.

The American Civil War touched Annandale several times between 1861 and 1865. Union troops defending the vicinity of Washington, D.C., frequently took positions in and around the town. Confederate forces probing those defenses skirmished with them from time to time. The Methodist Chapel, which had fallen into disrepair during the war, was dismantled by Union troops to obtain construction materials in 1863.

After the war, farmers and businessmen returned to their pursuits and dairy farming began to grow in Fairfax County. Small communities continued to develop or grow near railroad stations and the dairy farms. Residents built stores, churches, and schools for their communities.

===20th century===
By 1925, Fairfax County contained more dairy farms than any other county in Virginia. In the 1930s and 1940s, work in the area for the federal government grew as President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented the New Deal and the United States entered World War II.

After World War II, growth continued, with housing developments in suburbs like Annandale accompanied by businesses, schools, and roads to support the new residents. The suburbs became “bedroom communities” with many residents commuting to work in Washington or surrounding small cities. That trend has continued to today with further growth and many residents now commuting to work in Northern Virginia as well as in and around Washington.

==Geography==
Annandale is located at (38.834134, −77.211277). Annandale is mostly traversed by the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) and Little River Turnpike (Virginia State Route 236). The center of town is considered to be where Little River Turnpike, Columbia Pike, and Backlick Road meet, around east of Interstate 495 on Little River Turnpike.

Annandale is bordered to the north by West Falls Church, to the east by Lake Barcroft and Lincolnia, to the south by North Springfield, and to the west by Wakefield and Woodburn. The CDP border follows Braddock Road to the south, Interstate 495 to the west, Holmes Run and Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50) to the north, and Sleepy Hollow Road, Columbia Pike, and Little River Turnpike to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. The area is part of the coastal plain located just east of the Fall Line separating the coastal plain of Virginia from the Piedmont. It is characterized by rolling hills, stream valleys, and heavy red clay soils.

The Annandale region is bisected by Accotink Creek, which in Colonial times was a primary link for ocean-going ships that would load tobacco and other goods where Little River Turnpike - Annandale&#x27;s oldest road and the first toll road in America - crosses it. With the construction of the Springfield Dam in 1918, Lake Accotink was created to serve as a water source for World War I-era Army Camp A.A. Humphreys (now named Fort Belvoir). In 1960, when the lake was no longer needed by the Army, the Fairfax County Park Authority leased the land and finally bought the site in 1965. Today, Lake Accotink is a popular recreation area with walking, hiking and biking trails, fishing and boat rentals.

Also along Accotink Creek runs the Gerry Connolly Cross County Trail which provides uninterrupted hiking, biking, running and cross-country skiing for in Annandale. The trail meanders through parks and forests filled with deer, fox, geese and numerous species of native birds. In the spring, Accotink Creek is stocked with trout, and fishermen are often seen wading in its waters.

===Koreatown===

Downtown Annandale is also referred to by some as Koreatown as there were roughly 929 South Korean-owned businesses as of 2006 and 67 South Korean-owned restaurants as of July 1, 2010, operating in the Washington Metropolitan Area, according to the GIANT Directory for South Korean-owned and Korean-American businesses. They were developed beginning in the 1990s by Korean immigrants to the region. The influx of Koreans to Northern Virginia and Annandale can be traced to the ease of commute into the District of Columbia for federal employees, the quality of its schools, and even the opening of an office of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority in Seoul. Most of the businesses and restaurants initially catered primarily to South Korean expatriates, but some had a diverse clientele from the beginning. In the past, county officials sought to make Annandale more diverse by encouraging Korean businesses to include English in their signs., Fairfax County is home to nearly 40,000 Koreans and is seen by many Washingtonians as a destination for karaoke, BBQ, and bingsu. There are now multiple generations of Korean-American businesses and restaurants in Annandale and they attract a broad demographic of customers.

In 2016, a contentious video posted onto YouTube in 2014 about Annandale, Virginia resurfaced and reached over a million views after the creator, named Angelo Mike, posted it onto Reddit himself. In the video, Mike claims that Annandale is a &quot;funnel for the dregs of society&quot; and points out its flaws with &quot;striking images of filth, ruin, and a dead rat&quot;.

<text>Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 24,749 at the 2020 census. Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads lies at the crossroads of State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) and State Route 244 (Columbia Pike).

==Etymology==
Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads draws its name from the Bailey family of circus fame, which has long been connected with the community. Hachaliah Bailey, one of America&#x27;s first circus showmen, resided here. 

In 1808, while still in New York state, he purchased an Indian elephant which was one of the first such animals to reach the United States. Seeking a place to winter his circus animals, he moved to Virginia, and on December 19, 1837, he bought a tract of land on the outskirts of Falls Church including what is now the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike. On this tract he built a large house known as &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Mansion&quot; or &quot;Moray&quot;. It was reputed to have contained 100 rooms. The mansion sat at a location now known as Durbin Place. It abutted Glenforest Drive, the oldest outlet road to Leesburg Pike.

Circuses were part of the Bailey family business. Hachaliah&#x27;s son Lewis Bailey (1795–1870) operated a travelling circus and pioneered the use of canvas circus tents before eventually settling in 1840 to farm land in Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads. Hachaliah&#x27;s nephew George F. Bailey managed several shows, too, designing a tank in which a hippopotamus could be moved from place to place. Another nephew, Fred Harrison Bailey, recognized a potential circus talent in James Anthony McGuiness, later James Anthony Bailey, who united the Cooper and Bailey operations with Phineas Taylor Barnum&#x27;s circus to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus, which later joined with the Ringling Brothers Circus to form the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.

Perhaps the first of the Northerners to settle permanently in Fairfax County to farm was Lewis Bailey, an upstate New Yorker and the son of Hachaliah Bailey, who followed his father south. 

In 1837, the elder Bailey bought hundreds of acres of Fairfax land, much of it on the outskirts of present-day Arlington County in the area now known as Bailey&#x27;s Cross Roads. Shortly afterward, Lewis Bailey bought of land from his father for ten dollars an acre. Included in the purchase was &quot;a good dwelling-house,&quot; but there were &quot;no other buildings of value, and little or no fence.&quot; The farm itself, he wrote later, consisted of &quot;cultivated worn-out lands, too poor to produce a crop of grass, or pay for cultivation without manure.&quot; Some of Bailey&#x27;s neighbors considered the farm the poorest in the vicinity. When he built his first small barn, twenty-four by thirty-six feet, they asked him if he &quot;ever expected to fill it.&quot; The question was scarcely a jest, for Bailey did not make enough hay the first year &quot;to winter two horses.&quot; Nevertheless, the purchase was a wise one. Within a decade Bailey had a fine herd of dairy cattle and had become one of the more prosperous farmers in the area. The Baileys were prominent members of the Dulin Methodist Church, and intermarried with many Falls Church people.

==History==
===19th century===

Hachaliah Bailey, the founder of one of America&#x27;s earliest circuses, which in time evolved into the Bailey component of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, moved to Northern Virginia in 1837, bought the land surrounding the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike in Fairfax County, Virginia, near Falls Church, Virginia, and gave Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads his name. The Crossroads then became the winter quarters for his circus.

====Civil War====

The opening months of the American Civil War proved to be a disruptive and unforgettable episode in the history of Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads. From the summer of 1861, when the area fell into an uncomfortable and poorly defined &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; between the borders of two warring countries, until late November of that year, when the area hosted a massive troop review, anything akin to normalcy was in short supply.

Virginia voted to secede from the Union on May 23, 1861. Fairfax County&#x27;s northern-born residents—many of whom were its most prominent and prosperous citizens—now felt very uncomfortable. Their southern neighbors looked upon them with suspicion. In July 1861 the Union Army met with catastrophic defeat during the First Battle of Manassas. The army retreated all the way to Washington, with the Confederate Army advancing quickly behind it. The Confederates occupied Falls Church and Munson&#x27;s Hill, overlooking Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads, and the crossroads&#x27; northern-born residents fled for the safety of Washington.

Once Confederates established themselves atop Munson&#x27;s Hill they built a crude fort there, and from these commanding heights turned Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads into a &quot;killing field&quot;. Southern sharpshooters killed numerous Union soldiers. Violence arose whenever Confederate and Union pickets, or scouts, engaged one another in firefights. It was now impossible to walk the Leesburg Pike without being shot and killed.

There was a minor engagement between the sides on September 3, 1861, with the Union suffering eight casualties and the Confederates none.

Official reports on the &#x27;War of the Rebellion&#x27; indicate that during August 28–30, 1861 a series of skirmishes took place at a location scrawled as &quot;Balley&#x27;s Cross Roads&quot;.

The local balance of power changed completely—and to everyone&#x27;s surprise—on September 28, 1861, as the Confederate Army silently withdrew its forces from Munson&#x27;s Hill, Upton&#x27;s Hill and Falls Church to Manassas, which they fortified. Munson&#x27;s Hill and Falls Church were located too far afield of reliable supply lines, and a concerted Union pincer movement could possibly choke off supplies, the Southern command believed. At Manassas they were adjacent to Virginia&#x27;s interior, and had good railroad and road connections to it.

After Confederate withdrawal the area quickly was reoccupied by Union troops. A significant troop review took place at Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads on November 20, 1861. Thousands of Union troops marched in formation and paraded before President Abraham Lincoln, the northern press, and many onlookers from Washington. Army commanders selected Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads as the site because of its nature as a large, unbroken plain. In order to prepare it for the day&#x27;s activities the army merely needed to remove the split-rail fencing separating farms and fields.

Contemporary local historians have confused this review with another, smaller review held on nearby Upton&#x27;s Hill, where events spurred the composition and publication of the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;.

===20th century===

After the Civil War Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads returned to its pastoral pre-war pursuits. The area remained a rural farming community until the post-World War II years, when a massive wave of development occurred. Leesburg Pike is now a commercial corridor, with apartments and homes to its north and south. A strip shopping center called Culmore, in particular, has lent its name to the apartment development behind it, which is now home to several thousand Latino immigrants. &quot;Culmore&quot; is now an established place name within Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads. Close behind Culmore is Lake Barcroft, whose shore is lined with upscale middle-class homes.

During the 1960s, as Washington&#x27;s Metro system was being conceived, original plans called for a subway line to extend under Columbia Pike to and through Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads. As a result of the plan a massive highrise complex was built on the former Washington-Virginia Airport in the heart of Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads called Skyline City. Its location coincided with the planned locations of Metro stations. Plans for the Metro, however, changed. The western line was placed along the I-66 corridor instead.

==Geography==
Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads is located at (38.849474, -77.129093).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.3 km2), all of it land. The area occupies a broad, flat plain, bounded on the west by Munson&#x27;s Hill. This unbroken expanse of level ground caused the Union Army to select it as the site of a massive review of troops during the Civil War. The review, which took place on November 20, 1861, involved thousands of troops marching in formation and parading before President Abraham Lincoln.

Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads is formed by the junction of State Route 7 connecting Alexandria, Virginia with the Shenandoah Valley and State Route 244 (Columbia Pike) connecting the Pentagon and Washington, D.C., with Annandale, Virginia. The most noticeable landmark at Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads is Skyline Center, a towering group of 26-story apartment buildings and offices built in the 1970s. A branch of Northern Virginia Community College, and offices of the U.S. Department of Defense are nearby. The neighborhood has a large Hispanic population. The largest single store of the entire Giant Food supermarket chain is also there. While the closest Metrorail station is a few miles away, Metrobus service on the Columbia Pike corridor has recently been improved.

The precise extent of Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads has never been defined. As an unincorporated community without local government, it has never had the purview to do so. The United States Census Bureau observes one definition; and various parts of the Fairfax County government observe others. Economic development plans tend to include just the commercial corridors and associated areas. Current discussions among the Fairfax County government for revitalizing Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads economically concern themselves with the Fairfax County border on the north and east—which generally includes all commercial and residential properties generally considered as belonging to the neighborhood—as well as Seminary Road and Carlin Spring Road. The plans include a narrow strip along Leesburg Pike to Glen Carlyn Road.

As a general neighborhood, however, with all facets of life included, the geographic extent of Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads must be considered to be larger. It abuts the clearly established Lake Barcroft neighborhood on the southwest, with Blair Road, Beachway Drive, Nevius Street and Mansfield Road marking its western proximity. North of Leesburg Pike its extent is generally defined by Glen Carlyn and Carlin Springs roads.

== Governance ==
Fairfax County Public Schools operates public schools. Glen Forest Elementary School is the primary school attended by most children living in the area, and the local schools feed Justice High School.
Fairfax County Public Library operates the Culmore Community Library in the Culmore area. It has Spanish-language materials in addition to English-language ones.

A United States Post Office, located in Culmore, serves the Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads ZIP code of 22041. Although, the United States Postal Service uses &quot;Falls Church&quot; as the primary name of the ZIP code, mail can also be addressed using &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads&quot;, as many businesses and residents do to prevent confusion with services, deliveries, customers and guests. The State of Virginia and Fairfax County, Virginia recognize &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads&quot; as a valid address for official documents such as property deed, vehicle registration, drivers license and other business.

In 2010, the Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads Volunteer Fire Department turned the land, the firehouse, and most of the equipment of Fire Station 10 over to the Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Department in exchange for a new facility. Since then, Fire Station 10 has been maintained and operated by the Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Department and is staffed 24/7 by full-time career firefighters and paramedics. The Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads Volunteer firefighters still own the three medic units housed at the station - the two front line units are maintained and operated by Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue, while the third unit is maintained and operated by the volunteers.

<text>Belle Haven is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. Nearby CDPs are Huntington (northwest), Groveton (southwest) and Fort Hunt (south). The population of Belle Haven was 6,851 at the 2020 census.

The CDP is located just south of Old Town Alexandria and bounded on the west by Richmond Highway (U.S. 1) and on the east by the Potomac River. It encompasses Belle Haven, a wealthy subdivision dating from the 1920s, and several adjoining neighborhoods. Some, particularly New Alexandria and Belle View, are among the lowest-lying residential areas of Fairfax County, and sustained extensive flood damage from storms including 2003&#x27;s Hurricane Isabel and 1972&#x27;s Hurricane Agnes. The Belleview branch of the Alexandria Post Office is located here, and serves the 22307 ZIP code in which the majority of the CDP falls.

==History==
The name &quot;Belle Haven&quot; derives from when Scottish pioneers settled along the Potomac River in the early 18th century. They named the settlement after their favorite countryman, the Earl of Belhaven. This early settlement thrived along the Potomac River as a port and was later renamed &quot;Alexandria&quot;. The area later became part of the West Grove Plantation, which was built by Hugh West around 1748. It capitalized on its close and favorable position to the newly forming town of Alexandria.

The West family was important in Virginia and Fairfax County politics in the 18th century. Hugh West himself was a burgess from Fairfax County, a vestryman, and a trustee of the town of Alexandria. His son, John, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps with continued public work until he died in 1777.

The home passed from the West family in 1814 to a Col. Augustine J. Smith, who bought the plantation from the last West, James, who died in 1814. Smith is known to have enlarged the original to over . This included the draining of the swamps along the Potomac River and building a dike. This increased his land holding considerably, but the embankments were cut after his death and never repaired. He is also known for his vast building spree, where he had no less than thirteen new buildings built for the much enlarged plantation. These included larger slave quarters for the forty slaves he owned.

Smith died in 1830, and after several years the plantation was sold to Dennis Johnston. He did little enlarging to the plantation, still known as West&#x27;s Grove. He was probably kept busy repairing all of Smith&#x27;s additions. Johnston died several years before the Civil War, and his widow ran the plantation in his place. In 1862 the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Garibaldi Guard) occupied the plantation and later burned it to the ground, retaliating against the owner&#x27;s sons for serving as officers on General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s staff. No house occupied this land again until the first house was built in Belle Haven at 6041 Woodmont Road in 1928.

The current Belle Haven residential community had its start in the 1920s when David Howell, a civil engineer from Alexandria, purchased the land from owners Mrs. Thomas Wilfred Robinson, Sr. and her brothers. Upon purchasing the land, Howell set up two corporations, one to construct a golf course and club, and the other to develop a residential subdivision. The golf course and club later became the Belle Haven Country Club, which still exists.

<doc id="137562" wikidata="Q963207" url="?curid=137562" title="John Allen Muhammad">
<text>John Allen Muhammad (born John Allen Williams; December 31, 1960 – November 10, 2009) was an American serial killer who, along with his partner and accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (then aged 17), carried out the D.C. sniper attacks of October 2002, killing seventeen people. Muhammad and Malvo were arrested in connection with the attacks on October 24, 2002, following tips from alert citizens. 

A native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Muhammad changed his surname after joining the Nation of Islam in 1987. At Muhammad&#x27;s trial, the prosecution claimed that the attacks were part of a plot to kill his ex-wife and regain custody of his children, but the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support this argument.

Muhammad&#x27;s trial for one of the murders (of Dean Harold Meyers in Prince William County, Virginia) began in October 2003, and ended with his conviction for capital murder. Four months later he was sentenced to death. While awaiting execution in Virginia, in August 2005, Muhammad was extradited to Maryland for trial, resulting in his conviction on six counts of first-degree murder in May 2006. Upon completion of the trial activity in Maryland, he was returned to Virginia pending an agreement with another state or the District of Columbia seeking to try him. He was not tried on additional charges in other Virginia jurisdictions and faced potential trials in three other states and the District of Columbia involving other murders and attempted murders. All appeals of his conviction for killing Meyers had been rejected. Appeals for Muhammad&#x27;s other trials remained pending at the time of his execution.

Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009, at 9:06 p.m. EST at the Greensville Correctional Center near Jarratt, Virginia, and was pronounced dead at 9:11 p.m. EST. Muhammad declined to make a final statement.

==Early life==
John Allen Muhammad was born John Allen Williams in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Ernest and Eva Williams. John and his family moved to New Orleans when his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer; she died when he was three years old. His father left the family soon afterward, leaving John to be raised mainly by his maternal grandfather and an aunt.

In 1987, at the age of 26, Williams joined the Nation of Islam, and subsequently helped provide security for the &quot;Million Man March&quot; in 1995. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has publicly distanced himself and his organization from the D.C. sniper attacks.

In 1999, Williams kidnapped his children and took them to Antigua, apparently engaging in credit card and immigration document fraud. It was during this time that he became close with Lee Boyd Malvo, a Jamaican child who later acted as his partner in the killings.

Williams changed his name to John Allen Muhammad in October 2001. After his arrest, authorities also claimed that Muhammad admitted that he admired and modeled himself after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda and approved of the September 11 attacks. Malvo testified that Muhammad had indoctrinated him into believing that the proceeds of an extortion attempt would be used to establish &quot;a camp in Canada where homeless children would be trained as terrorists.&quot;

Muhammad was twice divorced; his second ex-wife, Mildred Muhammad, sought and was granted a restraining order, alleging abuse. Muhammad was arrested on federal charges of violating the restraining order by possessing a weapon. Under federal law, those with restraining orders are prohibited from purchasing or possessing guns, as per the Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968.

Defense attorneys in the Malvo trial and prosecutors in Muhammad&#x27;s trial argued that the ultimate goal of the Beltway sniper murders was to kill Mildred in order to regain custody of his three children.

==Military service==
In August 1978, Muhammad enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard at Baton Rouge as a combat engineer. He transferred to the Regular Army on November 6, 1985, and was trained as a mechanic, truck driver and specialist metalworker. He qualified with the Army&#x27;s standard rifle, the M16, earning the Expert Rifleman&#x27;s Badge. This is the Army&#x27;s highest of three levels of basic rifle marksmanship for a soldier.

Muhammad&#x27;s first tour was with the 15th Engineer Battalion at Fort Lewis in 1985. In 1991, he served in the Gulf War with a company that dismantled Iraqi chemical warfare rockets, service for which he received the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait). In 1992, he was at Fort Ord, California, with the 13th Engineers and in 1993 was back at Fort Lewis with the 14th Engineer Battalion.

Muhammad was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of sergeant on April 26, 1994, after 16 years of service. He received the following awards: Army Service Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Overseas Ribbon, Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon and Army Achievement Medal.

==D.C. sniper attacks==

Police followed a lead in which Muhammad or Malvo left a note at one of the shootings to tell the police to investigate a liquor store robbery-murder that had occurred in Montgomery, Alabama. Investigators responding to that crime scene found one of the suspects had dropped a magazine with his fingerprints on it; these were subsequently identified as belonging to Malvo, whose prints were on file with the INS and who was known to associate with Muhammad. They had lived together for around a year in Tacoma, Washington, where Malvo used the alias John Lee Malvo.

Muhammad&#x27;s identification led to the discovery that he had purchased a former police car, a blue Chevrolet Caprice, in New Jersey on September 11, 2002. A lookout broadcast to the public on that vehicle resulted in the arrest of Muhammad and Malvo when the car was spotted parked at an Interstate 70 rest stop in Myersville, Maryland.

==Criminal case==

On October 24, 2002, Muhammad was captured in Maryland, where most of the attacks and murders occurred. Although Maryland sought to bring him to trial, United States attorney general John Ashcroft reassigned the case to the jurisdiction of Paul Ebert, the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Prince William County, Virginia. Virginia was viewed as more likely to impose a death sentence, which was borne out by the Virginia and Maryland verdicts. Virginia also allowed the death penalty for juveniles.

In October 2003, Muhammad went on trial for the murder of Dean Meyers. The crime had occurred in Prince William County, near the city of Manassas, Virginia. The trial had been moved from Prince William County to Virginia Beach, approximately 200 miles away. Muhammad was granted the right to represent himself in his defense and dismissed his legal counsel, though he immediately switched back to having legal representation after his opening statement. He was charged with murder, terrorism, conspiracy and the illegal use of a firearm and faced a possible death sentence.

Prosecutors said the shootings were part of a plot to extort $10 million from local and state governments. The prosecution said that they would make the case for 16 shootings allegedly involving Muhammad. The terrorism charge against Muhammad required prosecutors to prove he committed at least two shootings in a three-year period.

The prosecution called more than 130 witnesses and introduced more than 400 pieces of evidence intended to prove that Muhammad undertook the murders and ordered Malvo to help carry them out. Evidence included a rifle found in Muhammad&#x27;s car that was linked by ballistics tests to eight of the 10 killings in the Washington area and two others in Louisiana and Alabama; the car, which was modified so that a sniper could shoot from inside the trunk; and a laptop computer, also found in the car, that contained maps with icons pinpointing shooting scenes. Witness accounts put Muhammad across the street from one shooting and his car near the scene of several others. There was also a recorded phone call to a police hotline in which a man, his voice identified by a detective as Muhammad&#x27;s, demanded money in exchange for stopping the shootings.

Muhammad&#x27;s defense asked the court to drop the capital murder charges because there was no direct evidence. Malvo&#x27;s fingerprints were on the Bushmaster rifle found in Muhammad&#x27;s car and DNA from Muhammad was discovered on the rifle, but the defense contended that Muhammad could not be put to death under Virginia&#x27;s &quot;trigger-man law&quot; unless he actually pulled the trigger to kill Meyers, and nobody testified that they saw him do so.

On November 17, 2003, Muhammad was convicted of all four counts in the indictment against him: capital murder for the shooting of Meyers; capital murder under Virginia&#x27;s antiterrorism statute for homicide committed with an intent to terrorize the government or the public at large; conspiracy to commit murder; and the illegal use of a firearm. In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury, after five hours of deliberation over two days, unanimously recommended that Muhammad be sentenced to death. On March 9, 2004, a Virginia judge agreed with the jury&#x27;s recommendation and sentenced John Allen Muhammad to death.

On April 22, 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed his death penalty, stating that Muhammad could be sentenced to death because the murder was part of an act of terrorism. The court also rejected an argument by defense lawyers that he could not be sentenced to death because he was not the triggerman in the killings. Virginia Supreme Court Justice Donald W. Lemons said at the time, &quot;With calculation, extensive planning, premeditation and ruthless disregard for life, Muhammad carried out his cruel scheme of terror.&quot;

In May 2005, Maryland and Virginia reached an agreement to allow his extradition to face Maryland charges. He was held at the maximum security Sussex I State Prison near Waverly, Sussex County, Virginia, which houses Virginia&#x27;s male death row inmates. In August 2005, while awaiting execution in Virginia, he was extradited to Montgomery County, Maryland to face charges there.

On May 30, 2006, a Maryland jury found Muhammad guilty of six counts of murder. He was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without possibility of parole on June 1, 2006. Neither Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana nor Washington (state) moved to try Muhammad, given his death sentence for murder in Virginia. In 2006, Malvo confessed that the pair also killed 14 victims in California, Arizona, and Texas.

On May 6, 2008, it was revealed that Muhammad asked prosecutors in a letter to help him end legal appeals of his conviction and death sentence &quot;so that you can murder this innocent black man.&quot; An appeal filed by Muhammad&#x27;s defense lawyers in April 2008 cited evidence of brain damage that would render Muhammad incompetent to make legal decisions and that he should not have been allowed to represent himself at his Virginia trial.

On September 16, 2009, Prince William County Circuit Court Judge Mary Grace O&#x27;Brien set Muhammad&#x27;s execution date for November 10, 2009. On November 9, 2009, Muhammad&#x27;s petition for review of his death sentence was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote a separate opinion stating that Virginia&#x27;s rush to set an execution date &quot;highlights once again the perversity of executing inmates before their appeals process has been fully concluded&quot; while noting that they concurred with the decision that the appeal ought not be heard.

==Civil case==
In 2003, Malvo and Muhammad were named in a civil lawsuit by the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence on behalf of two of their victims who were seriously wounded and the families of some of those murdered. Although Malvo and Muhammad were each believed to be , co-defendants Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster Firearms, Inc. contributed to a landmark $2.5 million out-of-court settlement in late 2004.

==Testimony of Lee Boyd Malvo==
In Muhammad&#x27;s May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Malvo, who was sentenced to a term of life without parole for his role in the shootings, confessed to a more detailed version of the pair&#x27;s plans. After psychological counseling, he admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial when he admitted to being the trigger man for every shooting. He said he lied to save Muhammad from a death penalty sentence. Malvo believed that he would not face the death penalty because he was a minor. In two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.

Part of his testimony concerned Muhammad&#x27;s complete plan with three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase one consisted of meticulously planning, mapping and practicing their locations around the D.C. area so after each shooting they could quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and continue to the next location. Muhammad&#x27;s goal in phase one was to kill six white people a day for 30 days. Malvo described how phase one did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot or getaway routes.

Phase two was meant to be undertaken in Baltimore, but was never carried out. It was to begin with the killing of a pregnant woman by a shot to the abdomen. The next step was to have been the killing of a Baltimore police officer and, at the officer&#x27;s funeral, to detonate improvised explosive devices that contained shrapnel to kill police officers attending the funeral.

Phase three was to begin during phase two. It was to extort millions of dollars from the United States government. The money would be used to pay for travel to Canada, stopping en route at YMCAs and orphanages to recruit impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and arrived in Canada, Muhammad would train the boys with weapons and send them across the United States to carry out mass shootings as he had done in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.

==Execution==
On November 10, 2009, hours before Muhammad&#x27;s scheduled execution, pleas for clemency made by his attorneys were denied by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.

Under Virginia law at the time, a defendant convicted of capital murder was allowed to choose the method by which he or she will be put to death—either lethal injection or electrocution. As Muhammad declined to select a method, by law the method of lethal injection was selected for him. He was offered a selection of a last meal, which he accepted. Muhammad&#x27;s last meal consisted of chicken, red sauce, and cake.

Muhammad declined to make a final statement and his execution began at 9 p.m. EST at the Greensville Correctional Center, Greensville County, near Jarratt, Virginia. The lethal injection process began at 9:06 p.m. EST. Muhammad was pronounced dead at 9:11 p.m. EST.

Muhammad&#x27;s body was cremated, and the ashes given to his son in Louisiana.

==In film==
Muhammad is portrayed by Bobby Hosea in the 2003 film &quot;D.C. Sniper: 23 Days of Fear&quot;, by Ken Foree in the 2010 film &quot;D.C. Sniper&quot; and by Isaiah Washington in the 2013 film &quot;Blue Caprice&quot;, and is portrayed anonymously in the 2020 series &quot;I, Sniper&quot;.

<doc id="137563" wikidata="Q1374615" url="?curid=137563" title="Burke, Virginia">
<text>Burke is an unincorporated section of Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, traditionally defined as the area served by the Burke post office (Zip Code 22015). Burke includes two census-designated places: the Burke CDP, population 42,312 in 2020

and the Burke Centre CDP, population 17,518 in 2020.
==History==
Burke is named after Silas Burke (1796–1854), a 19th-century slave-owner who built a house on a hill overlooking the valley of Pohick Creek in approximately 1824. Burke was a farmer, merchant, and local politician. He was a judge, sheriff, director of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad Company, president of the Fairfax Agricultural Society and the Fairfax Turnpike Company, among other leadership titles. He was also an overseer of the Fitzhugh’s plantation, which meant that he managed the Fitzhugh’s slaves and farming tasks. Burke also had personal slaves for his own farm. The Silas Burke house still stands.

When the Orange and Alexandria Railroad was constructed in the late 1840s, the railroad station at the base of that hill was named &quot;Burke&#x27;s Station&quot; after Burke, who owned the land in the area and donated a right-of-way to the railroad company. The community that grew up around the railroad station acquired a post office branch in 1852. The railroad tracks located on the same historical line are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and form part of the Manassas Line of the Virginia Railway Express commuter rail system, which has two stations (Rolling Road and Burke Centre) in the Burke area. The original Burke Station building can still be seen in the community, turned 90 degrees from its historical footprint.

During the Civil War, the railway station was garrisoned by Union troops. The Bog Wallow Ambush occurred nearby in 1861. On December 28, 1862, Confederate cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart raided the station. Stuart seized supplies from the area, destroyed a nearby bridge, monitored Union messages passing over the telegraph lines, and then famously sent a telegram to Union Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs complaining of the poor quality of the mules he had captured. Further action was seen in the neighborhood in 1863.

In 1903, Henry C. Copperthite changed the name of the post office from Burke&#x27;s Station to Burke after buying the Burke House and to build a racetrack for trotting and pacing horses. Copperthite was a wealthy man and the largest non-government employer in Washington, D.C.; in 1914 his factory in Georgetown produced 50,000 pies a day, earning him the nickname &quot;King of Pie&quot;. Copperthite built four hotels, stables and expanded the general store. Burke became a popular summer destination where people attended fairs and saw horse races, foot races, motorcycle races, exhibition boxing matches and baseball games. Trains ran to Burke from Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., Alexandria, Prince William, and Loudoun counties and as far away as Richmond. Copperthite installed the first phones in Burke, and his stables housed the horses of President McKinley and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt. The site of the racetrack is marked by a historic marker erected by Fairfax County in 2016.

The area remained predominantly rural into the mid-20th century. After World War I, Burke&#x27;s population grew as federal government workers moved into the area within easy commuting distance to Washington.

In 1951, the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration announced plans to condemn of land in Burke to construct a second airport to serve the Washington metropolitan area. After a lengthy lobbying campaign by area residents, the government in 1958 selected a different site near Chantilly, Virginia, which would become Washington Dulles International Airport. Land that had been purchased to build the airport was later developed into Burke Lake Park and the planned community of Burke Centre.

The first large subdivision in the vicinity, Kings Park, was constructed beginning in 1960, and was followed by many others over the next two decades, converting Burke into a densely populated suburban community.

A historic marker in Burke denotes the Huldah Coffer House, owned by a prominent resident of the county for many years. Another privately erected historical marker indicates the site of the former Lee Chapel Methodist church, which was intentionally burned in 1951 after having been abandoned for some years, but whose cemetery remains on the site.

<text>Centreville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. It is a suburb of Washington, D.C., the nation&#x27;s capital. It had a population of 73,518, making it the most-populous community in Fairfax County as of the 2020 U.S. census

Centreville is approximately west of Washington, D.C.

==History==
===Colonial period===
Beginning in the 1760s, the area was known as Newgate due to the popularity of the conveniently located Newgate tavern. William Carr Lane operated the tavern and was co-proprietor of a nearby store with James Lane, Jr. The Lanes sold convicted servants, which may explain why the tavern had the same name as a London prison. The small stream that passed near the tavern was named the River Thames, another London association. Another reason for it being named Newgate, was the fact that it was a &quot;new gate&quot; to the western territories.

===18th century===
The town of Centerville, shortly later spelled Centreville, was established in 1792 on the turnpike road at the village of Newgate by the Virginia General Assembly in response to petitions by local landowners. The petitioners reasoned that a town on the turnpike road leading from the Northwest Territory and centrally located to Alexandria, Colchester, Dumfries, Middleburg, George Town (later Georgetown), Fauquier Court House (later Warrenton), and Leesburg would be convenient. The town acquired its name due to its central location. James Hardage Lane, one of the landowners, conceived the idea of the town as a way to provide financial support to his widow and their children. At the town&#x27;s inception, it was within the boundary of Loudoun County, Virginia, and became part of Fairfax County, Virginia, in 1798 when the boundary between the two counties shifted.

Town development established a pattern of mixed residential and commercial use. Frame houses, several taverns, stores, blacksmith shops, tan yards, and a school house were constructed on the 1/2-acre town lots.

====American Civil War====
In the American Civil War, several battles were fought nearby including the First Battle of Manassas, the Second Battle of Manassas, and the Battle of Chantilly.

During the winter of 1861 and early 1862 the town was significantly fortified by the Confederacy and served as a supply depot for both sides at various points in the war, and is famous for being the site of the construction of the first railroad ever built exclusively for military use, the Centreville Military Railroad. Centreville was of significant strategic value due to its proximity to several important roads, while its position atop a high ridge provided a commanding view of the surrounding area. The town was frequently associated with Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby, whose partisan rangers used its hillsides and farms as a base of operations, leading to the sobriquet &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Confederacy&quot;.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Like much of Northern Virginia, Centreville experienced sustained population growth in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2021, the town has grown significantly. There are numerous shopping centers built around the town center.

==Geography==

Centreville is located at (38.842470, −77.442621).

== Transportation ==

Centreville is served by three major roads. U.S. Route 29, the main artery through the town, enters Centreville from the west. Virginia Route 28 enters from the south and interchanges with U.S. Route 29 in between Centreville&#x27;s two main shopping centers. SR 620 (Braddock Road) has several stretches of pavement in Centreville. Interstate 66 comes from the south-west and interchanges with both routes before heading toward Washington, D.C., in the east or western Virginia. The three roads are part of an interesting, if not frustrating traffic pattern. Drivers heading north on SR 28 are able to exit onto Interstate 66 eastbound, but they must use a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of US 29 to access the westbound side of the Interstate. Likewise, eastbound Interstate 66&#x27;s Exit 53 only provides access to SR 28 northbound; one must use Exit 52 and the same stretch of US 29 to reach SR 28 south.

The area is served by several Fairfax Connector bus routes connecting to the Metrorail system: 640, 641, 642.

<text>Chantilly is a census-designated place (CDP) in western Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 24,301 as of the 2020 census. Chantilly is named after an early-19th-century mansion and farm, which in turn took the name of an 18th-century plantation that was located in Westmoreland County, Virginia. The name &quot;Chantilly&quot; originated in France with the Château de Chantilly, about 28 miles north of Paris.

Located in the Northern Virginia portion of the Washington metropolitan area, Chantilly sits approximately west of Washington, D.C., via Interstate 66 and U.S. Route 50. It is located between Centreville to the south, Herndon and Reston to the north and northeast, respectively, and Fairfax to the southeast. U.S. Route 50 and Virginia State Route 28 intersect in Chantilly, and these highways provide access to the Dulles/Reston/Tysons Corner technology corridor and other major employment centers in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C.

==History==

Chantilly was home to a number of colonial plantations in the 1700s, including the Sully Plantation (now the Sully Historic Site) built by Richard Bland Lee I. Other plantations included George Richard Lee Turberville&#x27;s &quot;Leeton Grove&quot; (originally a 5,000+ acre plantation, the main house of which still stands at 4619 Walney Rd.), the John Hutchison Farm, and the Chantilly Plantation, after which Chantilly is named. Cornelia Lee Turberville Stuart, who was born at Leeton and was the daughter of George Richard Lee Turberville and Henrietta Lee, inherited a portion of Leeton in 1817 from her father. Stuart and her husband Charles Calvert Stuart, whom she had married in 1816, constructed the Chantilly Plantation and named it after the Westmoreland County plantation owned by her grandfather, Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Civil War, federal troops destroyed by fire the Chantilly Plantation manor house. One building remains, a stone house across Route 50 from the Greenbriar Shopping Center. While it is not clear what this stone house was used for, most historical evidence suggests it was probably a plantation overseer&#x27;s quarters during the antebellum period, and a tavern or boarding house following the war. After the war, Cornelia Stuart, who had become deeply in debt, sold her Chantilly estate. The advertisement for the sale referenced several &quot;tenements&quot;, one of which was the Stone House.

The village grew during the 19th century, particularly following the construction of the Little River Turnpike to Winchester.

The evolution of the Chantilly area into an outer suburb of Washington, D.C., gained momentum after 1980, as developers built residential subdivisions and commercial areas, filling in the farmland south of Dulles Airport.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War on September 1, 1862, the Battle of Chantilly (or Ox Hill) was fought nearby. Following his victory at the Second Battle of Bull Run (or Second Manassas), Confederate General Robert E. Lee directed Major General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson to cross Bull Run on August 31 and sweep around the position of Major General John Pope&#x27;s Union Army of Virginia at Centreville. Reaching the Little River Turnpike (now U.S. Route 50) northwest of Centreville, Jackson turned southeastward toward Fairfax Court House (now the city of Fairfax) to strike in rear of Pope&#x27;s army.

During September 1, Pope, apprised of Jackson&#x27;s movement, began to withdraw toward Fairfax Court House. Late in the day, Jackson clashed with Union forces under Brigadier General Isaac Stevens and Major General Philip Kearny near Ox Hill, west of Fairfax. During the ensuing battle, which was fought amid a raging storm, both Union generals Stevens and Kearny were killed. The fighting ended at dusk, and Pope&#x27;s army continued its withdrawal to Fairfax and subsequently to the Washington defenses.

Although commercial and residential development now covers most of the Chantilly (Ox Hill) battlefield, the small Ox Hill Battlefield Park preserves a portion of the battle site.

<doc id="137566" wikidata="Q1374067" url="?curid=137566" title="Clifton, Virginia">
<text>Clifton is an incorporated town located in southwestern Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 243 at the time of the 2020 census.

Incorporated by the General Assembly on March 9, 1902, Clifton is one of only three towns in the county, the other two being the much more populous Vienna and Herndon. Clifton&#x27;s history begins pre-colonially, when the area was used as hunting grounds by the local Dogue Native American tribe. A railroad siding was constructed here during the Civil War, and the area became titled as Devereux Station. A nearby neighborhood on the outskirts of the Clifton ZIP code has this name. Development of a village at the siding began in 1868 when a railroad depot, named &quot;Clifton Station&quot;, was constructed.

Unlike most areas in Northern Virginia, the land around Clifton is far less built up than nearby areas, especially to its east and southwest. This was out of the worry that overdevelopment near Bull Run and the Occoquan River would be environmentally damaging to the Occoquan Reservoir. Consequently, as development edged near the area in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an ordinance was enacted stating that only one building could be placed on parcels that have not already been divided. Today, the southern and eastern portions of the area are heavily forested, with single-family homes, while the northern area has become equestrian areas.

==History==

===Colonial era===
Before the arrival of European settlers, the present-day Clifton area was part of the hunting grounds used by Algonquin-speaking members of the Dogue tribe. The Dogue lived in villages and towns along the Potomac River and nearby Occoquan River. They carved bowls out of soapstone found in the area.

European settlers composed of Scots merchants created the first nearby port settlement in the mid-1710s on the Potomac River near the present-day Dumfries-Triangle area. Land in the Clifton area began to be settled in the early 18th century.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War, the United States Military Railroad Construction Corps built a railroad siding here on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in order to supply the Union Army with timber for railroad ties, bridge trusses, and firewood. The siding was named after John Henry Devereux, superintendent of military railroads that terminated in Alexandria. Wood from hundreds of acres was cut and hauled by wood choppers and teamsters, most of whom were escaped enslaved people, and transported by train to Alexandria. The laborers risked capture by working outside protected Union lines.

In spring 1863, a wye was constructed at Devereux Siding to enable trains to turn around after the Union Army abandoned the Orange and Alexandria Railroad south of Bull Run. By June 1863 the entire railroad outside of the defenses of Washington was abandoned until the return of Major General George Meade&#x27;s Army of the Potomac following their successful Gettysburg Campaign. New York infantry regiments were stationed at the siding in order to protect wood station operations and the railroad from Confederate attack.

Devereux Siding was located between the station at Union Mills (near present-day Union Mill) and Sangster&#x27;s Station. Today, there are two neighborhoods outside of the town named after the Devereux and Sangster&#x27;s stations. The Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad extended from Alexandria to Orange, Virginia. For a brief period near the close of the war, the siding became the sixth scheduled stop for passengers and freight and became known as &quot;Devereux Station&quot;.

The O &amp; A was the only railroad link between Alexandria and Richmond, Virginia.

William E. Beckwith, whose 1200 acre plantation included much of the land now incorporated as Clifton, bequeathed his land south of the railroad to his former slaves, some of whom were his children. Harriet Harris and the five children she had with William Harris were devised the land where the village of Clifton was initially developed. Harrison G. Otis, a New York realtor, purchased a large tract of land north of the railroad from the Beckwith estate and a small lot of land south of the railroad from William Harris, where he constructed a saw mill and train depot. The depot opened in November 1868 and was named &quot;Clifton Station&quot;. The next year, an official U.S. post office opened at the depot, and Otis built the historic Clifton Hotel. Harrison Otis and his brother J. Sanford Otis founded the Clifton Presbyterian Church, still in existence. The station no longer exists, but the town of Clifton is still standing along what used to be the O &amp; A Railroad, now a part of the Norfolk Southern Railway.

William Harris divided a portion of his family&#x27;s land adjacent to the railroad into ten lots that were offered for sale in 1869. Homes and businesses were constructed on the lots, including a general merchandise store located on the western side of Main Street adjacent to the railroad. Harris expanded the village by selling additional lots along Main Street in the mid-1870s. Harrison Otis and his business partner Margaret Hetzel subdivided land on the eastern side of Main Street for development and several lots were sold in the 1870s; however, this development was not as successful as planned due to Harrison Otis&#x27;s reduced mental health and Margaret Hetzel&#x27;s financial difficulties.

The village grew in the late 1800s when a number of homes and businesses were constructed, including additional merchandise stores and lumber yards.

===20th century===
The town was incorporated by the General Assembly on March 9, 1902. It is currently one of the three towns in Fairfax County.

During the 1900s, the town was nearly the same size as it is now. The first schoolhouse in Clifton was in Susan Reviere Hetzel&#x27;s home on Pendleton Avenue. She was also one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The school was later moved to the side-yard area of what would later become the home of Mayors Swem Elgin and Jim Chesley. In 1912 a new schoolhouse (built for K-12) was built overlooking the town; it stood until 1952. A new elementary school, Clifton Elementary, was built on the same site in 1953 and served the community until 2010. On March 9, 1930, the Clifton General Store caught fire, and a few months later a new general store was built in its place.

By the late 1960s, the town was in a state of decline. Many houses in the town were boarded up and abandoned. A number of new families and residents began much-needed gentrification of the town. Wayne Nickum, a former mayor, worked to ensure the entire town was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Some 63 Clifton buildings were added to the register at that time. Another resident, Jim Chesley, who would also serve as mayor of Clifton, worked tirelessly with national and state politicians and administrators to ensure the town maintained its historic integrity. In 1967, the town sponsored the first Clifton Day Festival as a way to attract the public to this historic town. This celebration continues each year as a town fair and music festival on the Sunday before Columbus Day in October.

One historical home in the town is attributed to a member of the Kincheloe family, located where Main Street, County Rd 645, becomes Kincheloe Road. Kincheloe Road continues to Old Yates Ford Road. Daniel Kincheloe (1723-1785), whose grandfather immigrated from Ireland, was a landowner near the town and along Popes Head Creek. He was a captain in the militia in the French and Indian Wars and provided beef and other supplies to the revolutionary army during the Revolutionary War. He is buried in the Wickliffe/Kincheloe cemetery that is now part of the Hemlock Overlook Regional Park, adjacent to a park office. Among two wives, he had 11 children, including 7 sons. One of Daniel&#x27;s descendants built the house in Clifton.

Towards the late 1970s and early 1980s suburban development was starting to edge near Clifton. Communities such as Burke Center, with 5,500 homes, and Little Rocky Run, with 2,722 homes, were constructed, raising concerns that the new construction might ruin the beauty of the Clifton area. In the 1980s, Fairfax County government enacted an ordinance stipulating that only one building could be placed on parcels that have not already been divided. Single-family homes were constructed in the southern and eastern parts of Clifton, while land to the north became equestrian areas.

The town was declared a National Historic District by the US Department of the Interior in 1984. The opening scenes of &quot;Broadcast News&quot; were filmed in Clifton in 1986.

Formation of the Occoquan Watershed in the 1970s limited development due to ecological concerns and required all houses in the area to have at least of land. This prevents nearly all development other than luxury single-family homes. In 2002, a new community was built on the edge of town called Frog Hill. Controversy arose about demolishing the abandoned Hetzel home on the corner of Chapel Road and Pendleton Avenue in 2006. The building and a replica home were finished in the winter of 2007.

===21st century===
In 2000, then-mayor Jim Chesley started a Labor Day antique car show in Clifton sponsored by the Northern Virginia Custom Cruisers and Clifton Lions clubs to raise money for local charities. The ninth annual Labor Day Car Show in 2008 attracted more than 400 antique cars, an estimated two thousand visitors, and raised over $30,000. That year&#x27;s featured charity was Life With Cancer, a Fairfax hospital-based program that provides family support and education. In the past five years alone, the event has raised nearly $120,000 for various local charities.

The Clifton Spring Homes Tour is run by the Clifton Community Women&#x27;s Club and is held on the third Thursday in May. The 100-member General Federation of Women&#x27;s Club group raises money for local charities via home tours, silent auction, boutique, and local women&#x27;s art show and sale.

In 2020, the city made national headlines when a &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; banner was hung in the town&#x27;s Main Street. The banner was met with praise by many residents but condemnation by others including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas who saw it as justifying controversial aspects of the BLM movement. Her comments lead to media attention on the banner. The banner was stolen on July 20, 2020, and has not been found —despite a police investigation.

<text>Dunn Loring is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 9,464 as of the 2020 census. This suburban area is bordered by Merrifield to the south, Vienna to the west, Tysons to the north, and Idylwood to the east. Dunn Loring is located within the Washington metropolitan area.

==History==

Dunn Loring (archaic &quot;Dunn-Loring&quot;), the earliest platted subdivision in Fairfax County and possibly the Commonwealth of Virginia, was founded in 1886. General William McKee Dunn and his wife Elizabeth Lanier Dunn purchased about located on the Washington, Ohio and Western Railroad, now the Washington and Old Dominion Regional Trail, from L. B. Clarke and his wife on June 8, 1886. On September 22, 1886, the land was transferred to the Loring Land and Improvement Company, composed of General Dunn, then a retired Army brigadier general and former Judge Advocate General; George B. Loring, a former congressman and Commissioner of Agriculture; and George H. LeFetra, a Washington temperance hotel proprietor. The Town of Dunn Loring was advertised for residential sales in 1887. The Loring Land and Improvement Company built a railroad station and a post office, but shortly thereafter General Dunn died, and the development stagnated. During the Spanish–American War, the founding of Camp Russell A. Alger brought growth and prosperity to Dunn Loring, and among the troops trained at Camp Alger was the celebrated author-poet Carl Sandburg, after whom the present Sandburg Street was named. In 1912, Fairfax Shield McCandlish bought out the interests of the developers, consolidated parcels, and subdivided the land into its current platting. Following World War II, the area began to develop as part of Metropolitan Washington, D.C.

Up until the mid-1990s, large portions of the land (mainly between Lee Hwy and Gallows Rd.) had been horse farms and plantations before becoming gentrified.

==History==

The site of present-day Fort Hunt Park was used as an asset for the United States military beginning in the Spanish–American War. The fort had been completed on land that used to belong to the River Farm plantation of George Washington. The fort was used to complement Fort Washington across the river in Maryland, but it was not involved in an actual battle during the Spanish–American War.

During World War II, the fort was used as an interrogation center called P. O. Box 1142 where captive German officers were kept and questioned. Fort Hunt is the site of the death of Lieutenant Commander Werner Henke, the highest-ranking German officer to be shot while in American captivity during World War II.

During the war and after, neighborhoods such as Waynewood and Snowden began arising in the area around the fort, and the commercial center for the community, Hollin Hall shopping center, was constructed on Fort Hunt Road.

<text>Franconia is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 18,943 at the 2020 census.

Located just southwest of Alexandria, Franconia has existed as a community since the 1870s, when a station by that name opened on the RF&amp;P Railroad. Like most of the surrounding area, however, it began to develop into its present suburban form only in the 1950s. The CDP extends south to just north of the border of Fort Belvoir, encompassing neighborhoods such as Manchester Lakes and Windsor Estates. Street addresses have Alexandria ZIP Codes 22310 and 22315. It is near the Springfield Mall shopping area and the Franconia–Springfield Washington Metro station.

==Geography==
Franconia is located in southeastern Fairfax County at (38.763351, −77.150328). It is bordered to the west by Springfield, to the north by Lincolnia, to the northeast by Rose Hill, to the east by Kingstowne, and to the south by Newington. It is southwest of Washington, D.C.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Franconia CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, is water.

==History==
Franconia Road once served as a rolling road to bring tobacco hogsheads to the port at Alexandria. The surrounding community derives its name from the &quot;Frankhonia Farm&quot;, which sat on a portion of a tract of 191 acres purchased from Joseph Broders of Oak Grove Farm in 1859 by William Fowle, a merchant from Alexandria. Fowle&#x27;s son, Robert Rollins Fowle, sold 18 acres of the property to the Alexandria &amp; Fredericksburg Railway Company in 1871 for the erection of a railway station, which took its name of the farm. The station was the site of the Garfield Post Office from 1881 until 1890, and again from 1898 until 1907. In 1903, it was relocated after a fire from its original site, near Fleet Drive, to the north side of Franconia Road. The railway station remained in regular service until around 1953. Today, it is memorialized with a historic marker erected by the Fairfax County History Commission in 2000, located in front of the Franconia Governmental Center. For many years the center of the community was Wards Corner, at the intersection of Franconia Road and Old Rolling Road. Over twenty-five years the complex grew to include a gas station, grocery store, bar, movie theater, and dance hall; a 1959 fire destroyed everything at the site.
The Franconia area was the site of a skirmish in January 1862, during the American Civil War. Colonel Wade Hampton III, having led a group of cavalrymen across the Occoquan River past Pohick Church, encountered a group of Union cavalry in the area and gave chase. Being warned by a Texas scout that he was soon to enter an ambush, Hampton stopped short and formed a squadron on top of Potter&#x27;s Hill. The trap having failed, both sides began firing at each other; several soldiers were wounded, including one of Hampton&#x27;s men who was shot in the face. The Confederates then retreated across the Occoquan. In later years Potter&#x27;s Hill was the site of three schoolhouses, the last of them burning in 1932; more recently it was the site of a chicken farm and, later, a gravel quarry which provided material for the construction of the first Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Today the location is the site of the Hilltop Village Center. Members of the Potter family are buried at the Millan family cemetery, located nearby on the former grounds of the Millan family home, Dairy Lodge.

The Franconia Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1934; its first firehouse, completed in 1937, stood where the government center is located today. Today the department continues to serve the community from two locations in the vicinity.

Franconia is also the site of the Laurel Grove Colored School and Church, organized as a congregation of former slaves in the 1880s. The school site was deeded to the Virginia School System in 1881 by Georgianna and William Jasper for $10; the school served the community until 1932. In 1884, the couple provided another half-acre for a church to be built next to the school. Laurel Grove Baptist Church stood until being destroyed by an electrical fire in December 2004. The church cemetery still exists, as does the school building, which was honored in 2008 with the erection of a historical marker by the Fairfax County History Commission. A number of other churches have existed in the neighborhood over the years, including Sharon Chapel, founded in 1848 and counting Phillips Brooks among its early seminarians, and Olivet Episcopal Church. Adjacent to Sharon Chapel is a cemetery, one of several in the area; another marks the former site of Oak Grove plantation, which was demolished in 1996 to make way for an assisted living facility. Other cemeteries can be found along Beulah Street.

The Franconia area is represented in the Virginia House of Delegates by Democrat Mark D. Sickles. Other residents have included former South Carolina Congressman William Waters Boyce, who purchased the house Ashland and 195 acres of farmland after the Civil War.

The history of the Franconia community and the surrounding area is preserved and interpreted by the Franconia Museum, located in the Franconia Governmental Center.

<text>Herndon is a town in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, part of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. In 2020, the population at the census was 24,655, which makes it the largest of three incorporated towns in the county.

The actual dimensions of the town of Herndon are fairly small. However, the United States Post Office treats nearby unincorporated communities in northwestern Fairfax County as part of a &quot;Greater Herndon&quot; region, including Dranesville, Floris, Franklin Farm, McNair, and Oak Hill.

==History==
The early settlement was named Herndon in 1858, after Commander William Lewis Herndon, an American naval explorer and author of &quot;Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon&quot;. Commander Herndon captained the ill-fated steamer SS &quot;Central America&quot;, going down with his ship while helping to save over 150 of its passengers and crew. In the 1870s, many Northern soldiers and their families came to settle in the area, taking advantage of moderate climate and low land prices.

Originally part of the rural surroundings of the Washington, D.C. area, the town of Herndon developed into a hub of dairy farming and vacationing for area residents, aided by its presence along the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad (later to become the Washington and Old Dominion (W&amp;OD) Railroad). When the railroad was converted into a hike-and-bike trail, Herndon capitalized on history and small-town feel (in a major metropolitan region) by converting its train station into a museum and visitors center and by relocating a Norfolk Southern Railway caboose to a nearby site and repainting it in W&amp;OD livery.

The caboose was originally acquired in 1989 by Herndon Historical Society member, George Moore, to whose memory the caboose was dedicated after his death in 2003. Although the caboose itself never traveled through Herndon, it remains an iconic part of the downtown area that both locals and tourists visit daily. The caboose and station offer a glimpse of the original downtown&#x27;s historic charm, which residents are passionate about preserving.

On January 14, 2004, the Town of Herndon commemorated its 125th anniversary.

The town of Herndon was part of a nationally reported controversy involving illegal immigration beginning in 2005. The controversy revolved around a day labor center called the &quot;Herndon Official Worker Center&quot; (HOW Center), operated by Reston Interfaith&#x27;s &quot;Project Hope and Harmony&quot; under a grant from surrounding Fairfax County. The HOW Center was created on March 23, 2006, in response to daily gatherings of Hispanic workers at a local 7-Eleven store. The 2006 election for Mayor and Town Council revolved mainly around the issue, and resulted in unseating the pro-center Mayor and two councilmembers. The center closed after less than two years of operation, in September 2007.

The Herndon Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hybla Valley () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, south of Alexandria. The population was 15,801 at the 2010 census, down from 16,721 in 2000 due to a reduction in area, resulting from some of the eastward neighborhoods including much of Hollin Hills being moved to the Fort Hunt CDP. The population increased to 16,319 in the 2020 census.

==History==
The Mason family&#x27;s Hollin Hall plantation, just south of Alexandria, had become the property of several owners, including Edward Curtis Gibbs and the Wilson family. Thomson Dairy had been founded on the land in the late 19th century, and lasted until Merle Thorpe purchased it in the early 20th century. The various dairy farms, such as Sherwood Farm, Hybla Valley Farm, and Popkins Farm were converted into suburban neighborhoods, while plans for the construction of the George Washington Air Junction and the Hybla Valley Airport began. The civilian airport was proposed to be the largest in the world, yet the land, which had once been dairy farm, was abandoned and is currently Huntley Meadows Park. During World War II, the famous Hollin Hills subdivision, to the east of U.S. Route 1 towards the Potomac River, was completed by designers Charles Goodman and Robert Davenport. Also during the war, the princess of Norway sought refuge from the conflict in Europe and wished to purchase the property of Hollin Hall; President Roosevelt personally inspected the land for her, yet his assistant, Thorpe, became its new owner in the end. The land surrounding it became a turkey farm, and was eventually bought by the Mount Vernon Unitarian Church. In 1978, the Mount Vernon Unitarian Church donated land within Hollin Hills to create the wealthy Mason Hill subdivision. The west side of Hybla Valley has developed over the years, including construction of Mount Vernon Plaza in 2002.

In 1833, Gum Springs was founded by West Ford, a freed slave, skilled carpenter, and manager on George Washington&#x27;s plantation, Mount Vernon. Ford was able to develop this 214-acre farming community in Fairfax County from the sale of land he inherited from Hanna Washington, the sister-in-law of George Washington. By 1866, Ford was the second richest free black farmer in Fairfax County, Virginia. Gum Springs Farm became the nucleus of an African-American community throughout the 1800s. Gum Springs was established along what is now Route 1 (Richmond Highway) and in 1991 a historical marker was erected from the Department of Historic Resource (Marker Number E-04).

Since the early 2000s, the Hybla Valley area has experienced a significant growth of its Hispanic population. As of the 2010 census, the Hispanic population exceeded the African American population in Hybla Valley.

==Geography==

<text>West Falls Church is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 29,207 at the 2010 census.
Before 2010, West Falls Church was officially named Jefferson (from Thomas Jefferson). Outside of the Jefferson Village neighborhood, &quot;Jefferson&quot; generally is not used locally to refer to the area bounding Falls Church city to the south and southwest that comprises the CDP. Likewise, &quot;West Falls Church&quot; is rarely used to describe the area but is usually applied to areas west of Falls Church city or near West Falls Church metro station. The bulk of it is made of subdivisions built in the 1940s and early 1950s, including Jefferson Village, Westlawn, Hillwood, Sleepy Hollow, Woodley, Raymondale and Broyhill Park.

==History==
Following the American Civil War, local blacks established prosperous communities in an area then called South Falls Church, along Tinner&#x27;s Hill and elsewhere. In 1887, white Falls Church residents successfully gerrymandered heavily black South Falls Church out of the town limits and shrank the area of the town by one third. It is speculated that the reason for the shrinking of the town limits was a fear of black power to swing local elections. This was never reversed, and caused the boundary of the future City of Falls Church to follow South Washington Street. The name South Falls Church subsequently fell out of use.

Before 2010, the West Falls Church CDP was officially named Jefferson but that name was rarely used for the area. As the CDP does not lie to the immediate west of Falls Church city, &quot;West Falls Church&quot; is also an uncommon designation for the area and more often refers to the area around West Falls Church station several miles away in the Idylwood CDP.

==Geography==
West Falls Church is located at (38.8655595, −77.1876993).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.03 square miles (13.0 km), of which, 4.99 square miles (12.9 km) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km) of it (0.77%) is water.

==Demographics==

<doc id="137578" wikidata="Q1374974" url="?curid=137578" title="Lake Barcroft, Virginia">
<text>Lake Barcroft is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 9,558 at the 2010 census. It is also the name of the privately owned lake—part of the Cameron Run Watershed—around which this population is located. The lake is named for Dr. John W. Barcroft, who owned and operated a mill on Holmes Run during the mid-19th century.

==History==
In 1913, the Alexandria Water Company began construction of the Lake Barcroft Dam on Holmes Run to create a drinking water reservoir for the city of Alexandria. Construction of the dam was completed in 1915, putting a 620 million-gallon reservoir into service. In 1942, the company installed 24 gates at the top of the dam to raise the spillway elevation five feet, increasing the reservoir size to 800 million gallons.

In 1949, the City of Alexandria began to draw its drinking water from the Occoquan Reservoir. A year later, Colonel Joseph Barger and Associates purchased the reservoir, dam, and 680 adjacent acres of land for $1 million from the Alexandria Water Company. A year later, Barger and Associates began developing the into a residential community. During the early 1950s, residents formed a homeowners association called the Lake Barcroft Community Association (LABARCA). In 1970, community residents purchased the lake, dam, and common grounds for $300,000, and established the Barcroft Lake Management Association (BARLAMA).

In 1972, Hurricane Agnes passed over the area. The hurricane caused so much rain that the lake level rose above the top of the dam by . This resulted in the lake overflowing and eroding the western, earthen shoulder of the dam. The rush of water deepened the washout, but the slow erosion protected downstream interests from the wall of water that would have resulted from a total dam collapse.

To restore the dam and lake, residents voted to establish the Lake Barcroft Watershed Improvement District (LBWID) to set up a taxing authority to fund repairs. The LBWID is a quasi-governmental entity headed by three state-appointed trustees who are residents of Lake Barcroft. The lake was dry for two years during the early 1970s while the damaged dam was rebuilt. A new gate improved the operation of the dam and is now fully automatic. The dam meets all Commonwealth dam safety requirements.

The Lake Barcroft Association (LBA) came into being in 1992 when LABARCA and BARLAMA joined up into one private entity. Lake Barcroft has excellent fishing. Largemouth bass, catfish, sunfish and a rare (non-stinging) fresh water jellyfish all inhabit Lake Barcroft. Ospreys, fishing birds of prey, are now on the lake as well.

==Geography==
Lake Barcroft is located in eastern Fairfax County at (38.851412, −77.155654). It is bordered to the northeast by Seven Corners, to the east by Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads, to the south by Lincolnia, to the southwest by Annandale, and to the northwest by West Falls Church. Downtown Washington, D.C. is to the northeast. The CDP border follows Sleepy Hollow Road to the west, Leesburg Pike to the north, various roads along its border with Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads to the east, and Columbia Pike to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Lake Barcroft CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 8.34%, is water.

The local high school is Justice High School.

The boundaries of the Lake Barcroft CDP are somewhat more expansive than those of the LBA. The former includes several apartment buildings, condominiums, and businesses along the streets that form the border. The latter includes exclusively single family homes.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 8,906 people, 3,589 households, and 2,415 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 3,673 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 75.98% White, 9.59% Asian, 4.92% African American, 4.84% from other races, 4.35% from two or more races, 0.26% Native American, and 0.07% Pacific Islander.

Hispanics or Latinos (who may be of any race) were 14.72% of the population.

There were 3,589 households out of which 26.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.9% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.7% were non-families. 26.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 2.97.

In the CDP, the population was spread out with 20.5% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 28.2% from 45 to 64, and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.7 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $83,593, and the median income for a family was $101,562. Males had a median income of $62,882 versus $52,284 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $46,293. About 2.7% of families and 3.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.3% of those under age 18 and 0.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Management of the lake==

Lake Barcroft is privately owned, and managed by the Lake Barcroft Association (LBA); the current homeowners&#x27; association. Property owners on the lake and the immediate areas around the lake are bound by a restrictive covenant that also gives them rights to use the lake for recreation. For homeowners who do not own riparian land, there are five private sand beaches and a community park owned by LBA to permit access to the water. All common property is open to people living within the boundaries of the association and their authorized guests. The Lake Barcroft Association employs seasonal lifeguards to protect its beaches during the summer months.

The residents organize occasional aquatic festivals, most notably Independence Day fireworks every July 4. Fireworks are fired from one of the beaches, and residents crowd the water in their electric-powered or paddled boats to watch. The Labor Day games are held at two of its beaches to close the summer swimming season.

Internal combustion engines are prohibited on the lake to prevent noise and pollution. Only the lifeguards have access to gas-powered motorboats. Most residents own a small sailboat, canoe, or an electrically powered boat.

==Ecology of the lake==

Lake Barcroft is home to many freshwater species of fish and invertebrate. Largemouth bass were introduced to the lake decades ago, and now the population is self-sustaining. Catfish and bluegill also live in the lake in large numbers. Bryozoa can be observed just below the surface on the edges and in the shallower areas of the lake. Semi-aquatic species such as muskrat, ducks, Canada geese and kingfishers are also common.

As part of the Cameron Run Watershed, the lake receives large amounts of runoff from adjacent parts of suburban Fairfax County. These cause occasional algal blooms. The microbiology of the lake is monitored, and it is considered safe for fishing and swimming.

==History==

Originally created following the Civil War as a community of freed slaves, Lincolnia remained as one of Fairfax County&#x27;s original communities of African Americans for over 100 years. During segregation, Lincolnia had its own schoolhouse. The historical structure is still standing, now incorporated into Lincolnia Senior Center.
The school became integrated in 1962 as part of court-ordered busing. The African American students were bused out and white students were bused in.

<text>Lorton is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population was 20,072 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Lorton is named for a village in the Lake District National Park, Cumbria, in England. Joseph Plaskett of the Cumbrian village settled in southern Fairfax County, running a general store and opening the Lorton Valley Post Office on November 11, 1875.

Before the identity of Lorton, the commercial center was Colchester, and the spiritual and historical center of the community around which the leading citizens of the time revolved was Pohick Church, where George Washington and George Mason were at times members of the vestry.

From the early 20th century until November 2001, Lorton was the site of a District of Columbia correctional facility called the Lorton Reformatory which, among other things, detained approximately 168 women from the women&#x27;s suffrage movement from the Washington, D.C. area from June to December 1917. For the 2010 census, the area around the former Lorton Reformatory was assigned to the Laurel Hill census-designated place, reducing the area and population of the Lorton CDP.

A Nike missile site was built at Lorton in 1955, and remained until 1973.

Lorton is one of the two stations that serve Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Auto Train&quot; which carries passengers and their vehicles non-stop to Sanford, Florida, in the Orlando area. The Lorton and Occoquan Railroad once operated between the Lorton Reformatory and Occoquan, with connection to the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad.

Historic landmarks in the surrounding area include Gunston Hall, George Mason&#x27;s home; Belvoir, which was William Fairfax&#x27;s home; the Market; and now the Fort Belvoir Army Corps of Engineers base and Cranford Church. Woodlawn Plantation and Mount Vernon, the latter being George Washington&#x27;s home on the Potomac River, lie farther to the east.

On October 28th, 2023, the grand opening for the newly-created Lorton District Police Station commenced, which means that the Fairfax County Police Department officially has a station in the Lorton district of Fairfax County. The station was set up as part of a Public Safety bond approved by voters in November 2015 as a result of officers being drawn from their usual police stations (the Franconia and West Springfield stations), thereby leading to longer response times.

<text>Mantua is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. Mantua is a bedroom community serving as a suburb to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Most of the homes in Mantua were built between the 1950s and the 1980s. The population was 7,503 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Mantua is located in central Fairfax County at (38.852012, −77.257675). It is bordered to the west by the city of Fairfax, to the north by Merrifield, to the east by Woodburn, to the southeast by Wakefield, and to the south by Long Branch. The northern border of the CDP follows U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard), the southern border follows Virginia State Route 236 (Little River Turnpike), and the eastern border follows Prosperity Avenue. The Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) is to the east, and downtown Washington is to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Mantua CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.91%, is water. Accotink Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, flows through the northern part of the CDP, and Crook Branch, a tributary of Accotink Creek, flows through the southern part.

==History==
===Texaco oil leak===
An oil distribution plant, located west of the community along Pickett Road in Fairfax City, was found in 1990 to have leaked approximately 200,000 gallons (approximately 4,700 barrels) of petroleum into of the soil and groundwater of the Crook Branch watershed. At the time, the distribution plant was owned in part by a subsidiary of Texaco. The oil leakage may have occurred over up to twenty-five years, as the distribution plant had opened in April 1965. Four families were evacuated, and approximately 100 homes were connected to public water and sewer lines. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) directed the installation of a &quot;pump-and-treat&quot; groundwater remediation system, which was augmented in 2000 by digging of horizontal infiltration wells, intended to wash contaminated groundwater into the remediation system. Storm sewers in the area were checked for leaks and relining was performed to prevent further contamination of surface water. By 2013, a four-year temporary shutdown test had shown that benzene and methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether vapor intrusion in homes directly above the contaminated groundwater plume calculated from sub-slab soil vapor sampling did not exceed the screening limit, and that groundwater contamination east of the distribution plant had fallen to levels controllable by natural degradation. The offsite remediation system was removed by 2016, but cleanup at the distribution plant is ongoing. The oil distribution plant remains in operation as of 2023 using nine reinforced surface tanks, despite objections that community members and a task force appointed by Governor L. Douglas Wilder had raised at the time the leak was being investigated. All underground tanks have since been removed and piping for trucks to discharge oil residual into at the loading rack was installed in 1991: both the underground tanks and the loading rack had been suspected sources of the leak. Groundwater in the Crook Branch watershed continues to be tested annually by the EPA and storm sewers are inspected for cracks.

<text>Pimmit Hills is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, a neighborhood within a densely populated urban area. The name derives from Pimmit Run, the stream that was named for John Pimmit.

== John Pimmit ==
John Pimmit (also known as Pimett Pimmett, or Pymmett) and Thomas Browne were deeded 100 acres of land on 12 March 1672 by Elizabeth Alexander, wife of Captain John Alexander. The land was sold &quot;for 5,200 Pounds of Tobacco and caske payd by Charles Hickes&quot;, witnessed by John Higinson and Thomas Elsey. The deed was recorded in Stafford County, Virginia, on 8 November 1680.
Pimmit was an overseer in 1675 for William Fitzhugh (1651–1701). Fitzhugh, who immigrated to Virginia from England about 1670, was a lawyer, public official, plantation owner, and investor in land.

John Pimmit drowned in February 1688 in the Potomac River near the mouth of the stream that was named for him. ...&quot;an Indian that founde him drowned&quot; was paid with a matchcoat (a long woolen coat, or blanket coat). Further compensation was made to &quot;ye old Frenchman for lookinge after ye Children [John, Margaret, and William] since their Fathers Drowninge&quot;. Seven pence was &quot;paid to an Indian takeing 7 p &amp; burying ye said JOHN PYMMET at ye Courts Direccon&quot;.


==Development==
The area that is now Pimmit Hills was primarily farm land until the sub-division was built beginning in 1950. The houses in Pimmit Hills were mostly built during the 1950s for World War II and Korean War veterans and their families. Most of the houses were originally built as three bedroom, one bath dwellings of 833 square feet. Their initial price in 1950 was $9,950. George Offutt began construction of the first 500 Pimmit Hills houses in 1950. His Offutt Construction Company completed the first two sections by 1954. Other builders completed sections 3-6, while Offutt built sections 7 &amp; 8 under a different company. The subdivision was fully built out by 1957-58, with 1675 homes on 663 acres. Houses are mostly single family detached dwellings, with an average property size of 1/4 acre (1,000 m²) with some third acre lots. When the homes were first built, many areas were treeless former farm fields. Decades later, the area is known for its population of large oaks, Tulip trees, and other trees.

Current real estate values mirror the rest of Northern Virginia, with extreme value appreciation within the last several years. The median sale price of a Pimmit Hills home was $1.1 million in May 2023, according to redfin.com, reflecting the large number of larger, new homes that replaced the original 1950s homes. Pimmit Hills abuts the emerging city of Tysons with its upscale retail, restaurants, performance venues, and businesses, including many Fortune 500 companies. It is within walking distance to the Silver Line Metro and a short distance to Washington, DC. Fairfax County offers magnificent parks, playgrounds, and year round activities for all age groups.

Add-ons to the original one story houses, such as second floors, basements, and same-floor expansions, are common. Many new homes have been built in the neighborhood, and, on any given block, one can find several tear downs and rebuilds. This accelerated trend on tear downs is expected to continue, although many of the older houses built in the mid-1950s with less than 1000 square feet remain.

Several proposals have been presented by commercial developers to buy Pimmit properties and convert them to higher-density housing, such as condominiums or town houses, but, thus far, these have been resisted by homeowners. The comprehensive redevelopment plans for the Tysons area contemplates the preservation of the neighborhood as a community of single-family homes.

==Pimmit Barn==

Friends of Pimmit Barn successfully arranged with Fairfax County Parks Authority to preserve the historic building on Cherri Drive in Pimmit Hills for recreational use by the community through a Memorandum of Understanding on 9 October 2018. Since then, outdoor movies, Fall Festivals, and other events have been held there annually. Prior to the MOU, Pimmit Hills neighbors opposed &quot;placing large industrial gas equipment at the site&quot;.

&quot;The barn was built by Lisle Smith, who ran a dairy farm at the site for 15 years. The Fairfax County Water Authority (now called Fairfax Water) acquired the property in 1960. A well at the site was the primary water source for several hundred homes in the vicinity... The Water Authority deeded the site to the Park Authority in 1997 in exchange for a water-line easement within Cub Run Stream Valley Park&quot;

===Lisle Archibald Smith===
&quot;In 1941, Smith purchased 108 acres of land from George Johnson in Vienna, Virginia. He named the farm’s two story dwelling built in c. 1840 “Spring Glade”. &quot;This was one of three dairy farms that Smith operated including a farm in Pimmit Hills which later became the site of the Pimmit Hills neighborhood&quot;.

Smith was &quot;a counsel for the [United States] Department of Agriculture. During the Roosevelt administration, Smith was appointed Assistant to the Attorney General, Homer Cummings. He later returned to the Department of Agriculture and retired in 1941.&quot;

==Geography==
Pimmit Hills is located within the triangle made by the intersection of three highways: Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway), Interstate 66, and State Route 267 (the Dulles Toll Road). Within this triangle, the actual bounds of the neighborhood are Pimmit Run, Leesburg Pike (State Route 7), and Magarity Road. Pimmit Hills is politically part of Fairfax County, and Pimmit Hills residents use Falls Church as their mailing address.

==Popular culture==
The trailer park in the NBC sitcom &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; is named &quot;Pimmit Hills Trailer Park&quot; after the neighborhood. The series creator, Greg Garcia, lived in Pimmit Hills for a time as a child.
