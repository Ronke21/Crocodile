<text>InfiniBand (IB) is a computer networking communications standard used in high-performance computing that features very high throughput and very low latency. It is used for data interconnect both among and within computers. InfiniBand is also used as either a direct or switched interconnect between servers and storage systems, as well as an interconnect between storage systems. It is designed to be scalable and uses a switched fabric network topology.
Between 2014 and June 2016, it was the most commonly used interconnect in the TOP500 list of supercomputers.

Mellanox (acquired by Nvidia) manufactures InfiniBand host bus adapters and network switches, which are used by large computer system and database vendors in their product lines. 

As a computer cluster interconnect, IB competes with Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and Intel Omni-Path. The technology is promoted by the InfiniBand Trade Association.

== History ==
InfiniBand originated in 1999 from the merger of two competing designs: Future I/O and Next Generation I/O (NGIO). NGIO was led by Intel, with a specification released in 1998, and joined by Sun Microsystems and Dell.
Future I/O was backed by Compaq, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard.
This led to the formation of the InfiniBand Trade Association (IBTA), which included both sets of hardware vendors as well as software vendors such as Microsoft.
At the time it was thought some of the more powerful computers were approaching the interconnect bottleneck of the PCI bus, in spite of upgrades like PCI-X. Version 1.0 of the InfiniBand Architecture Specification was released in 2000. Initially the IBTA vision for IB was simultaneously a replacement for PCI in I/O, Ethernet in the machine room, cluster interconnect and Fibre Channel. IBTA also envisaged decomposing server hardware on an IB fabric.

Mellanox had been founded in 1999 to develop NGIO technology, but by 2001 shipped an InfiniBand product line called InfiniBridge at 10 Gbit/second speeds.
Following the burst of the dot-com bubble there was hesitation in the industry to invest in such a far-reaching technology jump.
By 2002, Intel announced that instead of shipping IB integrated circuits (&quot;chips&quot;), it would focus on developing PCI Express, and Microsoft discontinued IB development in favor of extending Ethernet. Sun Microsystems and Hitachi continued to support IB.

In 2003, the System X supercomputer built at Virginia Tech used InfiniBand in what was estimated to be the third largest computer in the world at the time.
The OpenIB Alliance (later renamed OpenFabrics Alliance) was founded in 2004 to develop an open set of software for the Linux kernel. By February, 2005, the support was accepted into the 2.6.11 Linux kernel.
In November 2005 storage devices finally were released using InfiniBand from vendors such as Engenio.
Cisco, desiring to keep technology superior to Ethernet off the market, adopted a &quot;buy to kill&quot; strategy. Cisco successfully killed InfiniBand switching companies such as Topspin via acquisition. 

Of the top 500 supercomputers in 2009, Gigabit Ethernet was the internal interconnect technology in 259 installations, compared with 181 using InfiniBand.
In 2010, market leaders Mellanox and Voltaire merged, leaving just one other IB vendor, QLogic, primarily a Fibre Channel vendor. 
At the 2011 International Supercomputing Conference, links running at about 56 gigabits per second (known as FDR, see below), were announced and demonstrated by connecting booths in the trade show.
In 2012, Intel acquired QLogic&#x27;s InfiniBand technology, leaving only one independent supplier.

By 2014, InfiniBand was the most popular internal connection technology for supercomputers, although within two years, 10 Gigabit Ethernet started displacing it.

In 2016, it was reported that Oracle Corporation (an investor in Mellanox) might engineer its own InfiniBand hardware.

In 2019 Nvidia acquired Mellanox, the last independent supplier of InfiniBand products.

== Specification ==
Specifications are published by the InfiniBand trade association.

=== Performance ===
Original names for speeds were single-data rate (SDR), double-data rate (DDR) and quad-data rate (QDR) as given below. Subsequently, other three-letter acronyms were added for even higher data rates.
; Notes
Each link is duplex. Links can be aggregated: most systems use a 4 link/lane connector (QSFP). HDR often makes use of 2x links (aka HDR100, 100 Gb link using 2 lanes of HDR, while still using a QSFP connector). 8x is called for with NDR switch ports using OSFP (Octal Small Form Factor Pluggable) connectors 

InfiniBand provides remote direct memory access (RDMA) capabilities for low CPU overhead.

=== Topology ===

InfiniBand uses a switched fabric topology, as opposed to early shared medium Ethernet. All transmissions begin or end at a channel adapter. Each processor contains a host channel adapter (HCA) and each peripheral has a target channel adapter (TCA). These adapters can also exchange information for security or quality of service (QoS).

=== Messages ===

InfiniBand transmits data in packets of up to 4 KB that are taken together to form a message. A message can be:
* a remote direct memory access read or write
* a channel send or receive
* a transaction-based operation (that can be reversed)
* a multicast transmission
* an atomic operation

=== Physical interconnection ===
In addition to a board form factor connection, it can use both active and passive copper (up to 10 meters) and optical fiber cable (up to 10 km). 
QSFP connectors are used.

The InfiniBand Association also specified the CXP connector system for speeds up to 120 Gbit/s over copper, active optical cables, and optical transceivers using parallel multi-mode fiber cables with 24-fiber MPO connectors.

=== Software interfaces ===
Mellanox operating system support is available for Solaris, FreeBSD, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Windows, HP-UX, VMware ESX, and AIX.

InfiniBand has no specific standard application programming interface (API). The standard only lists a set of verbs such as codice_1 or codice_2, which are abstract representations of functions or methods that must exist. The syntax of these functions is left to the vendors. Sometimes for reference this is called the &quot;verbs&quot; API. The de facto standard software is developed by OpenFabrics Alliance and called the Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED). It is released under two licenses GPL2 or BSD license for Linux and FreeBSD, and as Mellanox OFED for Windows (product names: WinOF / WinOF-2; attributed as host controller driver for matching specific ConnectX 3 to 5 devices) under a choice of BSD license for Windows. 
It has been adopted by most of the InfiniBand vendors, for Linux, FreeBSD, and Microsoft Windows. IBM refers to a software library called codice_3, for its AIX operating system, as well as &quot;AIX InfiniBand verbs&quot;.
The Linux kernel support was integrated in 2005 into the kernel version 2.6.11.

=== Ethernet over InfiniBand ===

Ethernet over InfiniBand, abbreviated to EoIB, is an Ethernet implementation over the InfiniBand protocol and connector technology.
EoIB enables multiple Ethernet bandwidths varying on the InfiniBand (IB) version.
Ethernet&#x27;s implementation of the Internet Protocol Suite, usually referred to as TCP/IP, is different in some details compared to the direct InfiniBand protocol in IP over IB (IPoIB).

<doc id="143310" wikidata="Q40235359" url="?curid=143310" title="Rewrite man">
<text>The rewrite man (rewrite person) is a newspaper reporter who works in the office, not on the street, taking information reported by others and crafting it into stories. It is rarely used as an actual title, however. The term is something of a misnomer since rewrite men or women do not just &quot;rewrite&quot;; they take notes gathered by on-the-scene-reporters, information gathered by telephone, or information from wire services or clippings from other newspapers, and combine them as they write each article. 

The job has lost much of its importance due to technology that allows reporters to write and transmit articles from the field. In the pre-computer days of newspaper work, however, it was vital. At the most extreme example, reporters on deadline would telephone into the newsroom and dictate their notes to an editor – hence the movie cliché of reporters rushing to telephone booths and shouting &quot;Get me rewrite!&quot; into the phone.

A rewrite man didn&#x27;t leave the office. He, or in rare instances she, would take calls from reporters who quickly needed to relay information for a story.

Sometimes an entire front page, with bylines from several different reporters, will have actually been written by a single rewrite man working with an editor. 

Some rewrite men spent all or most of their careers in the job; others learned how to do it while acquiring additional skills. 

Rewrite men are common at large national magazines, where reporters handle the reporting of the story while a writer takes the material and writes the actual article. In this case, the reporter will put all the information and quotes gathered into a multipage file which is then given to the writer. In cases of a story in several areas, several reporters will give their files to the writer. &quot;Time&quot; magazine also used to engage rewrite men almost exclusively, although it has all but abandoned the practice as of its 2008 redesign.

One example of a legendary rewrite man was the late Phillip O&#x27;Connor, who worked for 40 years for the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Daily News. Among the last of his breed, O&#x27;Connor was known for his speed and accuracy in compiling a story in less than 15 minutes under deadline pressure.

<doc id="143313" wikidata="Q333919" url="?curid=143313" title="George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy">
<text>Thomas George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy, (29 January 1909 – 22 September 1997) was a British politician who served as a member of parliament (MP) and Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983. He was elected as a Labour MP.

Born in Port Talbot, South Wales, he initially worked as a teacher in both London and Cardiff. An MP from 1945 to 1983, he held office in Harold Wilson&#x27;s 1964–1970 Labour administration, notably as Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970. As a junior minister at the Welsh Office, he was one of the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster (21 October 1966), and was later involved in the controversial government decision to use money from the Aberfan Charity Fund to clear remaining National Coal Board waste tips from around the village.

In 1976 Thomas was elected Speaker, in which role the first broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings brought him unprecedented public attention. He is the most recent Speaker to have served as a government minister before becoming Speaker. He retired from Parliament in June 1983 and, on 11th July 1983 by Letters Patent, was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Tonypandy, of Rhondda in the County of Mid Glamorgan.

==Early life and education==
Thomas was born in Port Talbot, Glamorgan, the second son of Zachariah Thomas, a Welsh-speaking miner from Carmarthen, and Emma Jane Tilbury, daughter of a founder of the English Methodist Church in Tonypandy. He had two elder sisters, Ada May and Dolly, one elder brother Emrys and one younger brother Ivor. His father became a heavy drinker and the family were happy when he joined up at the start of the First World War. They were less pleased when Emma had to take her marriage certificate to court to prove she was Zachariah&#x27;s wife and not the woman in Kent to whom he had allocated his soldier allowance. He never returned to South Wales and died of tuberculosis in 1925.

Thomas was raised by his mother in the village of Trealaw in South Wales, just across the Rhondda Fawr river from the town of Tonypandy. All four of his siblings left school at age 13. His two sisters went into domestic service, his elder brother went to work in a coal mine, and his younger brother worked in a shop. He attended Trealaw Boys&#x27; School where he passed the scholarship examination for Tonypandy Higher Grade School, later promoted to Tonypandy Secondary Grammar School. On leaving school Thomas became a pupil teacher, first in Trealaw and then in Fanshawe Crescent School, Dagenham, Essex, after which he did a two-year teacher-training course at University College, Southampton. He then worked as a teacher in both London and Cardiff.

==Political career==
Elected to Parliament in the Attlee landslide at the 1945 general election, Thomas held Cardiff Central between 1945 and 1950, and Cardiff West between 1950 and his retirement from the Commons at the 1983 general election. When the Labour Party came to power under Harold Wilson in 1964, Thomas was made joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, In April 1966 he was appointed Minister of State for Wales, and was one of the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster in October 1966.

Thomas initially showed sympathy to the people of the village, where a NCB colliery spoil tip slid down a hillside and engulfed houses and a primary school, killing 144 people, 116 of them children. Disagreements subsequently arose, when Thomas refused to order the removal of the other tips surrounding the village, for which the villagers were campaigning. When the government ultimately acceded to the demands for removal, it took £150,000 from the Aberfan relief fund – raised to help the victims of the disaster and their families – in part payment of the costs. Just over 30 years later, the money was refunded by the newly appointed Secretary of State for Wales Ron Davies who described it as, &quot;a wrong that needed to be righted.&quot;

In early 1967 he became Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs. As Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970 he presided over the investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969. Thomas was fervently attached to the Royal Family and also strongly opposed to Plaid Cymru, and particularly to the Welsh Language Society.

In 1974 Thomas was elected Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. Two years later he succeeded Selwyn Lloyd as Speaker of the House of Commons. The first broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings (although only the sound was broadcast until 1989, not live pictures) brought him unprecedented public attention, but he proved more impartial than party colleagues had expected. In June 1983 he retired and, a month later, on 11th July 1983, he was raised to the peerage with a hereditary peerage as Viscount Tonypandy, of Rhondda in the County of Mid Glamorgan. Thomas&#x27;s was the last creation of a Viscountcy in the UK; William Whitelaw, who is often cited as the last such creation, received his in June 1983, a month earlier than Thomas.

In 1983 Thomas was awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD) honoris causa by the University of Leeds. The same year he was the subject of the television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, ahead of a charity concert for the National Children&#x27;s Homes.

In the House of Lords Thomas was an outspoken critic of the European Union and the Maastricht Treaty, and in a June 1993 debate, he endorsed Baroness Thatcher’s comments and defended her after Lord Jenkins of Hillhead had criticised her similar &quot;extreme&quot; views against further European sociopolitical integration.

Thomas&#x27;s opposition to Welsh nationalism was finally expressed in hostility to the Blair government&#x27;s devolution proposals of 1997. He was asked by Robert Hodge, son of Sir Julian Hodge, to be a member of the steering committee of the &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign (which opposed devolution in 1997). Despite ailing from cancer, Thomas agreed to a ceremonial role and became president. Other known persons in the movement included Nick Bourne, David Davies (Monmouth MP) and Alun Cairns.

During that year, he also gave his very high-profile endorsement of Sir James Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party, believing that the European Union was compromising the sovereignty of Parliament. He also wrote the foreword to Adrian Hilton&#x27;s book on this issue, &quot;The Principality and Power of Europe.&quot; 

Outside Parliament, Lord Tonypandy was Chairman of the Bank of Wales between 1985 and 1991.

A portrait of Thomas in the robes of the Speaker is part of the Parliamentary Art Collection.

==Personal life==
After Lord Tonypandy&#x27;s death, former Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse revealed that Thomas had been homosexual and had been blackmailed because of it. Abse, the MP who introduced the private member&#x27;s bill which partially decriminalised homosexuality in Britain, discussed this incident in his book &quot;Tony Blair: The Man Behind the Smile.&quot; He said that Thomas had paid money to blackmailers to keep information related to his private life secret. Abse said that he had once lent Thomas £800 to pay off blackmailers, and had also provided advice when Thomas contracted a venereal disease from a rent boy. Abse wrote that, while being otherwise a tough and fearless politician, Thomas would &quot;dangerously over-react and panic if there was the slightest sign of a crack in the thin ice upon which he skated all this life ... The slightest tremor of scandal ... reduced him to a jelly.&quot; He also explained that he had decided to reveal Thomas&#x27;s sexuality because he thought that &quot;the gifts he gave to the nation fundamentally arose because of, not despite, his sexual orientation&quot;, adding that he brought &quot;a feminine sensibility and empathy&quot; to politics.

Throughout his career Thomas remained a deeply religious man, and was a prominent member of the Methodist Church. He was a local preacher and former Vice-President of the Methodist Conference. Known by the nickname &quot;Tommy Twice&quot; (from his full name), his Welsh-accented cries of &quot;Order! Order!&quot; as Speaker were familiar to a generation of Britons.

Lord Tonypandy died in Cardiff on 22 September 1997. He was twice engaged to be married but he never did, so there was no heir to the viscountcy, which became extinct. He is buried at Trealaw Cemetery.

==Allegations of sexual abuse==

In July 2014, British media carried reports that the South Wales Police were investigating allegations that Thomas had sexually abused a boy aged nine in the late 1960s. In March 2015, South Wales Police confirmed that they were investigating claims that he had been involved in child abuse. The probe ended in March 2017 with no action being taken.

<text>PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), officially abbreviated as PCIe or PCI-E, is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard, meant to replace the older PCI, PCI-X and AGP bus standards. It is the common motherboard interface for personal computers&#x27; graphics cards, capture cards, sound cards, hard disk drive host adapters, SSDs, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet hardware connections. PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count, smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism (Advanced Error Reporting, AER), and native hot-swap functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware support for I/O virtualization.

The PCI Express electrical interface is measured by the number of simultaneous lanes. (A lane is a single send/receive line of data, analogous to a &quot;one-lane road&quot; having one lane of traffic in both directions.) The interface is also used in a variety of other standards — most notably the laptop expansion card interface called ExpressCard. It is also used in the storage interfaces of SATA Express, U.2 (SFF-8639) and M.2.

Formal specifications are maintained and developed by the PCI-SIG (PCI Special Interest Group) — a group of more than 900 companies that also maintains the conventional PCI specifications.

== Architecture ==

Conceptually, the PCI Express bus is a high-speed serial replacement of the older PCI/PCI-X bus. One of the key differences between the PCI Express bus and the older PCI is the bus topology; PCI uses a shared parallel bus architecture, in which the PCI host and all devices share a common set of address, data, and control lines. In contrast, PCI Express is based on point-to-point topology, with separate serial links connecting every device to the root complex (host). Because of its shared bus topology, access to the older PCI bus is arbitrated (in the case of multiple masters), and limited to one master at a time, in a single direction. Furthermore, the older PCI clocking scheme limits the bus clock to the slowest peripheral on the bus (regardless of the devices involved in the bus transaction). In contrast, a PCI Express bus link supports full-duplex communication between any two endpoints, with no inherent limitation on concurrent access across multiple endpoints.

In terms of bus protocol, PCI Express communication is encapsulated in packets. The work of packetizing and de-packetizing data and status-message traffic is handled by the transaction layer of the PCI Express port (described later). Radical differences in electrical signaling and bus protocol require the use of a different mechanical form factor and expansion connectors (and thus, new motherboards and new adapter boards); PCI slots and PCI Express slots are not interchangeable. At the software level, PCI Express preserves backward compatibility with PCI; legacy PCI system software can detect and configure newer PCI Express devices without explicit support for the PCI Express standard, though new PCI Express features are inaccessible.

The PCI Express link between two devices can vary in size from one to 16 lanes. In a multi-lane link, the packet data is striped across lanes, and peak data throughput scales with the overall link width. The lane count is automatically negotiated during device initialization and can be restricted by either endpoint. For example, a single-lane PCI Express (x1) card can be inserted into a multi-lane slot (x4, x8, etc.), and the initialization cycle auto-negotiates the highest mutually supported lane count. The link can dynamically down-configure itself to use fewer lanes, providing a failure tolerance in case bad or unreliable lanes are present. The PCI Express standard defines link widths of x1, x2, x4, x8, and x16. Up to and including PCIe 5.0, x12, and x32 links were defined as well but virtually never used. This allows the PCI Express bus to serve both cost-sensitive applications where high throughput is not needed, and performance-critical applications such as 3D graphics, networking (10 Gigabit Ethernet or multiport Gigabit Ethernet), and enterprise storage (SAS or Fibre Channel). Slots and connectors are only defined for a subset of these widths, with link widths in between using the next larger physical slot size.

As a point of reference, a PCI-X (133 MHz 64-bit) device and a PCI Express 1.0 device using four lanes (x4) have roughly the same peak single-direction transfer rate of 1064 MB/s. The PCI Express bus has the potential to perform better than the PCI-X bus in cases where multiple devices are transferring data simultaneously, or if communication with the PCI Express peripheral is bidirectional.

=== Interconnect ===
PCI Express devices communicate via a logical connection called an &quot;interconnect&quot; or &quot;link&quot;. A link is a point-to-point communication channel between two PCI Express ports allowing both of them to send and receive ordinary PCI requests (configuration, I/O or memory read/write) and interrupts (INTx, MSI or MSI-X). At the physical level, a link is composed of one or more &quot;lanes&quot;. Low-speed peripherals (such as an 802.11 Wi-Fi card) use a single-lane (x1) link, while a graphics adapter typically uses a much wider and therefore faster 16-lane (x16) link.

=== Lane ===
A lane is composed of two differential signaling pairs, with one pair for receiving data and the other for transmitting. Thus, each lane is composed of four wires or signal traces. Conceptually, each lane is used as a full-duplex byte stream, transporting data packets in eight-bit &quot;byte&quot; format simultaneously in both directions between endpoints of a link. Physical PCI Express links may contain 1, 4, 8 or 16 lanes. Lane counts are written with an &quot;x&quot; prefix (for example, &quot;x8&quot; represents an eight-lane card or slot), with x16 being the largest size in common use. Lane sizes are also referred to via the terms &quot;width&quot; or &quot;by&quot; e.g., an eight-lane slot could be referred to as a &quot;by 8&quot; or as &quot;8 lanes wide.&quot;

For mechanical card sizes, see below.

=== Serial bus ===

The bonded serial bus architecture was chosen over the traditional parallel bus because of the inherent limitations of the latter, including half-duplex operation, excess signal count, and inherently lower bandwidth due to timing skew. Timing skew results from separate electrical signals within a parallel interface traveling through conductors of different lengths, on potentially different printed circuit board (PCB) layers, and at possibly different signal velocities. Despite being transmitted simultaneously as a single word, signals on a parallel interface have different travel duration and arrive at their destinations at different times. When the interface clock period is shorter than the largest time difference between signal arrivals, recovery of the transmitted word is no longer possible. Since timing skew over a parallel bus can amount to a few nanoseconds, the resulting bandwidth limitation is in the range of hundreds of megahertz.

A serial interface does not exhibit timing skew because there is only one differential signal in each direction within each lane, and there is no external clock signal since clocking information is embedded within the serial signal itself. As such, typical bandwidth limitations on serial signals are in the multi-gigahertz range. PCI Express is one example of the general trend toward replacing parallel buses with serial interconnects; other examples include Serial ATA (SATA), USB, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), FireWire (IEEE 1394), and RapidIO. In digital video, examples in common use are DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort.

Multichannel serial design increases flexibility with its ability to allocate fewer lanes for slower devices.

== Form factors ==

=== PCI Express (standard) ===
A PCI Express card fits into a slot of its physical size or larger (with x16 as the largest used), but may not fit into a smaller PCI Express slot; for example, a x16 card may not fit into a x4 or x8 slot. Some slots use open-ended sockets to permit physically longer cards and negotiate the best available electrical and logical connection.

The number of lanes actually connected to a slot may also be fewer than the number supported by the physical slot size. An example is a x16 slot that runs at x4, which accepts any x1, x2, x4, x8 or x16 card, but provides only four lanes. Its specification may read as &quot;x16 (x4 mode)&quot;, while &quot;mechanical @ electrical&quot; notation (e.g. &quot;x16 @ x4&quot;) is also common. The advantage is that such slots can accommodate a larger range of PCI Express cards without requiring motherboard hardware to support the full transfer rate. Standard mechanical sizes are x1, x4, x8, and x16. Cards using a number of lanes other than the standard mechanical sizes need to physically fit the next larger mechanical size (e.g. an x2 card uses the x4 size, or an x12 card uses the x16 size).

The cards themselves are designed and manufactured in various sizes. For example, solid-state drives (SSDs) that come in the form of PCI Express cards often use HHHL (half height, half length) and FHHL (full height, half length) to describe the physical dimensions of the card.

==== Non-standard video card form factors ====
Modern (since ) gaming video cards usually exceed the height as well as thickness specified in the PCI Express standard, due to the need for more capable and quieter cooling fans, as gaming video cards often emit hundreds of watts of heat. Modern computer cases are often wider to accommodate these taller cards, but not always. Since full-length cards (312 mm) are uncommon, modern cases sometimes cannot fit those. The thickness of these cards also typically occupies the space of 2 to 5 PCIe slots. In fact, even the methodology of how to measure the cards varies between vendors, with some including the metal bracket size in dimensions and others not.

For instance, comparing three high-end video cards released in 2020: a Sapphire Radeon RX 5700 XT card measures 135 mm in height (excluding the metal bracket), which exceeds the PCIe standard height by 28 mm, another Radeon RX 5700 XT card by XFX measures 55 mm thick (i.e. 2.7 PCI slots at 20.32 mm), taking up 3 PCIe slots, while an Asus GeForce RTX 3080 video card takes up two slots and measures 140.1mm × 318.5mm × 57.8mm, exceeding PCI Express&#x27;s maximum height, length, and thickness respectively.

==== Pinout ====
The following table identifies the conductors on each side of the edge connector on a PCI Express card. The solder side of the printed circuit board (PCB) is the A-side, and the component side is the B-side. PRSNT1# and PRSNT2# pins must be slightly shorter than the rest, to ensure that a hot-plugged card is fully inserted. The WAKE# pin uses full voltage to wake the computer, but must be pulled high from the standby power to indicate that the card is wake capable.

==== Power ====
===== Slot power =====

All PCI express cards may consume up to at (). The amount of +12 V and total power they may consume depends on the form factor and the role of the card:
* x1 cards are limited to 0.5 A at +12V (6 W) and 10 W combined.
* x4 and wider cards are limited to 2.1 A at +12V (25 W) and 25 W combined.
* A full-sized x1 card may draw up to the 25 W limits after initialization and software configuration as a high-power device.
* A full-sized x16 graphics card may draw up to 5.5 A at +12V (66 W) and 75 W combined after initialization and software configuration as a high-power device.

===== 6- and 8-pin power connectors =====
Optional connectors add (6-pin) or (8-pin) of +12 V power for up to total ().
* Sense0 pin is connected to ground by the cable or power supply, or float on board if cable is not connected.
* Sense1 pin is connected to ground by the cable or power supply, or float on board if cable is not connected.

Some cards use two 8-pin connectors, but this has not been standardized yet , therefore such cards must not carry the official PCI Express logo. This configuration allows 375 W total () and will likely be standardized by PCI-SIG with the PCI Express 4.0 standard. The 8-pin PCI Express connector could be confused with the EPS12V connector, which is mainly used for powering SMP and multi-core systems. The power connectors are variants of the Molex Mini-Fit Jr. series connectors.


===== 12VHPWR connector =====
===== 48VHPWR connector =====
In 2023 PCIe 5.1 CEM introduced a connector for 48 V with just two current-carrying contacts and four sense pins. The contacts are rated for 15 A continuous current.


=== PCI Express Mini Card ===


PCI Express Mini Card (also known as Mini PCI Express, Mini PCIe, Mini PCI-E, mPCIe, and PEM), based on PCI Express, is a replacement for the Mini PCI form factor. It is developed by the PCI-SIG. The host device supports both PCI Express and USB 2.0 connectivity, and each card may use either standard. Most laptop computers built after 2005 use PCI Express for expansion cards; however, , many vendors are moving toward using the newer M.2 form factor for this purpose.

Due to different dimensions, PCI Express Mini Cards are not physically compatible with standard full-size PCI Express slots; however, passive adapters exist that let them be used in full-size slots. 

==== Physical dimensions ====
Dimensions of PCI Express Mini Cards are 30 mm × 50.95 mm (width × length) for a Full Mini Card. There is a 52-pin edge connector, consisting of two staggered rows on a 0.8 mm pitch. Each row has eight contacts, a gap equivalent to four contacts, then a further 18 contacts. Boards have a thickness of 1.0 mm, excluding the components. A &quot;Half Mini Card&quot; (sometimes abbreviated as HMC) is also specified, having approximately half the physical length of 26.8 mm. There are also half size mini PCIe cards that are 30 x 31.90 mm which is about half the length of a full size mini PCIe card. 

==== Electrical interface ====
PCI Express Mini Card edge connectors provide multiple connections and buses:
* PCI Express x1 (with SMBus)
* USB 2.0
* Wires to diagnostics LEDs for wireless network (i.e., Wi-Fi) status on computer&#x27;s chassis
* SIM card for GSM and WCDMA applications (UIM signals on spec.)
* Future extension for another PCIe lane
* 1.5 V and 3.3 V power

==== Mini-SATA (mSATA) variant ====

Despite sharing the Mini PCI Express form factor, an mSATA slot is not necessarily electrically compatible with Mini PCI Express. For this reason, only certain notebooks are compatible with mSATA drives. Most compatible systems are based on Intel&#x27;s Sandy Bridge processor architecture, using the Huron River platform. Notebooks such as Lenovo&#x27;s ThinkPad T, W and X series, released in March–April 2011, have support for an mSATA SSD card in their WWAN card slot. The ThinkPad Edge E220s/E420s, and the Lenovo IdeaPad Y460/Y560/Y570/Y580 also support mSATA. On the contrary, the L-series among others can only support M.2 cards using the PCIe standard in the WWAN slot.

Some notebooks (notably the Asus Eee PC, the Apple MacBook Air, and the Dell mini9 and mini10) use a variant of the PCI Express Mini Card as an SSD. This variant uses the reserved and several non-reserved pins to implement SATA and IDE interface passthrough, keeping only USB, ground lines, and sometimes the core PCIe x1 bus intact. This makes the &quot;miniPCIe&quot; flash and solid-state drives sold for netbooks largely incompatible with true PCI Express Mini implementations.

Also, the typical Asus miniPCIe SSD is 71 mm long, causing the Dell 51 mm model to often be (incorrectly) referred to as half length. A true 51 mm Mini PCIe SSD was announced in 2009, with two stacked PCB layers that allow for higher storage capacity. The announced design preserves the PCIe interface, making it compatible with the standard mini PCIe slot. No working product has yet been developed.

Intel has numerous desktop boards with the PCIe x1 Mini-Card slot that typically do not support mSATA SSD. A list of desktop boards that natively support mSATA in the PCIe x1 Mini-Card slot (typically multiplexed with a SATA port) is provided on the Intel Support site.

=== PCI Express M.2 ===

M.2 replaces the mSATA standard and Mini PCIe. Computer bus interfaces provided through the M.2 connector are PCI Express 3.0 or higher (up to four lanes), Serial ATA 3.0, and USB 3.0 (a single logical port for each of the latter two). It is up to the manufacturer of the M.2 host or device to choose which interfaces to support, depending on the desired level of host support and device type.

=== PCI Express External Cabling ===
&quot;PCI Express External Cabling&quot; (also known as &quot;External PCI Express&quot;, &quot;Cabled PCI Express&quot;, or &quot;ePCIe&quot;) specifications were released by the PCI-SIG in February 2007.

Standard cables and connectors have been defined for x1, x4, x8, and x16 link widths, with a transfer rate of 250 MB/s per lane. The PCI-SIG also expects the norm to evolve to reach 500 MB/s, as in PCI Express 2.0. An example of the uses of Cabled PCI Express is a metal enclosure, containing a number of PCIe slots and PCIe-to-ePCIe adapter circuitry. This device would not be possible had it not been for the ePCIe specification.

====PCI Express OCuLink====
&quot;OCuLink&quot; (standing for &quot;optical-copper link&quot;, since &quot;Cu&quot; is the chemical symbol for copper) is an extension for the &quot;cable version of PCI Express&quot;. Version 1.0 of OCuLink, released in Oct 2015, supports up to 4 PCIe 3.0 lanes (3.9 GB/s) over copper cabling; a fiber optic version may appear in the future.

The most recent version of OCuLink, OCuLink-2, supports up to 16 GB/s (PCIe 4.0 x8) while the maximum bandwidth of a USB 4 cable is 10GB/s.

While initially intended for use in laptops for the connection of powerful external GPU boxes, OCuLink&#x27;s popularity lies primarily in its use for PCIe interconnections in servers, a more prevalent application.

=== Derivative forms ===
Numerous other form factors use, or are able to use, PCIe. These include:
* Low-height card
* ExpressCard: Successor to the PC Card form factor (with x1 PCIe and USB 2.0; hot-pluggable)
* PCI Express ExpressModule: A hot-pluggable modular form factor defined for servers and workstations
* XQD card: A PCI Express-based flash card standard by the CompactFlash Association with x2 PCIe
* CFexpress card: A PCI Express-based flash card by the CompactFlash Association in three form factors supporting 1 to 4 PCIe lanes
* SD card: The SD Express bus, introduced in version 7.0 of the SD specification uses a x1 PCIe link
* XMC: Similar to the CMC/PMC form factor (VITA 42.3)
* AdvancedTCA: A complement to CompactPCI for larger applications; supports serial based backplane topologies
* AMC: A complement to the AdvancedTCA specification; supports processor and I/O modules on ATCA boards (x1, x2, x4 or x8 PCIe).
* FeaturePak: A tiny expansion card format (43mm × 65 mm) for embedded and small-form-factor applications, which implements two x1 PCIe links on a high-density connector along with USB, I2C, and up to 100 points of I/O
* Universal IO: A variant from Super Micro Computer Inc designed for use in low-profile rack-mounted chassis. It has the connector bracket reversed so it cannot fit in a normal PCI Express socket, but it is pin-compatible and may be inserted if the bracket is removed.
* M.2 (formerly known as NGFF)
* M-PCIe brings PCIe 3.0 to mobile devices (such as tablets and smartphones), over the M-PHY physical layer.
* U.2 (formerly known as SFF-8639)
* SlimSAS

The PCIe slot connector can also carry protocols other than PCIe. Some 9xx series Intel chipsets support Serial Digital Video Out, a proprietary technology that uses a slot to transmit video signals from the host CPU&#x27;s integrated graphics instead of PCIe, using a supported add-in.

The PCIe transaction-layer protocol can also be used over some other interconnects, which are not electrically PCIe:
* Thunderbolt: A royalty-free interconnect standard by Intel that combines DisplayPort and PCIe protocols in a form factor compatible with Mini DisplayPort. Thunderbolt 3.0 also combines USB 3.1 and uses the USB-C form factor as opposed to Mini DisplayPort.
* USB4

== History and revisions ==
While in early development, PCIe was initially referred to as &quot;HSI&quot; (for &quot;High Speed Interconnect&quot;), and underwent a name change to &quot;3GIO&quot; (for &quot;3rd Generation I/O&quot;) before finally settling on its PCI-SIG name &quot;PCI Express&quot;. A technical working group named the &quot;Arapaho Work Group&quot; (AWG) drew up the standard. For initial drafts, the AWG consisted only of Intel engineers; subsequently, the AWG expanded to include industry partners.

Since, PCIe has undergone several large and smaller revisions, improving on performance and other features.

===Comparison table===
; Notes
=== PCI Express 1.0a ===
In 2003, PCI-SIG introduced PCIe 1.0a, with a per-lane data rate of 250 MB/s and a transfer rate of 2.5 gigatransfers per second (GT/s).

Transfer rate is expressed in transfers per second instead of bits per second because the number of transfers includes the overhead bits, which do not provide additional throughput; PCIe 1.x uses an 8b/10b encoding scheme, resulting in a 20% (= 2/10) overhead on the raw channel bandwidth. So in the PCIe terminology, transfer rate refers to the encoded bit rate: 2.5 GT/s is 2.5 Gbit/s on the encoded serial link. This corresponds to 2.0 Gbit/s of pre-coded data or 250 MB/s, which is referred to as throughput in PCIe.

====PCI Express 1.1====
In 2005, PCI-SIG introduced PCIe 1.1. This updated specification includes clarifications and several improvements, but is fully compatible with PCI Express 1.0a. No changes were made to the data rate.

=== PCI Express 2.0 ===
PCI-SIG announced the availability of the PCI Express Base 2.0 specification on 15 January 2007. The PCIe 2.0 standard doubles the transfer rate compared with PCIe 1.0 to 5GT/s and the per-lane throughput rises from 250 MB/s to 500 MB/s. Consequently, a 16-lane PCIe connector (x16) can support an aggregate throughput of up to 8 GB/s.

PCIe 2.0 motherboard slots are fully backward compatible with PCIe v1.x cards. PCIe 2.0 cards are also generally backward compatible with PCIe 1.x motherboards, using the available bandwidth of PCI Express 1.1. Overall, graphic cards or motherboards designed for v2.0 work, with the other being v1.1 or v1.0a.

The PCI-SIG also said that PCIe 2.0 features improvements to the point-to-point data transfer protocol and its software architecture.

Intel&#x27;s first PCIe 2.0 capable chipset was the X38 and boards began to ship from various vendors (Abit, Asus, Gigabyte) as of 21 October 2007. AMD started supporting PCIe 2.0 with its AMD 700 chipset series and nVidia started with the MCP72. All of Intel&#x27;s prior chipsets, including the Intel P35 chipset, supported PCIe 1.1 or 1.0a.

Like 1.x, PCIe 2.0 uses an 8b/10b encoding scheme, therefore delivering, per-lane, an effective 4 Gbit/s max. transfer rate from its 5 GT/s raw data rate.

====PCI Express 2.1====
PCI Express 2.1 (with its specification dated 4 March 2009) supports a large proportion of the management, support, and troubleshooting systems planned for full implementation in PCI Express 3.0. However, the speed is the same as PCI Express 2.0. The increase in power from the slot breaks backward compatibility between PCI Express 2.1 cards and some older motherboards with 1.0/1.0a, but most motherboards with PCI Express 1.1 connectors are provided with a BIOS update by their manufacturers through utilities to support backward compatibility of cards with PCIe 2.1.

=== PCI Express 3.0 ===
PCI Express 3.0 Base specification revision 3.0 was made available in November 2010, after multiple delays. In August 2007, PCI-SIG announced that PCI Express 3.0 would carry a bit rate of 8 gigatransfers per second (GT/s), and that it would be backward compatible with existing PCI Express implementations. At that time, it was also announced that the final specification for PCI Express 3.0 would be delayed until Q2 2010. New features for the PCI Express 3.0 specification included a number of optimizations for enhanced signaling and data integrity, including transmitter and receiver equalization, PLL improvements, clock data recovery, and channel enhancements of currently supported topologies.

Following a six-month technical analysis of the feasibility of scaling the PCI Express interconnect bandwidth, PCI-SIG&#x27;s analysis found that 8 gigatransfers per second could be manufactured in mainstream silicon process technology, and deployed with existing low-cost materials and infrastructure, while maintaining full compatibility (with negligible impact) with the PCI Express protocol stack.

PCI Express 3.0 upgraded the encoding scheme to 128b/130b from the previous 8b/10b encoding, reducing the bandwidth overhead from 20% of PCI Express 2.0 to approximately 1.54% (= 2/130). PCI Express 3.0&#x27;s 8 GT/s bit rate effectively delivers 985 MB/s per lane, nearly doubling the lane bandwidth relative to PCI Express 2.0.

On 18 November 2010, the PCI Special Interest Group officially published the finalized PCI Express 3.0 specification to its members to build devices based on this new version of PCI Express.

==== PCI Express 3.1 ====
In September 2013, PCI Express 3.1 specification was announced for release in late 2013 or early 2014, consolidating various improvements to the published PCI Express 3.0 specification in three areas: power management, performance and functionality. It was released in November 2014.

=== PCI Express 4.0 ===
On 29 November 2011, PCI-SIG preliminarily announced PCI Express 4.0, providing a 16 GT/s bit rate that doubles the bandwidth provided by PCI Express 3.0 to 31.5 GB/s in each direction for a 16-lane configuration, while maintaining backward and forward compatibility in both software support and used mechanical interface. PCI Express 4.0 specs also bring OCuLink-2, an alternative to Thunderbolt. OCuLink version 2 has up to 16 GT/s (16GB/s total for x8 lanes), while the maximum bandwidth of a Thunderbolt 3 link is 5GB/s.

In June 2016 Cadence, PLDA and Synopsys demonstrated PCIe 4.0 physical-layer, controller, switch and other IP blocks at the PCI SIG’s annual developer’s conference.
Mellanox Technologies announced the first 100Gbit/s network adapter with PCIe 4.0 on 15 June 2016, and the first 200Gbit/s network adapter with PCIe 4.0 on 10 November 2016.

In August 2016, Synopsys presented a test setup with FPGA clocking a lane to PCIe 4.0 speeds at the Intel Developer Forum. Their IP has been licensed to several firms planning to present their chips and products at the end of 2016.

On the IEEE Hot Chips Symposium in August 2016 IBM announced the first CPU with PCIe 4.0 support, POWER9.

PCI-SIG officially announced the release of the final PCI Express 4.0 specification on 8 June 2017. The spec includes improvements in flexibility, scalability, and lower-power.

On 5 December 2017 IBM announced the first system with PCIe 4.0 slots, Power AC922.

NETINT Technologies introduced the first NVMe SSD based on PCIe 4.0 on 17 July 2018, ahead of Flash Memory Summit 2018

AMD announced on 9 January 2019 its upcoming Zen 2-based processors and X570 chipset would support PCIe 4.0. AMD had hoped to enable partial support for older chipsets, but instability caused by motherboard traces not conforming to PCIe 4.0 specifications made that impossible.

Intel released their first mobile CPUs with PCI Express 4.0 support in mid-2020, as a part of the Tiger Lake microarchitecture.

=== PCI Express 5.0 ===

In June 2017, PCI-SIG announced the PCI Express 5.0 preliminary specification. Bandwidth was expected to increase to 32GT/s, yielding 63GB/s in each direction in a 16-lane configuration. The draft spec was expected to be standardized in 2019. Initially, was also considered for technical feasibility.

On 7 June 2017 at PCI-SIG DevCon, Synopsys recorded the first demonstration of PCI Express 5.0 at 32 GT/s.

On 31 May 2018, PLDA announced the availability of their XpressRICH5 PCIe 5.0 Controller IP based on draft 0.7 of the PCIe 5.0 specification on the same day.

On 10 December 2018, the PCI SIG released version 0.9 of the PCIe 5.0 specification to its members,
and on 17 January 2019, PCI SIG announced the version 0.9 had been ratified, with version 1.0 targeted for release in the first quarter of 2019.

On 29 May 2019, PCI-SIG officially announced the release of the final PCI Express 5.0 specification.

On 20 November 2019, Jiangsu Huacun presented the first PCIe 5.0 Controller HC9001 in a 12 nm manufacturing process. Production started in 2020.

On 17 August 2020, IBM announced the Power10 processor with PCIe 5.0 and up to 32 lanes per single-chip module (SCM) and up to 64 lanes per double-chip module (DCM).

On 9 September 2021, IBM announced the Power E1080 Enterprise server with planned availability date 17 September. It can have up to 16 Power10 SCMs with maximum of 32 slots per system which can act as PCIe 5.0 x8 or PCIe 4.0 x16. Alternatively they can be used as PCIe 5.0 x16 slots for optional optical CXP converter adapters connecting to external PCIe expansion drawers.

On 27 October 2021, Intel announced the 12th Gen Intel Core CPU family, the world&#x27;s first consumer x86-64 processors with PCIe 5.0 (up to 16 lanes) connectivity.

On 22 March 2022, Nvidia announced Nvidia Hopper GH100 GPU, the world&#x27;s first PCIe 5.0 GPU.

On 23 May 2022, AMD announced its Zen 4 architecture with support for up to 24 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity on consumer platforms and 128 lanes on server platforms.

=== PCI Express 6.0 ===
On 18 June 2019, PCI-SIG announced the development of PCI Express 6.0 specification. Bandwidth is expected to increase to 64GT/s, yielding 128GB/s in each direction in a 16-lane configuration, with a target release date of 2021. The new standard uses 4-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) with a low-latency forward error correction (FEC) in place of non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation. Unlike previous PCI Express versions, forward error correction is used to increase data integrity and PAM-4 is used as line code so that two bits are transferred per transfer. With 64GT/s data transfer rate (raw bit rate), up to 121GB/s in each direction is possible in x16 configuration.

On 24 February 2020, the PCI Express 6.0 revision 0.5 specification (a &quot;first draft&quot; with all architectural aspects and requirements defined) was released.

On 5 November 2020, the PCI Express 6.0 revision 0.7 specification (a &quot;complete draft&quot; with electrical specifications validated via test chips) was released.

On 6 October 2021, the PCI Express 6.0 revision 0.9 specification (a &quot;final draft&quot;) was released.

On 11 January 2022, PCI-SIG officially announced the release of the final PCI Express 6.0 specification.

On 18 March 2024, Nvidia announced Nvidia Blackwell GB100 GPU, the world&#x27;s first PCIe 6.0 GPU.

PAM-4 coding results in a vastly higher bit error rate (BER) of 10−6 (vs. 10−12 previously), so in place of 128b/130b encoding, a 3-way interlaced forward error correction (FEC) is used in addition to cyclic redundancy check (CRC). A fixed 256 byte Flow Control Unit (FLIT) block carries 242 bytes of data, which includes variable-sized transaction level packets (TLP) and data link layer payload (DLLP); remaining 14 bytes are reserved for 8-byte CRC and 6-byte FEC. 3-way Gray code is used in PAM-4/FLIT mode to reduce error rate; the interface does not switch to NRZ and 128/130b encoding even when retraining to lower data rates.

=== PCI Express 7.0 ===
On 21 June 2022, PCI-SIG announced the development of PCI Express 7.0 specification. It will deliver 128 GT/s raw bit rate and up to 242 GB/s per direction in x16 configuration, using the same PAM4 signaling as version 6.0. Doubling of the data rate will be achieved by fine-tuning channel parameters to decrease signal losses and improve power efficiency, but signal integrity is expected to be a challenge. The specification is expected to be finalized in 2025.

On 2 April 2024, PCI-SIG announced the release of PCIe 7.0 specification version 0.5; PCI Express 7.0 remains on track for release in 2025.

== Extensions and future directions ==
Some vendors offer PCIe over fiber products, with active optical cables (AOC) for PCIe switching at increased distance in PCIe expansion drawers, or in specific cases where transparent PCIe bridging is preferable to using a more mainstream standard (such as InfiniBand or Ethernet) that may require additional software to support it.

&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was co-developed by Intel and Apple as a general-purpose high speed interface combining a logical PCIe link with DisplayPort and was originally intended as an all-fiber interface, but due to early difficulties in creating a consumer-friendly fiber interconnect, nearly all implementations are copper systems. A notable exception, the Sony VAIO Z VPC-Z2, uses a nonstandard USB port with an optical component to connect to an outboard PCIe display adapter. Apple has been the primary driver of Thunderbolt adoption through 2011, though several other vendors have announced new products and systems featuring Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt 3 forms the basis of the USB4 standard.

&quot;Mobile PCIe&quot; specification (abbreviated to &quot;M-PCIe&quot;) allows PCI Express architecture to operate over the MIPI Alliance&#x27;s M-PHY physical layer technology. Building on top of already existing widespread adoption of M-PHY and its low-power design, Mobile PCIe lets mobile devices use PCI Express.

=== Draft process ===
There are 5 primary releases/checkpoints in a PCI-SIG specification:
* Draft 0.3 (Concept): this release may have few details, but outlines the general approach and goals.
* Draft 0.5 (First draft): this release has a complete set of architectural requirements and must fully address the goals set out in the 0.3 draft.
* Draft 0.7 (Complete draft): this release must have a complete set of functional requirements and methods defined, and no new functionality may be added to the specification after this release. Before the release of this draft, electrical specifications must have been validated via test silicon.
* Draft 0.9 (Final draft): this release allows PCI-SIG member companies to perform an internal review for intellectual property, and no functional changes are permitted after this draft.
* 1.0 (Final release): this is the final and definitive specification, and any changes or enhancements are through Errata documentation and Engineering Change Notices (ECNs) respectively.

Historically, the earliest adopters of a new PCIe specification generally begin designing with the Draft 0.5 as they can confidently build up their application logic around the new bandwidth definition and often even start developing for any new protocol features. At the Draft 0.5 stage, however, there is still a strong likelihood of changes in the actual PCIe protocol layer implementation, so designers responsible for developing these blocks internally may be more hesitant to begin work than those using interface IP from external sources.

== Hardware protocol summary ==
The PCIe link is built around dedicated unidirectional couples of serial (1-bit), point-to-point connections known as &quot;lanes&quot;. This is in sharp contrast to the earlier PCI connection, which is a bus-based system where all the devices share the same bidirectional, 32-bit or 64-bit parallel bus.

PCI Express is a layered protocol, consisting of a &quot;transaction layer&quot;, a &quot;data link layer&quot;, and a &quot;physical layer&quot;. The Data Link Layer is subdivided to include a media access control (MAC) sublayer. The Physical Layer is subdivided into logical and electrical sublayers. The Physical logical-sublayer contains a physical coding sublayer (PCS). The terms are borrowed from the IEEE 802 networking protocol model.

=== Physical layer ===


The PCIe Physical Layer (&quot;PHY&quot;, &quot;PCIEPHY&quot;, &quot;PCI Express PHY&quot;, or &quot;PCIe PHY&quot;) specification is divided into two sub-layers, corresponding to electrical and logical specifications. The logical sublayer is sometimes further divided into a MAC sublayer and a PCS, although this division is not formally part of the PCIe specification. A specification published by Intel, the PHY Interface for PCI Express (PIPE), defines the MAC/PCS functional partitioning and the interface between these two sub-layers. The PIPE specification also identifies the &quot;physical media attachment&quot; (PMA) layer, which includes the serializer/deserializer (SerDes) and other analog circuitry; however, since SerDes implementations vary greatly among ASIC vendors, PIPE does not specify an interface between the PCS and PMA.

At the electrical level, each lane consists of two unidirectional differential pairs operating at 2.5, 5, 8, 16 or 32 Gbit/s, depending on the negotiated capabilities. Transmit and receive are separate differential pairs, for a total of four data wires per lane.

A connection between any two PCIe devices is known as a &quot;link&quot;, and is built up from a collection of one or more &quot;lanes&quot;. All devices must minimally support single-lane (x1) link. Devices may optionally support wider links composed of up to 32 lanes. This allows for very good compatibility in two ways:
* A PCIe card physically fits (and works correctly) in any slot that is at least as large as it is (e.g., a x1 sized card works in any sized slot);
* A slot of a large physical size (e.g., x16) can be wired electrically with fewer lanes (e.g., x1, x4, x8, or x12) as long as it provides the ground connections required by the larger physical slot size.
In both cases, PCIe negotiates the highest mutually supported number of lanes. Many graphics cards, motherboards and BIOS versions are verified to support x1, x4, x8 and x16 connectivity on the same connection.

The width of a PCIe connector is 8.8 mm, while the height is 11.25 mm, and the length is variable. The fixed section of the connector is 11.65 mm in length and contains two rows of 11 pins each (22 pins total), while the length of the other section is variable depending on the number of lanes. The pins are spaced at 1 mm intervals, and the thickness of the card going into the connector is 1.6 mm.

==== Data transmission ====
PCIe sends all control messages, including interrupts, over the same links used for data. The serial protocol can never be blocked, so latency is still comparable to conventional PCI, which has dedicated interrupt lines. When the problem of IRQ sharing of pin based interrupts is taken into account and the fact that message signaled interrupts (MSI) can bypass an I/O APIC and be delivered to the CPU directly, MSI performance ends up being substantially better.

Data transmitted on multiple-lane links is interleaved, meaning that each successive byte is sent down successive lanes. The PCIe specification refers to this interleaving as &quot;data striping&quot;. While requiring significant hardware complexity to synchronize (or deskew) the incoming striped data, striping can significantly reduce the latency of the &quot;n&quot;th byte on a link. While the lanes are not tightly synchronized, there is a limit to the &quot;lane to lane skew&quot; of 20/8/6 ns for 2.5/5/8 GT/s so the hardware buffers can re-align the striped data. Due to padding requirements, striping may not necessarily reduce the latency of small data packets on a link.

As with other high data rate serial transmission protocols, the clock is embedded in the signal. At the physical level, PCI Express 2.0 utilizes the 8b/10b encoding scheme (line code) to ensure that strings of consecutive identical digits (zeros or ones) are limited in length. This coding was used to prevent the receiver from losing track of where the bit edges are. In this coding scheme every eight (uncoded) payload bits of data are replaced with 10 (encoded) bits of transmit data, causing a 20% overhead in the electrical bandwidth. To improve the available bandwidth, PCI Express version 3.0 instead uses 128b/130b encoding (1.54% overhead). Line encoding limits the run length of identical-digit strings in data streams and ensures the receiver stays synchronised to the transmitter via clock recovery.

A desirable balance (and therefore spectral density) of 0 and 1 bits in the data stream is achieved by XORing a known binary polynomial as a &quot;scrambler&quot; to the data stream in a feedback topology. Because the scrambling polynomial is known, the data can be recovered by applying the XOR a second time. Both the scrambling and descrambling steps are carried out in hardware.

Dual simplex in PCIe means there are two simplex channels on every PCIe lane. Simplex means communication is only possible in one direction. By having two simplex channels, two-way communication is made possible. One differential pair is used for each channel.

=== Data link layer ===
The data link layer performs three vital services for the PCIe link:
# sequence the transaction layer packets (TLPs) that are generated by the transaction layer,
# ensure reliable delivery of TLPs between two endpoints via an acknowledgement protocol (ACK and NAK signaling) that explicitly requires replay of unacknowledged/bad TLPs,
# initialize and manage flow control credits

On the transmit side, the data link layer generates an incrementing sequence number for each outgoing TLP. It serves as a unique identification tag for each transmitted TLP, and is inserted into the header of the outgoing TLP. A 32-bit cyclic redundancy check code (known in this context as Link CRC or LCRC) is also appended to the end of each outgoing TLP.

On the receive side, the received TLP&#x27;s LCRC and sequence number are both validated in the link layer. If either the LCRC check fails (indicating a data error), or the sequence-number is out of range (non-consecutive from the last valid received TLP), then the bad TLP, as well as any TLPs received after the bad TLP, are considered invalid and discarded. The receiver sends a negative acknowledgement message (NAK) with the sequence-number of the invalid TLP, requesting re-transmission of all TLPs forward of that sequence-number. If the received TLP passes the LCRC check and has the correct sequence number, it is treated as valid. The link receiver increments the sequence-number (which tracks the last received good TLP), and forwards the valid TLP to the receiver&#x27;s transaction layer. An ACK message is sent to remote transmitter, indicating the TLP was successfully received (and by extension, all TLPs with past sequence-numbers.)

If the transmitter receives a NAK message, or no acknowledgement (NAK or ACK) is received until a timeout period expires, the transmitter must retransmit all TLPs that lack a positive acknowledgement (ACK). Barring a persistent malfunction of the device or transmission medium, the link-layer presents a reliable connection to the transaction layer, since the transmission protocol ensures delivery of TLPs over an unreliable medium.

In addition to sending and receiving TLPs generated by the transaction layer, the data-link layer also generates and consumes data link layer packets (DLLPs). ACK and NAK signals are communicated via DLLPs, as are some power management messages and flow control credit information (on behalf of the transaction layer).

In practice, the number of in-flight, unacknowledged TLPs on the link is limited by two factors: the size of the transmitter&#x27;s replay buffer (which must store a copy of all transmitted TLPs until the remote receiver ACKs them), and the flow control credits issued by the receiver to a transmitter. PCI Express requires all receivers to issue a minimum number of credits, to guarantee a link allows sending PCIConfig TLPs and message TLPs.

=== Transaction layer ===
PCI Express implements split transactions (transactions with request and response separated by time), allowing the link to carry other traffic while the target device gathers data for the response.

PCI Express uses credit-based flow control. In this scheme, a device advertises an initial amount of credit for each received buffer in its transaction layer. The device at the
opposite end of the link, when sending transactions to this device, counts the number of credits each TLP consumes from its account. The sending device may only transmit a TLP when doing so does not make its consumed credit count exceed its credit limit. When the receiving device finishes processing the TLP from its buffer, it signals a return of credits to the sending device, which increases the credit limit by the restored amount. The credit counters are modular counters, and the comparison of consumed credits to credit limit requires modular arithmetic. The advantage of this scheme (compared to other methods such as wait states or handshake-based transfer protocols) is that the latency of credit return does not affect performance, provided that the credit limit is not encountered. This assumption is generally met if each device is designed with adequate buffer sizes.

PCIe 1.x is often quoted to support a data rate of 250 MB/s in each direction, per lane. This figure is a calculation from the physical signaling rate (2.5 gigabaud) divided by the encoding overhead (10 bits per byte). This means a sixteen lane (x16) PCIe card would then be theoretically capable of 16x250 MB/s = 4 GB/s in each direction. While this is correct in terms of data bytes, more meaningful calculations are based on the usable data payload rate, which depends on the profile of the traffic, which is a function of the high-level (software) application and intermediate protocol levels.

Like other high data rate serial interconnect systems, PCIe has a protocol and processing overhead due to the additional transfer robustness (CRC and acknowledgements). Long continuous unidirectional transfers (such as those typical in high-performance storage controllers) can approach &gt;95% of PCIe&#x27;s raw (lane) data rate. These transfers also benefit the most from increased number of lanes (x2, x4, etc.) But in more typical applications (such as a USB or Ethernet controller), the traffic profile is characterized as short data packets with frequent enforced acknowledgements. This type of traffic reduces the efficiency of the link, due to overhead from packet parsing and forced interrupts (either in the device&#x27;s host interface or the PC&#x27;s CPU). Being a protocol for devices connected to the same printed circuit board, it does not require the same tolerance for transmission errors as a protocol for communication over longer distances, and thus, this loss of efficiency is not particular to PCIe.

=== Efficiency of the link ===
As for any network-like communication links, some of the raw bandwidth is consumed by protocol overhead:

A PCIe 1.x lane for example offers a data rate on top of the physical layer of 250 MB/s (simplex). This is not the payload bandwidth but the physical layer bandwidth – a PCIe lane has to carry additional information for full functionality.
The Gen2 overhead is then 20, 24, or 28 bytes per transaction.
The Gen3 overhead is then 22, 26 or 30 bytes per transaction.

The formula_1 for a 128 byte payload is 86%, and 98% for a 1024 byte payload. For small accesses like register settings (4 bytes), the efficiency drops as low as 16%.

The maximum payload size (MPS) is set on all devices based on smallest maximum on any device in the chain. If one device has an MPS of 128 bytes, &quot;all&quot; devices of the tree must set their MPS to 128 bytes. In this case the bus will have a peak efficiency of 86% for writes.

== Applications ==

PCI Express operates in consumer, server, and industrial applications, as a motherboard-level interconnect (to link motherboard-mounted peripherals), a passive backplane interconnect and as an expansion card interface for add-in boards.

In virtually all modern () PCs, from consumer laptops and desktops to enterprise data servers, the PCIe bus serves as the primary motherboard-level interconnect, connecting the host system-processor with both integrated peripherals (surface-mounted ICs) and add-on peripherals (expansion cards). In most of these systems, the PCIe bus co-exists with one or more legacy PCI buses, for backward compatibility with the large body of legacy PCI peripherals.

, PCI Express has replaced AGP as the default interface for graphics cards on new systems. Almost all models of graphics cards released since 2010 by AMD (ATI) and Nvidia use PCI Express. Nvidia used the high-bandwidth data transfer of PCIe for its Scalable Link Interface (SLI) technology, which allowed multiple graphics cards of the same chipset and model number to run in tandem, allowing increased performance. This interface has, since, been discontinued. AMD has also developed a multi-GPU system based on PCIe called CrossFire. AMD, Nvidia, and Intel have released motherboard chipsets that support as many as four PCIe x16 slots, allowing tri-GPU and quad-GPU card configurations.

=== External GPUs ===
Theoretically, external PCIe could give a notebook the graphics power of a desktop, by connecting a notebook with any PCIe desktop video card (enclosed in its own external housing, with a power supply and cooling); this is possible with an ExpressCard or Thunderbolt interface. An ExpressCard interface provides bit rates of 5 Gbit/s (0.5 GB/s throughput), whereas a Thunderbolt interface provides bit rates of up to 40 Gbit/s (5 GB/s throughput).

In 2006, Nvidia developed the Quadro Plex external PCIe family of GPUs that can be used for advanced graphic applications for the professional market. These video cards require a PCI Express x8 or x16 slot for the host-side card, which connects to the Plex via a VHDCI carrying eight PCIe lanes.

In 2008, AMD announced the ATI XGP technology, based on a proprietary cabling system that is compatible with PCIe x8 signal transmissions. This connector is available on the Fujitsu Amilo and the Acer Ferrari One notebooks. Fujitsu launched their AMILO GraphicBooster enclosure for XGP soon thereafter. Around 2010 Acer launched the Dynavivid graphics dock for XGP.

In 2010, external card hubs were introduced that can connect to a laptop or desktop through a PCI ExpressCard slot. These hubs can accept full-sized graphics cards. Examples include MSI GUS, Village Instrument&#x27;s ViDock, the Asus XG Station, Bplus PE4H V3.2 adapter, as well as more improvised DIY devices. However such solutions are limited by the size (often only x1) and version of the available PCIe slot on a laptop.

The Intel Thunderbolt interface has provided a new option to connect with a PCIe card externally. Magma has released the ExpressBox 3T, which can hold up to three PCIe cards (two at x8 and one at x4). MSI also released the Thunderbolt GUS II, a PCIe chassis dedicated for video cards. Other products such as the Sonnet&#x27;s Echo Express and mLogic&#x27;s mLink are Thunderbolt PCIe chassis in a smaller form factor.

In 2017, more fully featured external card hubs were introduced, such as the Razer Core, which has a full-length PCIe x16 interface.

=== Storage devices ===

The PCI Express protocol can be used as data interface to flash memory devices, such as memory cards and solid-state drives (SSDs).

The XQD card is a memory card format utilizing PCI Express, developed by the CompactFlash Association, with transfer rates of up to 1 GB/s.

Many high-performance, enterprise-class SSDs are designed as PCI Express RAID controller cards. Before NVMe was standardized, many of these cards utilized proprietary interfaces and custom drivers to communicate with the operating system; they had much higher transfer rates (over 1 GB/s) and IOPS (over one million I/O operations per second) when compared to Serial ATA or SAS drives. For example, in 2011 OCZ and Marvell co-developed a native PCI Express solid-state drive controller for a PCI Express 3.0 x16 slot with maximum capacity of 12 TB and a performance of to 7.2 GB/s sequential transfers and up to 2.52 million IOPS in random transfers.

SATA Express was an interface for connecting SSDs through SATA-compatible ports, optionally providing multiple PCI Express lanes as a pure PCI Express connection to the attached storage device. M.2 is a specification for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors, which also uses multiple PCI Express lanes.

PCI Express storage devices can implement both AHCI logical interface for backward compatibility, and NVM Express logical interface for much faster I/O operations provided by utilizing internal parallelism offered by such devices. Enterprise-class SSDs can also implement SCSI over PCI Express.

=== Cluster interconnect ===
Certain data-center applications (such as large computer clusters) require the use of fiber-optic interconnects due to the distance limitations inherent in copper cabling. Typically, a network-oriented standard such as Ethernet or Fibre Channel suffices for these applications, but in some cases the overhead introduced by routable protocols is undesirable and a lower-level interconnect, such as InfiniBand, RapidIO, or NUMAlink is needed. Local-bus standards such as PCIe and HyperTransport can in principle be used for this purpose, but , solutions are only available from niche vendors such as Dolphin ICS, and TTTech Auto.

== Competing protocols ==
Other communications standards based on high bandwidth serial architectures include InfiniBand, RapidIO, HyperTransport, Intel QuickPath Interconnect, the Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI), and NVLink. Differences are based on the trade-offs between flexibility and extensibility vs latency and overhead. For example, making the system hot-pluggable, as with Infiniband but not PCI Express, requires that software track network topology changes.

Another example is making the packets shorter to decrease latency (as is required if a bus must operate as a memory interface). Smaller packets mean packet headers consume a higher percentage of the packet, thus decreasing the effective bandwidth. Examples of bus protocols designed for this purpose are RapidIO and HyperTransport.

 targeted by design as a system interconnect (local bus) rather than a device interconnect or routed network protocol. Additionally, its design goal of software transparency constrains the protocol and raises its latency somewhat.

Delays in PCIe 4.0 implementations led to the Gen-Z consortium, the CCIX effort and an open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) all being announced by the end of 2016.

On 11 March 2019, Intel presented Compute Express Link (CXL), a new interconnect bus, based on the PCI Express 5.0 physical layer infrastructure. The initial promoters of the CXL specification included: Alibaba, Cisco, Dell EMC, Facebook, Google, HPE, Huawei, Intel and Microsoft.

<text>József Bajza (31 January 1804 – 3 March 1858) was a Hungarian poet and critic.

He was born at Szűcsi and was first published in Károly Kisfaludy&#x27;s &quot;Aurora&quot;, a literary paper he edited from 1830 to 1837. He also contributed substantially to the &quot;Kritikai Lapok&quot;, the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, and the &quot;Figyelmező&quot; (Observer). His reviews of dramatic art were considered the best of these miscellaneous writings. In 1830 he published translations of some foreign dramas, &quot;Ausländische Bühne&quot;, and in 1835 a collection of his own poems. In 1837 he was made director of the newly established national theatre at Pest. He then, for some years, devoted himself to historical writing, and published in succession the &quot;Historical Library&quot; (&quot;Történeti Könyvtár&quot;), 6 vols., 1843–1845; the &quot;Modern Plutarch&quot; (&quot;Uj Plutarch&quot;), 1845–1847; and the &quot;Universal History&quot; (&quot;Világtörténet&quot;), 1847. These works are partly translations from German authors. In 1847 Bajza edited the journal of the opposition, &quot;Ellenor&quot;, at Leipzig, and in March 1848 Lajos Kossuth made him editor of his paper, &quot;Kossuth Hirlapja&quot;. In 1850 he fell ill with a brain disease, and he died in Pest in 1858.

== Legacy ==

* In Szűcsi, a permanent exhibition about his life and work can be viewed at the Bajza Memorial House.
* In Budapest, a bust of him is displayed in the lobby of the National Theatre.
* In Hatvan, Bajza József High School is named after him.
* Several cities and towns in Hungary have named streets or public squares after him, including Békéscsaba, Budapest, Cibakháza, Gyula, Hódmezővásárhely, Jászszentlászló, Kiskunfélegyháza, Kiskunhalas, Makó, Nagykanizsa, Szeged, Tiszakécske, Tótkomlós, Vésztő, Debrecen, and Dombóvár.

<text>HIPPI, short for High Performance Parallel Interface, is a computer bus for the attachment of high speed storage devices to supercomputers, in a point-to-point link. It was popular in the late 1980s and into the mid-to-late 1990s, but has since been replaced by ever-faster standard interfaces like Fibre Channel and 10 Gigabit Ethernet.

HIPPI was the first “near-gigabit” (0.8 Gbit/s) (ANSI) standard for network data transmission. It was specifically designed for supercomputers and was never intended for mass market networks such as Ethernet. Many of the features developed for HIPPI were integrated into such technologies as InfiniBand. What is remarkable about HIPPI is that it came out when Ethernet was still a 10 Mbit/s data link and SONET at OC-3 (155 Mbit/s) was considered leading edge technology.

The first HIPPI standard (HIPPI-PH) defined a 50-pair (100-wire) unidirectional twisted pair cable, running at 800 Mbit/s (100 MB/s) with maximum range limited to . A bidirectional connection therefore required two separate cables. 32 bits are transferred in parallel with a 25 MHz clock. Later standards included a 1600 Mbit/s (200 MB/s) mode (using two cables running at the same 25 MHz clock in parallel) as well as Serial HIPPI using fibre optics with a maximum range of .

HIPPI usage dwindled in the late 1990s. This was partly because Ultra3 SCSI offered rates of 320 MB/s and was available at almost any computer store at commodity prices. Meanwhile, Fibre Channel offered simple interconnect with both HIPPI and SCSI (it can run both protocols) and speeds of up to 400 MB/s on fibre and 100 MB/s on a single pair of twisted pair copper wires. Both of these systems have since been supplanted by even higher performance systems during the 2000s.

==GSN - HIPPI-6400 ==
From 1996 on an effort to improve the speed resulted in HIPPI-6400, which was later renamed to GSN (for Gigabyte System Network), but GSN saw little use due to competing standards and high cost. GSN has a full-duplex bandwidth of 6400 Mbit/s or 800 MB/s in each direction. GSN was developed by Silicon Graphics and Los Alamos National Laboratory. It uses a parallel interface for higher speeds.

GSN copper cables (HIPPI-6400-PH) are limited to . Like HiPPI-800, GSN uses two separate simplex channels (one in each direction). Unlike HiPPI-800, they are combined in a single cable and connector. Each channel consists of 16 data lines, four control lines, one framing line and two clock lines, for a total of 23 lines, all of which are differential. The connectors (Berg Micropax 100) have 100 pins total, of which 92 (23×2×2) are used.

Fiber-optic cables (HIPPI-6400-OPT) are limited to 1 km. It uses the same principal signals as the copper interface, but runs everything at twice the clock rate, which halves the number of data and control fibers. Each channel thus consists of 8 data fibers, two control fibers and one clock and framing fiber each. All 12 fibers of a channel are bundled in a single multi-fiber connector and cable. A full-duplex connection thus consists of two separate cables.

<text>Fibre Channel (FC) is a high-speed data transfer protocol providing in-order, lossless delivery of raw block data. Fibre Channel is primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers in storage area networks (SAN) in commercial data centers.

Fibre Channel networks form a switched fabric because the switches in a network operate in unison as one big switch. Fibre Channel typically runs on optical fiber cables within and between data centers, but can also run on copper cabling. Supported data rates include 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 gigabit per second resulting from improvements in successive technology generations. The industry now notates this as Gigabit Fibre Channel (GFC).

There are various upper-level protocols for Fibre Channel, including two for block storage. Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) is a protocol that transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks. FICON is a protocol that transports ESCON commands, used by IBM mainframe computers, over Fibre Channel. Fibre Channel can be used to transport data from storage systems that use solid-state flash memory storage medium by transporting NVMe protocol commands.

== Etymology ==
When the technology was originally devised, it ran over optical fiber cables only and, as such, was called &quot;Fiber Channel&quot;. Later, the ability to run over copper cabling was added to the specification. In order to avoid confusion and to create a unique name, the industry decided to change the spelling and use the British English &quot;fibre&quot; for the name of the standard.

== History ==
Fibre Channel is standardized in the T11 Technical Committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS), an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-accredited standards committee. Fibre Channel started in 1988, with ANSI standard approval in 1994, to merge the benefits of multiple physical layer implementations including SCSI, HIPPI and ESCON.

Fibre Channel was designed as a serial interface to overcome limitations of the SCSI and HIPPI physical-layer parallel-signal copper wire interfaces. Such interfaces face the challenge of, among other things, maintaining signal timing coherence across all the data-signal wires (8, 16 and finally 32 for SCSI, 50 for HIPPI) so that a receiver can determine when all the electrical signal values are &quot;good&quot; (stable and valid for simultaneous reception sampling). This challenge becomes evermore difficult in a mass-manufactured technology as data signal frequencies increase, with part of the technical compensation being ever reducing the supported connecting copper-parallel cable length. See Parallel SCSI. FC was developed with leading-edge multi-mode optical fiber technologies that overcame the speed limitations of the ESCON protocol. By appealing to the large base of SCSI disk drives and leveraging mainframe technologies, Fibre Channel developed economies of scale for advanced technologies and deployments became economical and widespread.

Commercial products were released while the standard was still in draft. By the time the standard was ratified lower speed versions were already growing out of use. Fibre Channel was the first serial storage transport to achieve gigabit speeds where it saw wide adoption, and its success grew with each successive speed. Fibre Channel has doubled in speed every few years since 1996.

In addition to a modern physical layer, Fibre Channel also added support for any number of &quot;upper layer&quot; protocols, including ATM, IP (IPFC) and FICON, with SCSI (FCP) being the predominant usage.

Fibre Channel has seen active development since its inception, with numerous speed improvements on a variety of underlying transport media. The following tables shows the progression of native Fibre Channel speeds:
FC used throughout all applications for Fibre Channel infrastructure and devices, including edge and ISL interconnects. Each speed maintains backward compatibility at least two previous generations (I.e., 32GFC backward compatible to 16GFC and 8GFC)

Inter-Switch Links, ISLs, are usually multi-lane interconnects used for non-edge, core connections, and other high speed applications demanding maximum bandwidth. ISL’s utilize high bit-rates to accommodate the funneling of edge connections. Some ISL solutions are vendor-proprietary.

==Characteristics==
Two major characteristics of Fibre Channel networks are in-order delivery and lossless delivery of raw block data. Lossless delivery of raw data block is achieved based on a credit mechanism.

==Topologies==
There are three major Fibre Channel topologies, describing how a number of ports are connected together. A &quot;port&quot; in Fibre Channel terminology is any entity that actively communicates over the network, not necessarily a hardware port. This port is usually implemented in a device such as disk storage, a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) network connection on a server or a Fibre Channel switch.

* (see &quot;FC-FS-3&quot;). Two devices are connected directly to each other using N_ports. This is the simplest topology, with limited connectivity. The bandwidth is dedicated. 
* Arbitrated loop (see &quot;FC-AL-2&quot;). In this design, all devices are in a loop or ring, similar to Token Ring networking. Adding or removing a device from the loop causes all activity on the loop to be interrupted. The failure of one device causes a break in the ring. Fibre Channel hubs exist to connect multiple devices together and may bypass failed ports. A loop may also be made by cabling each port to the next in a ring.
** A minimal loop containing only two ports, while appearing to be similar to point-to-point, differs considerably in terms of the protocol.
** Only one pair of ports can communicate concurrently on a loop.
** Maximum speed of 8GFC.
** Arbitrated Loop has been rarely used after 2010 and its support is being discontinued for new gen switches.
* Switched Fabric (see &quot;FC-SW-6&quot;). In this design, all devices are connected to Fibre Channel switches, similar conceptually to modern Ethernet implementations. Advantages of this topology over point-to-point or Arbitrated Loop include:
** The Fabric can scale to tens of thousands of ports.
** The switches manage the state of the Fabric, providing optimized paths via Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) data routing protocol.
** The traffic between two ports flows through the switches and not through any other ports like in Arbitrated Loop.
** Failure of a port is isolated to a link and should not affect operation of other ports.
** Multiple pairs of ports may communicate simultaneously in a Fabric.

== Layers ==

Fibre Channel does not follow the OSI model layering, and is split into five layers:
* FC-4 – Protocol-mapping layer, in which upper-level protocols such as NVM Express (NVMe), SCSI, IP, and FICON are encapsulated into Information Units (IUs) for delivery to FC-2. Current FC-4s include FCP-4, FC-SB-5, and FC-NVMe.
* FC-3 – Common services layer, a thin layer that could eventually implement functions like encryption or RAID redundancy algorithms; multiport connections;
* FC-2 – Signaling Protocol, defined by the &quot;Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling&quot; standard, consists of the low level Fibre Channel network protocols; port to port connections;
* FC-1 – Transmission Protocol, which implements line coding of signals;
* FC-0 – physical layer, defined by &quot;Fibre Channel Physical Interfaces&quot; standard, includes cabling, connectors etc.;

Fibre Channel products are available at 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 16 and 32 and ; these protocol flavors are called accordingly 1GFC, 2GFC, 4GFC, 8GFC, 10GFC, 16GFC, 32GFC or 128GFC. The 32GFC standard was approved by the INCITS T11 committee in 2013, and those products became available in 2016. The 1GFC, 2GFC, 4GFC, 8GFC designs all use 8b/10b encoding, while the 10GFC and 16GFC standard uses 64b/66b encoding. Unlike the 10GFC standards, 16GFC provides backward compatibility with 4GFC and 8GFC since it provides exactly twice the throughput of 8GFC or four times that of 4GFC.

==Ports==
Fibre Channel ports come in a variety of logical configurations. The most common types of ports are:
* N_Port (Node port) An N_Port is typically an HBA port that connects to a switch&#x27;s F_Port or another N_Port. Nx_Port communicating through a PN_Port that is not operating a Loop Port State Machine.
* F_Port (Fabric port) An F_Port is a switch port that is connected to an N_Port.
* E_Port (Expansion port) Switch port that attaches to another E_Port to create an Inter-Switch Link.

Fibre Channel Loop protocols create multiple types of Loop Ports:
* L_Port (Loop port) FC_Port that contains Arbitrated Loop functions associated with the Arbitrated Loop topology.
* FL_Port (Fabric Loop port) L_Port that is able to perform the function of an F_Port, attached via a link to one or more NL_Ports in an Arbitrated Loop topology.
* NL_Port (Node Loop port) PN_Port that is operating a Loop port state machine.

If a port can support loop and non-loop functionality, the port is known as:
* Fx_Port switch port capable of operating as an F_Port or FL_Port.
* Nx_Port end point for Fibre Channel frame communication, having a distinct address identifier and Name_Identifier, providing an independent set of FC-2V functions to higher levels, and having the ability to act as an Originator, a Responder, or both.

Ports have virtual components and physical components and are described as:
* PN_Port entity that includes a Link_Control_Facility and one or more Nx_Ports.
* VF_Port (Virtual F_Port) instance of the FC-2V sublevel that connects to one or more VN_Ports.
* VN_Port (Virtual N_Port) instance of the FC-2V sublevel. VN_Port is used when it is desired to emphasize support for multiple Nx_Ports on a single Multiplexer (e.g., via a single PN_Port).
* VE_Port (Virtual E_Port) instance of the FC-2V sublevel that connects to another VE_Port or to a B_Port to create an Inter-Switch Link.

The following types of ports are also used in Fibre Channel:
* A_Port (Adjacent port) combination of one PA_Port and one VA_Port operating together.
* B_Port (Bridge Port) Fabric inter-element port used to connect bridge devices with E_Ports on a Switch.
* D_Port (Diagnostic Port) A configured port used to perform diagnostic tests on a link with another D_Port.
* EX_Port A type of E_Port used to connect to an FC router fabric.
* G_Port (Generic Fabric port) Switch port that may function either as an E_Port, A_Port, or as an F_Port.
* GL_Port (Generic Fabric Loop port) Switch port that may function either as an E_Port, A_Port, or as an Fx_Port.
* PE_Port LCF within the Fabric that attaches to another PE_Port or to a B_Port through a link.
* PF_Port LCF within a Fabric that attaches to a PN_Port through a link.
* TE_Port (Trunking E_Port) A trunking expansion port that expands the functionality of E ports to support VSAN trunking, Transport quality of service (QoS) parameters, and Fibre Channel trace (fctrace) feature.
* U_Port (Universal port) A port waiting to become another port type
* VA_Port (Virtual A_Port) instance of the FC-2V sublevel of Fibre Channel that connects to another VA_Port.
* VEX_Port VEX_Ports are no different from EX_Ports, except underlying transport is IP rather than FC.

==Media and modules==

The Fibre Channel physical layer is based on serial connections that use fiber optics to copper between corresponding pluggable modules. The modules may have a single lane, dual lanes or quad lanes that correspond to the SFP, SFP-DD and QSFP form factors. Fibre Channel does not use 8- or 16-lane modules (like CFP8, QSFP-DD, or COBO used in 400GbE) and there are no plans to use these expensive and complex modules.

The small form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP) module and its enhanced version SFP+, SFP28 and SFP56 are common form factors for Fibre Channel ports. SFP modules support a variety of distances via multi-mode and single-mode optical fiber as shown in the table below. SFP modules use duplex fiber cabling with LC connectors.

SFP-DD modules are used for high-density applications that need to double the throughput of an SFP Port. SFP-DD is defined by the SFP-DD MSA and enables breakout to two SFP ports. Two rows of electrical contacts enable doubling the throughput of SFP modules in a similar fashion as QSFP-DD.

The quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP) module began being used for switch inter-connectivity and was later adopted for use in 4-lane implementations of Gen-6 Fibre Channel supporting 128GFC. QSFP uses either LC connectors for 128GFC-CWDM4 or MPO connectors for 128GFC-SW4 or 128GFC-PSM4. MPO cabling uses 8- or 12-fiber cabling infrastructure that connects to another 128GFC port or may be broken out into four duplex LC connections to 32GFC SFP+ ports. Fibre Channel switches use either SFP or QSFP modules.


Modern Fibre Channel devices support SFP+ transceiver, mainly with LC (Lucent Connector) fiber connector. Older 1GFC devices used GBIC transceiver, mainly with SC (Subscriber Connector) fiber connector.

==Storage area networks==

The goal of Fibre Channel is to create a storage area network (SAN) to connect servers to storage.

The SAN is a dedicated network that enables multiple servers to access data from one or more storage devices. Enterprise storage uses the SAN to backup to secondary storage devices including disk arrays, tape libraries, and other backup while the storage is still accessible to the server. Servers may access storage from multiple storage devices over the network as well.

SANs are often designed with dual fabrics to increase fault tolerance. Two completely separate fabrics are operational and if the primary fabric fails, then the second fabric becomes the primary.

==Switches==

Fibre Channel switches can be divided into two classes. These classes are not part of the standard, and the classification of every switch is a marketing decision of the manufacturer:

* Directors offer a high port-count in a modular (slot-based) chassis with no single point of failure (high availability).
* Switches are typically smaller, fixed-configuration (sometimes semi-modular), less redundant devices.

A fabric consisting entirely of one vendors products is considered to be &quot;homogeneous&quot;. This is often referred to as operating in its &quot;native mode&quot; and allows the vendor to add proprietary features which may not be compliant with the Fibre Channel standard.

If multiple switch vendors are used within the same fabric it is &quot;heterogeneous&quot;, the switches may only achieve adjacency if all switches are placed into their interoperability modes. This is called the &quot;open fabric&quot; mode as each vendor&#x27;s switch may have to disable its proprietary features to comply with the Fibre Channel standard.

Some switch manufacturers offer a variety of interoperability modes above and beyond the &quot;native&quot; and &quot;open fabric&quot; states. These &quot;native interoperability&quot; modes allow switches to operate in the native mode of another vendor and still maintain some of the proprietary behaviors of both. However, running in native interoperability mode may still disable some proprietary features and can produce fabrics of questionable stability.

==Host bus adapters==
Fibre Channel HBAs, as well as CNAs, are available for all major open systems, computer architectures, and buses, including PCI and SBus. HBAs connect servers to the Fibre Channel network and are part of a class of devices known as translation devices. Some are OS dependent. Each HBA has a unique World Wide Name (WWN), which is similar to an Ethernet MAC address in that it uses an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE. However, WWNs are longer (8 bytes). There are two types of WWNs on an HBA; a World Wide Node Name (WWNN), which can be shared by some or all ports of a device, and a World Wide Port Name (WWPN), which is necessarily unique to each port. Adapters or routers can connect Fibre Channel networks to IP or Ethernet networks.

<doc id="143328" wikidata="Q3430490" url="?curid=143328" title="Richard Baker (chronicler)">
<text>Sir Richard Baker ( – 18 February 1645) was a politician, historian and religious writer. He was the English author of the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of England&quot; and other works.

==Family==
Richard Baker, born about 1568 at Sissinghurst, Kent, was the elder son of John Baker and Katherine Scott, the daughter of Sir Reginald Scott (d. 16 December 1554) of Scot&#x27;s Hall near Ashford, Kent, and Emeline Kempe, the daughter of Sir William Kempe of Olantigh, by Eleanor, daughter of Sir Robert Browne. Richard Baker&#x27;s father, John Baker, was the second son of Sir John Baker, the first Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Richard Baker had a younger brother named Thomas, who is doubtless the ancestor of William Baker of Lismacue House in County Tipperary, Ireland.

== Life ==
Richard Baker entered Hart Hall, Oxford, as a commoner in 1584. He left the university without taking a degree, studied law in London and afterwards travelled in Europe. In 1593 he was chosen member of parliament for Arundel, in 1594 his university conferred upon him the degree of M.A., and in 1597 he was elected to parliament as the representative of East Grinstead. In 1603 he was knighted by King James I, in 1620 he acted as high sheriff at Oxfordshire where he owned some property, and soon afterwards he married Margaret, daughter of Sir George Mainwaring, of Ightfield, Shropshire. By making himself responsible for some debts of his wife’s family, he was reduced to great poverty, which led to the seizure of his Oxfordshire property in 1625. Quite penniless, he took refuge in the Fleet prison in 1635, and was still in confinement when he died on 18 February 1644 (1645). He was buried in the church of St Bride, Fleet Street, London.

==Marriage and issue==
About 1600, Baker married Margaret Mainwaring (d.1654), daughter of Sir George Mainwaring of Ightfield, Shropshire, by whom he had three sons and four daughters:
*Sir Thomas Baker, baptised in 1602, married on 9 April 1629 at St Mary in the parish of Lambeth, Frances Wilford, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilford of Ileden, Kent, and Elizabeth Sandys. They had eight children.
*Mainwaring, baptised in 1603.
*Arthur (died in 1644), barrister at law.
*Anne, baptised in 1607, who married a Mr. Bury. 
*Margaret, who produced three manuscript recipe books. 
*Cecily/Cecilia (died in 1635), who married on 27 April 1625 at Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire, Francis Wroughton son of George Wroughton. They had six children. 
*Frances married on 18 October 1645 at St Anne and St Agnes, London, Robert Smith, citizen and tailor in London. Smith is said to have burned a manuscript of Baker&#x27;s life.

== Works ==
During his imprisonment Baker spent his time mainly in writing. His chief work is the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of England from the Time of the Romans’ Government unto the Death of King James&quot; (1643, and many subsequent editions). It was translated into Dutch in 1649, and was continued down to 1658 by Edward Phillips, a nephew of John Milton. For many years the &quot;Chronicle&quot; was extremely popular, but owing to numerous inaccuracies its historical value is very slight. Baker also wrote &quot;Cato Variegatus&quot; or &quot;Catoes Morall Distichs, Translated and Paraphrased by Sir Richard Baker, Knight&quot; (London, 1636); &quot;Meditations on the Lord’s Prayer&quot; (1637); &quot;Translation of New Epistles by Mounsieur D’Balzac&quot; (1638); &quot;Apologie for Laymen’s Writing in Divinity&quot;, &quot;with a Short Meditation upon the Fall of Lucifer&quot; (1641); &quot;Motives for Prayer upon the seaven dayes of ye weeke&quot; (1642); a translation of Virgilio Malvezzi’s &quot;Discourses upon Cornelius Tacitus&quot; (1642), and &quot;Theatrum Redivivum, or The Theatre Vindicated&quot;, a reply to the &quot;Histrio-Mastix&quot; of William Prynne (1642). He also wrote &quot;Meditations&quot; upon several of the psalms of David, which have been collected and edited by A. B. Grosart (London, 1882).

<doc id="143331" wikidata="Q132157" url="?curid=143331" title="Zeno of Elea">
<text>Zeno of Elea (; ; ) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea, in Southern Italy (Magna Graecia). He was a student of Parmenides and one of the Eleatics. Zeno defended his instructor&#x27;s belief in monism, the idea that only one single entity exists that makes up all of reality. He rejected the existence of space, time, and motion. To disprove these concepts, he developed a series of paradoxes to demonstrate why they are impossible. Though his original writings are lost, subsequent descriptions by Plato, Aristotle, Diogenes Laertius, and Simplicius of Cilicia have allowed study of his ideas.

Zeno&#x27;s arguments are divided into two different types: his arguments against plurality, or the existence of multiple objects, and his arguments against motion. Those against plurality suggest that for anything to exist, it must be divisible infinitely, meaning it would necessarily have both infinite mass and no mass simultaneously. Those against motion invoke the idea that distance must be divisible infinitely, meaning infinite steps would be required to cross any distance.

Zeno&#x27;s philosophy is still debated in the present day, and no solution to his paradoxes has been agreed upon by philosophers. His paradoxes have influenced philosophy and mathematics, both in ancient and modern times. Many of his ideas have been challenged by modern developments in physics and mathematics, such as atomic theory, mathematical limits, and set theory.

== Life ==
Zeno was born c. 490 BC. Little about his life is known for certain, except that he was from Elea and that he was a student of Parmenides. Zeno is portrayed in the dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot; by Plato, which takes place when Zeno is about 40 years old. In &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Zeno is described as having once been a zealous defender of his instructor Parmenides; this younger Zeno wished to prove that belief in the physical world as it appears is more absurd than belief in the Eleatic idea of a single entity of existence. By the time that &quot;Parmenides&quot; takes place, Zeno is shown to have matured and to be more content to overlook challenges to his instructor&#x27;s Eleatic philosophy. Plato also has Socrates hint at a previous romantic or sexual relationship between Parmenides and Zeno. It is unknown how accurate the depiction in &quot;Parmenides&quot; is to reality, but it is agreed that it bears at least some truth.

Zeno died c. 430 BC. According to Diogenes Laertius, Zeno was killed while he was engaged in a plot to overthrow the tyrant Nearchus. This account tells that he was captured, and that he was killed after he refused to give the names of his co-conspirators. Before his death, Zeno is said to have asked to whisper the names into Nearchus&#x27;s ear, only to bite the ear when Nearchus approached, holding on until he was killed.

=== Writings ===
The writings of Zeno have been lost; no fragments of his original thoughts exist. Instead, modern understanding of Zeno&#x27;s philosophy comes through recording by subsequent philosophers. Zeno is only known to have written one book, most likely in the 460s BC. This book is told of in &quot;Parmenides&quot;, when the character of Zeno describes it as something that he wrote in his youth. According to Plato&#x27;s account, the book was stolen and published without Zeno&#x27;s permission. Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes were recorded by Aristotle in his book &quot;Physics&quot;. Simplicius of Cilicia, who lived in the 6th century AD, is another one of the main sources of present day knowledge about Zeno.

== Philosophy ==

Zeno is one of three major philosophers in the Eleatic school, along with Parmenides and Melissus of Samos. This school of philosophy was a form of monism, following Parmenides&#x27; belief that all of reality is one single indivisible object. Both Zeno and Melissus engaged in philosophy to support the ideas of Parmenides. While Melissus sought to build on them, Zeno instead argued against opposing ideas. Such arguments would have been constructed to challenge the ideas of pluralism, particularly those of the Pythagoreans.

Zeno was the first philosopher to use argumentative rather than descriptive language in his philosophy. Previous philosophers had explained their worldview, but Zeno was the first one to create explicit arguments that were meant to be used for debate. Aristotle described Zeno as the &quot;inventor of dialectic&quot;. To disprove opposing views about reality, he wrote a series of paradoxes that used &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; arguments, or arguments that disprove an idea by showing how it leads to illogical conclusions. Furthermore, Zeno&#x27;s philosophy makes use of infinitesimals, or quantities that are infinitely small while still being greater than zero.

Criticism of Zeno&#x27;s ideas may accuse him with using rhetorical tricks and sophistry rather than cogent arguments. Critics point to how Zeno describes the attributes of different ideas as absolutes when they may be contextual. He may be accused of comparing similarities between concepts, such as attributes that physical space shared with physical objects, and then assuming that they be identical in other ways.

=== Plurality and space ===
Zeno rejected the idea of plurality, or that more than one thing can exist. According to Proclus, Zeno had forty arguments against plurality.

In one argument, Zeno proposed that multiple objects cannot exist, because this would require everything to be finite and infinite simultaneously. He used this logic to challenge the existence of indivisible atoms. Though the first part of this argument is lost, its main idea is recorded by Simplicius. According to him, Zeno began the argument with the idea that nothing can have size because &quot;each of the many is self-identical and one&quot;. Zeno argued that if objects have mass, then they can be divided. The divisions would in turn be divisible, and so on, meaning that no object could have a finite size, as there would always be a smaller part to take from it. Zeno also argued from the other direction: if objects do not have mass, then they cannot be combined to create something larger.

In another argument, Zeno proposed that multiple objects cannot exist, because it would require an infinite number of objects to have a finite number of objects; he held that in order for there to be a finite number of objects, there must be an infinite number of objects dividing them. For two objects to exist separately, according to Zeno, there must be a third thing dividing them, otherwise they would be parts of the same thing. This dividing thing would then itself need two dividing objects to separate it from the original objects. These new dividing objects would then need dividing objects, and so on.

As with all other aspects of existence, Zeno argued that location and physical space are part of the single object that exists as reality. Zeno believed that for all things that exist, they must exist in a certain point in physical space. For a point in space to exist, it must exist in another point in space. This space must in turn exist in another point in space, and so on. Zeno was likely the first philosopher to directly propose that being is incorporeal rather than taking up physical space.

=== Motion and time ===
Zeno&#x27;s arguments against motion contrast the actual phenomena of happenings and experience with the way that they are described and perceived. The exact wording of these arguments has been lost, but descriptions of them survive through Aristotle in his &quot;Physics&quot;. Aristotle identified four paradoxes of motion as the most important. Each paradox has multiple names that it is known by.

* &quot;The dichotomy&quot;, &quot;the racetrack&quot;, or &quot;the stadium&quot; argues that no distance can be traveled. To cross a certain distance, one must first cross half of that distance, and to cross that distance, one must first cross half of that distance, and so on. This appears to make crossing any distance impossible, as an infinite number of acts are required to do it. The argument contends that any appearance of movement is simply an illusion. It is unknown whether Zeno intended for it to be impossible to start or finish crossing a certain distance.
* &quot;Achilles and the tortoise&quot;, or simply &quot;Achilles&quot;, argues that a swift runner such as Achilles can never catch up to a slow runner, such as a tortoise. Every time Achilles goes to where the tortoise was, the tortoise will have moved ahead, and when Achilles reaches that next point, then the tortoise will have moved ahead again, and so on. This makes it seem that Achilles can never reach the tortoise. &quot;The dichotomy&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; are two variations of the same argument, and they effectively come to the same conclusions.
* &quot;The flying arrow&quot;, or simply &quot;the arrow&quot;, argues that all objects must be motionless in space. If an arrow is in the air, it is stationary at any given instant by occupying a specific area in space.
* &quot;The moving rows&quot;, also sometimes called &quot;the stadium&quot;, argues that periods of time can be both halved and doubled simultaneously. It describes a row of objects passing beside other rows of objects in a stadium. If one of the opposing rows is stationary and the other is moving, then it will take a different amount of time to pass them.

=== Antiquity ===

Zeno&#x27;s greatest influence was within the thought of the Eleatic school, as his arguments built on the ideas of Parmenides, though his paradoxes were also of interest to Ancient Greek mathematicians. Zeno is regarded as the first philosopher who dealt with attestable accounts of mathematical infinity. Zeno was succeeded by the Greek Atomists, who argued against the infinite division of objects by proposing an eventual stopping point: the atom. Though Epicurus does not name Zeno directly, he attempts to refute some of Zeno&#x27;s arguments.

Zeno appeared in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot;, and his paradoxes are mentioned in &quot;Phaedo&quot;. Aristotle also wrote about Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. Plato looked down on Zeno&#x27;s approach of making arguments through contradictions. He believed that even Zeno himself did not take the arguments seriously. Aristotle disagreed, believing them to be worthy of consideration. He challenged Zeno&#x27;s dichotomy paradox through his conception of infinity, arguing that there are two infinities: an actual infinity that takes place at once and a potential infinity that is spread over time. He contended that Zeno attempted to prove actual infinities using potential infinities. He also challenged Zeno&#x27;s paradox of the stadium, observing that it is fallacious to assume a stationary object and an object in motion require the same amount of time to pass. The paradox of Achilles and the tortoise may have influenced Aristotle&#x27;s belief that actual infinity cannot exist, as this non-existence presents a solution to Zeno&#x27;s arguments.

=== Modern era ===
Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes are still debated, and they remain one of the archetypal examples of arguments to challenge commonly held perceptions. The paradoxes saw renewed attention in 19th century philosophy that has persisted to the present. Zeno&#x27;s philosophy shows a contrast between what one knows logically and what one observes with the senses with the goal of proving that the world is an illusion; this practice was later adopted by the modern philosophic schools of thought, empiricism and post-structuralism. Bertrand Russell praised Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, crediting them for allowing the work of mathematician Karl Weierstrass.

Scientific phenomena have been named after Zeno. The hindrance of a quantum system by observing it is usually called the Quantum Zeno effect as it is strongly reminiscent of Zeno&#x27;s arrow paradox. In the field of verification and design of timed and hybrid systems, the system behavior is called &quot;Zeno&quot; if it includes an infinite number of discrete steps in a finite amount of time.

Zeno&#x27;s arguments against plurality have been challenged by modern atomic theory. Rather than plurality requiring both a finite and infinite amount of objects, atomic theory shows that objects are made from a specific number of atoms that form specific elements. Likewise, Zeno&#x27;s arguments against motion have been challenged by modern mathematics and physics. Mathematicians and philosophers continued studying infinitesimals until they came to be better understood through calculus and limit theory. Ideas relating to Zeno&#x27;s plurality arguments are similarly affected by set theory and transfinite numbers. Modern physics has yet to determine whether space and time can be represented on a mathematical continuum or if it is made up of discrete units.

Zeno&#x27;s argument of Achilles and the tortoise can be addressed mathematically, as the distance is defined by a specific number. His argument of the flying arrow has been challenged by modern physics, which allows the smallest instants of time to still have a minuscule non-zero duration. Other mathematical ideas, such as internal set theory and nonstandard analysis, may also resolve Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. However, there is no definitive agreement on whether solutions to Zeno&#x27;s arguments have been found.

<text>Sir Samuel White Baker (8 June 1821 – 30 December 1893) was an English explorer, officer, naturalist, big game hunter, engineer, writer and abolitionist. He also held the titles of Pasha and Major-General in the Ottoman Empire and Egypt. He served as the Governor-General of the Equatorial Nile Basin (today&#x27;s South Sudan and Northern Uganda) between April 1869 and August 1873, which he established as the Province of Equatoria. He is mostly remembered as the first European to visit Lake Albert, as an explorer of the Nile and interior of central Africa, and for his exploits as a big game hunter in Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. Baker wrote a considerable number of books and published articles. He was a friend of King Edward VII, who as Prince of Wales, visited Baker with Queen Alexandra in Egypt. Other friendships were with explorers Henry Morton Stanley, Roderick Murchison, John H. Speke and James A. Grant, with the ruler of Egypt Pasha Ismail The Magnificent, Major-General Charles George Gordon and Maharaja Duleep Singh.

==Family and early biography==
Samuel White Baker was born on 8 June 1821 in London, as the offspring of a wealthy commercial family. His father, Samuel Baker Sr., was a sugar merchant, banker and ship owner from Thorngrove, Worcestershire with mercantile ties in the West Indies. His younger brother, Col. Valentine Baker, known as &quot;Baker Pasha&quot;, was initially a British hero of the African Cape Colony, the Crimean War, Ceylon and the Balkans, later dishonoured by a civilian scandal. Valentine had successfully sought fame in the Ottoman Empire, notably the Russian-Turkish War in the Caucasus and the War of Sudan from Egypt. Samuel&#x27;s other siblings were: James, John, Mary &quot;Min&quot; (later Cawston), Ellen (later Hopkinson) and Anna Eliza Baker (later Bourne).

Baker was educated at a private school at Rottingdean in Sussex, next at the King&#x27;s School, Gloucester (1833–1835), then privately at Tottenham (1838–1840), before completing his studies in Frankfurt, Germany in 1841. He studied and graduated MA as Civil Engineer. While commissioned, at Constanța, Romania, where, as Royal Superintendent, he designed and planned railways, bridges and other structures across the Dobruja region, from the Danube to the Black Sea.

On 3 August 1843 he married his first wife, Henrietta Ann Bidgood Martin, daughter of the Rev Charles Herbert Martin, Rector of St Giles, Maisemore, Gloucestershire. Together, they had seven children: Agnes, Charles Martin, Constance, Edith, Ethel, Jane &amp; John Lindsay Sloan.
His brother John Garland Baker married Henrietta&#x27;s sister Eliza Heberden Martin and after a double wedding, the four moved to Mauritius, overseeing the family&#x27;s plantation. After spending two years there the desire for travel took them in 1846 to Ceylon, where in the following year he founded an agricultural settlement at Nuwara Eliya, a mountain health-resort.

Aided by his family, he brought emigrants from England, together with choice breeds of cattle, and before long the new settlement was a success. During his residence in Ceylon he wrote and published &quot;The Rifle and the Hound in Ceylon&quot; (1853) and two years later &quot;Eight Years&#x27; Wanderings in Ceylon&quot; (1855). These books showcase his hunting of wildlife in Ceylon(Sri Lanka). After twelve years of marriage, his wife, Henrietta, died of typhoid fever in 1855, leaving Samuel a widower at the age of thirty-four. His two sons and one daughter (Jane) also died young. Baker left his four surviving daughters in the care of his unmarried sister Mary &quot;Min&quot;.

After a journey to Constantinople and the Crimea in 1856, he went to Constanța, Romania and acted as Royal Superintendent for the construction of a railway and bridges across the Dobruja, connecting the Danube with the Black Sea. After that project was completed he spent some months on a tour of south-eastern Europe and Asia Minor.

==Florence Baker and Travels in Eastern Europe==


While Baker was visiting the Duke of Atholl on his shooting estate in Scotland, he befriended Maharaja Duleep Singh and in 1858–1859 the two partnered an extensive hunting trip in central Europe and the Balkans, via Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest. On the last part of the voyage, Baker and the Maharajah hired a wooden boat in Budapest, which was eventually abandoned on the frozen Danube. The two continued into Vidin where, to amuse the Maharajah, Baker went to the Vidin slave market. There, Baker fell in love with a white slave girl destined for the Ottoman Pasha of Vidin. He was outbid by the Pasha but bribed the girl&#x27;s attendants and they ran away in a carriage together and eventually she became his lover and wife and accompanied him everywhere he journeyed. They are reported to have married, most probably in Bucharest, before going to Dubrushka, but Sir Samuel certainly promised that they would go through another ceremony on their return to England – where they had a family wedding in 1865.

She was officially born 6 August 1841 (but more probably 1845) in Nagyenyed, Austria-Hungary (today Aiud, Romania) and was named Florenz Barbara Maria. She said that her nurse helped her to a refugee camp in Vidin, Bulgaria. Possibly it was there that she was adopted by an Armenian family with name Finnian (or Finnin). Her nurse married and left her, probably during the first Amnesty of 1857. Later she was abducted and sold to an Armenian slave merchant, who groomed her for the Harem.

Baker and the girl fled to Bucharest and remained in Romania, Baker applying for the position of British Consul there but being refused. In Constanța, he acted as the Royal Superintendent for the construction of a railway and bridges across the Dobruja, connecting the Danube with the Black Sea. After its completion he spent some months on a tour in south-eastern Europe and Asia Minor. The new consul issued Baker&#x27;s companion with a British passport under the name Florence Barbara Maria Finnian, although she was British neither by birth nor yet by marriage. She was affectionately called &quot;Flooey&quot; by Baker and later nicknamed &quot;Anyadwe&quot; or &quot;Daughter of the Moon&quot; in what is now northern Uganda by the Luo-speaking Acholi natives, who prized her long blonde hair.

Florence refused to stay home, instead following her husband in his travels. She spoke English, Turkish, and Arabic, rode camels, mules and horses and carried pistols when in the wilds. Although Sir Samuel and Lady Baker were personally charming enough to conquer most of Victorian society, Queen Victoria refused to receive Florence at court since she believed Baker had been &quot;intimate with his wife before marriage&quot;, as indeed he had. Confusingly, Lady Baker is in Hungarian sources known as Sass (or Szász) Flóra, and Florica Maria Sas in the Romanian sources. She died in 1916 at the estate she had shared with her husband in Sandford Orleigh, Devon. She was 74 years old and was buried with her husband, who had died 23 years earlier, in the Baker family vault at Grimley, near Worcester, although her name was never recorded.

==Career==

In March 1861 he started upon his first tour of exploration in central Africa. This, in his own words, was undertaken &quot;to discover the sources of the river Nile, with the hope of meeting the East African expedition under Captains Speke and Grant somewhere about the Lake Victoria.&quot; After a year spent on the Sudan–Ethiopian frontier, during which time he learned Arabic, explored the Atbara river and other Nile tributaries, and proved that the Nile sediment came from Ethiopia, he arrived at Khartoum, leaving that city in December 1862 to follow up the course of the White Nile.

Two months later at Gondokoro he met Speke and Grant, who, after being led by the local Africans to the source of the Nile, were following the river to Egypt. Their success made him fear that there was nothing left for his own expedition to accomplish; but the two explorers gave him information which enabled him, after separating from them, to achieve the first European visit to Albert Nyanza (Lake Albert), of whose existence credible assurance had already been given to Speke and Grant. Baker first sighted the lake on 14 March 1864. After some time spent in the exploration of the neighbourhood, Baker demonstrated that the Nile flowed through the Albert Nyanza. He formed an exaggerated idea of the relative importance of the Albert and Victoria lake sources in contributing to the Nile flow rate. Although he believed them to be near equal, Albert Nyanza sources add only ~15% to the Nile flow at this point, the remainder provided primarily by outflow from Lake Victoria. While in this area, Baker and his wife became the first Europeans to see a substantial waterfall on the Victoria Nile, which Baker named Murchison Falls after the then-president of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Roderick Murchison. He started upon his return journey, and reached Khartoum, after many checks, in May 1865.

In the following October Baker returned to England with his wife, who had accompanied him throughout the dangerous and difficult journeys in Africa. In recognition of the achievements, the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron&#x27;s Medal, and a similar distinction was bestowed on him by the Paris Geographical Society. In August 1866 he was knighted. In the same year he published &quot;The Albert N&#x27;yanza, Great Basin of the Nile, and Explorations of the Nile Sources&quot;, and in 1867 &quot;The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia&quot;, both books quickly turned into several editions. In 1868 he published a popular story called &quot;Cast up by the Sea&quot;. In 1869 he travelled with the future King Edward VII (who was the Prince of Wales at that time) through Egypt.

Baker never received quite the same level of acclamation granted to other contemporary British explorers of Africa. Queen Victoria, in particular, avoided meeting Baker because of the irregular way in which he acquired Florence, not to mention the fact that during the years of their mutual travels, the couple were not actually married. A court case involving his brother Valentine Baker (following his indecent assault of a woman on a train) also harmed Baker&#x27;s chances of wider acceptance by the Victorian establishment.

In 1869, at the request of the khedive Ismail, Baker led a military expedition to the equatorial regions of the Nile, with the object of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and civilisation. Before starting from Cairo with a force of 1700 Egyptian troops – many of them discharged convicts – he was given the rank of pasha and major-general in the Ottoman army. Lady Baker, as before, accompanied him. The khedive appointed him Governor-General of the new territory of Equatoria for four years at a salary of £10,000 a year; and it was not until the expiration of that time that Baker returned to Cairo, leaving his work to be carried on by the new governor, Colonel Charles George Gordon.

He had to contend with innumerable difficulties – the blocking of the river in the Sudd, the hostility of officials interested in the slave-trade, the armed opposition of the natives – but he succeeded in planting in the new territory the foundations upon which others could build up an administration.

==Later life==
He published his narrative of the central African expedition under the title of &quot;Ismailia&quot; (1874). &quot;Cyprus as I saw it in 1879&quot; was the result of a visit to that island. He spent several winters in Egypt, and travelled in India, the Rocky Mountains and Japan in search of big game, publishing in 1890 &quot;Wild Beasts and their Ways&quot;.

He kept up a correspondence with men of all shades of opinion upon Egyptian affairs, strongly opposing the abandonment of the Sudan by the British Empire and subsequently urging its reconquest. Next to these, questions of maritime defence and strategy chiefly attracted him in his later years.

In November 1874 he purchased the Sandford Orleigh estate in Newton Abbot, Devon, England, where he also died after a heart attack, at the age of 72, on 30 December 1893. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the Baker family vault at Grimley Saint Bartholomew Churchyard in Grimley, Worcestershire.

==Hunting authority==

Baker lived as a reputed Victorian Nimrod and was a milestone in the history of modern hunting through his works and deeds. He was proud of his British heritage and was an advocate of the virtues of his nation, and a fighter against slavery in Northern Uganda at Fort Patiko. 
An acclaimed sportsman, he likely started hunting in the Scottish Highlands; his skills were renowned, and he once gave a demonstration to friends in Scotland of how he could, with dogs, successfully hunt down a stag armed only with a knife, he did the same with the large boars in the jungles of Ceylon. He hunted consistently until his last years, in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.

Baker forged his skills chasing Asian elephants and sambar deer in Ceylon, a place where Rowland Ward&#x27;s records account him for some of the world&#x27;s largest wild boar trophies. He travelled looking for sport in Asia Minor in 1860, in Scotland in 1869 for red stag, in the Rocky Mountains in 1881 downing elk, grizzly and buffalo. In 1886, he was in the French Alps, looking for brown bear and many times in India in 1885 and 1887–1889 pursuing tigers and blackbuck.
His most memorable cynegetic (hunting-related) exploits remained the episodes in Africa and Ceylon, where he returned again towards the end of his life in 1887. He also visited for sport, Transylvania for bears, Serbia for wild boars, Hungary for deer, Cyprus in 1879, China and Japan.

Baker left a wealth of study in the science of hunting firearms and ballistics, and accounts as one of the world&#x27;s few hunters that used the two bore rifle, the world&#x27;s largest gun calibre for the purpose. He described in great detail his observations of the animal world, account in which, his book &quot;Wild Beasts And Their Ways (1890)&quot; ranks highest.

In 1863, the German zoologist Theodor von Heuglin named a subspecies of Roan antelope in his honour: &quot;Hippotragus e. bakeri&quot; or Baker&#x27;s antelope. In Sri Lanka, Baker&#x27;s Falls bears his name, and in 1906 Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, named Mount Baker in his honour while in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda.

<doc id="143333" wikidata="Q7324637" url="?curid=143333" title="Richard Carrión">
<text>Richard L. Carrión Rexach (born in November 26, 1952) is the executive chairman of Popular, Inc., the parent company of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular Bank. Prior to assuming his current position in July 2017, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Popular, Inc. for over 20 years. He is on the board of directors at Verizon Communications and Centro Financiero BHD and the supervisory board of NIBC Holding N.V. Carrión is currently a partner at J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. He served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2008 to 2015.&gt;

==Early life==
Carrión was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His grandfather was one of the founders of Popular, Inc. (BPPR). He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce in 1974 and an MS in Management Information Systems from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1976. After the master&#x27;s degree, Mr. Carrión joined Banco Popular in 1976. After his father&#x27;s death, Carrión became the leader of that banking corporation.

==Popular, Inc.==
While at the helm of Popular, Inc., Carrión led the way in bringing technology innovation to banking in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and several countries in Latin America. Carrión&#x27;s vision brought the first network of ATMs to Puerto Rico and many other Latin American countries. He also spearheaded the successful migration from paper to electronic transactions and the establishment of the largest data processing center in the Caribbean, a regional leader in information technology.

==Philanthropy==
For almost three decades Mr. Carrión has divided his time between Popular and philanthropy, placing particular emphasis on education and sports. He is the founder and trustee of the Banco Popular Foundation; which, among other charities, has donated scholarships to over 1,000 students through the Rafael Carrión, Jr. Scholarship Fund. He currently serves on the board of directors of Verizon. Since 1992, Carrión has also been involved in the production of music videos that highlight Puerto Rico&#x27;s musical culture and history. In 2007, he was appointed a member of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Finance Commission.

Mr. Carrión has also contributed to improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s public education system. He participated in Sapientis Week, an initiative sponsored by the non-profit Sapientis which brings distinguished public figures into classrooms in order to raise the public&#x27;s awareness of the education crisis in Puerto Rico.

==International Olympic Committee==
He has been a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 1990 and currently chairs the Finance Commission and is a member of the IOC&#x27;s Marketing, TV and Internet Rights Commissions. Mr. Carrión led the negotiation team for the U.S. broadcast of the 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games – generating $2 billion in revenue – and was elected to the IOC executive board in 2004. He was one of the torch carriers for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

From 1987, he and the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee led a fight to try to bring the 2004 Summer Olympic Games to San Juan. That bid failed, however, when Athens was voted in 1997 as the city to host those games.

In 2012, Carrión awarded Javier Culson with the bronze medal for the 400 m hurdles and Jaime Espinal with the silver medal for wrestling freestyle 84 kg at the 2012 Olympics. Culson and Espinal were the first Puerto Ricans to win Olympic medals outside of boxing.

===2013 Candidacy for IOC President===
On May 22, 2013, Carrión confirmed that he would run for president of the IOC. At the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Carrión secured 29 votes in the final round of voting, but lost the election to Thomas Bach.

==FIBA==
Carrión is a current member of the FIBA Central Board, the highest executive body of FIBA.

==Personal life==
Richard Carrión is currently married to Isabella Heseltine. He was previously married to Conxita Viñamata Martorell, with whom he had a son, Rafael Luis. Carrión has 4 children from his first marriage, Io Ana: Richard Jr., Ceciliana and Ana Sofía. Carrión is the cousin of Puerto Rican actress and radio talk show host Camille Carrión.

<text>Celestial navigation, also known as astronavigation, is the practice of position fixing using stars and other celestial bodies that enables a navigator to accurately determine their actual current physical position in space or on the surface of the Earth without relying solely on estimated positional calculations, commonly known as dead reckoning. Celestial navigation is performed without using satellite navigation or other similar modern electronic or digital positioning means.

Celestial navigation uses &quot;sights,&quot; or timed angular measurements, taken typically between a celestial body (e.g., the Sun, the Moon, a planet, or a star) and the visible horizon. Celestial navigation can also take advantage of measurements between celestial bodies without reference to the Earth&#x27;s horizon, such as when the Moon and other selected bodies are used in the practice called &quot;lunars&quot; or the lunar distance method, used for determining precise time when time is unknown.

Celestial navigation by taking sights of the Sun and the horizon whilst on the surface of the Earth is commonly used, providing various methods of determining position, one of which is the popular and simple method called &quot;noon sight navigation&quot;—being a single observation of the exact altitude of the Sun and the exact time of that altitude (known as &quot;local noon&quot;)—the highest point of the Sun above the horizon from the position of the observer in any single day. This angular observation, combined with knowing its simultaneous precise time, referred to as the time at the prime meridian, directly renders a latitude and longitude fix at the time and place of the observation by simple mathematical reduction. The Moon, a planet, Polaris, or one of the 57 other navigational stars whose coordinates are tabulated in any of the published nautical or air almanacs can also accomplish this same goal.

Celestial navigation accomplishes its purpose by using angular measurements (sights) between celestial bodies and the visible horizon to locate one&#x27;s position on the Earth, whether on land, in the air, or at sea. In addition, observations between stars and other celestial bodies accomplished the same results while in space,used in the Apollo space program and is still used on many contemporary satellites. Equally, celestial navigation may be used while on other planetary bodies to determine position on their surface, using their local horizon and suitable celestial bodies with matching reduction tables and knowledge of local time.

For navigation by celestial means, when on the surface of the Earth at any given instant in time, a celestial body is located directly over a single point on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The latitude and longitude of that point are known as the celestial body&#x27;s geographic position (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the nautical or air almanac for that year. The measured angle between the celestial body and the visible horizon is directly related to the distance between the celestial body&#x27;s GP and the observer&#x27;s position. After some computations, referred to as &quot;sight reduction,&quot; this measurement is used to plot a line of position (LOP) on a navigational chart or plotting worksheet, with the observer&#x27;s position being somewhere on that line. The LOP is actually a short segment of a very large circle on Earth that surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. (An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on Earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer&#x27;s position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at the example below). Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimize the chance of error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, referred to as the &quot;altitude-intercept method.&quot; At least three points must be plotted. The plot intersection will usually provide a triangle where the exact position is inside of it. The accuracy of the sights is indicated by the size of the triangle.

Joshua Slocum used both noon sight and star sight navigation to determine his current position during his voyage, the first recorded single-handed circumnavigation of the world. In addition, he used the lunar distance method (or &quot;lunars&quot;) to determine and maintain known time at Greenwich (the prime meridian), thereby keeping his &quot;tin clock&quot; reasonably accurate and therefore his position fixes accurate.

Celestial navigation can only determine longitude when the time at the prime meridian is accurately known. The more accurately time at the prime meridian (0° longitude) is known, the more accurate the fix;indeed, every four seconds of time source (commonly a chronometer or, in aircraft, an accurate &quot;hack watch&quot;) error can lead to a positional error of one nautical mile. When time is unknown or not trusted, the lunar distance method can be used as a method of determining time at the prime meridian. A functioning timepiece with a second hand or digit, an almanac with lunar corrections, and a sextant are used. With no knowledge of time at all, a lunar calculation (given an observable Moon of respectable altitude) can provide time accurate to within a second or two with about 15 to 30 minutes of observations and mathematical reduction from the almanac tables. After practice, an observer can regularly derive and prove time using this method to within about one second, or one nautical mile, of navigational error due to errors ascribed to the time source.

==Example==

An example illustrating the concept behind the intercept method for determining position is shown to the right. (Two other common methods for determining one&#x27;s position using celestial navigation are longitude by chronometer and ex-meridian methods.) In the adjacent image, the two circles on the map represent lines of position for the Sun and Moon at 12:00 GMT on October 29, 2005. At this time, a navigator on a ship at sea measured the Moon to be 56° above the horizon using a sextant. Ten minutes later, the Sun was observed to be 40° above the horizon. Lines of position were then calculated and plotted for each of these observations. Since both the Sun and Moon were observed at their respective angles from the same location, the navigator would have to be located at one of the two locations where the circles cross.

In this case, the navigator is either located on the Atlantic Ocean, about west of Madeira, or in South America, about southwest of Asunción, Paraguay. In most cases, determining which of the two intersections is the correct one is obvious to the observer because they are often thousands of miles apart. As it is unlikely that the ship is sailing across South America, the position in the Atlantic is the correct one. Note that the lines of position in the figure are distorted because of the map&#x27;s projection; they would be circular if plotted on a globe.

An observer at the Gran Chaco point would see the Moon at the left of the Sun, and an observer at the Madeira point would see the Moon at the right of the Sun.

==Angular measurement==
Accurate angle measurement has evolved over the years. One simple method is to hold the hand above the horizon with one&#x27;s arm stretched out. The angular width of the little finger is just over 1.5 degrees at extended arm&#x27;s length and can be used to estimate the elevation of the Sun from the horizon plane and therefore estimate the time until sunset. The need for more accurate measurements led to the development of a number of increasingly accurate instruments, including the kamal, astrolabe, octant, and sextant. The sextant and octant are most accurate because they measure angles from the horizon, eliminating errors caused by the placement of an instrument&#x27;s pointers, and because their dual-mirror system cancels relative motions of the instrument, showing a steady view of the object and horizon.

Navigators measure distance on the Earth in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds. A nautical mile is defined as 1,852 meters but is also (not accidentally) one arc minute of angle along a meridian on the Earth. Sextants can be read accurately to within 0.1 arcminutes, so the observer&#x27;s position can be determined within (theoretically) 0.1 nautical miles (185.2 meters, or about 203 yards). Most ocean navigators, measuring from a moving platform under fair conditions, can achieve a practical accuracy of approximately 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 km), enough to navigate safely when out of sight of land or other hazards.

==Practical navigation==


Practical celestial navigation usually requires a marine chronometer to measure time, a sextant to measure the angles, an almanac giving schedules of the coordinates of celestial objects, a set of sight reduction tables to help perform the height and azimuth computations, and a chart of the region. With sight reduction tables, the only calculations required are addition and subtraction. Small handheld computers, laptops and even scientific calculators enable modern navigators to &quot;reduce&quot; sextant sights in minutes, by automating all the calculation and/or data lookup steps. Most people can master simpler celestial navigation procedures after a day or two of instruction and practice, even using manual calculation methods.

Modern practical navigators usually use celestial navigation in combination with satellite navigation to correct a dead reckoning track, that is, a course estimated from a vessel&#x27;s position, course, and speed. Using multiple methods helps the navigator detect errors and simplifies procedures. When used this way, a navigator, from time to time, measures the Sun&#x27;s altitude with a sextant, then compares that with a precalculated altitude based on the exact time and estimated position of the observation. On the chart, the straight edge of a plotter can mark each position line. If the position line indicates a location more than a few miles from the estimated position, more observations can be taken to restart the dead-reckoning track.

In the event of equipment or electrical failure, taking Sun lines a few times a day and advancing them by dead reckoning allows a vessel to get a crude running fix sufficient to return to port. One can also use the Moon, a planet, Polaris, or one of 57 other navigational stars to track celestial positioning.

===Latitude===


Latitude was measured in the past either by measuring the altitude of the Sun at noon (the &quot;noon sight&quot;) or by measuring the altitudes of any other celestial body when crossing the meridian (reaching its maximum altitude when due north or south), and frequently by measuring the altitude of Polaris, the north star (assuming it is sufficiently visible above the horizon, which it is not in the Southern Hemisphere). Polaris always stays within 1 degree of the celestial north pole. If a navigator measures the angle to Polaris and finds it to be 10 degrees from the horizon, then he is about 10 degrees north of the equator. This approximate latitude is then corrected using simple tables or almanac corrections to determine a latitude that is theoretically accurate to within a fraction of a mile. Angles are measured from the horizon because locating the point directly overhead, the zenith, is not normally possible. When haze obscures the horizon, navigators use artificial horizons, which are horizontal mirrors or pans of reflective fluid, especially mercury. In the latter case, the angle between the reflected image in the mirror and the actual image of the object in the sky is exactly twice the required altitude.

===Longitude===

If the angle to Polaris can be accurately measured, a similar measurement of a star near the eastern or western horizons would provide the longitude. The problem is that the Earth turns 15 degrees per hour, making such measurements dependent on time. A measure a few minutes before or after the same measure the day before creates serious navigation errors. Before good chronometers were available, longitude measurements were based on the transit of the moon or the positions of the moons of Jupiter. For the most part, these were too difficult to be used by anyone except professional astronomers. The invention of the modern chronometer by John Harrison in 1761 vastly simplified longitudinal calculation.

The longitude problem took centuries to solve and was dependent on the construction of a non-pendulum clock (as pendulum clocks cannot function accurately on a tilting ship, or indeed a moving vehicle of any kind). Two useful methods evolved during the 18th century and are still practiced today: lunar distance, which does not involve the use of a chronometer, and the use of an accurate timepiece or chronometer.

Presently, layperson calculations of longitude can be made by noting the exact local time (leaving out any reference for daylight saving time) when the Sun is at its highest point in Earth&#x27;s sky. The calculation of noon can be made more easily and accurately with a small, exactly vertical rod driven into level ground—take the time reading when the shadow is pointing due north (in the northern hemisphere). Then take your local time reading and subtract it from GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), or the time in London, England. For example, a noon reading (12:00) near central Canada or the US would occur at approximately 6 p.m. (18:00) in London. The 6-hour difference is one quarter of a 24-hour day, or 90 degrees of a 360-degree circle (the Earth). The calculation can also be made by taking the number of hours (use decimals for fractions of an hour) multiplied by 15, the number of degrees in one hour. Either way, it can be demonstrated that much of central North America is at or near 90 degrees west longitude. Eastern longitudes can be determined by adding the local time to GMT, with similar calculations.

====Lunar distance====

An older but still useful and practical method of determining accurate time at sea before the advent of precise timekeeping and satellite-based time systems is called &quot;lunar distances,&quot; or &quot;lunars,&quot; which was used extensively for a short period and refined for daily use on board ships in the 18th century. Use declined through the middle of the 19th century as better and better timepieces (chronometers) became available to the average vessel at sea. Although most recently only used by sextant hobbyists and historians, it is now becoming more common in celestial navigation courses to reduce total dependence on GNSS systems as potentially the only accurate time source aboard a vessel. Designed for use when an accurate timepiece is not available or timepiece accuracy is suspect during a long sea voyage, the navigator precisely measures the angle between the Moon and the Sun or between the Moon and one of several stars near the ecliptic. The observed angle must be corrected for the effects of refraction and parallax, like any celestial sight. To make this correction, the navigator measures the altitudes of the Moon and Sun (or another star) at about the same time as the lunar distance angle. Only rough values for the altitudes are required. A calculation with suitable published tables (or longhand with logarithms and graphical tables) requires about 10 to 15 minutes&#x27; work to convert the observed angle(s) to a geocentric lunar distance. The navigator then compares the corrected angle against those listed in the appropriate almanac pages for every three hours of Greenwich time, using interpolation tables to derive intermediate values. The result is a difference in time between the time source (of unknown time) used for the observations and the actual prime meridian time (that of the &quot;Zero Meridian&quot; at Greenwich, also known as UTC or GMT). Knowing UTC/GMT, a further set of sights can be taken and reduced by the navigator to calculate their exact position on the Earth as a local latitude and longitude.

====Use of time====
The considerably more popular method was (and still is) to use an accurate timepiece to directly measure the time of a sextant sight. The need for accurate navigation led to the development of progressively more accurate chronometers in the 18th century (see John Harrison). Today, time is measured with a chronometer, a quartz watch, a shortwave radio time signal broadcast from an atomic clock, or the time displayed on a satellite time signal receiver. A quartz wristwatch normally keeps time within a half-second per day. If it is worn constantly, keeping it near body heat, its rate of drift can be measured with the radio, and by compensating for this drift, a navigator can keep time to better than a second per month. When time at the prime meridian (or another starting point) is accurately known, celestial navigation can determine longitude, and the more accurately latitude and time are known, the more accurate the longitude determination. The angular speed of the Earth is latitude-dependent. At the poles, or latitude 90°, the rotation velocity of the Earth reaches zero. At 45° latitude, one second of time is equivalent in longitude to , or one-tenth of a second means At the slightly bulged-out equator, or latitude 0°, the rotation velocity of Earth or its equivalent in longitude reaches its maximum at .

Traditionally, a navigator checked their chronometer(s) with their sextant at a geographic marker surveyed by a professional astronomer. This is now a rare skill, and most harbormasters cannot locate their harbor&#x27;s marker. Ships often carried more than one chronometer. Chronometers were kept on gimbals in a dry room near the center of the ship. They were used to set a hack watch for the actual sight, so that no chronometers were ever exposed to the wind and salt water on deck. Winding and comparing the chronometers was a crucial duty of the navigator. Even today, it is still logged daily in the ship&#x27;s deck log and reported to the captain before eight bells on the forenoon watch (shipboard noon). Navigators also set the ship&#x27;s clocks and calendar. Two chronometers provided dual modular redundancy, allowing a backup if one ceases to work but not allowing any error correction if the two displayed a different time, since in case of contradiction between the two chronometers, it would be impossible to know which one was wrong (the error detection obtained would be the same as having only one chronometer and checking it periodically: every day at noon against dead reckoning). Three chronometers provided triple modular redundancy, allowing error correction if one of the three was wrong, so the pilot would take the average of the two with closer readings (average precision vote). There is an old adage to this effect, stating: &quot;Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.&quot; Vessels engaged in survey work generally carried many more than three chronometers for example, HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; carried 22 chronometers.

==Modern celestial navigation==
The celestial line of position concept was discovered in 1837 by Thomas Hubbard Sumner when, after one observation, he computed and plotted his longitude at more than one trial latitude in his vicinity and noticed that the positions lay along a line. Using this method with two bodies, navigators were finally able to cross two position lines and obtain their position, in effect determining both latitude and longitude. Later in the 19th century came the development of the modern (Marcq St. Hilaire) intercept method; with this method, the body height and azimuth are calculated for a convenient trial position and compared with the observed height. The difference in arcminutes is the nautical mile &quot;intercept&quot; distance that the position line needs to be shifted toward or away from the direction of the body&#x27;s subpoint. (The intercept method uses the concept illustrated in the example in the &quot;How it works&quot; section above.) Two other methods of reducing sights are the longitude by chronometer and the ex-meridian method.

While celestial navigation is becoming increasingly redundant with the advent of inexpensive and highly accurate satellite navigation receivers (GNSS), it was used extensively in aviation until the 1960s and marine navigation until quite recently. However, since a prudent mariner never relies on any sole means of fixing their position, many national maritime authorities still require deck officers to show knowledge of celestial navigation in examinations, primarily as a backup for electronic or satellite navigation. One of the most common current uses of celestial navigation aboard large merchant vessels is for compass calibration and error checking at sea when no terrestrial references are available.

In 1980, French Navy regulations still required an independently operated timepiece on board so that, in combination with a sextant, a ship&#x27;s position could be determined by celestial navigation.

The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy continued instructing military aviators on celestial navigation use until 1997, because:
* celestial navigation can be used independently of ground aids.
* celestial navigation has global coverage.
* celestial navigation cannot be jammed (although it can be obscured by clouds).
* celestial navigation does not give off any signals that could be detected by an enemy.

The United States Naval Academy (USNA) announced that it was discontinuing its course on celestial navigation (considered to be one of its most demanding non-engineering courses) from the formal curriculum in the spring of 1998. In October 2015, citing concerns about the reliability of GNSS systems in the face of potential hostile hacking, the USNA reinstated instruction in celestial navigation in the 2015 to 2016 academic year.

At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam to enter the Merchant Marine. It is also taught at Harvard, most recently as Astronomy 2.

Celestial navigation continues to be used by private yachtsmen, and particularly by long-distance cruising yachts around the world. For small cruising boat crews, celestial navigation is generally considered an essential skill when venturing beyond visual range of land. Although satellite navigation technology is reliable, offshore yachtsmen use celestial navigation as either a primary navigational tool or as a backup.

Celestial navigation was used in commercial aviation up until the early part of the jet age; early Boeing 747s had a &quot;sextant port&quot; in the roof of the cockpit. It was only phased out in the 1960s with the advent of inertial navigation and Doppler navigation systems, and today&#x27;s satellite-based systems which can locate the aircraft&#x27;s position accurate to a 3-meter sphere with several updates per second.

A variation on terrestrial celestial navigation was used to help orient the Apollo spacecraft en route to and from the Moon. To this day, space missions such as the Mars Exploration Rover use star trackers to determine the attitude of the spacecraft.

As early as the mid-1960s, advanced electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated celestial sight fixes. These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft&#x27;s position to less than . The SR-71 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of automated celestial and inertial navigation. These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles use celestial navigation to check and correct their course (initially set using internal gyroscopes) while flying outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The immunity to jamming signals is the main driver behind this seemingly archaic technique.

X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing (XNAV) is an experimental navigation technique for space whereby the periodic X-ray signals emitted from pulsars are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. Similar to GNSS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to triangulate its position accurately (±5 km). The advantage of using X-ray signals over radio waves is that X-ray telescopes can be made smaller and lighter. On 9 November 2016 the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched an experimental pulsar navigation satellite called XPNAV 1. SEXTANT (Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology) is a NASA-funded project developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center that is testing XNAV on-orbit on board the International Space Station in connection with the NICER project, launched on 3 June 2017 on the SpaceX CRS-11 ISS resupply mission.

==Training==
Celestial navigation training equipment for aircraft crews combine a simple flight simulator with a planetarium.

An early example is the Link Celestial Navigation Trainer, used in the Second World War. Housed in a high building, it featured a cockpit accommodating a whole bomber crew (pilot, navigator, and bombardier). The cockpit offered a full array of instruments, which the pilot used to fly the simulated airplane. Fixed to a dome above the cockpit was an arrangement of lights, some collimated, simulating constellations, from which the navigator determined the plane&#x27;s position. The dome&#x27;s movement simulated the changing positions of the stars with the passage of time and the movement of the plane around the Earth. The navigator also received simulated radio signals from various positions on the ground. Below the cockpit moved &quot;terrain plates&quot;—large, movable aerial photographs of the land below—which gave the crew the impression of flight and enabled the bomber to practice lining up bombing targets. A team of operators sat at a control booth on the ground below the machine, from which they could simulate weather conditions such as wind or clouds. This team also tracked the airplane&#x27;s position by moving a &quot;crab&quot; (a marker) on a paper map.

The Link Celestial Navigation Trainer was developed in response to a request made by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1939. The RAF ordered 60 of these machines, and the first one was built in 1941. The RAF used only a few of these, leasing the rest back to the US, where eventually hundreds were in use.

<doc id="143338" wikidata="Q2085066" url="?curid=143338" title="Land (economics)">
<text>In economics, land comprises all naturally occurring resources as well as geographic land. Examples include particular geographical locations, mineral deposits, forests, fish stocks, atmospheric quality, geostationary orbits, and portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Supply of these resources is fixed.

==Factor of production==
Land is considered one of the three factors of production (also sometimes called the three producer goods) along with capital, and labor. Natural resources are fundamental to the production of all goods, including capital goods. While the particular role of land in the economy was extensively debated in classical economics it played a minor role in the neoclassical economics dominant in the 20th century. Income derived from ownership or control of natural resources is referred to as rent.

== Ownership ==

Because no man created the land, it does not have a definite original proprietor, owner or user. 
Consequently, conflicting claims on geographic locations and mineral deposits have historically led to disputes over their economic rent and contributed to many civil wars and revolutions.

In the context of geographic locations the resulting conflict is regularly understood as the land question (see e.g. United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada).

== Addressing the land question ==

=== Land reform ===
Land reform programs are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land.

===Georgism===
Georgists hold that this implies a perfectly inelastic supply curve (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a land value tax that recovers the rent of land for public purposes would not affect the opportunity cost of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it. This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, market inventories of land show, if anything, an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity).

==Significance==
Land plays a vital role in advanced economies. In the UK, the &quot;non-produced asset of land&quot; accounts for 51% of the country&#x27;s total net worth, implying that it plays a more critical role in the economy than capital.

== Academic ==
Some United Kingdom and commonwealth universities offer courses in &quot;land economy&quot;, where economics is studied alongside law, business regulation, surveying, and the built and natural environments. This mode of study at Cambridge dates back to 1917 when William Cecil Dampier suggested the creation of a school of rural economy at the university.

==Accounting==
As a tangible asset, land is represented in accounting as a fixed asset or a capital asset.

== Sustainability ==
The sustainable use of land is the focus of some economic theories.

<text>Anklam (), formerly known as Tanglim and Wendenburg, is a town in the Western Pomerania region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in north-eastern Germany. It is situated on the banks of the Peene river, just 8 km from its mouth in the , the western part of the Szczecin Lagoon. Anklam has a population of 12,177 (2021) and was the capital of the former Ostvorpommern district. Since September 2011, it has been part of the district of Vorpommern-Greifswald.

==History==
In the early Middle Ages, there was an important Scandinavian and Wendish settlement in the area near the present town now known as Altes Lager Menzlin. Anklam proper began as an associated Wendish fortress.

In the Middle Ages the town was a part of the Duchy of Pomerania. During the German expansion eastwards, the abandoned fortress was developed into a settlement named Tanglim after its new founder. The site possesses importance as the head of navigation on the Peene. It was elevated to town status in 1244 and became a member of the Hanseatic League the same year or in 1483. The town remained small and non-influential, but achieved a measure of wealth and prosperity with its membership.

As a town of considerable military importance, it suffered greatly during the Thirty Years&#x27; War when Swedish and Imperial troops battled over it across a twenty-year span. Amid this and subsequent wars, it also endured repeated outbreaks of fire and plague. It was occupied by imperial forces from 1627 to 1630, and thereafter by Swedish forces. After the war, Anklam became part of Swedish Pomerania in 1648. In 1676, it was captured by Frederick William of Brandenburg.

In 1713, Anklam was looted by soldiers of the Tsardom of Russia. That it was not burned to the ground, as ordered by Peter the Great, was in large part due to the resistance of Christian Thomesen Carl (&quot;Carlson&quot;), after whom a street is named in remembrance. The southern parts of the town were ceded to Prussia by the 1720 Treaty of Stockholm, while a smaller section north of the Peene remained Swedish. It was damaged again during the Seven Years&#x27; War in the 1750s and 1760s, with its fortifications being effectively dismantled in 1762. Sweden yielded its remaining part of the town in 1815, when all of Western Pomerania became part of the Prussian province of Pomerania.

In the 19th century, Anklam was connected with Berlin and Stettin (Szczecin) by rail and developed its manufacture of linen and woolen goods, leather, beer, and soap. Its 1871 population was 10,739, which had risen to 14,602 by the turn of the century. By the time of the First World War, it possessed a military school and developed iron foundries and sugar factories. In 1939 the Wehrmacht took over the military school and constructed a military prison on the grounds. In September 1942, the FStGA 8 field penal battalion for Allied prisoners-of-war was established and afterwards relocated to the eastern front.

Anklam was nearly completely destroyed by several bombing raids of the U.S. Air Force in 1943 and 1944 and in the last days of World War II, when the advancing Soviets burned and leveled most of the town. During the final stages of the war, in February 1945, the German-perpetrated death march of Allied POWs from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the town. After the war, Anklam became part of the East German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and after the dissolution of the province it was part of Bezirk Neubrandenburg from 1952 to 1990. The town was rebuilt in the rather uniform socialist style.

After the 1990 reunification of Germany, Anklam became part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, re-created at that time.

==Sights==

Anklam was a prosperous medieval city but suffered severely during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the Second World War, as well as from periodic fires. Nonetheless, Anklam has some significant buildings remaining. The 12th-century church of St Mary was rebuilt in the 15th century, had a modern spire added in the 19th, and was repaired in 1947.

<text>A pressurized water reactor (PWR) is a type of light-water nuclear reactor. PWRs constitute the large majority of the world&#x27;s nuclear power plants (with notable exceptions being the UK, Japan, India and Canada). 

In a PWR, water is used both as a neutron moderator and as coolant fluid for the reactor core. In the core, water is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms contained in the fuel. Using high pressure (around 155 bar) ensures that the water stays in a liquid state. The heated water then flows to a steam generator, where it transfers its thermal energy to the water of a secondary cycle kept at a lower pressure which allows it to vaporize. The resulting steam then drives steam turbines linked to an electric generator. A boiling water reactor (BWR) by contrast does not maintain such a high pressure in the primary cycle and the water thus vaporizes inside of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) before being sent to the turbine. Most PWR designs make use of two to six steam generators each associated with a coolant loop.

PWRs were originally designed to serve as nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines and were used in the original design of the second commercial power plant at Shippingport Atomic Power Station.

PWRs are operated in the United States, France, Russia, China, South Korea and several other countries. The majority are Generation II reactors; newer Generation III designs such as the AP1000, Hualong One, EPR and APR-1400 have entered service from 2018.

== History ==

Several hundred PWRs are used for marine propulsion in aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and ice breakers. In the US, they were originally designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for use as a nuclear submarine power plant with a fully operational submarine power plant located at the Idaho National Laboratory. Follow-on work was conducted by Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. The first purely commercial nuclear power plant at Shippingport Atomic Power Station was originally designed as a pressurized water reactor (although the first power plant connected to the grid was at Obninsk, USSR), on insistence from Admiral Hyman G. Rickover that a viable commercial plant would include none of the &quot;crazy thermodynamic cycles that everyone else wants to build&quot;.

The United States Army Nuclear Power Program operated pressurized water reactors from 1954 to 1974. Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station initially operated two pressurized water reactor plants, TMI-1 and TMI-2. The partial meltdown of TMI-2 in 1979 essentially ended the growth in new construction of nuclear power plants in the United States for two decades. Watts Bar unit 2 (a Westinghouse 4-loop PWR) came online in 2016, becoming the first new nuclear reactor in the United States since 1996.

The pressurized water reactor has several new Generation III reactor evolutionary designs: the AP1000, VVER-1200, ACPR1000+, APR1400, Hualong One, IPWR-900 and EPR. The first AP1000 and EPR reactors were connected to the power grid in China in 2018. In 2020, NuScale Power became the first U.S. company to receive regulatory approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small modular reactor with a modified PWR design. Also in 2020, the Energy Impact Center introduced the OPEN100 project, which published open-source blueprints for the construction of a 100 MWelectric nuclear power plant with a PWR design.

== Design ==

Nuclear fuel in the reactor pressure vessel is engaged in a controlled fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating the water in the primary coolant loop by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through several thousand small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the shell side of the exchanger where the secondary coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. This transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.

In a nuclear power station, the pressurized steam is fed through a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator connected to the electric grid for transmission. After passing through the turbine the secondary coolant (water-steam mixture) is cooled down and condensed in a condenser. The condenser converts the steam to a liquid so that it can be pumped back into the steam generator, and maintains a vacuum at the turbine outlet so that the pressure drop across the turbine, and hence the energy extracted from the steam, is maximized. Before being fed into the steam generator, the condensed steam (referred to as feedwater) is sometimes preheated in order to minimize thermal shock.

The steam generated has other uses besides power generation. In nuclear ships and submarines, the steam is fed through a steam turbine connected to a set of speed reduction gears to a shaft used for propulsion. Direct mechanical action by expansion of the steam can be used for a steam-powered aircraft catapult or similar applications. District heating by the steam is used in some countries and direct heating is applied to internal plant applications.

Two things are characteristic for the pressurized water reactor (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.

== Reactor ==
=== Coolant ===

Light water is used as the primary coolant in a PWR. Water enters through the bottom of the reactor&#x27;s core at about and is heated as it flows upwards through the reactor core to a temperature of about . The water remains liquid despite the high temperature due to the high pressure in the primary coolant loop, usually around 155 bar (15.5 MPa 153 atm, 2,250 psi).
The water in a PWR cannot exceed a temperature of or a pressure of 22.064 MPa (3200 psi or 218 atm), because those are the critical point of water. Supercritical water reactors are (as of 2022) only a proposed concept in which the coolant would never leave the supercritical state. However, as this requires even higher pressures than a PWR and can cause issues of corrosion, so far no such reactor has been built.

=== Pressurizer ===
Pressure in the primary circuit is maintained by a pressurizer, a separate vessel that is connected to the primary circuit and partially filled with water which is heated to the saturation temperature (boiling point) for the desired pressure by submerged electrical heaters. To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature is maintained at 345 °C (653 °F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30 °C (54 °F). As 345 °C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is at the edge of a phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients in the primary coolant system manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and water spray, which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.

=== Pumps ===

The coolant is pumped around the primary circuit by powerful pumps. These pumps have a rate of ~100,000 gallons of coolant per minute. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2 MPa (60 atm, 900 psia), 275 °C (530 °F) — for use in the steam turbine. The cooled primary coolant is then returned to the reactor vessel to be heated again.

== Moderator ==
Pressurized water reactors, like all thermal reactor designs, require the fast fission neutrons to be slowed (a process called moderation or thermalizing) in order to interact with the nuclear fuel and sustain the chain reaction. In PWRs the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This &quot;moderating&quot; of neutrons will happen more often when the water is more dense (more collisions will occur). The use of water as a moderator is an important safety feature of PWRs, as an increase in temperature may cause the water to expand, giving greater &#x27;gaps&#x27; between the water molecules and reducing the probability of thermalization — thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactivity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, makes PWR reactors very stable. This process is referred to as &#x27;Self-Regulating&#x27;, i.e. the hotter the coolant becomes, the less reactive the plant becomes, shutting itself down slightly to compensate and vice versa. Thus the plant controls itself around a given temperature set by the position of the control rods.

In contrast, the Soviet RBMK reactor design used at Chernobyl, which uses graphite instead of water as the moderator and uses boiling water as the coolant, has a large positive thermal coefficient of reactivity. This means reactivity and heat generation increases when coolant and fuel temperatures increase, which makes the RBMK design less stable than pressurized water reactors at high operating temperature. In addition to its property of slowing down neutrons when serving as a moderator, water also has a property of absorbing neutrons, albeit to a lesser degree. When the coolant water temperature increases, the boiling increases, which creates voids. Thus there is less water to absorb thermal neutrons that have already been slowed by the graphite moderator, causing an increase in reactivity. This property is called the void coefficient of reactivity, and in an RBMK reactor like Chernobyl, the void coefficient is positive, and fairly large, making it very hard to regulate when the reaction begins to run away. The RBMK reactors also have a flawed control rods design in which during rapid scrams, the graphite reaction enhancement tips of the rods would displace water at the bottom of the reactor and locally increase reactivity there. This is called the &quot;positive scram effect&quot; that is unique to the flawed RBMK control rods design. These design flaws, in addition to operator errors that pushed the reactor to its limits, are generally seen as the causes of the Chernobyl disaster.

The Canadian CANDU heavy water reactor design have a slight positive void coefficient, these reactors mitigate this issues with a number of built-in advanced passive safety systems not found in the Soviet RBMK design. No criticality could occur in a CANDU reactor or any other heavy water reactor when ordinary light water is supplied to the reactor as an emergency coolant. Depending on burnup, boric acid or another neutron poison will have to be added to emergency coolant to avoid a criticality accident.

PWRs are designed to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water&#x27;s neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.

=== Fuel ===


After enrichment, the uranium dioxide () powder is fired in a high-temperature, sintering furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium dioxide. The cylindrical pellets are then clad in a corrosion-resistant zirconium metal alloy Zircaloy which are backfilled with helium to aid heat conduction and detect leakages. Zircaloy is chosen because of its mechanical properties and its low absorption cross section. The finished fuel rods are grouped in fuel assemblies, called fuel bundles, that are then used to build the core of the reactor. A typical PWR has fuel assemblies of 200 to 300 rods each, and a large reactor would have about 150–250 such assemblies with 80–100 tons of uranium in all. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14 × 14 to 17 × 17. A PWR produces on the order of 900 to 1,600 MWe. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters in length.

Refuelings for most commercial PWRs is on an 18–24 month cycle. Approximately one third of the core is replaced each refueling, though some more modern refueling schemes may reduce refuel time to a few days and allow refueling to occur on a shorter periodicity.

=== Control ===
In PWRs reactor power can be viewed as following steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and cadmium control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.

Reactivity adjustment to maintain 100% power as the fuel is burned up in most commercial PWRs is normally achieved by varying the concentration of boric acid dissolved in the primary reactor coolant. Boron readily absorbs neutrons and increasing or decreasing its concentration in the reactor coolant will therefore affect the neutron activity correspondingly. An entire control system involving high pressure pumps (usually called the charging and letdown system) is required to remove water from the high pressure primary loop and re-inject the water back in with differing concentrations of boric acid. The reactor control rods, inserted through the reactor vessel head directly into the fuel bundles, are moved for the following reasons:
to start up the reactor,
to shut down the primary nuclear reactions in the reactor,
to accommodate short term transients, such as changes to load on the turbine,

The control rods can also be used to compensate for nuclear poison inventory and to compensate for nuclear fuel depletion. However, these effects are more usually accommodated by altering the primary coolant boric acid concentration.

In contrast, BWRs have no boron in the reactor coolant and control the reactor power by adjusting the reactor coolant flow rate.

== Advantages ==
PWR reactors are very stable due to their tendency to produce less power as temperatures increase; this makes the reactor easier to operate from a stability standpoint.

PWR turbine cycle loop is separate from the primary loop, so the water in the secondary loop is not contaminated by radioactive materials.

PWRs can passively scram the reactor in case offsite power is lost to immediately stop the primary nuclear reaction. The control rods are held by electromagnets and fall by gravity when current is lost; full insertion safely shuts down the primary nuclear reaction.

PWR technology is favoured by nations seeking to develop a nuclear navy; the compact reactors fit well in nuclear submarines and other nuclear ships.

PWRs are the most deployed type of reactor globally, allowing for a wide range of suppliers of new plants and parts for existing plants. Due to long experience with their operation they are the closest thing to mature technology that exists in nuclear energy.

PWRs - depending on type - can be fueled with MOX-fuel and/or the Russian Remix Fuel (which has a lower and a higher content than &quot;regular&quot; U/Pu MOX-fuel) allowing for a (partially) closed nuclear fuel cycle.

Water is a nontoxic, transparent, chemically unreactive (by comparison with e.g. NaK) coolant that is liquid at room temperature which makes visual inspection and maintenance easier. It is also easy and cheap to obtain unlike heavy water or even nuclear graphite.

Compared to reactors operating on natural uranium, PWRs can achieve a relatively high burnup. A typical PWR will exchange a quarter to a third of its fuel load every 18-24 months and have maintenance and inspection, that requires the reactor to be shut down, scheduled for this window. While more uranium ore is consumed per unit of electricity produced than in a natural uranium fueled reactor, the amount of spent fuel is less with the balance being depleted uranium whose radiological danger is lower than that of natural uranium.

== Disadvantages ==
The coolant water must be highly pressurized to remain liquid at high temperatures. This requires high strength piping and a heavy pressure vessel and hence increases construction costs. The higher pressure can increase the consequences of a loss-of-coolant accident. The reactor pressure vessel is manufactured from ductile steel but, as the plant is operated, neutron flux from the reactor causes this steel to become less ductile. Eventually the ductility of the steel will reach limits determined by the applicable boiler and pressure vessel standards, and the pressure vessel must be repaired or replaced. This might not be practical or economic, and so determines the life of the plant.

Additional high pressure components such as reactor coolant pumps, pressurizer, and steam generators are also needed. This also increases the capital cost and complexity of a PWR power plant.

The high temperature water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary coolant loop. This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to control rod drive mechanisms when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.

Due to the requirement to load a pressurized water reactor&#x27;s primary coolant loop with boron, undesirable radioactive secondary tritium production in the water is over 25 times greater than in boiling water reactors of similar power, owing to the latter&#x27;s absence of the neutron moderating element in its coolant loop. The tritium is created by the absorption of a fast neutron in the nucleus of a boron-10 atom which subsequently splits into a lithium-7 and tritium atom. Pressurized water reactors annually emit several hundred curies of tritium to the environment as part of normal operation.

Natural uranium is only 0.7% uranium-235, the isotope necessary for thermal reactors. This makes it necessary to enrich the uranium fuel, which significantly increases the costs of fuel production. Compared to reactors operating on natural uranium, less energy is generated per unit of uranium ore even though a higher burnup can be achieved. Nuclear reprocessing can &quot;stretch&quot; the fuel supply of both natural uranium and enriched uranium reactors but is virtually only practiced for light water reactors operating with lightly enriched fuel as spent fuel from e.g. CANDU reactors is very low in fissile material.

Because water acts as a neutron moderator, it is not possible to build a fast-neutron reactor with a PWR design. A reduced moderation water reactor may however achieve a breeding ratio greater than unity, though this reactor design has disadvantages of its own.

Spent fuel from a PWR usually has a higher content of fissile material than natural uranium. Without nuclear reprocessing, this fissile material cannot be used as fuel in a PWR. It can, however, be used in a CANDU with only minimal reprocessing in a process called &quot;DUPIC&quot; - Direct Use of spent PWR fuel in CANDU.

Thermal efficiency, while better than for boiling water reactors, cannot achieve the values of reactors with higher operating temperatures such as those cooled with high temperature gases, liquid metals or molten salts. Similarly process heat drawn from a PWR is not suitable for most industrial applications as those require temperatures in excess of .

Radiolysis and certain accident scenarios which involve interactions between hot steam and zircalloy cladding can produce hydrogen from the cooling water leading to hydrogen explosions as a potential accident scenario. During the Fukushima nuclear accident a hydrogen explosion damaging the containment building was a major concern, though the reactors at the plant were BWRs, which owing to the steam at the top of the pressure vessel by design carry a greater risk of this happening. Some reactors contain catalytic recombiners which let the hydrogen react with ambient oxygen in a non-explosive fashion.

<text>A boiling water reactor (BWR) is a type of nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power. It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor (PWR).

BWR are thermal neutron reactors, where water is thus used both as a coolant and as a moderator, slowing down neutrons. As opposed to PWR, there is no separation between the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the steam turbine in BWR. Water is allowed to vaporize directly inside of the reactor core (at a pressure of approximately 70 bars) before being directed to the turbine which drives the electric generator. Immediately after the turbine, a heat exchanger called a condenser brings the outgoing fluid back into liquid form before it is sent back into the reactor. The cold side of the condenser is made up of the plant&#x27;s secondary coolant cycle which is fed by the power plant&#x27;s cold source (generally the sea or a river, more rarely air).

The BWR was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory and General Electric (GE) in the mid-1950s. The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor.

== Overview ==
A boiling water reactor uses demineralized water as a coolant and neutron moderator. Heat is produced by nuclear fission in the reactor core, and this causes the cooling water to boil, producing steam. The steam is directly used to drive a turbine, after which it is cooled in a condenser and converted back to liquid water. This water is then returned to the reactor core, completing the loop. The cooling water is maintained at about 75 atm (7.6 MPa, 1000–1100 psi) so that it boils in the core at about 285 °C (550 °F). In comparison, there is no significant boiling allowed in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) because of the high pressure maintained in its primary loop—approximately 158 atm (16 MPa, 2300 psi). The core damage frequency of the reactor was estimated to be between 10−4 and 10−7 (i.e., one core damage accident per every 10,000 to 10,000,000 reactor years).

== Components ==
=== Condensate and feedwater ===
Steam exiting the turbine flows into condensers located underneath the low-pressure turbines, where the steam is cooled and returned to the liquid state (condensate). The condensate is then pumped through feedwater heaters that raise its temperature using extraction steam from various turbine stages. Feedwater from the feedwater heaters enters the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) through nozzles high on the vessel, well above the top of the nuclear fuel assemblies (these nuclear fuel assemblies constitute the &quot;core&quot;) but below the water level.

The feedwater enters into the downcomer or annulus region and combines with water exiting the moisture separators. The feedwater subcools the saturated water from the moisture separators. This water now flows down the downcomer or annulus region, which is separated from the core by a tall shroud. The water then goes through either jet pumps or internal recirculation pumps that provide additional pumping power (hydraulic head). The water now makes a 180-degree turn and moves up through the lower core plate into the nuclear core, where the fuel elements heat the water. Water exiting the fuel channels at the top guide is saturated with a steam quality of about 15%. Typical core flow may be 45,000,000 kg/h (100,000,000 lb/h) with 6,500,000 kg/h (14,500,000 lb/h) steam flow. However, core-average void fraction is a significantly higher fraction (~40%). These sort of values may be found in each plant&#x27;s publicly available Technical Specifications, Final Safety Analysis Report, or Core Operating Limits Report.

The heating from the core creates a thermal head that assists the recirculation pumps in recirculating the water inside of the RPV. A BWR can be designed with no recirculation pumps and rely entirely on the thermal head to recirculate the water inside of the RPV. The forced recirculation head from the recirculation pumps is very useful in controlling power, however, and allows achieving higher power levels that would not otherwise be possible. The thermal power level is easily varied by simply increasing or decreasing the forced recirculation flow through the recirculation pumps.

The two-phase fluid (water and steam) above the core enters the riser area, which is the upper region contained inside of the shroud. The height of this region may be increased to increase the thermal natural recirculation pumping head. At the top of the riser area is the moisture separator. By swirling the two-phase flow in cyclone separators, the steam is separated and rises upwards towards the steam dryer while the water remains behind and flows horizontally out into the downcomer or annulus region. In the downcomer or annulus region, it combines with the feedwater flow and the cycle repeats.

The saturated steam that rises above the separator is dried by a chevron dryer structure. The &quot;wet&quot; steam goes through a tortuous path where the water droplets are slowed and directed out into the downcomer or annulus region. The &quot;dry&quot; steam then exits the RPV through four main steam lines and goes to the turbine.

=== Control systems ===
Reactor power is controlled via two methods: by inserting or withdrawing control rods (control blades) and by changing the water flow through the reactor core.

Positioning (withdrawing or inserting) control rods is the normal method for controlling power when starting up a BWR. As control rods are withdrawn, neutron absorption decreases in the control material and increases in the fuel, so reactor power increases. As control rods are inserted, neutron absorption increases in the control material and decreases in the fuel, so reactor power decreases. Differently from the PWR, in a BWR the control rods (boron carbide plates) are inserted from below to give a more homogeneous distribution of the power: in the upper side the density of the water is lower due to vapour formation, making the neutron moderation less efficient and the fission probability lower. In normal operation, the control rods are only used to keep a homogeneous power distribution in the reactor and to compensate for the consumption of the fuel, while the power is controlled through the water flow (see below). Some early BWRs and the proposed ESBWR (Economic Simplified BWR made by General Electric Hitachi) designs use only natural circulation with control rod positioning to control power from zero to 100% because they do not have reactor recirculation systems.

Changing (increasing or decreasing) the flow of water through the core is the normal and convenient method for controlling power from approximately 30% to 100% reactor power. When operating on the so-called &quot;100% rod line&quot;, power may be varied from approximately 30% to 100% of rated power by changing the reactor recirculation system flow by varying the speed of the recirculation pumps or modulating flow control valves. As flow of water through the core is increased, steam bubbles (&quot;voids&quot;) are more quickly removed from the core, the amount of liquid water in the core increases, neutron moderation increases, more neutrons are slowed to be absorbed by the fuel, and reactor power increases. As flow of water through the core is decreased, steam voids remain longer in the core, the amount of liquid water in the core decreases, neutron moderation decreases, fewer neutrons are slowed enough to be absorbed by the fuel, and reactor power decreases. Thus the BWR has a negative void coefficient.

Reactor pressure in a BWR is controlled by the main turbine or main steam bypass valves. Unlike a PWR, where the turbine steam demand is set manually by the operators, in a BWR, the turbine valves and bypass valves will modulate to maintain reactor pressure at a setpoint. Under this control mode, the turbine output will automatically follow reactor power changes. When the turbine is offline or trips, the main steam bypass/dump valves will open to direct steam directly to the condenser. These bypass valves will automatically or manually modulate as necessary to maintain reactor pressure and control the reactor&#x27;s heatup and cooldown rates while steaming is still in progress.

Reactor water level is controlled by the main feedwater system. From about 0.5% power to 100% power, feedwater will automatically control the water level in the reactor. At low power conditions, the feedwater controller acts as a simple PID control by watching reactor water level. At high power conditions, the controller is switched to a &quot;Three-Element&quot; control mode, where the controller looks at the current water level in the reactor, as well as the amount of water going in and the amount of steam leaving the reactor. By using the water injection and steam flow rates, the feed water control system can rapidly anticipate water level deviations and respond to maintain water level within a few inches of set point. If one of the two feedwater pumps fails during operation, the feedwater system will command the recirculation system to rapidly reduce core flow, effectively reducing reactor power from 100% to 50% in a few seconds. At this power level a single feedwater pump can maintain the core water level. If all feedwater is lost, the reactor will scram and the Emergency Core Cooling System is used to restore reactor water level.

=== Steam turbines ===
Steam produced in the reactor core passes through steam separators and dryer plates above the core and then directly to the turbine, which is part of the reactor circuit. Because the water around the core of a reactor is always contaminated with traces of radionuclides due to neutron capture from the water, the turbine must be shielded during normal operation, and radiological protection must be provided during maintenance. The increased cost related to operation and maintenance of a BWR tends to balance the savings due to the simpler design and greater thermal efficiency of a BWR when compared with a PWR. Most of the radioactivity in the water is very short-lived (mostly N-16, with a 7-second half-life), so the turbine hall can be entered soon after the reactor is shut down.

BWR steam turbines employ a high-pressure turbine designed to handle saturated steam, and multiple low-pressure turbines. The high-pressure turbine receives steam directly from the reactor. Some of the High-pressure turbine exhaust is sent to the Moisture Seperator Reheaters (MSR) and some is sent to the feedwater heaters. This moisture seperator reheater employs a group of chevrons to remove entrained moisture from the steam. The steam is then superheated to over 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees Celsius) for the low-pressure turbines to use. The exhaust of the low-pressure turbines is sent to the main condenser. The moisture seperator reheaters take some of the high pressure turbine&#x27;s steam, and some of the reactor&#x27;s steam, and use it as a heating source to reheat what comes out of the high-pressure turbine exhaust. While the reheaters take steam away from the turbine and reactor, the net result is that the reheaters improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the plant.

=== Reactor core ===

A modern BWR fuel assembly comprises 74 to 100 fuel rods, and there are up to approximately 800 assemblies in a reactor core, holding up to approximately 140 short tons of low-enriched uranium. The number of fuel assemblies in a specific reactor is based on considerations of desired reactor power output, reactor core size and reactor power density.

=== Safety systems ===

In order to be considered safe, nuclear reactors must at all time comply with the fundamental nuclear safety functions:

# Control of reactivity
# Removal of heat from the fuel
# Confinement of radioactive materials, shielding against radiation, and control of planned radioactive releases, as well as limitation of accidental releases

During normal operation of the reactor, good design, construction and operation practices ensure the compliance with the safety functions. In addition, dedicated safety systems must be installed to ensure that compliance with the safety functions is maintained in case of deviations from normal conditions. The safety systems of a modern reactor are designed to according to a defence in depth philosophy, which is a design philosophy that is integrated throughout construction and commissioning of the plant. In order to minimize the risks of inability to fulfil a safety function, a BWR uses redundant safety systems, relying on different action mechanisms and spatially separated.

Following emergency shutdown of the fission reaction, heat continues to be produced inside nuclear reactors due to the radioactive decay of fission products and materials that have been activated by neutron absorption. The decay heat of a reactor core is of the order of a few tens of megawatt (depending on the core&#x27;s operating power and operation duration) which is sufficient to lead to significant damage and even melting. To prevent such cases, safety systems grouped under the umbrellas of emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) are provided in order to remove heat through the injection of cooling water. 

=== Refueling systems ===
The reactor fuel rods are occasionally replaced by moving them from the reactor pressure vessel to the spent fuel pool. A typical fuel cycle lasts 12–24 months, with about one third to one fifth of fuel assemblies being replaced during a refueling outage. The remaining fuel assemblies are shuffled to new core locations to maximize the efficiency and power produced in the next fuel cycle.

Because they are hot both radioactively and thermally, this is done via cranes and under water. For this reason the spent fuel storage pools are above the reactor in typical installations. They are shielded by water several times their height, and stored in rigid arrays in which their geometry is controlled to avoid criticality. In the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster this became problematic because water was lost (as it was heated by the spent fuel) from one or more spent fuel pools and the earthquake could have altered the geometry. The fact that the fuel rods&#x27; cladding is a zirconium alloy was also problematic since this element can react with steam at temperatures above to produce hydrogen,
which can ignite with oxygen in the air. Normally the fuel rods are kept sufficiently cool in the reactor and spent fuel pools that this is not a concern, and the cladding remains intact for the life of the rod.

== Evolution ==
=== Early concepts ===
The BWR concept was developed slightly later than the PWR concept. Development of the BWR started in the early 1950s, and was a collaboration between General Electric (GE) and several US national laboratories.

Research into nuclear power in the US was led by the three military services. The Navy, seeing the possibility of turning submarines into full-time underwater vehicles, and ships that could steam around the world without refueling, appointed Captain Hyman Rickover to run their nuclear power program. Rickover decided on the PWR route for the Navy, as the early researchers in the field of nuclear power feared that the direct production of steam within a reactor would cause instability, while they knew that the use of pressurized water would definitively work as a means of heat transfer. This concern led to the US&#x27;s first research effort in nuclear power being devoted to the PWR, which was highly suited for naval vessels (submarines, especially), as space was at a premium, and PWRs could be made compact and high-power enough to fit into such vessels.

But other researchers wanted to investigate whether the supposed instability caused by boiling water in a reactor core would really cause instability. During early reactor development, a small group of engineers accidentally increased the reactor power level on an experimental reactor to such an extent that the water quickly boiled. This shut down the reactor, indicating the useful self-moderating property in emergency circumstances. In particular, Samuel Untermyer II, a researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, proposed and oversaw a series of experiments: the BORAX experiments—to see if a &quot;boiling water reactor&quot; would be feasible for use in energy production. He found that it was, after subjecting his reactors to quite strenuous tests, proving the safety principles of the BWR.

Following this series of tests, GE got involved and collaborated with Argonne National Laboratory to bring this technology to market. Larger-scale tests were conducted through the late 1950s/early/mid-1960s that only partially used directly generated (primary) nuclear boiler system steam to feed the turbine and incorporated heat exchangers for the generation of secondary steam to drive separate parts of the turbines. The literature does not indicate why this was the case, but it was eliminated on production models of the BWR.

=== First series of production ===

The first generation of production boiling water reactors saw the incremental development of the unique and distinctive features of the BWR: the torus (used to quench steam in the event of a transient requiring the quenching of steam), as well as the drywell, the elimination of the heat exchanger, the steam dryer, the distinctive general layout of the reactor building, and the standardization of reactor control and safety systems. The first, General Electric (GE), series of production BWRs evolved through 6 iterative design phases, each termed BWR/1 through BWR/6. (BWR/4s, BWR/5s, and BWR/6s are the most common types in service today.) The vast majority of BWRs in service throughout the world belong to one of these design phases.

* 1st generation BWR: BWR/1 with Mark I containment.
* 2nd generation BWRs: BWR/2, BWR/3 and some BWR/4 with Mark I containment. Other BWR/4, and BWR/5 with Mark-II containment.
* 3rd generation BWRs: BWR/6 with Mark-III containment.

Containment variants were constructed using either concrete or steel for the Primary Containment, Drywell and Wetwell in various combinations.

Apart from the GE designs there were others by ABB (Asea-Atom), MITSU, Toshiba and KWU (Kraftwerk Union). See List of boiling water reactors.

=== Advanced boiling water reactor===
A newer design of BWR is known as the advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR). The ABWR was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has been further improved to the present day. The ABWR incorporates advanced technologies in the design, including computer control, plant automation, control rod removal, motion, and insertion, in-core pumping, and nuclear safety to deliver improvements over the original series of production BWRs, with a high power output (1350 MWe per reactor), and a significantly lowered probability of core damage. Most significantly, the ABWR was a completely standardized design, that could be made for series production.

The ABWR was approved by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for production as a standardized design in the early 1990s. Subsequently, numerous ABWRs were built in Japan. One development spurred by the success of the ABWR in Japan is that General Electric&#x27;s nuclear energy division merged with Hitachi Corporation&#x27;s nuclear energy division, forming GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, which is now the major worldwide developer of the BWR design.

=== Simplified boiling water reactor - never licensed ===
Parallel to the development of the ABWR, General Electric also developed a different concept, known as the simplified boiling water reactor (SBWR). This smaller 600 megawatt electrical reactor was notable for its incorporation—for the first time ever in a light water reactor—of &quot;passive safety&quot; design principles. The concept of passive safety means that the reactor, rather than requiring the intervention of active systems, such as emergency injection pumps, to keep the reactor within safety margins, was instead designed to return to a safe state solely through operation of natural forces if a safety-related contingency developed.

For example, if the reactor got too hot, it would trigger a system that would release soluble neutron absorbers (generally a solution of borated materials, or a solution of borax), or materials that greatly hamper a chain reaction by absorbing neutrons, into the reactor core. The tank containing the soluble neutron absorbers would be located above the reactor, and the absorption solution, once the system was triggered, would flow into the core through force of gravity, and bring the reaction to a near-complete stop. Another example was the Isolation Condenser system, which relied on the principle of hot water/steam rising to bring hot coolant into large heat exchangers located above the reactor in very deep tanks of water, thus accomplishing residual heat removal. Yet another example was the omission of recirculation pumps within the core; these pumps were used in other BWR designs to keep cooling water moving; they were expensive, hard to reach to repair, and could occasionally fail; so as to improve reliability, the ABWR incorporated no less than 10 of these recirculation pumps, so that even if several failed, a sufficient number would remain serviceable so that an unscheduled shutdown would not be necessary, and the pumps could be repaired during the next refueling outage. Instead, the designers of the &quot;simplified boiling water reactor&quot; used thermal analysis to design the reactor core such that natural circulation (cold water falls, hot water rises) would bring water to the center of the core to be boiled.

The ultimate result of the passive safety features of the SBWR would be a reactor that would not require human intervention in the event of a major safety contingency for at least 48 hours following the safety contingency; thence, it would only require periodic refilling of cooling water tanks located completely outside of the reactor, isolated from the cooling system, and designed to remove reactor waste heat through evaporation. The &quot;simplified boiling water reactor&quot; was submitted to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, it was withdrawn prior to approval; still, the concept remained intriguing to General Electric&#x27;s designers, and served as the basis of future developments.

=== Economic simplified boiling water reactor ===

During a period beginning in the late 1990s, GE engineers proposed to combine the features of the advanced boiling water reactor design with the distinctive safety features of the simplified boiling water reactor design, along with scaling up the resulting design to a larger size of 1,600 MWe (4,500 MWth). This Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) design was submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval in April 2005, and design certification was granted by the NRC in September 2014.

Reportedly, this design has been advertised as having a core damage probability of only 3×10−8 core damage events per reactor-year. That is, there would need to be 3 million ESBWRs operating before one would expect a single core-damaging event during their 100-year lifetimes. Earlier designs of the BWR, the BWR/4, had core damage probabilities as high as 1×10−5 core-damage events per reactor-year. This extraordinarily low CDP for the ESBWR far exceeds the other large LWRs on the market.

== Comparison with other types ==
=== Advantages of BWR ===
* The reactor vessel and associated components operate at a substantially lower pressure of about compared to about in a PWR.
* Pressure vessel is subject to significantly less irradiation compared to a PWR, and so does not become as brittle with age.
* Operates at a lower nuclear fuel temperature, largely due to heat transfer by the latent heat of vaporization, as opposed to sensible heat in PWRs.
* Fewer large metal and overall components due to a lack of steam generators and a pressurizer vessel, as well as the associated primary circuit pumps. (Older BWRs have external recirculation loops, but even this piping is eliminated in modern BWRs, such as the ABWR.) This also makes BWRs simpler to operate.
* Lower risk (probability) of a rupture causing loss of coolant compared to a PWR, and lower risk of core damage should such a rupture occur. This is due to fewer pipes, fewer large-diameter pipes, fewer welds and no steam generator tubes.
* NRC assessments of limiting fault potentials indicate if such a fault occurred, the average BWR would be less likely to sustain core damage than the average PWR due to the robustness and redundancy of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS).
* Measuring the water level in the pressure vessel is the same for both normal and emergency operations, which results in easy and intuitive assessment of emergency conditions. 
* Can operate at lower core power density levels using natural circulation without forced flow.
* A BWR may be designed to operate using only natural circulation so that recirculation pumps are eliminated. (The new ESBWR design uses natural circulation.)
* BWRs do not use boric acid to control fission burn-up to avoid the production of tritium (contamination of the turbines), leading to less possibility of corrosion within the reactor vessel and piping. (Corrosion from boric acid must be carefully monitored in PWRs; it has been demonstrated that reactor vessel head corrosion can occur if the reactor vessel head is not properly maintained. See Davis-Besse. Since BWRs do not utilize boric acid, these contingencies are eliminated.)
* The power control by reduction of the moderator density (vapour bubbles in the water) instead of by addition of neutron absorbers (boric acid in PWR) leads to breeding of U-238 by fast neutrons, producing fissile Pu-239.
** This effect is amplified in reduced moderation boiling water reactors, resulting in a light water reactor with improved fuel utilization and reduced long-lived radioactive waste more characteristic of sodium breeder reactors.
* BWRs generally have &quot;N&quot;-2 redundancy on their major safety-related systems, which normally consist of four &quot;trains&quot; of components. This generally means that up to two of the four components of a safety system can fail and the system will still perform if called upon.
* Due to their single major vendor (GE/Hitachi), the current fleet of BWRs have predictable, uniform designs that, while not completely standardized, generally are very similar to one another. The ABWR/ESBWR designs are completely standardized. Lack of standardization remains a problem with PWRs, as, at least in the United States, there are three design families represented among the current PWR fleet (Combustion Engineering, Westinghouse, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox), and within these families, there are quite divergent designs. Still, some countries could reach a high level of standardisation with PWRs, like France.
** Additional families of PWRs are being introduced. For example, Mitsubishi&#x27;s APWR, Areva&#x27;s US-EPR, and Westinghouse&#x27;s AP1000/AP600 will add diversity and complexity to an already diverse crowd, and possibly cause customers seeking stability and predictability to seek other designs, such as the BWR.
* BWRs are overrepresented in imports, when the importing nation does not have a nuclear navy (PWRs are favored by nuclear naval states due to their compact, high-power design used on nuclear-powered vessels; since naval reactors are generally not exported, they cause national skill to be developed in PWR design, construction, and operation). This may be due to the fact that BWRs are ideally suited for peaceful uses like power generation, process/industrial/district heating, and desalination, due to low cost, simplicity, and safety focus, which come at the expense of larger size and slightly lower thermal efficiency.
** Sweden is standardized mainly on BWRs.
** Mexico&#x27;s two reactors are BWRs.
** Japan experimented with both PWRs and BWRs, but most builds as of late have been of BWRs, specifically ABWRs.
** In the CEGB open competition in the early 1960s for a standard design for UK 2nd-generation power reactors, the PWR didn&#x27;t even make it to the final round, which was a showdown between the BWR (preferred for its easily understood design as well as for being predictable and &quot;boring&quot;) and the AGR, a uniquely British design; the indigenous design won, possibly on technical merits, possibly due to the proximity of a general election. In the 1980s the CEGB built a PWR, Sizewell B.

=== Disadvantages of BWR ===
* BWRs require more complex calculations for managing consumption of nuclear fuel during operation due to &quot;two-phase (water and steam) fluid flow&quot; in the upper part of the core. This also requires more instrumentation in the reactor core.
* Larger reactor pressure vessel than for a PWR of similar power, with correspondingly higher cost, in particular for older models that still use a main steam generator and associated piping.
* Contamination of the turbine by short-lived activation products. This means that shielding and access control around the steam turbine are required during normal operations due to the radiation levels arising from the steam entering directly from the reactor core. This is a moderately minor concern, as most of the radiation flux is due to Nitrogen-16 (activation of oxygen in the water), which has a half-life of 7.1 seconds, allowing the turbine chamber to be entered within minutes of shutdown. Extensive experience demonstrates that shutdown maintenance on the turbine, condensate, and feedwater components of a BWR can be performed essentially as a fossil-fuel plant.
* Though the current BWRs are considered to be less likely to suffer core damage from the &quot;1 in 100,000 reactor-year&quot; limiting fault than the present fleet of PWRs (due to increased ECCS robustness and redundancy), there have been concerns raised about the pressure containment ability of the as-built, unmodified Mark I containment – that such may be insufficient to contain pressures generated by a limiting fault combined with complete ECCS failure that results in extremely severe core damage. In this double failure scenario, assumed to be extremely unlikely prior to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, an unmodified Mark I containment can allow some degree of radioactive release to occur. This is supposed to be mitigated by the modification of the Mark I containment; namely, the addition of an outgas stack system that, if containment pressure exceeds critical setpoints, is supposed to allow the orderly discharge of pressurizing gases after the gases pass through activated carbon filters designed to trap radionuclides.

=== Control rod issues ===
* Control rods are inserted from below for current BWR designs. There are two available hydraulic power sources that can drive the control rods into the core for a BWR under emergency conditions. There is a dedicated high-pressure hydraulic accumulator and also the pressure inside of the reactor pressure vessel available to each control rod. Either the dedicated accumulator (one per rod) or reactor pressure is capable of fully inserting each rod. Most other reactor types use top-entry control rods that are held up in the withdrawn position by electromagnets, causing them to fall into the reactor by gravity if power is lost. This advantage is partially offset by the fact that hydraulic forces provide much greater rod insertion forces than gravity, and as a consequence, BWR control rods are much less likely to jam in a partially inserted position due to damage to the control rod channels in a core damage event. Bottom-entry control rods also permit refueling without removal of the control rods and drives, as well as testing of the control rod systems with an open pressure vessel during refueling.

== Technical and background information ==
=== Start-up (&quot;going critical&quot;) ===


Reactor start up (criticality) is achieved by withdrawing control rods from the core to raise core reactivity to a level where it is evident that the nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining. This is known as &quot;going critical&quot;. Control rod withdrawal is performed slowly, as to carefully monitor core conditions as the reactor approaches criticality. When the reactor is observed to become slightly super-critical, that is, reactor power is increasing on its own, the reactor is declared critical.

Rod motion is performed using rod drive control systems. Newer BWRs such as the ABWR and ESBWR as well as all German and Swedish BWRs use the Fine Motion Control Rod Drive system, which allows multiple rods to be controlled with very smooth motions. This allows a reactor operator to evenly increase the core&#x27;s reactivity until the reactor is critical. Older BWR designs use a manual control system, which is usually limited to controlling one or four control rods at a time, and only through a series of notched positions with fixed intervals between these positions. Due to the limitations of the manual control system, it is possible while starting-up that the core can be placed into a condition where movement of a single control rod can cause a large nonlinear reactivity change, which could heat fuel elements to the point they fail (melt, ignite, weaken, etc.). As a result, GE developed a set of rules in 1977 called BPWS (Banked Position Withdrawal Sequence) which help minimize the effect of any single control rod movement and prevent fuel damage in the case of a control rod drop accident. BPWS separates control rods into four groups, A1, A2, B1, and B2. Then, either all of the A control rods or B control rods are pulled full out in a defined sequence to create a &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern. Next, the opposing group (B or A) is pulled in a defined sequence to positions 02, then 04, 08, 16, and finally full out (48). By following a BPWS compliant start-up sequence, the manual control system can be used to evenly and safely raise the entire core to critical, and prevent any fuel rods from exceeding 280 cal/gm energy release during any postulated event which could potentially damage the fuel.

=== Thermal margins ===
Several calculated/measured quantities are tracked while operating a BWR:

* Maximum Fraction Limiting Critical Power Ratio, or MFLCPR;
* Fraction Limiting Linear Heat Generation Rate, or FLLHGR;
* Average Planar Linear Heat Generation Rate, or APLHGR;
* Pre-Conditioning Interim Operating Management Recommendation, or PCIOMR;

MFLCPR, FLLHGR, and APLHGR must be kept less than 1.0 during normal operation; administrative controls are in place to assure some margin of error and margin of safety to these licensed limits. Typical computer simulations divide the reactor core into 24–25 axial planes; relevant quantities (margins, burnup, power, void history) are tracked for each &quot;node&quot; in the reactor core (764 fuel assemblies x 25 nodes/assembly = 19100 nodal calculations/quantity).

==== Maximum fraction limiting critical power ratio (MFLCPR) ====
Specifically, MFLCPR represents how close the leading fuel bundle is to &quot;dry-out&quot; (or &quot;departure from nucleate boiling&quot; for a PWR). Transition boiling is the unstable transient region where nucleate boiling tends toward film boiling. A water drop dancing on a hot frying pan is an example of film boiling. During film boiling a volume of insulating vapor separates the heated surface from the cooling fluid; this causes the temperature of the heated surface to increase drastically to once again reach equilibrium heat transfer with the cooling fluid. In other words, steam semi-insulates the heated surface and surface temperature rises to allow heat to get to the cooling fluid (through convection and radiative heat transfer). Nuclear fuel could be damaged by film boiling; this would cause the fuel cladding to overheat and fail.

MFLCPR is monitored with an empirical correlation that is formulated by vendors of BWR fuel (GE, Westinghouse, AREVA-NP). The vendors have test rigs where they simulate nuclear heat with resistive heating and determine experimentally what conditions of coolant flow, fuel assembly power, and reactor pressure will be in/out of the transition boiling region for a particular fuel design. In essence, the vendors make a model of the fuel assembly but power it with resistive heaters. These mock fuel assemblies are put into a test stand where data points are taken at specific powers, flows, pressures. 
Experimental data is conservatively applied to BWR fuel to ensure that the transition to film boiling does not occur during normal or transient operation. Typical SLMCPR/MCPRSL (Safety Limit MCPR) licensing limit for a BWR core is substantiated by a calculation that proves that 99.9% of fuel rods in a BWR core will not enter the transition to film boiling during normal operation or anticipated operational occurrences. Since the BWR is boiling water, and steam does not transfer heat as well as liquid water, MFLCPR typically occurs at the top of a fuel assembly, where steam volume is the highest.

==== Fraction limiting linear heat generation rate (FLLHGR) ====
FLLHGR (FDLRX, MFLPD) is a limit on fuel rod power in the reactor core. For new fuel, this limit is typically around 13 kW/ft (43 kW/m) of fuel rod. This limit ensures that the centerline temperature of the fuel pellets in the rods will not exceed the melting point of the fuel material (uranium/gadolinium oxides) in the event of the worst possible plant transient/scram anticipated to occur. To illustrate the response of LHGR in transient imagine the rapid closure of the valves that admit steam to the turbines at full power. This causes the immediate cessation of steam flow and an immediate rise in BWR pressure. This rise in pressure effectively subcools the reactor coolant instantaneously; the voids (vapor) collapse into solid water. When the voids collapse in the reactor, the fission reaction is encouraged (more thermal neutrons); power increases drastically (120%) until it is terminated by the automatic insertion of the control rods. So, when the reactor is isolated from the turbine rapidly, pressure in the vessel rises rapidly, which collapses the water vapor, which causes a power excursion which is terminated by the Reactor Protection System. If a fuel pin was operating at 13.0 kW/ft prior to the transient, the void collapse would cause its power to rise. The FLLHGR limit is in place to ensure that the highest powered fuel rod will not melt if its power was rapidly increased following a pressurization transient. Abiding by the LHGR limit precludes melting of fuel in a pressurization transient.

==== Average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR) ====
APLHGR, being an average of the Linear Heat Generation Rate (LHGR), a measure of the decay heat present in the fuel bundles, is a margin of safety associated with the potential for fuel failure to occur during a LBLOCA (large-break loss-of-coolant accident – a massive pipe rupture leading to catastrophic loss of coolant pressure within the reactor, considered the most threatening &quot;design basis accident&quot; in probabilistic risk assessment and nuclear safety and security), which is anticipated to lead to the temporary exposure of the core; this core drying-out event is termed core &quot;uncovery&quot;, for the core loses its heat-removing cover of coolant, in the case of a BWR, light water. If the core is uncovered for too long, fuel failure can occur; for the purpose of design, fuel failure is assumed to occur when the temperature of the uncovered fuel reaches a critical temperature (1100 °C, 2200 °F). BWR designs incorporate failsafe protection systems to rapidly cool and make safe the uncovered fuel prior to it reaching this temperature; these failsafe systems are known as the Emergency Core Cooling System. The ECCS is designed to rapidly flood the reactor pressure vessel, spray water on the core itself, and sufficiently cool the reactor fuel in this event. However, like any system, the ECCS has limits, in this case, to its cooling capacity, and there is a possibility that fuel could be designed that produces so much decay heat that the ECCS would be overwhelmed and could not cool it down successfully.

So as to prevent this from happening, it is required that the decay heat stored in the fuel assemblies at any one time does not overwhelm the ECCS. As such, the measure of decay heat generation known as LHGR was developed by GE&#x27;s engineers, and from this measure, APLHGR is derived. APLHGR is monitored to ensure that the reactor is not operated at an average power level that would defeat the primary containment systems. When a refueled core is licensed to operate, the fuel vendor/licensee simulate events with computer models. Their approach is to simulate worst case events when the reactor is in its most vulnerable state.

APLHGR is commonly pronounced as &quot;Apple Hugger&quot; in the industry.

==== Pre-Conditioning Interim Operating Management Recommendation (PCIOMR) ====
PCIOMR is a set of rules and limits to prevent cladding damage due to pellet-clad interaction. During the first nuclear heatup, nuclear fuel pellets can crack. The jagged edges of the pellet can rub and interact with the inner cladding wall. During power increases in the fuel pellet, the ceramic fuel material expands faster than the fuel cladding, and the jagged edges of the fuel pellet begin to press into the cladding, potentially causing a perforation. To prevent this from occurring, two corrective actions were taken. The first is the inclusion of a thin barrier layer against the inner walls of the fuel cladding which are resistant to perforation due to pellet-clad interactions, and the second is a set of rules created under PCIOMR.

The PCIOMR rules require initial &quot;conditioning&quot; of new fuel. This means, for the first nuclear heatup of each fuel element, that local bundle power must be ramped very slowly to prevent cracking of the fuel pellets and limit the differences in the rates of thermal expansion of the fuel. PCIOMR rules also limit the maximum local power change (in kW/ft*hr), prevent pulling control rods below the tips of adjacent control rods, and require control rod sequences to be analyzed against core modelling software to prevent pellet-clad interactions. PCIOMR analysis look at local power peaks and xenon transients which could be caused by control rod position changes or rapid power changes to ensure that local power rates never exceed maximum ratings.

<text>The advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) is a type of nuclear reactor designed and operated in the United Kingdom. These are the second generation of British gas-cooled reactors, using graphite as the neutron moderator and carbon dioxide as coolant. They have been the backbone of the UK&#x27;s nuclear power generation fleet since the 1980s.

The AGR was developed from the Magnox reactor, the UK&#x27;s first-generation reactor design. The first Magnox design had been optimised for generating plutonium, and for this reason it had features that were not the most economic for power generation. Primary among these was the requirement to run on natural uranium, which required a coolant with a low neutron cross section, in this case carbon dioxide, and an efficient neutron moderator, graphite. The Magnox design also ran relatively cool gas temperatures compared to other power-producing designs, which resulted in less efficient steam conditions.

The AGR design retained the Magnox&#x27;s graphite moderator and carbon dioxide coolant but increased the cooling gas operating temperature to improve steam conditions. These were made identical to those of a coal fired plant, allowing the same design of turbines and generation equipment to be used. During the initial design stages it was found necessary to switch the fuel cladding from beryllium to stainless steel. However, steel has a higher neutron cross section and this change required the use of enriched uranium fuel to compensate. This change resulted in a higher burnup of 18,000 MWt-days per tonne of fuel, enabling less frequent refuelling.

The prototype AGR became operational at Windscale in 1962, but the first commercial AGR did not come on-line until 1976. A total of fourteen AGR reactors at six sites were built between 1976 and 1988. All of these are configured with two reactors in a single building, and each reactor has a design thermal power output of 1,500 MWt driving a 660 MWe turbine-alternator set. The various AGR stations produce outputs in the range 555 MWe to 670 MWe though some run at lower than design output due to operational restrictions.

== AGR design ==

The AGR was designed such that the final steam conditions at the boiler stop valve were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of turbo-generator plant could be used. The mean temperature of the hot coolant leaving the reactor core was designed to be . In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite reacts with CO2 at high temperature) a re-entrant flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278 °C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary too much from those seen in a magnox station. The superheater outlet temperature and pressure were designed to be 2,485 psi (170 bar) and 543 °C.

The fuel is uranium dioxide pellets, enriched to 2.5-3.5%, in stainless steel tubes. The original design concept of the AGR was to use a beryllium based cladding. When this proved unsuitable due to brittle fracture, the enrichment level of the fuel was raised to allow for the higher neutron capture losses of stainless steel cladding. This significantly increased the cost of the power produced by an AGR. The carbon dioxide coolant circulates through the core, reaching and a pressure of around 40 bar (580 psi), and then passes through boiler (steam generator) assemblies outside the core but still within the steel-lined, reinforced concrete pressure vessel. Control rods penetrate the graphite moderator and a secondary system involves injecting nitrogen into the coolant to absorb thermal neutrons to stop the fission process if the control rods fail to enter the core. A tertiary shutdown system which operates by injecting boron beads into the reactor is included in case the reactor has to be depressurized with insufficient control rods lowered. This would mean that nitrogen pressure cannot be maintained.

The AGR was designed to have a high thermal efficiency (electricity generated/heat generated ratio) of about 41%, which is better than a modern pressurized water reactor (PWR) with a typical thermal efficiency of 34%. This is due to the higher coolant outlet temperature of about practical with gas cooling, compared to about for PWRs. However the reactor core has to be larger for the same power output, and the fuel burnup of 27,000 MW(th) days per tonne for type 2 fuel and up to 34,000 MW(th) days per tonne for robust fuel at discharge is lower than the 40,000 MW(th) days per ton of PWRs so the fuel is used less efficiently, countering the thermal efficiency advantage.

Like the magnox, CANDU, IPHWR, and RBMK reactors, and in contrast to light water reactors, AGRs are designed to be refuelled without being shut down first (see Online refuelling). This on-load refuelling was an important part of the economic case for choosing the AGR over other reactor types, and in 1965 allowed the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the government to claim that the AGR would produce electricity cheaper than the best coal-fired power stations. However, fuel assembly vibration problems arose during on-load refuelling at full power, so in 1988 full power refuelling was suspended until the mid-1990s, when further trials led to a fuel rod becoming stuck in a reactor core. Only refuelling at part load or when shut down is now undertaken at AGRs.

The pre-stressed concrete pressure vessel contains the reactor core and the boilers. To minimise the number of penetrations into the vessel (and thus reduce the number of possible breach sites) the boilers are of the once through design where all boiling and superheating is carried out within the boiler tubes. This necessitates the use of ultra pure water to minimise the buildup of salts in the evaporator and subsequent corrosion problems.

The AGR was intended to be a superior British alternative to American light water reactor designs. It was promoted as a development of the operationally (if not economically) successful Magnox design, and was chosen from a multitude of competing British alternatives - the helium cooled very-high-temperature reactor, the steam-generating heavy water reactor and the fast-breeder reactor - as well as the American light water pressurised and boiling water reactors (PWR and BWR) and Canadian CANDU designs. The CEGB conducted a detailed economic appraisal of the competing designs and concluded that the AGR proposed for Dungeness B would generate the cheapest electricity, cheaper than any of the rival designs and the best coal-fired stations.

== History ==

There were great hopes for the AGR design.
An ambitious construction programme of five twin reactor stations, Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B, Hunterston B, Hartlepool and Heysham was quickly rolled out, and export orders were eagerly anticipated.

For political reasons the CEGB was instructed to spread the &#x27;first generation&#x27; orders between three different &#x27;design &amp; build&#x27; consortia and a variety of major subcontractors. In consequence the first three CEGB stations, whilst sharing the same design concept and the same fuel pin design, were completely different in detail design. This also resulted in the three consortia having to compete for the same limited number of expert staff, the need for each design to have a unique (and very complex) safety case, and the need to support for the life of the programme three (later four) different AGR reactor designs.

The AGR stations proved to be complex and difficult to construct. Notoriously bad labour relations at the time added to the problems. The lead station, Dungeness B, was ordered in 1965 with a target completion date of 1970. After problems with nearly every aspect of the reactor design it finally began generating electricity in 1983, 13 years late.

The following reactor designs at Hinkley Point and Hunterston, ordered a year or two later, proved to be significantly better than the Dungeness design, and indeed were commissioned ahead of Dungeness. The next AGR design, built at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool, sought to reduce overall cost of design by reducing the footprint of the station and the number of ancillary systems. However this led to difficulties in construction.

The final two AGRs at Torness and Heysham 2 returned to a modified and &#x27;debugged&#x27; Hinkley design with much greater seismic margin, and have proved to be the most successful performers of the fleet. Former Treasury Economic Advisor, David Henderson, described the AGR programme as one of the two most costly British government-sponsored project errors, the other being Concorde.

When the government started on privatising the electricity generation industry in the 1980s, a cost analysis for potential investors revealed that true operating costs had been obscured for many years. Decommissioning costs especially had been significantly underestimated. These uncertainties caused nuclear power to be omitted from the privatisation at that time.

The small-scale prototype AGR at Sellafield (Windscale) has been decommissioned as of 2010 – the core and pressure vessel decommissioned leaving only the building &quot;Golf Ball&quot; visible. This project was also a study of what is required to decommission a nuclear reactor safely.

In October 2016 it was announced that super-articulated control rods would be installed at Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B because of concerns about the stability of the reactors&#x27; graphite cores. 
In early 2018 a slightly higher rate of new keyway root cracks than modelled was observed in Hunterston B Reactor 3 during a scheduled outage, and EDF announced in May 2018 that the outage would be extended for further investigation, analysis and modelling.

In 2018 inspections ordered by the ONR at Dungeness B showed that seismic restraints, pipework and storage vessels were &quot;corroded to an unacceptable condition&quot;, and that would have been the state when the reactor was operating. The ONR classified this as a level 2 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale.

==Existing AGR reactors==
As of August 2022, there are four nuclear generating stations each with two operating AGRs in the United Kingdom, all of which are owned and operated by EDF Energy:

In 2005 British Energy announced a 10-year life extension at Dungeness B, that would see the station continue operating until 2018, and in 2007 announced a 5-year life extension of Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B until 2016. Life extensions at other AGRs will be considered at least three years before their scheduled closure dates.

From 2006 Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B have been restricted to about 70% of normal MWe output because of boiler-related problems requiring that they operate at reduced boiler temperatures. In 2013 these two stations&#x27; power increased to about 80% of normal output following some plant modifications.

In 2006 AGRs made the news when documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; which claimed that British Energy were unaware of the extent of the cracking of graphite bricks in the cores of their reactors. It was also claimed that British Energy did not know why the cracking had occurred and that they were unable to monitor the cores without first shutting down the reactors. British Energy later issued a statement confirming that cracking of graphite bricks is a known symptom of extensive neutron bombardment and that they were working on a solution to the monitoring problem. Also, they stated that the reactors were examined every three years as part of &quot;statutory outages&quot;.
On 17 December 2010, EDF Energy announced a 5-year life extension for both Heysham 1 and Hartlepool to enable further generation until 2019.

In February 2012 EDF announced it expected 7-year life extensions on average across all AGRs, including the recently life-extended Heysham 1 and Hartlepool. These life extensions are subject to detailed review and approval, and are not included in the table above.

On 4 December 2012 EDF announced that Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B had been given 7-year life extensions, from 2016 to 2023.

On 5 November 2013 EDF announced that Hartlepool had been given a 5-year life extension, from 2019 to 2024.

In 2013 a defect was found by a regular inspection in one of the eight pod boilers of Heysham reactor A1. The reactor resumed operation at a lower output level with this pod boiler disabled, until June 2014 when more detailed inspections confirmed a crack in the boiler spine. As a precaution Heysham A2 and the sister Hartlepool station were also closed down for an eight weeks&#x27; inspection.

In October 2014 a new kind of crack in the graphite moderator bricks was found at the Hunterston B reactor. This keyway root crack has been previously theorised but not observed. The existence of this type of crack does not immediately affect the safety of a reactor – however if the number of cracks exceed a threshold the reactor would be decommissioned, as the cracks cannot be repaired.

In January 2015 Dungeness B was given a ten-year life extension, with an upgrade to control room computer systems and improved flood defences, taking the accounting closure date to 2028.

In February 2016, EDF extended the life of four of its eight nuclear power plants in the UK. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool had their life extended by five years until 2024, while Heysham 2 and Torness had their closure dates pushed back by seven years to 2030.

On 7 June 2021, EDF announced that Dungeness B, which had been in an extended outage since September 2018, would move into the defuelling phase with immediate effect.

On 15 December 2021 EDF announced that Heysham 2 and Torness are expected to close in March 2028.

On 7 January 2022 Hunterston B reactor 4 was shut down for the last time, ending production after nearly 47 years. Reactor 3 had moved to the defuelling phase in November 2021.

On 1 August 2022 Hinkley Point B Reactor 3 was shut down, Reactor 4 was shut down on 6 July 2022.

On 3 December 2024 EDF announced an extension to the life of the UK&#x27;s remaining 4 AGR nuclear power plants. Heysham 2 and Torness have been extended for an extra 2 years until 2030. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool have been given a 1 year extension until 2027.

In January 2025, EDF announced that their &quot;ambition is to generate beyond these dates, subject to plant inspections and regulatory oversight&quot;, although they expect &quot;that by the mid-2030s all seven of the AGR power stations will be owned by the UK Government&quot; (for decommissioning).

<doc id="143354" wikidata="Q1622414" url="?curid=143354" title="Pebble-bed reactor">
<text>The pebble-bed reactor (PBR) is a design for a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled nuclear reactor. It is a type of very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in the Generation IV initiative.
The basic design features spherical fuel elements called pebbles. These tennis ball-sized elements (approx. in diameter) are made of pyrolytic graphite (which acts as the moderator), and contain thousands of fuel particles called tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) particles. These TRISO particles consist of a fissile material (such as ) surrounded by a ceramic coating of silicon carbide for structural integrity and fission product containment. Thousands of pebbles are amassed to create a reactor core. The core is cooled by a gas that does not react chemically with the fuel elements, such as helium, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Other coolants such as FLiBe (molten ) have been suggested. The pebble bed design is passively safe.

Because the reactor is designed to handle high temperatures, it can cool by natural circulation and survive accident scenarios, which may raise the temperature of the reactor to 1,600 °C (2,910 °F). Such high temperatures allow higher thermal efficiencies than possible in traditional nuclear power plants (up to 50%). Additionally, the gases do not dissolve contaminants or absorb neutrons as water does, resulting in fewer radioactive fluids in the core.

The concept was first suggested by Farrington Daniels in the 1940s, inspired by the innovative design of the Benghazi burner by British desert troops in WWII. Commercial development came in the 1960s via the West German AVR reactor designed by Rudolf Schulten. This system was plagued with problems and the technology was abandoned. The AVR design was licensed to South Africa as the PBMR and China as the HTR-10. The HTR-10 prototype was developed into China&#x27;s HTR-PM demonstration plant, which connects two reactors to a single turbine producing 210 MWe, operating commercially since 2023. Other designs are under development by MIT, University of California at Berkeley, General Atomics (U.S.), Dutch company Romawa B.V., Adams Atomic Engines, Idaho National Laboratory, X-energy and Kairos Power.

==Design==

A pebble-bed power plant combines a gas-cooled core and a novel fuel packaging.

The uranium, thorium or plutonium nuclear fuels are in the form of a ceramic (usually oxides or carbides) contained within spherical pebbles a little smaller than the size of a tennis ball and made of pyrolytic graphite, which acts as the primary neutron moderator. The pebble design is relatively simple, with each sphere consisting of the nuclear fuel, fission product barrier, and moderator (which in a traditional water reactor would all be different parts). Grouping sufficient pebbles in the correct geometry creates criticality.

The pebbles are held in a vessel, and an inert gas (such as helium, nitrogen or carbon dioxide) circulates through the spaces between the fuel pebbles to carry heat away from the reactor. Pebble-bed reactors must keep the pebbles&#x27; graphite from burning in the presence of air if the reactor wall is breached (the flammability of the pebbles is disputed). The heated gas is run directly through a turbine. However, if the gas from the primary coolant can be made radioactive by the neutrons in the reactor, or a fuel defect could contaminate the power production equipment, it may be brought instead to a heat exchanger where it heats another gas or produces steam. The turbine exhaust is warm and may be used to heat buildings or in other applications.

Pebble-bed reactors are gas-cooled, sometimes at low pressures. The spaces between the pebbles replace the piping in conventional reactors. Since there is no actual piping in the core and the coolant contains no hydrogen, embrittlement is not a failure concern. The preferred gas, helium, does not easily absorb neutrons or impurities. Therefore, compared to water, it is both more efficient and less likely to become radioactive.

Much of the cost of a conventional, water-cooled nuclear power plant is due to cooling system complexity, which is not a factor in PBRs. Conventional plants require extensive safety systems and redundant backups. Their reactor cores are dwarfed by cooling systems. Further, the core irradiates the water with neutrons causing the water and impurities dissolved in it to become radioactive. The high-pressure piping in the primary side eventually becomes embrittled and requires inspection and replacement.

Some designs are throttled by temperature rather than control rods. Such reactors do not need to operate well at the varying neutron profiles caused by partially withdrawn control rods.

PBRs can use fuel pebbles made from various fuels in the same design (though perhaps not simultaneously). Proponents claim that pebble-bed reactors can use thorium, plutonium and natural unenriched uranium, as well as enriched uranium. 

In most stationary designs, fuel replacement is continuous. Pebbles are placed in a bin-shaped reactor. Pebbles travel from the bottom to the top about ten times over a period of years, and are tested after each pass. Expended pebbles are removed to the nuclear-waste area, replaced by a new pebble.

== Safety ==
When the reactor temperature rises, the atoms in the fuel move rapidly, causing Doppler broadening. The fuel then experiences a wider range of neutron speeds. Uranium-238, which forms the bulk of the uranium, is much more likely to absorb fast or epithermal neutrons at higher temperatures. This reduces the number of neutrons available to cause fission, and reduces power. Doppler broadening therefore creates a negative feedback: as fuel temperature increases, reactor power decreases. All reactors have reactivity feedback mechanisms. The pebble-bed reactor is designed so that this effect is relatively strong, inherent to the design, and does not depend on moving parts. This negative feedback creates passive control of the reaction process.

Thus PBRs passively reduce to a safe power-level in an accident scenario. This is the design&#x27;s main passive safety feature.

The reactor is cooled by an inert, fireproof gas, which has no phase transitions—it is always in the gaseous phase. The moderator is solid carbon; it does not act as a coolant, or move, or change phase.

Convection of the gas, driven by the heat of the pebbles, ensures that the pebbles are passively cooled.

Even in the event that all supporting machinery fails, the reactor will not crack, melt, explode or spew hazardous wastes. It heats to a designed &quot;idle&quot; temperature, and stays there. At idle, the reactor vessel radiates heat, but the vessel and fuel spheres remain intact and undamaged. The machinery can be repaired or the fuel can be removed. 

In a safety test using the German AVR reactor, all the control rods were removed, and coolant flow was halted. The fuel remained undamaged.

PBRs are intentionally operated above the annealing temperature of graphite, so that Wigner energy does not accumulate. This solves a problem discovered in the Windscale fire. One reactor (not a PBR) caught fire because of the release of energy stored as crystalline dislocations (Wigner energy) in the graphite. The dislocations are caused by neutron passage through the graphite. Windscale regularly annealed the graphite to release accumulated Wigner energy. However, the effect was not anticipated, and since the reactor was cooled by ambient air in an open cycle, the process could not be reliably controlled, and led to a fire.

Berkeley professor Richard A. Muller described PBRs as &quot;in every way ... safer than the present nuclear reactors&quot;.

===Containment===
Most PBR designs include multiple reinforcing levels of containment to prevent contact between the radioactive materials and the biosphere:
*Most reactors are enclosed in a containment building designed to resist aircraft crashes and earthquakes.
*The reactor is usually in a room with two-meter-thick walls with doors that can be closed, and cooling plenums that can be filled with water.
*The reactor vessel is typically sealed.
*Each pebble, within the vessel, is a hollow sphere of pyrolytic graphite, wrapped in fireproof silicon carbide.
*Low density porous pyrolytic carbon, high density nonporous pyrolytic carbon
*The fission fuel is in the form of metal oxides or carbides.
Pyrolytic graphite is the main structural material in pebbles. It sublimates at , more than double the design temperature of most reactors. It slows neutrons effectively, is strong, inexpensive, and has a long history of use in reactors and other high temperature applications. For example, pyrolytic graphite is also used, unreinforced, to construct missile reentry nose-cones and large solid rocket nozzles. Its strength and hardness come from its anisotropic crystals.

Pyrolytic carbon can burn in air when the reaction is catalyzed by a hydroxyl radical (e.g., from water). Infamous examples include the accidents and Chernobyl—both graphite-moderated reactors. However, PBRs are cooled by inert gases to prevent fire. All designs have at least one layer of silicon carbide that serves as a fire break and seal.

===Fuel production ===
All kernels are precipitated from a sol-gel, then washed, dried and calcined. U.S. kernels use uranium carbide, while German (AVR) kernels use uranium dioxide. German-produced fuel-pebbles release about 1000 times less radioactive gas than the U.S. equivalents, due to that construction method.
== Design criticisms ==

===Graphite combustion===
The primary criticism of pebble-bed reactors is that encasing the fuel in graphite poses a hazard. Graphite can burn in the presence of air, which could happen if the reactor vessel is compromised. Fire could vaporize the fuel, which could then be released to the surroundings. Fuel kernels are coated with a layer of silicon carbide to isolate the graphite. While silicon carbide is strong in abrasion and compression applications, it has less resistance to expansion and shear forces. Some fission products such as have limited absorbance in carbon, so some fuel kernels could accumulate enough gas to rupture the silicon carbide.

===Containment building===
Some designs do not include a containment building, leaving reactors more vulnerable to attack. However, most are surrounded by a reinforced concrete containment structure. 

===Waste handling===
PBR waste volumes are much greater, but have similar radioactivity measured in becquerels per kilowatt-hour. The waste tends to be less hazardous and simpler to handle. Current US legislation requires all waste to be safely contained, requiring waste storage facilities. Pebble defects may complicate storage. Graphite pebbles are more difficult to reprocess due to their construction. 

===2008 report===
In 2008, a report about safety aspects of Germany&#x27;s AVR reactor and general PBR features drew attention. The claims are contested. The report cited:
* Impossible to place standard measurement equipment in the reactor core
* The cooling circuit can be contaminated with metallic fission products (, ) due to limited pebble retention capabilities for metallic fission products. The report claimed that even modern fuel elements do not sufficiently retain strontium and caesium.
* Elevated core temperatures (&gt; above calculated values)
* Dust formation from pebble friction under pebble breach (Dust acts as a mobile fission product carrier, if fission products escape the fuel particles.)

Report author Rainer Moormann, recommended that average hot helium temperatures be limited to minus the uncertainty of the core temperatures (about ).

==History==
Farrington Daniels originated the concept and the name in 1947 at Oak Ridge. Rudolf Schulten advanced the idea in the 1950s. The crucial insight was to combine fuel, structure, containment, and neutron moderator in a small, strong sphere. The concept depended on the availability of engineered forms of silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon that were strong.

===AVR===

A 15 MWe demonstration reactor, Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (&quot;experimental reactor consortium&quot;), was built at the Jülich Research Centre in Jülich, West Germany. The goal was to gain operational experience with a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor. Construction costs of AVR were 115 million Deutschmark (1966), corresponding to a 2010 value of 180 million €. The unit&#x27;s first criticality was on August 26, 1966. The facility ran successfully for 21 years. 

In 1978, the AVR suffered from a water/steam ingress accident of , which led to contamination of soil and groundwater by strontium-90 and by tritium. The leak in the steam generator leading to this accident was probably caused by high core temperatures (see criticism section). A re-examination of this accident was announced by the local government in July 2010.

The AVR was originally designed to breed uranium-233 from thorium-232. A practical thorium breeder reactor was considered valuable technology. However, the AVR&#x27;s fuel design contained the fuel so well that the transmuted fuels were uneconomic to extract—it was cheaper to use mined and purified uranium.

The AVR used helium coolant, has a low neutron cross-section. Since few neutrons are absorbed, the coolant remains less radioactive. It is practical to route the primary coolant directly to power generation turbines. Even though the power generation used primary coolant, it was reported that the AVR exposed its personnel to less than 1/5 as much radiation as a typical light water reactor.

==== Decommissioning ====
It was decommissioned on December 1, 1988, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster and operational problems. During removal of the fuel elements it became apparent that the neutron reflector under the pebble-bed core had cracked during operation. Some hundred fuel elements remained stuck in the crack. During this examination it was revealed that the AVR was the world&#x27;s most heavily beta-contaminated (strontium-90) nuclear installation and that this contamination was present as dust (the worst form).

Localized fuel temperature instabilities resulted in heavy vessel contamination by Cs-137 and Sr-90. The reactor vessel was filled with light concrete in order to fix the radioactive dust and in 2012 the reactor vessel of was to be moved to intermediate storage until a permanent solution is devised. The reactor buildings were to be dismantled and soil and groundwater decontaminated. AVR dismantling costs were expected to far exceed its construction costs. In August 2010, the German government estimated costs for AVR dismantling without consideration of the vessel dismantling at 600 million € ( $750 million, which corresponded to 0.4 € ($0.55) per kWh of electricity generated by the AVR. A separate containment was erected for dismantling purposes, as seen in the AVR-picture.

==== Thorium high-temperature reactor ====
Following the experience with the AVR, Germany constructed a full scale power station (the thorium high-temperature reactor or THTR-300 rated at 300 MW), using thorium as the fuel. THTR-300 suffered technical difficulties, and owing to these and political events in Germany, was closed after four years of operation. An incident on 4 May 1986, only a few days after the Chernobyl disaster, allowed a release of part of the radioactive inventory into the environment. Although the radiological impact was small, it had a disproportionate impact. The release was caused by a human error during a blockage of pebbles in a pipe. Trying to restart the pebbles&#x27; movement by increasing gas flow stirred up dust, always present in PBRs, which was then released, unfiltered, into the environment due to an erroneously open valve.

In spite of the limited amount of radioactivity released (0.1 GBq , , ), a commission of inquiry was appointed. The radioactivity in the vicinity of the THTR-300 was finally found to result 25% from Chernobyl and 75% from THTR-300. The handling of this minor accident severely damaged the credibility of the German pebble-bed community, which lost support in Germany.

The overly complex design of the reactor, which is contrary to the general concept of self-moderated thorium reactors designed in the U.S., also suffered from the unplanned high destruction rate of pebbles during the test series and the resulting higher contamination of the containment structure. Pebble debris and graphite dust blocked some of the coolant channels in the bottom reflector, as was discovered during fuel removal after final shut-down. A failure of insulation required frequent reactor shut-downs for inspection, because the insulation could not be repaired. Metallic components in the hot gas duct failed in September 1988, probably due to thermal fatigue induced by unexpected hot gas currents. This failure led to a long shut-down for inspections. In August, 1989, the THTR company almost went bankrupt, but was rescued by the government. The unexpected high costs of THTR operation and the accident ended interest in THTR reactors. The government decided to terminate the THTR operation at the end of September, 1989. This particular reactor was built despite criticism at the design phase. Most of those design critiques by German physicists, and by American physicists at the National Laboratory level, went ignored until shutdown. Nearly every problem encountered by the THTR 300 reactor was predicted by the physicists who criticized it as &quot;overly complex&quot;.

=== China ===
In 2004 China licensed the AVR technology and developed a reactor for power generation. The 10 megawatt prototype is called the HTR-10. It is a conventional helium-cooled, helium-turbine design. In 2021 the Chinese then built a 211 MWe gross unit HTR-PM, which incorporates two 250 MWt reactors. , four sites were being considered for a 6-reactor successor, the HTR-PM600. The reactor entered service in December 2023.

== Other designs ==

=== South Africa ===

In June 2004, it was announced that a new PBMR would be built at Koeberg, South Africa by Eskom, the government-owned electrical utility to operate at . The PBMR project was opposed by groups such as Koeberg Alert and Earthlife Africa, the latter of which sued Eskom. The reactor was never completed and the testing facility was decommissioned and placed in a &quot;care and maintenance mode&quot; to protect the IP and the assets.

A Pretoria-based company, Stratek Global, created a variant of the PBMR reactor. The Stratek HTMR-100 reactor functions at . It directs the heat into water to create steam and is helium-cooled. The HTMR-100 reactor produces output of 35 MWe.

===Adams Atomic Engines===
Adams Atomic Engines (AAE) design was self-contained so it could be adapted to extreme environments such as space, polar and underwater environments. Their design was for a nitrogen coolant passing directly though a conventional low-pressure gas turbine, and due to the rapid ability of the turbine to change speeds, it can be used in applications where instead of the turbine&#x27;s output being converted to electricity, the turbine itself could directly drive a mechanical device, for instance, a propeller aboard a ship. 

Like all high temperature designs, the AAE engine would have been inherently safe, as the engine naturally shuts down due to Doppler broadening, stopping heat generation if the fuel in the engine gets too hot in the event of a loss of coolant or a loss of coolant flow.

The company went out of business in December 2010.

<text>Elm Park is a suburban planned community in East London and part of the London Borough of Havering. Located east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is identified as a district centre in the London Plan with several streets of shops and a priority for regeneration. Prior to the construction of the extensive Elm Park Garden City development in the 1930s it was a scattered settlement of farms in the south of the parish of Hornchurch. Elm Park has been connected to central London by the electrified District line service since 1935 and the planned development of the area formed part of the interwar private housing boom that was interrupted by World War II. After the war Elm Park expanded with social housing and it has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The place name Elm Park was devised in 1933. It was derived from Elm Farm, which is first recorded in 1777 and was known as Elms in 1883.

===Local government===
The area that became Elm Park formed part of the South End ward of the parish of Hornchurch; the large ancient parish occupied the same area as the royal manor and liberty of Havering. The Havering courts and Hornchurch vestry were the principal local government in the area. The liberty was abolished in 1892 and the parish vestry in 1894. Elected local government was incorporated by the Local Government Act 1894. Hornchurch civil parish was governed by Hornchurch Parish Council and formed part of the Romford Rural District, governed by Romford Rural District Council.

As the population was increasing, in 1926 the Hornchurch parish was removed from the rural district to become Hornchurch Urban District and the parish council became Hornchurch Urban District Council. The council, based in Langtons House from 1929, was the planning authority during the transition of Elm Park from farms to suburban development. The Hornchurch Urban District was abolished in 1965 and Elm Park became part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London.

===Urban development===
Elm Park Garden City was a planned community by the developer Richard Costain and Sons Ltd., drawing on the ideas of the garden city movement. Costain purchased the land of Wyebridge, Elm and Uphavering farms for the development in 1933. Plans were announced for 7,000 houses on of land for private sale in May 1933, and were submitted to Hornchurch Urban District Council in June. Costain negotiated a higher density of development than was usually permitted. In return the council achieved some improvements, including provision of wider roads, a bridge over the railway line, and the donation of land for Harrow Lodge Park. Costain built an estate office at the corner of Coronation Drive and Maylands Avenue that later became occupied by a real estate solicitor.

Costain negotiated with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to have a station built on the London to Southend railway that ran through the area and Elm Park Underground station, served by the District line of the London Underground, opened in 1935. The station and the Elm Park Garden City were officially opened by Hilton Young, Minister of Health in May 1935. Celebrations to mark the opening included a performance by the Dagenham Girl Pipers. The Assembly Hall, intended to be used as a recreation space and theatre, was given to the Elm Park Residents&#x27; Association, which was established in July 1935. The estate was marketed as &quot;Elm Park Romford&quot;, with Romford approximately to the north. A frequent bus service was provided from 1939.

House building on the estate was halted by World War II. Because of the proximity of RAF Hornchurch the area was subject aerial bombing with some damage to the housing stock. After the war national housing policy had changed and Hornchurch Urban District Council deviated from the Costain plans to provide higher density social housing through compulsory purchase of the land, using loans from the Public Works Loan Board. By 1964 the council had created 1,146 council houses in Elm Park.

==Governance==
Since the 2022 election, Elm Park is contained within the Elm Park ward of the London Borough of Havering. The ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. The majority of Elm Park is within Dagenham and Rainham UK Parliament constituency, but the area to the east of The Broadway and north of the railway is part of the Hornchurch and Upminster constituency. All of Elm Park is within the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

==Geography==
Open spaces in the area include Harrow Lodge Park, Hornchurch Country Park, Swallow Walk, Brettons Park and Eastbrookend Country Park of the Thames Chase forest. Nearest places are Dagenham, Rainham, and Romford.

==Demography==

The 2001 census shows the Elm Park ward has a population density higher than the borough of Havering, lower than all of London, but much higher than England as a whole. The population is predominately White, 92% within the White British classification, which is typical for the borough, and both higher than London and England. The mean and median average age of the population is 40, which is typical for the borough, about five years above London as a whole and slightly above the average for England.

==Economy==
Elm Park is identified as a district centre in the London Plan and a priority for regeneration. Within Havering it is near to the major centre at Hornchurch and metropolitan centre at Romford. The compact retail area extends along the whole of The Broadway, which is flanked by the Station Parade and Tadworth Parade precincts, and continues along parts of Elm Park Avenue and Saint Nicholas Avenue. There are 196 units in the town centre. As of November 2012, 13.91% are convenience goods, 30.43% comparison goods, 42.61% services, and 13.04% vacant. These include a variety of independent and high street brand shops, including banks, clothes shops, pharmacies, bakers, greengrocers, fishmongers, florists, opticians, bicycle shops, butchers, hairdressers, grocery stores, off licence, dry cleaners, travel agents, and a post office. The unit sizes are fairly small, with a Tesco Express and The Co-operative Food forming some of the larger stores. In 2013 an M local branded Morrisons convenience store opened and a Sainsbury&#x27;s replaced the former Elm Park Hotel. There is a library which has recently been rebuilt. There is a number of takeaways, cafes and restaurants.

==Transport==
Elm Park is served by Elm Park Underground station and has London Bus services to nearby Romford, Rainham and Hornchurch town centre. Regeneration linked to the Thames Gateway project has been mooted and recent changes such as the installation of new street lighting have been made. The East London Transit includes an option to serve the area.

Elm Park was the site of a derailment of a British Rail commuter service on 29 March 1965 resulting in two deaths and 15 people being injured: an act of vandalism by unknown persons (placing an obstruction on the line) derailed a London Fenchurch St. to Shoeburyness passenger train travelling at 70 m.p.h.

==Culture and community==
Regeneration in the area is led by Havering London Borough Council and the Elm Park Regeneration Partnership. Elm Park is served by several churches - the Elm Park Baptist Church, St Albans Catholic Church, and St. Nicholas Church of England. It is also home to Arise Metropolitan Assembly which meets at the annex of the Elm Park Community Assembly Hall on Eyhurst/St.Nicholas Avenue, Christ Life Church and Eagles Christian Connections. It is also in Elm Park that the London Metropolitan Assembly convened by Apostle George Akalonu meets each month to discuss issues of common interest to faith, civic and community leaders.

<text>Uecker-Randow was a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the eastern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from south clockwise) Uckermark in Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Ostvorpommern. To the east was the West Pomeranian Voivodship of Poland.

==History==
Uecker-Randow District was established on 12 June 1994 by merging the previous districts of Pasewalk and Ueckermünde, along with part of the district of Strasburg. On 4 September 2011, it was merged into Vorpommern-Greifswald.

<text>Medical ultrasound includes diagnostic techniques (mainly imaging techniques) using ultrasound, as well as therapeutic applications of ultrasound. In diagnosis, it is used to create an image of internal body structures such as tendons, muscles, joints, blood vessels, and internal organs, to measure some characteristics (e.g., distances and velocities) or to generate an informative audible sound. The usage of ultrasound to produce visual images for medicine is called medical ultrasonography or simply sonography, or echography. The practice of examining pregnant women using ultrasound is called obstetric ultrasonography, and was an early development of clinical ultrasonography. The machine used is called an ultrasound machine, a sonograph or an echograph. The visual image formed using this technique is called an ultrasonogram, a sonogram or an echogram.
Ultrasound is composed of sound waves with frequencies greater than 20,000 Hz, which is the approximate upper threshold of human hearing. Ultrasonic images, also known as sonograms, are created by sending pulses of ultrasound into tissue using a probe. The ultrasound pulses echo off tissues with different reflection properties and are returned to the probe which records and displays them as an image.

A general-purpose ultrasonic transducer may be used for most imaging purposes but some situations may require the use of a specialized transducer. Most ultrasound examination is done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved visualization is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body. For this purpose, special-use transducers, including transvaginal, endorectal, and transesophageal transducers are commonly employed. At the extreme, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed within blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels.

==Types==
The imaging mode refers to probe and machine settings that result in specific dimensions of the ultrasound image.
Several modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging:
* A-mode: Amplitude mode refers to the mode in which the amplitude of the transducer voltage is recorded as a function of two-way travel time of an ultrasound pulse. A single pulse is transmitted through the body and scatters back to the same transducer element. The voltage amplitudes recorded correlate linearly to acoustic pressure amplitudes. A-mode is one-dimensional.
* B-mode: In brightness mode, an array of transducer elements scans a plane through the body resulting in a two-dimensional image. Each pixel value of the image correlates to voltage amplitude registered from the backscattered signal. The dimensions of B-mode images are voltage as a function of angle and two-way time.
* M-mode: In motion mode, A-mode pulses are emitted in succession. The backscattered signal is converted to lines of bright pixels, whose brightness linearly correlates to backscattered voltage amplitudes. Each next line is plotted adjacent to the previous, resulting in an image that looks like a B-mode image. The M-mode image dimensions are however voltage as a function of two-way time and recording time. This mode is an ultrasound analogy to streak video recording in high-speed photography. As moving tissue transitions produce backscattering, this can be used to determine the displacement of specific organ structures, most commonly the heart.

Most machines convert two-way time to imaging depth using as assumed speed of sound of 1540 m/s. As the actual speed of sound varies greatly in different tissue types, an ultrasound image is therefore not a true tomographic representation of the body.

Three-dimensional imaging is done by combining B-mode images, using dedicated rotating or stationary probes. This has also been referred to as C-mode.

An imaging technique refers to a method of signal generation and processing that results in a specific application.
Most imaging techniques are operating in B-mode.
* Doppler sonography: This imaging technique makes use of the Doppler effect in detection and measuring moving targets, typically blood.
* Harmonic imaging: backscattered signal from tissue is filtered to comprise only frequency content of at least twice the centre frequency of the transmitted ultrasound. Harmonic imaging used for perfusion detection when using ultrasound contrast agents and for the detection of tissue harmonics. Common pulse schemes for the creation of harmonic response without the need of real-time Fourier analysis are pulse inversion and power modulation.
*B-flow is an imaging technique that digitally highlights moving reflectors (mainly red blood cells) while suppressing the signals from the surrounding stationary tissue. It aims to visualize flowing blood and surrounding stationary tissues simultaneously. It is thus an alternative or complement to Doppler ultrasonography in visualizing blood flow.

Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is not an imaging mode. However, for positioning a treatment probe to focus on a specific region of interest, A-mode and B-mode are typically used, often during treatment.

==Advantages and drawbacks==
Compared to other medical imaging modalities, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, is portable, and can consequently be brought to the bedside. It is substantially lower in cost than other imaging strategies. Drawbacks include various limits on its field of view, the need for patient cooperation, dependence on patient physique, difficulty imaging structures obscured by bone, air or gases, and the necessity of a skilled operator, usually with professional training.

==Uses==
Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in medicine. It is possible to perform both diagnosis and therapeutic procedures, using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures such as biopsies or to drain collections of fluid, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Sonographers are medical professionals who perform scans which are traditionally interpreted by radiologists, physicians who specialize in the application and interpretation of medical imaging modalities, or by cardiologists in the case of cardiac ultrasonography (echocardiography). Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as muscle, tendon, testis, breast, thyroid and parathyroid glands, and the neonatal brain are imaged at higher frequencies (7–18 MHz), which provide better linear (axial) and horizontal (lateral) resolution. Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at lower frequencies (1–6 MHz) with lower axial and lateral resolution as a price of deeper tissue penetration.

=== Anesthesiology ===
In anesthesiology, ultrasound is commonly used to guide the placement of needles when injecting local anesthetic solutions in the proximity of nerves identified within the ultrasound image (nerve block). It is also used for vascular access such as cannulation of large central veins and for difficult arterial cannulation. Transcranial Doppler is frequently used by neuro-anesthesiologists for obtaining information about flow-velocity in the basal cerebral vessels.

=== Angiology (vascular) ===
In angiology or vascular medicine, duplex ultrasound (B Mode imaging combined with Doppler flow measurement) is used to diagnose arterial and venous disease. This is particularly important in potential neurologic problems, where carotid ultrasound is commonly used for assessing blood flow and potential or suspected stenosis in the carotid arteries, while transcranial Doppler is used for imaging flow in the intracerebral arteries.

Intravascular ultrasound (&quot;IVUS&quot;) uses a specially designed catheter with a miniaturized ultrasound probe attached to its distal end, which is then threaded inside a blood vessel. The proximal end of the catheter is attached to computerized ultrasound equipment and allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as a piezoelectric transducer or capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer, to visualize the endothelium of blood vessels in living individuals.

In the case of the common and potentially, serious problem of blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, ultrasound plays a key diagnostic role, while ultrasonography of chronic venous insufficiency of the legs focuses on more superficial veins to assist with planning of suitable interventions to relieve symptoms or improve cosmetics.

=== Cardiology (heart) ===

Echocardiography is an essential tool in cardiology, assisting in evaluation of heart valve function, such as stenosis or insufficiency, strength of cardiac muscle contraction, and hypertrophy or dilatation of the main chambers. (ventricle and atrium)

=== Emergency medicine ===

Point of care ultrasound has many applications in emergency medicine. These include differentiating cardiac from pulmonary causes of acute breathlessness, and the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam, extended to include assessment for significant hemoperitoneum or pericardial tamponade after trauma (EFAST). Other uses include assisting with differentiating causes of abdominal pain such as gallstones and kidney stones. Emergency Medicine Residency Programs have a substantial history of promoting the use of bedside ultrasound during physician training.

=== Gastroenterology/Colorectal surgery ===
Both abdominal and endoanal ultrasound are frequently used in gastroenterology and colorectal surgery. In abdominal sonography, the major organs of the abdomen such as the pancreas, aorta, inferior vena cava, liver, gall bladder, bile ducts, kidneys, and spleen may be imaged. However, sound waves may be blocked by gas in the bowel and attenuated to differing degrees by fat, sometimes limiting diagnostic capabilities. The appendix can sometimes be seen when inflamed (e.g.: appendicitis) and ultrasound is the initial imaging choice, avoiding radiation if possible, although it frequently needs to be followed by other imaging methods such as CT. Endoanal ultrasound is used particularly in the investigation of anorectal symptoms such as fecal incontinence or obstructed defecation. It images the immediate perianal anatomy and is able to detect occult defects such as tearing of the anal sphincter.

=== Hepatology ===

Ultrasonography of liver tumors allows for both detection and characterization.
Ultrasound imaging studies are often obtained during the evaluation process of Fatty liver disease. Ultrasonography reveals a &quot;bright&quot; liver with increased echogenicity. Pocket-sized ultrasound devices might be used as point-of-care screening tools to diagnose liver steatosis.

=== Gynecology and obstetrics ===

Gynecologic ultrasonography examines female pelvic organs (specifically the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes) as well as the bladder, adnexa, and pouch of Douglas. It uses transducers designed for approaches through the lower abdominal wall, curvilinear and sector, and specialty transducers such as transvaginal ultrasound.

Obstetrical sonography was originally developed in the late 1950s and 1960s by Sir Ian Donald and is commonly used during pregnancy to check the development and presentation of the fetus. It can be used to identify many conditions that could be potentially harmful to the mother and/or baby possibly remaining undiagnosed or with delayed diagnosis in the absence of sonography. It is currently believed that the risk of delayed diagnosis is greater than the small risk, if any, associated with undergoing an ultrasound scan. However, its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal &quot;keepsake&quot; videos and photos is discouraged.

Obstetric ultrasound is primarily used to:
* Date the pregnancy (gestational age)
* Confirm fetal viability
* Determine location of fetus, intrauterine vs ectopic
* Check the location of the placenta in relation to the cervix
* Check for the number of fetuses (multiple pregnancy)
* Check for major physical abnormalities.
* Assess fetal growth (for evidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR))
* Check for fetal movement and heartbeat.
* Determine the sex of the baby

According to the European Committee of Medical Ultrasound Safety (ECMUS)
Nonetheless, care should be taken to use low power settings and avoid pulsed wave scanning of the fetal brain unless specifically indicated in high risk pregnancies.

Figures released for the period 2005–2006 by the UK Government (Department of Health) show that non-obstetric ultrasound examinations constituted more than 65% of the total number of ultrasound scans conducted.

=== Hemodynamics (blood circulation) ===
Blood velocity can be measured in various blood vessels, such as middle cerebral artery or descending aorta, by relatively inexpensive and low risk ultrasound Doppler probes attached to portable monitors. These provide non-invasive or transcutaneous (non-piercing) minimal invasive blood flow assessment. Common examples are transcranial Doppler, esophageal Doppler and suprasternal Doppler.

=== Otolaryngology (head and neck) ===
Most structures of the neck, including the thyroid and parathyroid glands, lymph nodes, and salivary glands, are well-visualized by high-frequency ultrasound with exceptional anatomic detail. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid tumors and lesions, and its use is important in the evaluation, preoperative planning, and postoperative surveillance of patients with thyroid cancer. Many other benign and malignant conditions in the head and neck can be differentiated, evaluated, and managed with the help of diagnostic ultrasound and ultrasound-guided procedures.

=== Neonatology ===
In neonatology, transcranial Doppler can be used for basic assessment of intracerebral structural abnormalities, suspected hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly or hydrocephalus and anoxic insults (periventricular leukomalacia). It can be performed through the soft spots in the skull of a newborn infant (Fontanelle) until these completely close at about 1 year of age by which time they have formed a virtually impenetrable acoustic barrier to ultrasound. The most common site for cranial ultrasound is the anterior fontanelle. The smaller the fontanelle, the more the image is compromised.

Lung ultrasound has been found to be useful in diagnosing common neonatal respiratory diseases such as transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, congenital pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and pneumothorax. A neonatal lung ultrasound score, first described by Brat et al., has been found to highly correlate with oxygenation in the newborn.

=== Ophthalmology () ===
In ophthalmology and optometry, there are two major forms of eye exam using ultrasound:
* A-scan ultrasound biometry, is commonly referred to as an &quot;A-scan&quot; (&quot;amplitude scan&quot;). A-mode provides data on the length of the eye, which is a major determinant in common sight disorders, especially for determining the power of an intraocular lens after cataract extraction.
* &quot;B-scan ultrasonography&quot;, or &quot;B-scan-Brightness scan&quot;, is a B-mode scan that produces a cross-sectional view of the eye and the orbit. It is an essential tool in ophthalmology for diagnosing and managing a wide array of conditions affecting the posterior segment of the eye.It is non invasive and uses frequency 10-15 MHz.It is often used in conjunction with other imaging techniques (like OCT or fluorescein angiography) for a more comprehensive evaluation of ocular conditions.

=== Pulmonology (lungs) ===
Ultrasound is used to assess the lungs in a variety of settings including critical care, emergency medicine, trauma surgery, as well as general medicine. This imaging modality is used at the bedside or examination table to evaluate a number of different lung abnormalities as well as to guide procedures such as thoracentesis, (drainage of pleural fluid (effusion)), needle aspiration biopsy, and catheter placement. Although air present in the lungs does not allow good penetration of ultrasound waves, interpretation of specific artifacts created on the lung surface can be used to detect abnormalities.

==== Lung ultrasound basics ====
* The Normal Lung Surface: The lung surface is composed of visceral and parietal pleura. These two surfaces are typically pushed together and make up the pleural line, which is the basis of lung (or pleural) ultrasound. This line is visible less than a centimeter below the rib line in most adults. On ultrasound, it is visualized as a hyperechoic (bright white) horizontal line if the ultrasound probe is applied perpendicularly to the skin.
* Artifacts: Lung ultrasound relies on artifacts, which would otherwise be considered a hindrance in imaging. Air blocks the ultrasound beam and thus visualizing healthy lung tissue itself with this mode of imaging is not practical. Consequently, physicians and sonographers have learned to recognize patterns that ultrasound beams create when imaging healthy versus diseased lung tissue. Three commonly seen and utilized artifacts in lung ultrasound include lung sliding, A-lines, and B-lines.
** §  Lung Sliding: The presence of lung sliding, which indicates the shimmering of the pleural line that occurs with movement of the visceral and parietal pleura against one another with respiration (sometimes described as &#x27;ants marching&#x27;), is the most important finding in normal aerated lung. Lung sliding indicates both that the lung is present at the chest wall and that the lung is functioning.
** §  A-lines: When the ultrasound beam makes contact with the pleural line, it is reflected back creating a bright white horizontal line. The subsequent reverberation artifacts that appear as equally spaced horizontal lines deep to the pleura are A-lines. Ultimately, A-lines are a reflection of the ultrasound beam from the pleura with the space between A-lines corresponding to the distance between the parietal pleura and the skin surface. A-lines indicate the presence of air, which means that these artifacts can be present in normal healthy lung (and also in patients with pneumothorax).
** §  B-lines: B-lines are also reverberation artifacts. They are visualized as hyperechoic vertical lines extending from the pleura to the edge of the ultrasound screen. These lines are sharply defined and laser-like and typically do not fade as they progress down the screen. A few B-lines that move along with the sliding pleura can be seen in normal lung due to acoustic impedance differences between water and air. However, excessive B-lines (three or more) are abnormal and are typically indicative of underlying lung pathology.

==== Lung pathology assessed with ultrasound ====
* Pulmonary edema: Lung ultrasound has been shown to be very sensitive for the detection of pulmonary edema. It allows for improvement in diagnosis and management of critically ill patients, particularly when used in combination with echocardiography. The sonographic feature that is present in pulmonary edema is multiple B-lines. B-lines can occur in a healthy lung; however, the presence of 3 or more in the anterior or lateral lung regions is always abnormal. In pulmonary edema, B-lines indicate an increase in the amount of water contained in the lungs outside of the pulmonary vasculature. B-lines can also be present in a number of other conditions including pneumonia, pulmonary contusion, and lung infarction. Additionally, it is important to note that there are multiple types of interactions between the pleural surface and the ultrasound wave that can generate artifacts with some similarity to B-lines but which do not have pathologic significance.
* Pneumothorax: In clinical settings when pneumothorax is suspected, lung ultrasound can aid in diagnosis. In pneumothorax, air is present between the two layers of the pleura and lung sliding on ultrasound is therefore absent. The negative predictive value for lung sliding on ultrasound is reported as 99.2–100% – briefly, if lung sliding is present, a pneumothorax is effectively ruled out. The absence of lung sliding, however, is not necessarily specific for pneumothorax as there are other conditions that also cause this finding including acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidations, pleural adhesions, and pulmonary fibrosis.
* Pleural effusion: Lung ultrasound is a cost-effective, safe, and non-invasive imaging method that can aid in the prompt visualization and diagnosis of pleural effusions. Effusions can be diagnosed by a combination of physical exam, percussion, and auscultation of the chest. However, these exam techniques can be complicated by a variety of factors including the presence of mechanical ventilation, obesity, or patient positioning, all of which reduce the sensitivity of the physical exam. Consequently, lung ultrasound can be an additional tool to augment plain chest Xray and chest CT. Pleural effusions on ultrasound appear as structural images within the thorax rather than an artifact. They will typically have four distinct borders including the pleural line, two rib shadows, and a deep border. In critically ill patients with pleural effusion, ultrasound may guide procedures including needle insertion, thoracentesis, and chest-tube insertion.
* Lung cancer staging: In pulmonology, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probes are applied to standard flexible endoscopic probes and used by pulmonologists to allow for direct visualization of endobronchial lesions and lymph nodes prior to transbronchial needle aspiration. Among its many uses, EBUS aids in lung cancer staging by allowing for lymph node sampling without the need for major surgery.
* COVID-19: Lung ultrasound has proved useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in cases where other investigations are not available.

=== Urinary tract ===

Ultrasound is routinely used in urology to determine the amount of fluid retained in a patient&#x27;s bladder. In a pelvic sonogram, images include the uterus and ovaries or urinary bladder in females. In males, a sonogram will provide information about the bladder, prostate, or testicles (for example to urgently distinguish epididymitis from testicular torsion). In young males, it is used to distinguish more benign testicular masses (varicocele or hydrocele) from testicular cancer, which is curable but must be treated to preserve health and fertility. There are two methods of performing pelvic sonography – externally or internally. The internal pelvic sonogram is performed either transvaginally (in a woman) or transrectally (in a man). Sonographic imaging of the pelvic floor can produce important diagnostic information regarding the precise relationship of abnormal structures with other pelvic organs and it represents a useful hint to treat patients with symptoms related to pelvic prolapse, double incontinence and obstructed defecation. It is also used to diagnose and, at higher frequencies, to treat (break up) kidney stones or kidney crystals (nephrolithiasis).

=== Penis and scrotum ===

Scrotal ultrasonography is used in the evaluation of testicular pain, and can help identify solid masses.

Ultrasound is an excellent method for the study of the penis, such as indicated in trauma, priapism, erectile dysfunction or suspected Peyronie&#x27;s disease.

=== Musculoskeletal ===
Musculoskeletal ultrasound is used to examine tendons, muscles, nerves, ligaments, soft tissue masses, and bone surfaces.
It is helpful in diagnosing ligament sprains, muscles strains and joint pathology. It is an alternative or supplement to x-ray imaging in detecting fractures of the wrist, elbow and shoulder for patients up to 12 years (Fracture sonography).

Quantitative ultrasound is an adjunct musculoskeletal test for myopathic disease in children; estimates of lean body mass in adults; proxy measures of muscle quality (i.e., tissue composition) in older adults with sarcopenia

Ultrasound can also be used for needle guidance in muscle or joint injections, as in ultrasound-guided hip joint injection.

=== Kidneys ===

In nephrology, ultrasonography of the kidneys is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. The kidneys are easily examined, and most pathological changes are distinguishable with ultrasound. It is an accessible, versatile, relatively economic, and fast aid for decision-making in patients with renal symptoms and for guidance in renal intervention. Using B-mode imaging, assessment of renal anatomy is easily performed, and US is often used as image guidance for renal interventions. Furthermore, novel applications in renal US have been introduced with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography and fusion imaging. However, renal US has certain limitations, and other modalities, such as CT (CECT) and MRI, should be considered for supplementary imaging in assessing renal disease.

=== Venous access ===

Intravenous access, for the collection of blood samples to assist in diagnosis or laboratory investigation including blood culture, or for administration of intravenous fluids for fluid maintenance of replacement or blood transfusion in sicker patients, is a common medical procedure. The need for intravenous access occurs in the outpatient laboratory, in the inpatient hospital units, and most critically in the Emergency Room and Intensive Care Unit. In many situations, intravenous access may be required repeatedly or over a significant time period. In these latter circumstances, a needle with an overlying catheter is introduced into the vein and the catheter is then inserted securely into the vein while the needle is withdrawn.
The chosen veins are most frequently selected from the arm, but in challenging situations, a deeper vein from the neck (external jugular vein) or upper arm (subclavian vein) may need to be used.
There are many reasons why the selection of a suitable vein may be problematic.
These include, but are not limited to, obesity, previous injury to veins from inflammatory reaction to previous &#x27;blood draws&#x27;, previous injury to veins from recreational drug use.

In these challenging situations, the insertion of a catheter into a vein has been greatly assisted by the use of ultrasound. The ultrasound unit may be &#x27;cart-based&#x27; or &#x27;handheld&#x27; using a linear transducer with a frequency of 10 to 15 megahertz. In most circumstances, choice of vein will be limited by the requirement that the vein is within 1.5 cms. from the skin surface.
The transducer may be placed longitudinally or transversely over the chosen vein.
Ultrasound training for intravenous cannulation is offered in most ultrasound training programs.

== Mechanism ==
The creation of an image from sound has three steps – transmitting a sound wave, receiving echoes, and interpreting those echoes.

=== Producing a sound wave ===

A sound wave is typically produced by a piezoelectric transducer encased in a plastic housing. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine drive the transducer at the desired frequency. The frequencies can vary between 1 and 18 MHz, though frequencies up to 50–100 megahertz have been used experimentally in a technique known as biomicroscopy in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of the eye.

Older technology transducers focused their beam with physical lenses. Contemporary technology transducers use digital antenna array techniques (piezoelectric elements in the transducer produce echoes at different times) to enable the ultrasound machine to change the direction and depth of focus. Near the transducer, the width of the ultrasound beam almost equals to the width of the transducer, after reaching a distance from the transducer (near zone length or Fresnel zone), the beam width narrows to half of the transducer width, and after that the width increases (far zone length or Fraunhofer&#x27;s zone), where the lateral resolution decreases. Therefore, the wider the transducer width and the higher the frequency of ultrasound, the longer the Fresnel zone, and the lateral resolution can be maintained at a greater depth from the transducer. Ultrasound waves travel in pulses. Therefore, a shorter pulse length requires higher bandwidth (greater number of frequencies) to constitute the ultrasound pulse.

As stated, the sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner, in the beamforming or spatial filtering technique. This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth.

Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (often a rubbery coating, a form of impedance matching). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient&#x27;s skin and the probe to facilitate ultrasound transmission into the body. This is because air causes total reflection of ultrasound; impeding the transmission of ultrasound into the body.

The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues or scattered from smaller structures. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere where there are acoustic impedance changes in the body: e.g. blood cells in blood plasma, small structures in organs, etc. Some of the reflections return to the transducer.

=== Receiving the echoes ===
The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process as sending the sound wave, in reverse. The returned sound wave vibrates the transducer and the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image.

=== Forming the image ===
To make an image, the ultrasound scanner must determine two characteristics from each received echo:
# How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted. (Time and distance are equivalent.)
# How strong the echo was.

Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these two, it can locate which pixel in the image to illuminate and with what intensity.

Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the &#x27;columns&#x27; of the spreadsheet (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, a greyscale image has been accomplished.

In modern ultrasound systems, images are derived from the combined reception of echoes by multiple elements, rather than a single one. These elements in the transducer array work together to receive signals, a process essential for optimizing the ultrasonic beam&#x27;s focus and producing detailed images. One predominant method for this is &quot;delay-and-sum&quot; beamforming. The time delay applied to each element is calculated based on the geometrical relationship between the imaging point, the transducer, and receiver positions. By integrating these time-adjusted signals, the system pinpoints focus onto specific tissue regions, enhancing image resolution and clarity. The utilization of multiple element reception combined with the delay-and-sum principles underpins the high-quality images characteristic of contemporary ultrasound scans.

=== Displaying the image ===
Images from the ultrasound scanner are transferred and displayed using the DICOM standard. Normally, very little post processing is applied.

== Sound in the body ==

Ultrasonography (sonography) uses a probe containing multiple acoustic transducers to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), some of the sound wave is scattered but part is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the echo to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to progress further.

The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18 MHz Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make more detailed sonograms. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so penetration of deeper tissues necessitates a lower frequency (3–5 MHz).

Penetrating deep into the body with sonography is difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost each time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately formula_1) is lost from acoustic absorption. (See Acoustic attenuation for further details on modeling of acoustic attenuation and absorption.)

The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the acoustical impedance of the material. However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540 m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced.

To generate a 2-D image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging or a 1-D phased array transducer may be used to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2-D representation of the slice into the body.

3-D images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2-D images. Commonly a specialized probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2-D image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2-D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3-D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3-D images of a beating heart.

Doppler ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes.

==Expansions==
An additional expansion of ultrasound is bi-planar ultrasound, in which the probe has two 2D planes perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection. Furthermore, an omniplane probe can rotate 180° to obtain multiple images. In 3D ultrasound, many 2D planes are digitally added together to create a 3-dimensional image of the object.

=== Doppler ultrasonography ===

Doppler ultrasonography employs the Doppler effect to assess whether structures (usually blood) are moving towards or away from the probe, and their relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized, as an example. &quot;Color Doppler&quot; is the measurement of velocity by color scale. Color Doppler images are generally combined with gray scale (B-mode) images to display &quot;duplex ultrasonography&quot; images. Uses include:
* Doppler echocardiography is the use of Doppler ultrasonography to examine the heart. An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output and E/A ratio (a measure of diastolic dysfunction). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related measurements of interest.
* Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and transcranial color Doppler (TCCD), measure the velocity of blood flow through the brain&#x27;s blood vessels through the cranium. They are useful in the diagnosis of emboli, stenosis, vasospasm from a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm), and other problems.
* Doppler fetal monitors use the Doppler effect to detect the fetal heartbeat during prenatal care. These are hand-held, and some models also display the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). Use of this monitor is sometimes known as &quot;Doppler auscultation&quot;. The Doppler fetal monitor is commonly referred to simply as a &quot;Doppler&quot; or &quot;fetal Doppler&quot; and provides information similar to that provided by a fetal stethoscope.

=== Contrast ultrasonography (ultrasound contrast imaging) ===
A contrast medium for medical ultrasonography is a formulation of encapsulated gaseous microbubbles to increase echogenicity of blood, discovered by Dr. Raymond Gramiak in 1968 and named contrast-enhanced ultrasound. This contrast medical imaging modality is used throughout the world, for echocardiography in particular in the United States and for ultrasound radiology in Europe and Asia.

Microbubbles-based contrast media is administered intravenously into the patient blood stream during the ultrasonography examination. Due to their size, the microbubbles remain confined in blood vessels without extravasating towards the interstitial fluid. An ultrasound contrast media is therefore purely intravascular, making it an ideal agent to image organ microvasculature for diagnostic purposes. A typical clinical use of contrast ultrasonography is detection of a hypervascular metastatic tumor, which exhibits a contrast uptake (kinetics of microbubbles concentration in blood circulation) faster than healthy biological tissue surrounding the tumor. Other clinical applications using contrast exist, as in echocardiography to improve delineation of left ventricle for visualizing contractibility of heart muscle after a myocardial infarction. Finally, applications in quantitative perfusion (relative measurement of blood flow) have emerged for identifying early patient response to anti-cancerous drug treatment (methodology and clinical study by Dr. Nathalie Lassau in 2011), enabling the best oncological therapeutic options to be determined.

In oncological practice of medical contrast ultrasonography, clinicians use &#x27;parametric imaging of vascular signatures&#x27; invented by Dr. Nicolas Rognin in 2010. This method is conceived as a cancer aided diagnostic tool, facilitating characterization of a suspicious tumor (malignant versus benign) in an organ. This method is based on medical computational science to analyze a time sequence of ultrasound contrast images, a digital video recorded in real-time during patient examination. Two consecutive signal processing steps are applied to each pixel of the tumor:
# calculation of a vascular signature (contrast uptake difference with respect to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor);
# automatic classification of the vascular signature into a unique parameter, the latter coded in one of the four following colors:
#* green for continuous hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake higher than healthy tissue one),
#* blue for continuous hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake lower than healthy tissue one),
#* red for fast hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake before healthy tissue one) or
#* yellow for fast hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake after healthy tissue one).

Once signal processing in each pixel is completed, a color spatial map of the parameter is displayed on a computer monitor, summarizing all vascular information of the tumor in a single image called a parametric image (see last figure of press article as clinical examples). This parametric image is interpreted by clinicians based on predominant colorization of the tumor: red indicates a suspicion of malignancy (risk of cancer), green or yellow – a high probability of benignity. In the first case (suspicion of malignant tumor), the clinician typically prescribes a biopsy to confirm the diagnostic or a CT scan examination as a second opinion. In the second case (quasi-certain of benign tumor), only a follow-up is needed with a contrast ultrasonography examination a few months later. The main clinical benefits are to avoid a systemic biopsy (with inherent risks of invasive procedures) of benign tumors or a CT scan examination exposing the patient to X-ray radiation. The parametric imaging of vascular signatures method proved to be effective in humans for characterization of tumors in the liver. In a cancer screening context, this method might be potentially applicable to other organs such as breast or prostate.

=== Molecular ultrasonography (ultrasound molecular imaging) ===
The current future of contrast ultrasonography is in molecular imaging with potential clinical applications expected in cancer screening to detect malignant tumors at their earliest stage of appearance. Molecular ultrasonography (or ultrasound molecular imaging) uses targeted microbubbles originally designed by Dr Alexander Klibanov in 1997; such targeted microbubbles specifically bind or adhere to tumoral microvessels by targeting biomolecular cancer expression (overexpression of certain biomolecules that occurs during neo-angiogenesis or inflammation in malignant tumors). As a result, a few minutes after their injection in blood circulation, the targeted microbubbles accumulate in the malignant tumor; facilitating its localization in a unique ultrasound contrast image. In 2013, the very first exploratory clinical trial in humans for prostate cancer was completed at Amsterdam in the Netherlands by Dr. Hessel Wijkstra.

In molecular ultrasonography, the technique of acoustic radiation force (also used for shear wave elastography) is applied in order to literally push the targeted microbubbles towards microvessels wall; first demonstrated by Dr. Paul Dayton in 1999. This allows maximization of binding to the malignant tumor; the targeted microbubbles being in more direct contact with cancerous biomolecules expressed at the inner surface of tumoral microvessels. At the stage of scientific preclinical research, the technique of acoustic radiation force was implemented as a prototype in clinical ultrasound systems and validated &quot;in vivo&quot; in 2D and 3D imaging modes.

=== Elastography (ultrasound elasticity imaging) ===

Ultrasound is also used for elastography, which is a relatively new imaging modality that maps the elastic properties of soft tissue. This modality emerged in the last two decades. Elastography is useful in medical diagnoses as it can discern healthy from unhealthy tissue for specific organs/growths. For example, cancerous tumors will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones.

There are many ultrasound elastography techniques.

===Interventional ultrasonography===
Interventional ultrasonography involves biopsy, emptying fluids, intrauterine Blood transfusion (Hemolytic disease of the newborn).
* Thyroid cysts: High frequency thyroid ultrasound (HFUS) can be used to treat several gland conditions. The recurrent thyroid cyst that was usually treated in the past with surgery, can be treated effectively by a new procedure called percutaneous ethanol injection, or PEI. With ultrasound guided placement of a 25 gauge needle within the cyst, and after evacuation of the cyst fluid, about 50% of the cyst volume is injected back into the cavity, under strict operator visualization of the needle tip. The procedure is 80% successful in reducing the cyst to minute size.
* Metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes: HFUS may also be used to treat metastatic thyroid cancer neck lymph nodes that occur in patients who either refuse, or are no longer candidates, for surgery. Small amounts of ethanol are injected under ultrasound guided needle placement. A power doppler blood flow study is done prior to injection. The blood flow can be destroyed and the node rendered inactive. Power doppler visualized blood flow can be eradicated, and there may be a drop in the cancer blood marker test, thyroglobulin, TG, as the node become non-functional. Another interventional use for HFUS is to mark a cancer node prior to surgery to help locate the node cluster at the surgery. A minute amount of methylene dye is injected, under careful ultrasound guided placement of the needle on the anterior surface, but not in the node. The dye will be evident to the thyroid surgeon when opening the neck. A similar localization procedure with methylene blue, can be done to locate parathyroid adenomas.

* Joint injections can be guided by medical ultrasound, such as in ultrasound-guided hip joint injections.

=== Compression ultrasonography ===
Compression ultrasonography is when the probe is pressed against the skin. This can bring the target structure closer to the probe, increasing spatial resolution of it. Comparison of the shape of the target structure before and after compression can aid in diagnosis.

It is used in ultrasonography of deep venous thrombosis, wherein absence of vein compressibility is a strong indicator of thrombosis. Compression ultrasonography has both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis in symptomatic patients. Results are not reliable when the patient is asymptomatic, for example in high risk postoperative orthopedic patients.


===Panoramic ultrasonography===

Panoramic ultrasonography is the digital stitching of multiple ultrasound images into a broader one. It can display an entire abnormality and show its relationship to nearby structures on a single image.

=== Multiparametric ultrasonography ===
Multiparametric ultrasonography (mpUSS) combines multiple ultrasound techniques to produce a composite result. For example, one study combined B-mode, colour Doppler, real-time elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, achieving an accuracy similar to that of multiparametric MRI.

=== Speed-of-Sound Imaging ===
Speed-of-sound (SoS) imaging aims to find the spatial distribution of the SoS within the tissue. The idea is to find relative delay measurements for different transmission events and solve the limited-angle tomographic reconstruction problem using delay measurements and transmission geometry. Compared to shear-wave elastography, SoS imaging has better ex-vivo tissue differentiation for benign and malignant tumors.

==Attributes==
As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has positive and negative attributes.

===Strengths===
* Muscle, soft tissue, and bone surfaces are imaged very well including the delineation of interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces.
* &quot;Live&quot; images can be dynamically selected, permitting diagnosis and documentation often rapidly. Live images also permit ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities.
* Organ structure can be demonstrated.
* There are no known long-term side effects when used according to guidelines, and discomfort is minimal.
* Ability to image local variations in the mechanical properties of soft tissue.
* Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible.
* Small, easily carried scanners are available which permit bedside examinations.
* Transducers have become relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as computed X-ray tomography, DEXA or magnetic resonance imaging.
* Spatial resolution is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than most other imaging modalities.
* Use of an ultrasound research interface can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for specific research purposes of tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques.

=== Weaknesses ===

* Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating bone. For example, sonography of the adult brain is currently very limited.
* Sonography performs very poorly when there is gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in acoustic impedance. For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the pancreas difficult. Lung imaging however can be useful in demarcating pleural effusions, detecting heart failure and pneumonia.
* Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients.
* Image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients and overlying subcutaneous fat attenuates the sound beam. A lower frequency transducer is required with subsequent lower resolution.
* The method is operator-dependent. Skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses.
* There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged.
* 80% of sonographers experience Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) or so-called Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSD) because of bad ergonomic positions.

==Risks and side-effects==
Ultrasonography is generally considered safe imaging, with the World Health Organizations stating:
:&quot;Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion&quot;.

Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the fetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. However, this diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the &quot;as low as reasonably practicable&quot; or ALARP principle.

Although there is no evidence that ultrasound could be harmful to the fetus, medical authorities typically strongly discourage the promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making &quot;keepsake fetal videos&quot;.

===Studies on the safety of ultrasound===
* A meta-analysis of several ultrasonography studies published in 2000 found no statistically significant harmful effects from ultrasonography. It was noted that there is a lack of data on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment.
* A study at the Yale School of Medicine published in 2006 found a small but significant correlation between prolonged and frequent use of ultrasound and abnormal neuronal migration in mice.
* A study performed in Sweden in 2001 has shown that subtle effects of neurological damage linked to ultrasound were implicated by an increased incidence in left-handedness in boys (a marker for brain problems when not hereditary) and speech delays.
** The above findings, however, were not confirmed in a follow-up study.
** A later study, however, performed on a larger sample of 8865 children, has established a statistically significant, albeit weak association of ultrasonography exposure and being non-right handed later in life.

== Regulation ==
Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound equipment is regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration, and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics; generally, other agencies accept the FDA-established guidelines.

Currently, New Mexico, Oregon, and North Dakota are the only US states that regulate diagnostic medical sonographers. Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Cardiovascular Credentialing International and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists.

The primary regulated metrics are Mechanical Index (MI), a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and Thermal Index (TI) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed established limits, which are reasonably conservative in an effort to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality. This requires self-regulation on the part of the manufacturer in terms of machine calibration.

Ultrasound-based pre-natal care and sex screening technologies were launched in India in the 1980s. With concerns about its misuse for sex-selective abortion, the Government of India passed the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT) in 1994 to distinguish and regulate legal and illegal uses of ultrasound equipment. The law was further amended as the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion. It is currently illegal and a punishable crime in India to determine or disclose the sex of a fetus using ultrasound equipment.

== Use in other animals ==
Ultrasound is also a valuable tool in veterinary medicine, offering the same non-invasive imaging that helps in the diagnosis and monitoring of conditions in animals.

==History==
After the French physicist Pierre Curie&#x27;s discovery of piezoelectricity in 1880, ultrasonic waves could be deliberately generated for industry. In 1940, the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone devised the first ultrasonic echo imaging device, the Supersonic Reflectoscope, to detect internal flaws in metal castings. In 1941, Austrian neurologist Karl Theo Dussik, in collaboration with his brother, Friedrich, a physicist, was likely the first person to image the human body ultrasonically, outlining the ventricles of a human brain. Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr George Ludwig at the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, in the late 1940s. English-born physicist John Wild (1914–2009) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949; he has been described as the &quot;father of medical ultrasound&quot;. Subsequent advances took place concurrently in several countries but it was not until 1961 that David Robinson and George Kossoff&#x27;s work at the Australian Department of Health resulted in the first commercially practical water bath ultrasonic scanner. In 1963 Meyerdirk &amp; Wright launched production of the first commercial, hand-held, articulated arm, compound contact B-mode scanner, which made ultrasound generally available for medical use.

===France===
Léandre Pourcelot, a researcher and teacher at INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées), Lyon, co-published a report in 1965 at the Académie des sciences, &quot;Effet Doppler et mesure du débit sanguin&quot; (&quot;Doppler effect and measure of the blood flow&quot;), the basis of his design of a Doppler flow meter in 1967.

===Scotland===
Parallel developments in Glasgow, Scotland by Professor Ian Donald and colleagues at the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique. Donald was an obstetrician with a self-confessed &quot;childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise&quot;, who, having treated the wife of one of the company&#x27;s directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers Babcock &amp; Wilcox at Renfrew. He adapted their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist Tom Brown. and fellow obstetrician John MacVicar, Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; on 7 June 1958 as &quot;Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound&quot; – possibly one of the most important papers published in the field of diagnostic medical imaging.

At GRMH, Professor Donald and James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including fetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the fetus. With the opening of the new Queen Mother&#x27;s Hospital in Yorkhill in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Stuart Campbell&#x27;s pioneering work on fetal cephalometry led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, fetal abnormality and &quot;placenta praevia&quot;. Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine.

===Sweden===
Medical ultrasonography was used in 1953 at Lund University by cardiologist Inge Edler and Gustav Ludwig Hertz&#x27;s son Carl Hellmuth Hertz, who was then a graduate student at the university&#x27;s department of nuclear physics.

Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use radar to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible. However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic reflectoscopes of the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone&#x27;s invention for nondestructive materials testing, and together Edler and Hertz developed the idea of applying this methodology in medicine.

The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953, using a device borrowed from the ship construction company Kockums in Malmö. On December 16 the same year, the method was applied to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the brain). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954.

===United States===
In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner. Their work had been supported by U.S. Public Health Services and the University of Colorado. Wright and Meyerdirk left the university to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.

In the late 1960s Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease. Eventually, they developed technologies to use duplex imaging, or Doppler in conjunction with B-mode scanning, to view vascular structures in real time while also providing hemodynamic information.

The first demonstration of color Doppler was by Geoff Stevenson, who was involved in the early developments and medical use of Doppler shifted ultrasonic energy.

<doc id="143359" wikidata="Q192677" url="?curid=143359" title="Leviathan">
<text>The Leviathan ( ; ; ) is a sea serpent demon noted in theology and mythology. It is referenced in several books of the Hebrew Bible, including Psalms, the Book of Job, the Book of Isaiah, and the pseudepigraphical Book of Enoch. The Leviathan is often an embodiment of chaos, threatening to eat the damned when their lives are over. In the end, it is annihilated. Christian theologians identified Leviathan with the demon of the deadly sin &quot;envy&quot;. According to Ophite diagrams, the Leviathan encapsulates the space of the material world.

In Gnosis, it encompasses the world like a sphere and incorporates the souls of those who are too attached to material things, so they cannot reach the realm of God&#x27;s fullness beyond, from which all good emanates. In Hobbes, who draws on Job 41:24, the Leviathan becomes a metaphor for the omnipotence of the state, which maintains itself by educating all children in its favour, generation after generation. This idea of an eternal power that &#x27;feeds&#x27; on its constantly growing citizens is based on a concept of education that mechanically shapes memory. It too is based on a good–evil dualism: a hypothetical natural law according to which man is a wolf to man, and the pedagogically mediated laws of the state as Leviathan for the purpose of containing such frightening conditions.

The Leviathan of the Book of Job is a reflection of the older Canaanite &quot;Lotan&quot;, a primeval monster defeated by the god Baal Hadad. Parallels to the role of Mesopotamian Tiamat defeated by Marduk have long been drawn in comparative mythology, as have been wider comparisons to dragon and world serpent narratives, such as Indra slaying Vrtra or Thor slaying Jörmungandr. Leviathan also figures in the Hebrew Bible as a metaphor for a powerful enemy, notably Babylon (Isaiah 27:1). Some 19th-century scholars pragmatically interpreted it as referring to large aquatic creatures, such as the crocodile. The word later came to be used as a term for &quot;great whale&quot; and for sea monsters in general.

==Etymology and origins==

Gesenius (among others) argued the name was derived from the root &quot;lwh&quot; &quot;to twine; to join&quot;, with an adjectival suffix , for a literal meaning of &quot;wreathed, twisted in folds&quot;. If it exists, the adjectival suffix (as opposed to -ון) is otherwise unattested except perhaps in Nehushtan, whose etymology is unknown; the ת would also require explanation, as Nechushtan is formed from &quot;neḥošeṯ&quot; and Leviathan from &quot;liveyah&quot;; the normal-pattern f.s. adjective would be לויון, &quot;liveyon&quot;. Other philologists, including Leskien, thought it a foreign loanword. A third school considers it a proper noun. Bauer proposed לוית+תן, for &quot;wreath of serpent.&quot;

Both the name and the mythological figure are a direct continuation of the Ugaritic sea monster &quot;Lôtān&quot;, one of the servants of the sea god Yammu defeated by Hadad in the &quot;Baal Cycle&quot;. 
The Ugaritic account has gaps, making it unclear whether some phrases describe him or other monsters at Yammu&#x27;s disposal such as Tunannu (the biblical Tannin). Most scholars agree on describing Lôtān as &quot;the fugitive serpent&quot; (&quot;bṯn brḥ&quot;) but he may or may not be &quot;the wriggling serpent&quot; (&quot;bṯn ʿqltn&quot;) or &quot;the mighty one with seven heads&quot; (&quot;šlyṭ d.šbʿt rašm&quot;). His role seems to have been prefigured by the earlier serpent Têmtum whose death at the hands of Hadad is depicted in Syrian seals of the 18th–16th century BC.

Sea serpents feature prominently in the mythology of the ancient Near East. They are attested by the 3rd millennium BC in Sumerian iconography depicting the god Ninurta overcoming a seven-headed serpent. It was common for Near Eastern religions to include a &quot;Chaoskampf&quot;: a cosmic battle between a sea monster representing the forces of chaos and a creator god or culture hero who imposes order by force. The Babylonian creation myth describes Marduk&#x27;s defeat of the serpent goddess Tiamat, whose body was used to create the heavens and the earth.

== Tanakh ==
The Leviathan specifically is mentioned six times in the Tanakh.

 is dedicated to describing him in detail: &quot;Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?&quot; Included in God&#x27;s lengthy description of his indomitable creation is Leviathan&#x27;s fire-breathing ability, his impenetrable scales, and his overall indomitability in .In , God is praised for having made all things, including Leviathan, and in , he is called the &quot;tortuous serpent&quot; who will be killed at the end of time.

The mention of the Tannins in the Genesis creation narrative (translated as &quot;great whales&quot; in the King James Version), in Job, and in the Psalm do not describe them as harmful but as ocean creatures who are part of God&#x27;s creation. The element of competition between God and the sea monster and the use of Leviathan to describe the powerful enemies of Israel may reflect the influence of the Mesopotamian and Canaanite legends or the contest in Egyptian mythology between the Apep snake and the sun god Ra. Alternatively, the removal of such competition may have reflected an attempt to naturalize Leviathan in a process that demoted it from deity to demon to monster.

== Judaism ==

Later Jewish sources describe Leviathan as a dragon who lives over the sources of the Deep and who, along with the male land-monster Behemoth, will be served up to the righteous at the end of time.
The Book of Enoch (60:7–9) describes Leviathan as a female monster dwelling in the watery abyss (as Tiamat), while Behemoth is a male monster living in the desert of Dunaydin (&quot;east of Eden&quot;).

In the Jewish midrash (explanations of the Tanakh), it is stated that God originally produced a male and a female leviathan, but lest in multiplying the species should destroy the world, he slew the female, reserving her flesh for the banquet that will be given to the righteous on the advent of the Messiah. A similar description appears in Book of Enoch (60:24), which describes how the Behemoth and Leviathan will be prepared as part of an eschatological meal.

Rashi&#x27;s commentary on repeats the tradition:

the ... sea monsters: The great fish in the sea, and in the words of the Aggadah (B.B. 74b), this refers to the Leviathan and its mate, for He created them male and female, and He slew the female and salted her away for the righteous in the future, for if they would propagate, the world could not exist because of them. הַתַּנִינִם is written.

In the Talmud &quot;Baba Bathra 75&quot; it is told that the Leviathan will be slain and its flesh served as a feast to the righteous in [the] Time to Come and its skin used to cover the tent where the banquet will take place. Those who do not deserve to consume its flesh beneath the tent may receive various vestments of the Leviathan varying from coverings (for the somewhat deserving) to amulets (for the least deserving). The remaining skin of the Leviathan will be spread onto the walls of Jerusalem, thereby illuminating the world with its brightness. The festival of Sukkot (Festival of Booths) therefore concludes with a prayer recited upon leaving the &quot;sukkah&quot; (booth):
: &quot;May it be your will, Lord our God and God of our forefathers, that just as I have fulfilled and dwelt in this sukkah, so may I merit in the coming year to dwell in &quot;the sukkah of the skin of Leviathan&quot;. Next year in Jerusalem.&quot;

The enormous size of the Leviathan is described by Johanan bar Nappaha, from whom proceeded nearly all the aggadot concerning this monster:
: &quot;Once we went in a ship and saw a fish which put his head out of the water. He had horns upon which was written: &#x27;I am one of the meanest creatures that inhabit the sea. I am three hundred miles in length, and enter this day into the jaws of the Leviathan&#x27;&quot;.

When the Leviathan is hungry, reports Rabbi Dimi in the name of Rabbi Johanan, he sends forth from his mouth a heat so great as to make all the waters of the deep boil, and if he would put his head into Paradise no living creature could endure the odor of him. His abode is the Mediterranean Sea.

In a legend recorded in the Midrash called &quot;Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; it is stated that the fish which swallowed Jonah narrowly avoided being eaten by the Leviathan, which eats one whale each day.

The body of the Leviathan, especially his eyes, possesses great illuminating power. This was the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who, in the course of a voyage in company with Rabbi Joshua, explained to the latter, when frightened by the sudden appearance of a brilliant light, that it probably proceeded from the eyes of the Leviathan. He referred his companion to the words of Job 41:18:
: &quot;By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning&quot;.

However, in spite of his supernatural strength, the leviathan is afraid of a small worm called &quot;kilbit&quot;, which clings to the gills of large fish and kills them.

In the eleventh-century piyyut (religious poem), &quot;Akdamut&quot;, recited on &quot;Shavuot&quot; (Pentecost), it is envisioned that, ultimately, God will slaughter the Leviathan, which is described as having &quot;mighty fins&quot; (and, therefore, a kosher fish, not an inedible snake or crocodile), and it will be served as a sumptuous banquet for all the righteous in Heaven.

In the Zohar, the Leviathan is a metaphor for enlightenment. The Zohar remarks that the legend of the righteous eating the skin of the leviathan at the end of the days is not literal, and merely a metaphor for enlightenment. The Zohar also specifies in detail that the Leviathan has a mate. The Zohar also associates the metaphor of the leviathan with the &quot;tzaddik&quot; or righteous in Zohar 2:11b and 3:58a. The Zohar associates it with the &quot;briach&quot; the pole in the middle of the boards of the tabernacle in Zohar 2:20a. Both, are associated with the Sefira of Yesod.

According to Abraham Isaac Kook, the Leviathan – a singular creature with no mate, &quot;its tail is placed in its mouth&quot; (Zohar) &quot;twisting around and encompassing the entire world&quot; (Rashi on Baba Batra 74b) – projects a vivid metaphor for the universe&#x27;s underlying unity. This unity will only be revealed in the future, when the righteous will feast on the Leviathan.

==Christianity==
Leviathan can also be used as an image of the devil, endangering both God&#x27;s creatures — by attempting to eat them — and God&#x27;s creation — by threatening it with upheaval in the waters of Chaos. A &quot;dragon&quot; (&quot;drakon&quot;), being the usual translation for the leviathan in the Septuagint, appears in the Book of Revelation. Although the Old Testament nowhere identifies the leviathan with the devil, the seven-headed dragon in the Book of Revelation explicitly is. By this the battle between God and the primordial chaos monsters shifts to a battle between God and the devil. Only once, in the Book of Job, the leviathan is translated as &quot;sea-monster&quot; (, &quot;ketos&quot;).

In the following chapter, a seven-headed beast, described with the same features as the dragon before, rises from the waters endowing a Beast of the Earth with power. Dividing the beasts into monster of water and one of dry earth is probably a recalling of the monstrous pair Leviathan and Behemoth. In accordance with , the dragon will be slain by God on the last day and cast into the abyss. The annihilation of the chaos-monster results in a new world of peace, without any trace of evil.

Jerome comments on Psalm 104:26 that &quot;this is the dragon that was cast out of Paradise, that beguiled Eve, and is permitted in this world to make sport of us. How many monks and clerics has it dashed headlong! &quot;They all look to you to give them food in due time,&quot; for all the creatures of God live at His bidding.&quot;

Peter Binsfeld classified Leviathan as the demon of envy, as one of the seven Princes of Hell corresponding to the seven deadly sins. Leviathan became associated with, and may originally have been referred to by, the visual motif of the Hellmouth, a monstrous animal into whose mouth the damned disappear at the Last Judgment, found in Anglo-Saxon art from about 800, and later all over Europe.

The Revised Standard Version of the Bible suggests in a footnote to Job 41:1 that Leviathan may be a name for the crocodile, and in a footnote to Job 40:15, that Behemoth may be a name for the hippopotamus.

==Satanism==

Anton LaVey in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; (1969) has Leviathan representing the element of Water and the direction of west, listing it as one of the Four Crown Princes of Hell. This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage&quot;. The Church of Satan uses the Hebrew letters at each of the points of the Sigil of Baphomet to represent Leviathan. Starting from the lowest point of the pentagram, and reading counter-clockwise, the word reads &quot;לויתן&quot;: (Nun, Tav, Yod, Vav, Lamed) Hebrew for &quot;Leviathan&quot;.

==Gnosticism==
The Church Father Origen accused a Gnostic sect of venerating the biblical serpent of the Garden of Eden. Therefore, he calls them Ophites, naming after the serpent they are supposed to worship. In this belief system, the Leviathan appears as an Ouroboros, separating the divine realm from humanity by enveloping or permeating the material world. It is unknown whether or not the Ophites actually identified the serpent of the Garden of Eden with the Leviathan. However, since the Leviathan is basically connoted negatively in this Gnostic cosmology, if they identified him with the serpent of the Book of Genesis, he was probably indeed considered evil and just its advice was good.

According to the cosmology of this Gnostic sect, the world is encapsulated by the Leviathan, in form of a dragon-shaped archon, biting its own tail (&quot;ouroboros&quot;). Generating the intrinsic evil in the entire universe, the Leviathan separates the lower world, governed by the Archons, from the realm of God. After death, a soul must pass through the seven spheres of the heavens. If the soul does not succeed, it will be swallowed by the Leviathan, who holds the world captive and returns the soul into an animal body.

In Mandaeism, Leviathan is regarded as being coessential with a demon called Ur.

In Manichaeism, an ancient religion influenced by Gnostic ideas, the Leviathan is killed by the sons of the fallen angel Shemyaza. This act is not portrayed as heroic, but as foolish, symbolizing the greatest triumphs as transient, since both are killed by archangels in turn after boasting about their victory. This reflects Manichaean criticism on royal power and advocates asceticism.

==Secular use==

The word Leviathan has come to refer to any sea monster, and from the early 17th century has also been used to refer to overwhelmingly powerful people or things, comparable to Behemoth, also a biblical term as noted by Hobbes&#x27; book (1651).

As a term for sea monster, it has also been used of great whales in particular, e.g. in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; – although in the first Hebrew translation of the novel, translator Elyahu Burtinker chose to translate &quot;Whale&quot; to &quot;Tanin&quot; (intending to refer to another sea monster although in Modern Hebrew usage Tanin more commonly translates to &quot;crocodile&quot;), and leave the word &quot;Leviathan&quot; as it is, nodding to the ambiguity of the word &quot;לויתן&quot; in modern Hebrew – in which the word now simply means &quot;whale&quot;.

An extinct genus of sperm whales bears the name &quot;Livyatan&quot;. A major cryovolcanic feature on Neptune&#x27;s largest moon Triton has been named Leviathan Patera.

<text>Juan Ponce de León ( – July 1521) was a Spanish explorer and &quot;conquistador&quot; known for leading the first official European expedition to Puerto Rico in 1508 and Florida in 1513. Though little is known about his family, he was of noble birth and served in the Spanish military from a young age. He first came to the Americas as a &quot;gentleman volunteer&quot; with Christopher Columbus&#x27;s second expedition in 1493.

Ponce de León was born in Santervás de Campos, Valladolid, Spain, in 1474. By the early 1500s, he was a top military official in the colonial government of Hispaniola, where he helped crush a rebellion of the native Taíno people. He was authorized to explore the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in 1508 and to take office as the first Governor of Puerto Rico by appointment of the Spanish crown in 1509. While he grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines, he faced an ongoing legal conflict with Diego Colón, the late Christopher Columbus&#x27;s son, over the right to govern Puerto Rico. After a long court battle, Colón replaced Ponce de León as governor in 1511. Ponce de León decided to follow the advice of the sympathetic King Ferdinand and explore more of the Caribbean Sea.

In 1513, Ponce de León led the first known European expedition to La Florida, which he named during his first voyage to the area. He landed somewhere along Florida&#x27;s east coast, then charted the Atlantic coast down to the Florida Keys and north along the Gulf coast; historian John R. Swanton believed that he sailed perhaps as far as Apalachee Bay on Florida&#x27;s western coast. Though in popular culture he was supposedly searching for the Fountain of Youth, there is no contemporary evidence to support the story, which most modern historians consider a myth.

Ponce de León returned to Spain in 1514 and was knighted by King Ferdinand, who also reinstated him as the governor of Puerto Rico and authorized him to settle Florida. He returned to the Caribbean in 1515, but plans to organize an expedition to Florida were delayed by the death of King Ferdinand in 1516, after which Ponce de León again traveled to Spain to defend his grants and titles. He did not return to Puerto Rico for two years.

In March 1521, Ponce de León finally returned to Southwest Florida with the first large-scale attempt to establish a Spanish colony in what is now the continental United States. However, the native Calusa people fiercely resisted the incursion, and Ponce de Léon was seriously wounded in a skirmish. The colonization attempt was abandoned, and he died from his wounds soon after returning to Cuba in early July. He was interred in Puerto Rico; his tomb is located inside the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista in San Juan.

==Biography==
===Spain===
Juan Ponce de León was born in the village of Santervás de Campos in the northern part of what is now the Spanish province of Valladolid. Although early historians placed his birth in 1460, and this date has been used traditionally, more recent evidence shows he was likely born in 1474. The surname Ponce de León dates from the 13th century. The Ponce de León lineage began with Ponce Vélaz de Cabrera, descendant of count Bermudo Núñez, and Sancha Ponce de Cabrera, daughter of Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera.

Before October 1235, a son of Ponce Vela de Cabrera and his wife Teresa Rodríguez Girón named Pedro Ponce de Cabrera married Aldonza Alfonso, an illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of León. The descendants of this marriage added the &quot;de León&quot; to their patronymic and were known thereafter by the name Ponce de León.

Although the identity of Juan Ponce de León&#x27;s parents is still a matter of conjecture, according to Fuson and Arnade, citing Puerto Rican historian Aurelio Tió, Pedro Ponce de León and Leonor de Figueroa were most likely the parents of Juan Ponce de León. Thus Ponce appears to have been a member of a distinguished and influential noble family.

His relatives included Rodrigo Ponce de León, Duke of Cádiz, a celebrated figure in the Moorish wars (sometimes known as a &quot;new Cid&quot;), and Juan Ponce de León&#x27;s first cousin. Aurelio Tió, in his &quot;Nuevas fuentes para la historia de Puerto Rico&quot;, made a vigorous case for Juan Ponce&#x27;s aristocratic heritage, determining that Juan Ponce&#x27;s father was Pedro Ponce de León, the Fourth Lord of Villagarcía, and his mother was Leonor de Figueroa, the daughter of Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa, Lord of Salvaleón, and María Manuel; consequently Juan Ponce&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Teresa de Guzmán (Teresa Ponce de León y Guzmán), was La Señora de la Casa Toral, making Juan Ponce a Ponce de León on both sides of his family.

Through this grandmother, Ponce de León was related to another notable family, the Núñez de Guzmáns; a contemporary chronicler, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, says that as a young man he served as a page and then as a squire to Pedro Núñez de Guzmán, Knight Commander of the Order of Calatrava. Devereux says Ponce de León probably joined the Spanish campaigns against the Muslims in the Granada War in which the Catholic Monarchs finally conquered in 1492 the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, the last Muslim polity surviving in the Iberian peninsula. Puerto Rican historian Vicente Murga Sanz states that as the squire of Pedro Núñez de Guzmán, it is possible that Juan Ponce de León fought on the side of Rodrigo Ponce de León at the Battle of Granada. Fernandez de Oviedo writes that when Juan Ponce de León arrived in the Americas he was a military man who had gained his experience in the Granada War, but Arnade cautions, &quot;Without proof the biographers of the conquistador state that he accompanied Pedro Núñez de Guzmán in the war against the Moors during the Granada campaign&quot;.

===Arrival in the New World===
In September 1493, some 1,200 sailors, colonists, and soldiers joined Christopher Columbus for his second voyage to the New World. Ponce de León, nineteen years old, was able to get passage in this expedition, with Núñez de Guzmán&#x27;s help, as one of 200 &quot;gentleman volunteers&quot;.

The fleet reached the Caribbean in November 1493. They visited several islands before arriving at their primary destination in Hispaniola, and anchored on the coast of a large island the native people called Borikén (Boriquen in Spanish), &quot;the land of the brave lord&quot;, which would eventually become known as Puerto Rico. This was Ponce de León&#x27;s first glimpse of the place that would play a major role in his future. Historians are divided on what he did during the next several years, but it is possible that he returned to Spain at some point and made his way back to Hispaniola with Nicolás de Ovando.

===Hispaniola===
In 1502 the newly appointed governor, Nicolás de Ovando, arrived in Hispaniola, with the Spanish Crown expecting him to bring order to a colony in disarray, a task in which he succeeded. Ovando interpreted his instructions as authorizing subjugation of the native Taínos, and consequently authorized the Jaragua massacre in November 1503. In 1504, when Taínos overran a small Spanish garrison in Higüey on the island&#x27;s eastern side, Ovando assigned Ponce de León to crush the rebellion.

Ponce de León was actively involved in the Higüey massacre, about which friar Bartolomé de las Casas attempted to notify Spanish authorities. Ovando rewarded his victorious commander by appointing him frontier governor of the newly conquered province, then named Higüey also. Ponce de León received a substantial land grant with an &quot;encomienda&quot; of sufficient Indian labor to farm his new estate.

Ponce de León prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de León to establish a new town in Higüey, which he named Salvaleón. In 1508 King Ferdinand (Queen Isabella having opposed the exploitation of natives but dying in 1504) authorized Ponce de León to conquer the remaining Taínos and exploit them by forcing them to mine gold.

Around this time, Ponce de León married Leonora, an innkeeper&#x27;s daughter. They had three daughters, Juana, Isabel and María, and one son, Luis. The large stone house Ponce de León ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of San Rafael del Yuma; he named it Salvaleón after his grandmother&#x27;s estate in Castile.

===Puerto Rico===

As provincial governor, Ponce de León heard stories from Island Caribs who had been captured when they raided Spanish colonies. They told him of gold on the neighboring island of San Juan, now Puerto Rico, which he had first seen as a member of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s second voyage in 1493, describing a fertile land with much gold to be found in the many rivers. Inspired by the possibility of riches, Ponce de León requested and received permission from Ovando to explore the island.

The official settlement of San Juan by Spaniards is often dated to 1508, when Ponce landed in a caravel with about fifty men on the southern coast of the island, but there is documentation in the Archive of the Indies (&quot;Archivo General de Indias&quot;) that he had led an expedition there with several hundred men as early as 1506, under orders by Governor Ovando to explore, settle, and conquer the island. Puerto Rican scholar Aurelio Tió wrote two books which contain much archival material concerning Ponce de León, including documentation he discovered in Spain and in Puerto Rico. He writes in detail of the &quot;Probanza de Juan González&quot;, according to which a temporary base was established on the west coast of Puerto Rico near the Bay of Añasco in 1506. This earlier trip was said to have been done quietly because the Spanish crown in 1504 had commissioned Vicente Yáñez Pinzón to explore the island and build a fort. Pinzón did not fulfill his commission and it expired in 1507, leaving the way clear for Ponce de León.

His earlier exploration had confirmed the presence of gold and gave him a good understanding of the geography of the island. In 1508, Ferdinand II of Aragon gave permission to Ponce de León for the first &quot;official&quot; expedition to the island, which the Spanish then called San Juan Bautista. Ponce de León led a small exploratory party to Puerto Rico in 1508 that found placer deposits of gold in the western end of the island. This expedition, consisting of about 50 men in one ship, left Hispaniola on 12 July 1508 and eventually anchored in San Juan Bay, near today&#x27;s city of San Juan.

Ponce de León searched inland until he found a suitable site about two miles from the bay. Here he erected a storehouse and a fortified house, creating the first settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra. Although a few crops were planted, the settlers spent most of their time and energy searching for gold. By early 1509 Ponce de León decided to return to Hispaniola. His expedition had collected a good quantity of gold but was running low on food and supplies.
The expedition was deemed a great success and Ovando appointed Ponce de León governor of San Juan Bautista. This appointment was later confirmed by Ferdinand II on 14 August 1509. He was instructed to extend the settlement of the island and continue mining for gold. The new governor returned to the island as instructed, bringing with him his wife and children. The rush of Spaniards from Hispaniola wanting to mine gold disrupted the way of life of the Taíno native people.

Back on his island, Ponce de León parceled out the native Taínos among himself and other settlers using the system of forced labor known as . The Indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold. Ponce put those assigned to his personal , , to work searching for gold in the Toa Valley just east of San Juan. Many of the Spaniards treated the Taínos very harshly and death rates were very high. The demand for slaves kidnapped from other islands grew. By June 1511, the Taínos, pushed to the limits of their endurance, began a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de León and a small force of troops armed with crossbows and arquebuses (long guns).

Even as Ponce de León was settling the island of San Juan, significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the Spanish West Indies. On 10 July 1509, Diego Colón, the son of Christopher Columbus, arrived in Hispaniola as acting Viceroy, replacing Nicolás de Ovando. For several years Diego Colón had been waging a legal battle over his rights to inherit the titles and privileges granted to his father. The Crown regretted the sweeping powers that had been granted to Columbus and his heirs and sought to establish more direct control in the New World. In spite of the Crown&#x27;s opposition, Colón prevailed in court and Ferdinand was required to appoint him Viceroy.

Although the courts had ordered that Ponce de León should remain in office, Colón circumvented this directive on 28 October 1509 by appointing Juan Ceron chief justice and Miguel Diaz chief constable of the island, effectively overriding the authority of the governor. This situation prevailed until 2 March 1510, when Ferdinand issued orders reaffirming Ponce de León&#x27;s position as governor. Ponce de León then had Ceron and Diaz arrested and sent back to Spain.

The political struggle between Colón and Ponce de León continued in this manner for the next few years. Ponce de León had influential supporters in Spain and Ferdinand regarded him as a loyal servant. However, Colón&#x27;s position as Viceroy made him a powerful opponent and eventually it became clear that Ponce de León&#x27;s position on San Juan was not tenable. Finally, on 28 November 1511, Ceron returned from Spain and was officially reinstated as governor.

===First voyage to Florida in 1513===

Rumors of undiscovered islands to the northwest of Hispaniola had reached Spain by 1511, and Ferdinand was interested in forestalling further exploration and discovery by Colón. In an effort to reward Ponce de León for his services, Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands outside the authority of Colón. Ponce de León readily agreed to a new venture, and in February 1512 a royal contract was dispatched outlining his rights and authorities to search for &quot;the Islands of Beniny&quot;.

The contract stipulated that Ponce de León held exclusive rights to the discovery of Beniny and neighboring islands for the next three years. He would be governor for life of any lands he discovered, but he was expected to finance all costs of exploration and settlement himself. In addition, the contract gave specific instructions for the distribution of gold, Native Americans, and other profits extracted from the new lands; the contract made no mention of a rejuvenating fountain.

Ponce de León equipped three ships with at least 200 men, including several Africans, at his own expense and set out from Puerto Rico on 4 March 1513. The only near contemporary description known for this expedition comes from Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, a Spanish historian who apparently had access to the original ships&#x27; logs or related secondary sources from which he created a summary of the voyage published in 1601. The brevity of the account and occasional gaps in the record have led historians to speculate and dispute many details of the voyage.

The three ships in this small fleet were the &quot;Santiago&quot;, the &quot;San Cristobal&quot; and the &quot;Santa Maria de la Consolacion&quot;. Anton de Alaminos was their chief pilot. He was already an experienced sailor, and would become one of the most respected pilots in the region. After leaving Puerto Rico, they sailed northwest along the great chain of Bahama Islands, known then as the Lucayos.

Herrera wrote that on 27 March 1513, Easter Sunday, they sighted land he described as an island that was unfamiliar to the sailors on the expedition. Because many Spanish seamen were acquainted with the Bahamas, which had been depopulated by slaving ventures, some scholars believe that this &quot;island&quot; was actually Florida, as it was thought to be an island for several years after its formal discovery. Historian and marine archeologist Samuel Turner says that Ponce de León sighted the Florida coast on Easter Sunday of 1513, and that many historians have misinterpreted Herrera&#x27;s text by claiming it was one of the Bahama Islands Ponce saw on that date. Turner writes that because Beimini is described as an island, they assume that Herrera refers to one of the Bahama Islands, variously proposing that this &quot;island&quot; was Eleuthera, Man-O-War Cay, Great Abaco, or Grand Bahama.

For the next several days the fleet crossed open water until 2 April, when they sighted land which Ponce de León believed was another island. He named it &quot;La Florida&quot; in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called &quot;Pascua Florida&quot; (Festival of Flowers). The following day they came ashore to seek information and take possession of this new land.

The precise location of their landing on the Florida coast has been disputed for many years. Some historians believe it occurred at or near St. Augustine, but others prefer a more southerly landing at a small harbor now called Ponce de León Inlet. Some believe that Ponce came ashore even farther south near the present location of Melbourne Beach, a hypothesis first proposed by Douglas Peck, an amateur historian who attempted to reconstruct the track of the voyage sailing in his 33-foot Bermuda-rigged sailboat. Samuel Turner dismisses this theory, pointing out that Ponce&#x27;s fleet encountered a storm on 30 March, sailing in it for two days, with no indication in Herrera of the wind direction or how strong it was, and that this fact complicates any attempt to reconstruct the voyage (not to mention that Peck&#x27;s boat was nothing like the Spanish ships). On 2 April, after the weather improved, Ponce&#x27;s pilot Anton de Alaminos took a navigational fix by the sun at noon in nine fathoms of water with a quadrant or a mariner&#x27;s astrolabe, and obtained a reading of 30 degrees, 8 minutes of latitude, the coordinate recorded in the ship&#x27;s log when it was closest to the landing site, as reported by Herrera (who had the original logbook) in 1601. This latitude corresponds to a spot north of St. Augustine between what is now the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve and Ponte Vedra Beach. The expedition sailed north for the remainder of the day before anchoring for the night and rowing ashore the next morning.

After remaining in the area of their first landing for about five days, the ships turned south for further exploration of the coast. On 8 April they encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards and forced them to seek anchorage. The smallest ship, the &quot;San Cristobal&quot;, was carried out of sight and lost for two days. This was the first known encounter by Europeans with the Gulf Stream, occurring where it reaches maximum force between the Florida coast and the Bahamas. Because of the powerful boost provided by the current, it would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish West Indies bound for Europe.

They continued down the coast hugging the shore to avoid the strong head current. By 4 May the fleet reached and named Biscayne Bay. They took on water at an island they named Santa Marta (now Key Biscayne) and explored the Tequesta Miami mound town at the mouth of the Miami River. The Tequesta people did not engage the Spanish, but instead evacuated into the coastal woodlands. On 15 May they left Biscayne Bay and sailed along the Florida Keys, looking for a passage to head north and explore the west coast of the Florida peninsula.

From a distance the Keys reminded Ponce de León of men who were suffering, so he named them &quot;Los Martires&quot; (the Martyrs). Eventually they found a gap in the reefs and sailed &quot;to the north and other times to the northeast&quot; until they reached the Florida mainland on 23 May, where they encountered the Calusa, who refused to trade and drove off the Spanish ships by surrounding them with warriors in sea canoes armed with long bows.
Again, the exact site of their landfall is controversial. The vicinity of Charlotte Harbor is the most commonly identified spot, while some assert a landing further north at Tampa Bay or even Pensacola. Other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was Cape Romano or Cape Sable. Here Ponce de León anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships. They were approached by Calusa, who initially indicated an interest in trading, but relations soon turned hostile.

Several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides. The Spaniards captured eight Calusa (four men and four women) and seized five war canoes abandoned by the retreating warriors. On 5 June, a final confrontation occurred when some 80 Calusa warriors attacked a party of eleven Spanish sailors. The result was a standoff with neither party willing to come within striking distance of their opponents&#x27; weapons.

On 14 June they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives. They reached the Dry Tortugas on 21 June. There they captured giant sea turtles, Caribbean monk seals, and thousands of seabirds. From these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around Cuba and return home to Puerto Rico. Failing to take into account the powerful currents pushing them eastward, they struck the northeast shore of Cuba and were initially confused about their location.

Once they regained their bearings, the fleet retraced their route east along the Florida Keys and around the Florida peninsula, reaching Grand Bahama on 8 July. They were surprised to come across another Spanish ship, piloted by Diego Miruelo, who was either on a slaving voyage or had been sent by Diego Colón to spy on Ponce de León. Shortly thereafter Miruelo&#x27;s ship was wrecked in a storm and Ponce de León rescued the stranded crew.

From here the little fleet disbanded. Ponce de León tasked the &quot;Santa Maria&quot; with further exploration while he returned home with the rest of crew. Ponce de León reached Puerto Rico on 19 October 1513 after having been away for almost eight months. The other ship, after further explorations returned safely on 20 February 1514.

Although Ponce de León is widely credited with the discovery of Florida, he almost certainly was not the first European to reach the peninsula. Spanish slave expeditions had been regularly raiding the Bahamas since 1494 and there is some evidence that one or more of these slavers made it as far as the shores of Florida. Another piece of evidence that others came before Ponce de León is the Cantino Map from 1502, which shows a peninsula near Cuba that looks like Florida&#x27;s and includes characteristic place names.

====Fountain of Youth====
According to a popular legend, Ponce de León discovered Florida while searching for the Fountain of Youth. Though stories of vitality-restoring waters were known on both sides of the Atlantic long before Ponce de León, the story of his searching for them was not attached to him until after his death. In his &quot;Historia general y natural de las Indias&quot; of 1535, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of &quot;Bimini&quot;.

A similar account appears in Francisco López de Gómara&#x27;s &quot;Historia general de las Indias&quot; of 1551. Then in 1575, Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the Native Americans of Florida for 17 years, published his memoir in which he locates the waters called the River Jordan (flowing out of Eden) in Florida, and says that Ponce de León was supposed to have looked for them there.

Though Fontaneda doubted that Ponce de León had really gone to Florida looking for the waters, the account was included in the &quot;Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos&quot; of Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas of 1615. Most historians hold that the search for gold and the expansion of the Spanish Empire were far more imperative than any potential search for such a fountain.

===Between voyages===
Upon his return to Puerto Rico, Ponce de León found the island in turmoil. A party of Caribs from a neighboring island had attacked the settlement of Caparra, killed several Spaniards and burned it to the ground. Ponce de León&#x27;s own house was destroyed and his family narrowly escaped. Colón used the attack as a pretext for renewing hostilities against the local Taíno tribes. The explorer suspected that Colón was working to further undermine his position on the island and perhaps even to take his claims for the newly discovered Florida.

Ponce de León decided he should return to Spain and personally report the results of his recent expedition. He left Puerto Rico in April 1514 and was warmly received by Ferdinand when he arrived at court in Valladolid. There he was knighted, and given a personal coat of arms, becoming the first conquistador to receive these honors. He also visited Casa de Contratación in Seville, which was the central bureaucracy and clearinghouse for all of Spain&#x27;s activities in the New World. The Casa took detailed notes of his discoveries and added them to the Padrón Real, a master map which served as the basis for official navigation charts provided to Spanish captains and pilots.

During his stay in Spain, a new contract was drawn up for Ponce de León confirming his rights to settle and govern Beniny and Florida, which was then presumed to be an island. In addition to the usual directions for sharing gold and other valuables with the king, the contract was one of the first to stipulate that the Requerimiento was to be read to the inhabitants of the islands prior to their conquest. Ponce de León was also ordered to organize an armada for the purpose of attacking and subduing the Caribs, who continued to attack Spanish settlements in the Caribbean.
Three ships were purchased for his armada and after repairs and provisioning Ponce de León left Spain on 14 May 1515 with his little fleet. The record of his activities against the Caribs is vague. There was one engagement in Guadeloupe on his return to the area and possibly two or three other encounters. The campaign came to an abrupt end in 1516 when Ferdinand died. The king had been a strong supporter and Ponce de León felt it was imperative he return to Spain and defend his privileges and titles. He did receive assurances of support from Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the regent appointed to govern Castile, but it was nearly two years before he was able to return home to Puerto Rico.

Meanwhile, there had been at least two unauthorized voyages to &quot;his&quot; Florida both ending in repulsion by the native Calusa or Tequesta warriors. Ponce de León realized he had to act soon if he was to maintain his claim.

===Last voyage to Florida===
In early 1521, Ponce de León organized a colonizing expedition consisting of some 200 men, including priests, farmers and artisans, 50 horses and other domestic animals, and farming implements carried on two ships. The expedition landed somewhere on the coast of southwest Florida, likely in the vicinity of Charlotte Harbor or the Caloosahatchee River, areas which Ponce de León had visited in his earlier voyage to Florida.

Before the settlement could be established, the colonists were attacked by the Calusa, the indigenous people who dominated southern Florida and whose principal town was nearby. Ponce de León was mortally wounded in the skirmish when, historians believe, an arrow poisoned with the sap of the manchineel tree struck his thigh.

The expedition immediately abandoned the colonization attempt and sailed to Havana, Cuba, where Ponce de León soon died of his wounds. He was buried in Puerto Rico, in the crypt of San José Church from 1559 to 1836, when his remains were exhumed and transferred to the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. Inscribed on the side panel of the altar-tomb in his mausoleum are these words in Latin: &quot;MOLE SVB HAC FORTIS REQVIESCVNT OSSA LEONIS OVI VICIT FACTIS NOMINA MAGNA SVIS&quot; (&quot;Under this structure rest the bones of a lion, more for his great deeds than for his name&quot;).

<text>A culture hero is a mythological hero specific to some group (cultural, ethnic, religious, etc.) who changes the world through invention or discovery. Although many culture heroes help with the creation of the world, most culture heroes are important because of their effect on the world after creation. A typical culture hero might be credited as the discoverer of fire, agriculture, songs, tradition, law, or religion, and is usually the most important legendary figure of a people, sometimes as the founder of its ruling dynasty.

== Culture heroes in mythology ==

=== History of a culture hero ===
The term &quot;culture hero&quot; was originated by historian Kurt Breysig, who used the German word &quot;heilbringer,&quot; which translates to &quot;savior&quot;. Over the years, &quot;culture hero&quot; has been interpreted in many ways. Older interpretations by Breysig, Paul Ehrenreich, and Wilhelm Schmidt thought that the journeys of culture heroes were ways in which humans could attempt to understand things in nature, such as the rising and setting of the sun, or the movement of the stars and constellations. Eventually, their interpretations were rejected and replaced with newer interpretations by scholars such as Hermann Baumann, Adolf E. Jensen, Mircea Eliade, Otto Zerries, Raffaele Pettazzoni, and Harry Tegnaeus, which evolved as a result of having more access to ethnological data, creating the present version of the culture hero.

=== Creation of a culture hero ===
Culture heroes can perform unbelievable tasks in life because they are different from normal people. Typically, a culture hero&#x27;s power originates from birth, an event that rarely occurs regularly. When their mothers conceive, it is generally not by her husband but by the wind, or a drop of water. Newborn culture heroes are either very powerful babies or full-grown men, an attribute highlighting their exceptional nature.

=== Characteristics of a culture hero ===
A culture hero generally goes on an adventure (often called the hero&#x27;s journey) that does one of the following:

* Saves humankind from a dangerous monster
* Shapes the world (rivers, mountains, etc...)
* Creates distinction between humans and animals
* Makes economic life possible for humans (teaching the humans)
* Sets the origin of death

Because culture heroes often possess shapeshifting abilities, they often can transform from man to animal and back. The typical culture hero possesses both admirable and deplorable personal qualities, a combination that is often responsible for sending him on his great journey. Some culture heroes are tricksters, acting selfishly and ultimately benefiting mankind only unintentionally.

=== Disappearance of a culture hero ===
Once culture heroes have finished their task, they usually disappear. In many stories, the hero is transformed back to his origin, and his death place is marked with a stone, tree, or body of water. The end of a culture hero&#x27;s life will generally lead to the creation of something else, such as a river, constellation, food, animals, and the moon and sun. Culture heroes are the etiological explanation for many humans about the things occurring in their daily lives.

=== Examples ===

In many Native American mythologies and beliefs, the coyote spirit stole fire from the gods (or stars or sun) and is more of a trickster than a culture hero. Natives from the Southeastern United States typically saw a rabbit trickster/culture hero, and Pacific Northwest native stories often feature a raven in this role: in some stories, Raven steals fire from his uncle Beaver and eventually gives it to humans. In Greek mythology Prometheus has a similar role. The Western African trickster spider Anansi is also common. In Norse mythology, Odin steals the mead of poetry from Jötunheim and is credited as the discoverer of the runes.

<doc id="143366" wikidata="Q775332" url="?curid=143366" title="Fountain of Youth">
<text>The Fountain of Youth is a mythical spring which supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted around the world for thousands of years, appearing in the writings of Herodotus (5th century BC), in the Alexander Romance (3rd century AD), and in the stories of Prester John (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters also featured prominently among the people of the Caribbean during the Age of Exploration (early 16th century); they spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of Bimini. Based on these many legends, explorers and adventurers looked for the elusive Fountain of Youth or some other remedy to aging, generally associated with magic waters. These waters might have been a river, a spring or any other water-source said to reverse the aging process and to cure sickness when swallowed or bathed in.

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it became associated with the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, the first Governor of Puerto Rico. Ponce de León was supposedly searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to Florida in 1513. Legend has it that Native Americans told Ponce de León that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini.

==Early accounts==
Herodotus mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the Macrobians, which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.

A story of the &quot;Water of Life&quot; appears in the Eastern versions of the Alexander romance, which describes Alexander the Great and his servant crossing the Land of Darkness to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of Al-Khidr, a sage who appears also in the Qur&#x27;an. Arabic and Aljamiado versions of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; were very popular in Spain during and after the period of Moorish rule, and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy &quot;The Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot;, which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern Kollam) in India. Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly Gothic art, appearing for example on the ivory Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European Age of Exploration.
European iconography is fairly consistent, as the Cranach painting and mirror-case &quot; Fons Juventutis&quot; (The Fountain of Youth) from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. Eternal youth is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the philosopher&#x27;s stone, universal panaceas, and the elixir of life are common throughout Eurasia and elsewhere.

An additional inspiration may have been taken from the account of the Pool of Bethesda where a paralytic man was healed in the Gospel of John. In the possibly interpolated , the pool is said to be periodically stirred by an angel, upon which the first person to step into the water would be healed of whatever afflicted them.

==Bimini==

According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the Arawaks in Hispaniola, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of &quot;Beimeni&quot; or &quot;Beniny&quot; (whence Bimini), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called &quot;la Vieja&quot; during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the Maya. This land also became confused with the Boinca or Boyuca mentioned by Juan de Solis, although Solis&#x27;s navigational data placed it in the Gulf of Honduras. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself. Sequene, an Arawak chief from Cuba, purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water mangrove swamp that covers of the shoreline of North Bimini is &quot;The Healing Hole&quot;, a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, mineral-laden fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and magnesium. Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health, is present in large quantities in the sea water. While it is not known whether any legend about healing waters was widespread among the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, the Italian-born chronicler Peter Martyr attached such a story drawn from ancient and medieval European sources to his account of the 1514 voyage of Juan Diaz de Solis in a letter to the Pope in 1516, though he did not believe the stories and was dismayed that so many others did.

==Ponce de León==

In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the conquistador Juan Ponce de León. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of &quot;Beniny&quot;. Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the Maya in Yucatán, the nameand legends about Boinca&#x27;s fountain of youthbecame associated with the Bahamas instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.

The connection was made in Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés&#x27;s &quot;Historia general y natural de las Indias&quot; of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness. Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo&#x27;s account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts. A similar account appears in Francisco López de Gómara&#x27;s &quot;Historia general de las Indias&quot; of 1551. In the &quot;Memoir&quot; of Hernando d&#x27;Escalante Fontaneda in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas&#x27; unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World. Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his &quot;Memoir&quot; he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls &quot;Jordan&quot; and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda&#x27;s story included in his &quot;Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano&quot;. Herrera states that local caciques paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume &quot;all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children.&quot; Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every &quot;river, brook, lagoon or pool&quot; along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
The city of St. Augustine, Florida, is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as &quot;Diamond Lil&quot;.

Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo. McConnell later claimed to have &quot;discovered&quot; on the grounds a large cross made of coquina rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city&#x27;s residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927.

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell&#x27;s attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state&#x27;s most successful tourist attractions. The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the Smithsonian Institution. These digs revealed a large number of Christianized Timucua burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the Mission Nombre de Dios, this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés&#x27;s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate Ponce de León and Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, the founder of St. Augustine. Exhibits of Timucua and Spanish heritage are also on display.

<text>Egrets ( ) are herons, generally long-legged wading birds, that have white or buff plumage, developing fine plumes (usually milky white) during the breeding season. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from herons and have the same build.

==Biology==

Many egrets are members of the genera &quot;Egretta&quot; or &quot;Ardea&quot;, which also contain other species named as herons rather than egrets. The distinction between a heron and an egret is rather vague, and depends more on appearance than biology. The word &quot;egret&quot; comes from the French word &quot;aigrette&quot; that means both &quot;silver heron&quot; and &quot;brush&quot;, referring to the long, filamentous feathers that seem to cascade down an egret&#x27;s back during the breeding season (also called &quot;egrets&quot;).

Several of the egrets have been reclassified from one genus to another in recent years; the great egret, for example, has been classified as a member of either &quot;Casmerodius&quot;, &quot;Egretta&quot;, or &quot;Ardea&quot;.

In the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries, some of the world&#x27;s egret species were endangered by relentless plume hunting, since hat makers in Europe and the United States demanded large numbers of egret plumes, leading to breeding birds being killed in many places around the world.

Several &quot;Egretta&quot; species, including the eastern reef egret, the reddish egret, and the western reef egret, have two distinct colours, one of which is just white. The little blue heron has all-white juvenile plumage.

==Species in taxonomic order==

* Great egret or great white egret, &quot;Ardea alba&quot;
* Great blue heron, &quot;Ardea herodias&quot;
* Intermediate egret, &quot;Mesophoyx intermedia&quot;
* Western cattle egret, &quot;Ardea ibis&quot; 
* Little egret &quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;
* Snowy egret, &quot;Egretta thula&quot;
* Reddish egret, &quot;Egretta rufescens&quot;
* Slaty egret, &quot;Egretta vinaceigula&quot;
* Black egret, &quot;Egretta ardesiaca&quot;
* Chinese egret, &quot;Egretta eulophotes&quot;
* Eastern reef egret or Pacific reef heron, &quot;Egretta sacra&quot;
* Western reef egret or Western reef heron, &quot;Egretta gularis&quot;
* Eastern cattle egret, &quot;Ardea coromanda&quot;
==Habitat==

Egrets inhabit all continents; although they typically avoid the coldest regions, arid deserts, and very high mountains. They hunt and live in both saltwater and freshwater marshes.

<doc id="143373" wikidata="Q42956" url="?curid=143373" title="Harbin">
<text>Harbin is the capital of Heilongjiang, China. It is the largest city of Heilongjiang, as well as being the city with the second-largest urban population (after Shenyang, Liaoning province) and largest metropolitan population (urban and rural regions together) in Northeast China. Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2020 census. The built-up area of Harbin (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,841,929 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,009,854, making it one of the 100 largest urban areas in the world. Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.

Several differerent etymologies have been offered for the city&#x27;s name. The city government says the name means &quot;swan&quot; in the Jurchen language, and other sources says that it comes from a Manchu word meaning &quot;a place for drying fishing nets&quot;. The settlement grew from a small rural fishing village on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Russian-built Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a settlement inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire. In the 1920s, the city was considered China&#x27;s fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. From 1932 until 1945, Harbin was the largest city in the Imperial Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Being well known for its historical Russian legacy and architecture, the city is famed for its European influence and serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. 

Harbin is one of the top 50 cities and metropolitan areas in the world by scientific research output as tracked by the Nature Index. The city hosts several major universities in Northeast China, including Harbin Engineering, Harbin Medical, Northeast Agricultural, Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin Normal, Northeast Forestry, and Heilongjiang. Notably, Harbin Institute of Technology is consistently ranked as one of the best universities in the world for engineering.

Harbin was voted &quot;China Top Tourist City&quot; by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004. Known for its bitterly cold winters, Harbin is heralded as the &quot;Ice City&quot; () for its winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. The city has hosted the 1996 Winter Asian Games, the 2009 Winter Universiade, and the 2025 Asian Winter Games. 

==History==
===Early history===
Human settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115–1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region. In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin&#x27;s capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today&#x27;s Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda&#x27;s death, the new emperor Wanyang Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin Empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of the Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang&#x27;s successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about from present-day Acheng&#x27;s central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the . The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.
Many of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.

After the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211–1234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 19th century, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city&#x27;s present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.

===International city===
A small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szydłowski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway, substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian naval base of Port Arthur (Lüshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a boomtown, growing into a city within five years. The Russian-speaking settlers in Harbin came from all over the Russian Empire, including Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Georgians, and Tatars, in addition to Russians, eventually making Harbin a Russian town, with the majority of population coming from the south of the European Russia.

The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian-Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin &quot;the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned—well before the October Revolution—by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners&quot;, giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms that soon turned Manchuria into the &quot;breadbasket of China&quot; while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize. Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria. A sign of Harbin&#x27;s wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play &quot;K zvezdam&quot; by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.

During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia&#x27;s defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food, and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.

The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic, which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh were built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine, and medical education.

The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin&#x27;s population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians – 34,313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) – 23,537, Jews – 5,032, Poles – 2556, Japanese – 696, Germans – 564, Tatars – 234, Latvians – 218, Georgians – 183, Estonians – 172, Lithuanians – 142, Armenians – 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68,549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin&#x27;s population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them being ethnic Russians.

Immediately after the February Revolution of 1917 Harbin Soviet was organized. It sought to seize control over the Chinese Eastern Railway and to defend Russian citizens in Manchuria. The Bolshevik Martemyan Ryutin was the chairman of the Harbin Soviet.

After Russia&#x27;s Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, the new Soviet government in Russia recognized the Harbin Soviet as its representation in Manchuria and placed Russian citizens in Manchuria under its protection. Subsequently, the Harbin Soviet requested recognition of the local &quot;taotai&quot;. On 12 December 1917, Bolsheviks seized control over the Harbin Soviet, pressuring Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries to leave the body. Through &quot;Golos Truda&quot; the Harbin Soviet declared itself as the government of the area. On 18 December 1917, the Harbin Soviet declared the Chinese Eastern Railway administrator Dmitry Horvat dismissed and directed its militia to seize control of the railway installations. The Bolshevik militia was soon confronted by Chinese troops and Horvat loyalists, who disarmed and deported some 1,560 Bolshevik fighters. Ryutin went underground.

In 1920 more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian émigrés and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian émigrés who arrived in Harbin was: &quot;Unlike the Russian émigrés who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.&quot; The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. The Russian &quot;Harbintsy&quot; community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin&#x27;s Russians were wealthy, which sometimes confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book &quot;Wanderings in North China&quot; writing the Russian &quot;ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards&quot;, leading him to wonder how they had achieved this &quot;deceptive appearance&quot;.

The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department. Between 1925 and 1928 the university&#x27;s Rector was Leonid Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak&#x27;s government and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

The Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters, and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937 and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin&#x27;s poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereleshin to leave Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling &quot;Nash put&#x27;&quot;, the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party &quot;the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen&quot;. Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper &quot;Rubezh&quot; was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine – yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese businesspeople of Harbin.

In the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars&#x27; recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin&#x27;s large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Russian Republic in 1920, leaving many Russians stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would employ only Russian or Chinese nationals, the émigrés were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.

The Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the &quot;Young Marshal&quot; seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. The Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept the restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.

===Japanese invasion period===

Japan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours, the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.

With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called &quot;pacification of Manchukuo&quot; began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the &quot;Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army&quot;. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately south of Harbin urban area at that time.
Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens, including men, women, and children,—from which around 600 every year were provided by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;—died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing &quot;unreliable&quot; Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments.

Some others were Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders from the colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after being infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs.

Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated. Others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, Douglas MacArthur, before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for their biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Forces.
Chinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army—which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CCP Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.
Under the Manchukuo régime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48,133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as &quot;Japanese spies&quot;). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.

Many of Harbin&#x27;s Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army-sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin&#x27;s Russian community as its thugs began to harass and sometimes kill those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan&#x27;s largest synagogue.

===After World War II===

The Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Nationalist Government, whose troops stopped short of the city. The city&#x27;s administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who had been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated from 1950 to 1954 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.

Harbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted. On 23 August 1966, Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying the church. As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin&#x27;s economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha&#x27;s National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).
National economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International Economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.

On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin&#x27;s total population to 9.47 million.

Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.

A memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea Itō Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn&#x27;s memorial hall.

===Cuisine===
Harbin is renowned for its culinary tradition. The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.

One of the most famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin that originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (). It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.

Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi. The village is now Demoli Service Area on Harbin-Tongjiang Expressway. Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Pork with Vermicelli, and quick-boil pork with Chinese sauerkraut are also typical authentic local dishes.

Since Russia had a strong influence on Harbin&#x27;s history, the local cuisine of Harbin also contains Russian-style dishes and flavor. There are several authentic Russian-style restaurants in Harbin, especially alongside the Zhongyang Street.

A popular regional specialty is Harbin-style smoked savory red sausage. This product, which is similar to mild Lithuanian and German sausages, tend to be much more of European flavours than other Chinese sausages. In 1900, Russian merchant Ivan Yakovlevich Churin founded a branch in Harbin, which was named Churin Foreign trading company (; ) selling imported clothes, leather boots, canned foods, vodka, etc., and began to expand sales network in other cities in Manchuria. The influx of Europeans through the Trans-Siberian Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, increased demand of European flavor food. In 1909, Churin&#x27;s Sausage Factory was founded, and first produced European flavor sausage with the manufacturing process of Lithuanian staff. Since then, European style sausage has become a specialty of the city.

A Russian style large round bread 大列巴 dà liě ba, derived from the Russian word &quot;&quot; for &quot;bread&quot; is also produced in Harbin&#x27;s bakeries. Dalieba is a miche like sourdough bread. First introduced to the locals by a Russian baker, it has been sold in bakeries in Harbin for over a hundred years. Dalieba&#x27;s sour and chewy taste is different from other traditional soft and fluffy Asian style breads in other parts of China.

Kvass, a Russia-originated fermented beverage made from black or regular rye bread, is also popular in Harbin.

While there are ice sculptures throughout the city, there are two main exhibition areas: enormous snow sculptures at Sun Island (Taiyang Dao, a AAAAA-rated recreational area on the opposite side of the Songhua River from the city) and the separate &quot;Ice and Snow World&quot; that operates each night with lights switched on, illuminating the sculptures from both inside and outside. Ice and Snow World features illuminated full-size buildings made from blocks of 2–3 feet thick crystal clear ice directly taken from the Songhua River, which passes through the city. The sculptures inside the exhibition ground takes 15,000 workers to work for 16 days. In early December, ice artisans cut 120,000 cubic metres (4.2 million cubic feet) of ice blocks from Songhua river&#x27;s frozen surface as raw materials for the ice sculptures&#x27; show. Massive ice buildings, large-scale snow sculptures, ice slides, festival food and drinks can also be found in several parks and major avenues in the city. Winter activities in the festival include Yabuli Alpine Skiing, snow mobile driving, winter-swimming in Songhua River, and the traditional ice-lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden, which was first held in 1963.

<doc id="143377" wikidata="Q192218" url="?curid=143377" title="Ted Bundy">
<text>Theodore Robert Bundy (; November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped, and murdered dozens of young women and girls during the 1970s. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders. The total number of his victims is likely to be higher.

Bundy&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; typically consisted of simulating having a physical impairment to convince his target that he was in need of assistance or duping her into believing he was an authority figure. He would then lure his victim to a vehicle parked in a more secluded area, at which point he would bludgeon her unconscious, then restrain her with handcuffs before driving his victim to a remote location to be sexually assaulted and killed. 

Bundy frequently revisited the bodies of those he abducted, grooming and performing sex acts on the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made further interactions impossible. He decapitated at least twelve of his victims, keeping their severed heads as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, Bundy broke into homes at night and bludgeoned, maimed, strangled and sexually assaulted his victims in their sleep.

In 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, Bundy engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders, before being recaptured in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials, and was executed in the electric chair at Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989.

Biographer Ann Rule characterized Bundy as &quot;a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human&#x27;s pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after.&quot; He once described himself as &quot;the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you&#x27;ll ever meet,&quot; a statement with which attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed. She wrote that &quot;Ted was the very definition of heartless evil.&quot;

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Ted Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (1924–2012) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers in Burlington, Vermont. His biological father&#x27;s identity has never been confirmed; his original birth certificate apparently assigns paternity to a salesman and United States Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall, though a copy of it listed his father as unknown. Louise claimed she met a war veteran named Jack Worthington, who abandoned her soon after she became pregnant. Census records reveal that several men by the name of John Worthington and Lloyd Marshall lived near Louise when Bundy was conceived. Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy was sired by Louise&#x27;s own father, Samuel Cowell. However, in the 2020 documentary film &quot;Crazy, Not Insane&quot;, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis claimed she received a sample of Bundy&#x27;s blood and that a DNA test had confirmed that he was not the product of incest.

For the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the Roxborough neighborhood of Philadelphia with his maternal grandparents, Samuel Knecht Cowell (1898–1983) and Eleanor Miriam Longstreet (1895–1971). The couple raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at that time. Family, friends and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Bundy eventually discovered the truth about his family, although his recollections of the circumstances varied; he told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a &quot;bastard,&quot; but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he had found the certificate himself. Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew Bundy personally, wrote that he did not find out about his true parentage until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont. Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never telling him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover the truth about his paternity for himself.

Bundy occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Louise&#x27;s younger sister, Julia Cowell, recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and her three-year-old nephew standing by the bed, smiling. In some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents and told Rule that he &quot;identified with,&quot; &quot;respected&quot; and &quot;clung to&quot; his grandfather Samuel. 

In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel was a tyrannical bully who beat his wife and dog, swung neighborhood cats by their tails and expressed racist and xenophobic attitudes. In one instance, Samuel reportedly threw Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping. He would sometimes speak aloud to unseen presences, and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of Bundy&#x27;s paternity was raised. Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.

These descriptions of Bundy&#x27;s grandparents have been questioned in more recent investigations. Some locals in Roxborough remembered Samuel as a &quot;fine man&quot; and expressed bewilderment at the reports of him being violent. &quot;The characterization that [Sam] was a raging alcoholic and animal abuser was a convenient characterization used to make people justify why Ted was the way he was,&quot; said one of Bundy&#x27;s cousins. &quot;From my limited exposure to him, nothing could be farther from the truth. His daughters loved him dearly and had nothing but fond memories of him.&quot; In addition, Louise&#x27;s sister, Audrey Cowell, stated that their mother could not leave her home because she suffered a stroke due to being overweight and was not mentally ill.
In 1950, Louise changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson and, at the urging of multiple family members, left Philadelphia with Ted to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in Tacoma, Washington. In 1951, Louise met Johnny Culpepper Bundy (1921–2007), a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma&#x27;s First Methodist Church. They married later that year and Johnny formally adopted Ted. Johnny and Louise conceived four children together, and though Johnny tried to include his adopted son in camping trips and other family activities, Bundy remained distant from him. Bundy would later complain to a girlfriend that Johnny &quot;was not his real father, &quot;wasn&#x27;t very bright&quot; and &quot;didn&#x27;t make much money.&quot;

Bundy varied his recollections of Tacoma in later years. To Michaud and Aynesworth, he described roaming his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women. To attorney and author Polly Nelson, he said that he perused detective magazines and crime novels for stories that involved sexual violence, particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed women. In a letter to Rule, however, he asserted that he &quot;never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought that anyone would.&quot; He once told Michaud that he would consume large quantities of alcohol and &quot;canvass the community&quot; late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or &quot;whatever [else] could be seen.&quot; Psychologist Al Carlisle claimed that Bundy &quot;started fantasizing about women he saw while window peeping or elsewhere [and] mimicking the accents of some politicians he listened to on the radio. In essence, he was fantasizing about being someone else, someone important.&quot;

Bundy&#x27;s childhood Tacoma neighbor, Sandi Holt, described him as a bully and a &quot;mean-spirited kid&quot;. &quot;He liked to terrify people,&quot; Holt later said. &quot;He liked to be in charge. He liked to inflict pain and suffering and fear.&quot; She also alleged that Bundy engaged in animal cruelty: &quot;He hung one of the stray cats in the neighborhood from one of the clothes lines in the backyard, doused it in lighter fluid and set it on fire and I heard that cat squealing.&quot; She claimed that Bundy would take younger children in the neighborhood into the woods and terrorize them. &quot;He&#x27;d take them out there and strip them down, take their clothes,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#x27;d hear them screaming for blocks, I mean no matter where we were here, we could hear them screaming.&quot; Holt added that Bundy built makeshift punji traps around his neighborhood, injuring at least one girl. &quot;One little girl went over the top of one of Ted&#x27;s tiger traps and got the whole side of her leg slit open with the sharpened point of the stick that she landed on.&quot;

Accounts of Bundy&#x27;s social life also varied. He told journalists Michaud and Aynesworth that he &quot;chose to be alone&quot; as an adolescent because he was unable to understand interpersonal relationships; he also claimed to have no natural sense of how to develop friendships. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what made people want to be friends,&quot; Bundy claimed. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what underlay social interactions.&quot; &quot;Some people perceived me as being shy and introverted,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t go to dances. I didn&#x27;t go on the beer drinking outings. I was a pretty, you might call me straight, but not a social outcast in any way.&quot; Classmates from Woodrow Wilson High School, however, told Rule that Bundy was &quot;well known and well liked&quot; there, &quot;a medium-sized fish in a large pond.&quot; His only significant athletic avocation was downhill skiing, which he pursued enthusiastically with stolen equipment and forged lift tickets. During high school, Bundy was arrested at least twice on suspicion of burglary and motor vehicle theft. At age 18 the details of the incidents were expunged from his record, as is customary in Washington and many other states.

=== University years ===
After graduating from high school in 1965, Bundy attended the University of Puget Sound (UPS) for one year before transferring to the University of Washington (UW) to study Chinese. In 1967 he became romantically involved with a UW classmate, Diane Edwards (identified in Bundy biographies by several pseudonyms, most commonly Stephanie Brooks). Bundy later described Edwards as &quot;the only woman I ever really loved.&quot;

In early 1968, Bundy dropped out of college and worked a series of minimum-wage jobs. He also volunteered at the Seattle office of Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s presidential campaign and became Arthur Fletcher&#x27;s driver and bodyguard during Fletcher&#x27;s campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Washington State. Edwards graduated in the spring of 1968 and left Washington for San Francisco. Bundy visited her later that year after he earned a scholarship to study Chinese at Stanford University that summer.

In August, Bundy attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. Shortly thereafter, Edwards ended their relationship and returned to her family home in California, frustrated by what she described as Bundy&#x27;s immaturity and lack of ambition. Lewis would later pinpoint this crisis as &quot;probably the pivotal time in his development.&quot; Devastated by the breakup, Bundy traveled to Colorado and then farther east, visiting relatives in Arkansas and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at Temple University. During his studies, he frequently visited New York City, where he was drawn to pornography. He immersed himself in violent pornographic literature while nursing his wounds from the breakup. It was also at this time in early 1969, Rule believed, that Bundy discovered his true parentage in Vermont.

Bundy returned to Washington in the fall of 1969, when he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in Bundy literature as Meg Anders, Beth Archer or Liz Kendall), a single mother from Ogden, Utah, who worked as a secretary at the UW School of Medicine. Their tumultuous relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976. Bundy became a father figure to Kloepfer&#x27;s daughter Molly, who was three years old when he started dating her mother; he remained in her life until she was aged 10, after he had been arrested. As an adult, Molly wrote of incidents beginning at age 7 in which Bundy was abusive or sexually inappropriate with her. Her accounts include Bundy hitting her in the face, knocking her down, putting her at risk of drowning, indecent exposure and sexual touching disguised as accidents or &quot;games&quot;.

In mid-1970, Bundy, now focused and goal-oriented, re-enrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major. He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors. In 1971, he took a job at Seattle&#x27;s Suicide Hotline Crisis Center. There, he met and worked alongside Ann Rule, a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies, &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot;. Rule saw nothing disturbing in Bundy&#x27;s personality at the time; she described him as &quot;kind, solicitous, and empathetic.&quot;

After graduating from UW in 1972, Bundy joined Governor Daniel J. Evans&#x27;s re-election campaign. Posing as a college student, he shadowed Evans&#x27; opponent, former governor Albert Rosellini, and recorded his stump speeches for analysis by Evans&#x27;s team. Evans subsequently appointed Bundy to the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee. After Evans was re-elected, Bundy was hired as an assistant to Ross Davis, Chairman of the Washington State Republican Party. Davis thought well of Bundy and described him as &quot;smart, aggressive ... and a believer in the system.&quot; In early 1973, despite mediocre LSAT scores, Bundy was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the University of Utah (U of U) on the strength of letters of recommendation from Evans, Davis and several UW psychology professors.

During a trip to California on Republican Party business in the summer of 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Edwards. She marveled at his transformation into a serious and dedicated professional, seemingly on the cusp of a significant legal and political career. Bundy continued to date Kloepfer as well; neither woman was aware of the other&#x27;s existence. In the fall of 1973, Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School, and continued courting Edwards, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée.

In January 1974, Bundy abruptly broke off all contact with Edwards; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. When she finally reached him by phone a month later, she demanded to know why he had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, &quot;Diane, I have no idea what you mean,&quot; and hung up. She never heard from him again. Bundy later explained, &quot;I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her&quot;; but Edwards concluded in retrospect that &quot;Ted&#x27;s high-power courtship in the latter part of 1973 had been deliberately planned, that he had waited all those years to be in a position of where he could make her fall in love with him, so that he could drop her, reject her, as she had rejected him.&quot; By then, Bundy had begun skipping classes at law school. By April, he had stopped attending entirely, as young women began to disappear in the Pacific Northwest.

=== First murders ===
There is no consensus as to when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. Bundy told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in Ocean City, New Jersey, in 1969, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City while visiting family in Philadelphia in 1969. Bundy hinted to homicide detective Robert Keppel that he committed a murder in Seattle in 1972 and another murder in 1973 that involved a hitchhiker near Tumwater, but he refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believed that he might have started killing as a teenager. Bundy&#x27;s earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974, when he was 27. By his own admission, he had by then mastered the necessary skills – in the era before DNA profiling – to leave minimal incriminating forensic evidence at crime scenes.

== Murder spree in the Western states ==
=== Washington, Oregon ===

Shortly after midnight on January 4, 1974, around the time that he terminated his relationship with Edwards, Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (often identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams and Terri Caldwell in Bundy literature), a dancer and student at UW in Seattle&#x27;s University District. After bludgeoning Sparks with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with the same rod causing extensive internal injuries and rupturing her bladder. Sparks remained unconscious in the hospital for ten days and although she survived, she was left with permanent brain damage with significant loss to her vision and hearing. In the early morning hours of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of 21-year-old Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse and boots, and carried her away. He later stated that he drove Healy to a secluded area, where he raped and murdered her before dumping her body.

During the first half of 1974, female college students disappeared at the rate of about one per month. On March 12, Donna Gail Manson, a 19-year-old student at Evergreen State College in Olympia, southwest of Seattle, left her dormitory to attend a jazz concert on campus but never arrived. Bundy claimed that he burned Manson&#x27;s skull in his girlfriend&#x27;s fireplace &quot;down to the last ash&quot; in &quot;a fit of... paranoia and cleanliness&quot;. On April 17, 18-year-old Susan Elaine Rancourt disappeared while on her way to her dorm room after an evening advisors&#x27; meeting at Central Washington State College in Ellensburg, southeast of Seattle. Two female Central Washington students later came forward to report encounters—one on the night of Rancourt&#x27;s disappearance, the other three nights earlier—with a man wearing a sling, who was asking for help carrying a load of books to his brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.

On May 6, Roberta Kathleen Parks, aged 22, left her dormitory at Oregon State University in Corvallis, south of Seattle, to have coffee with friends at the Memorial Union, but never arrived. Bundy claimed that he spotted Parks in the cafeteria and persuaded her to go with him to a bar. After they got into his car, he tied and gagged Parks and drove her back to Washington to be killed, raping her twice on the way. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen in the parking lot, talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. Bundy later stated he brought Ball back to his residence where they had a &quot;consensual&quot; sexual encounter before he strangled her while she was sleeping; although this failed to explain the damage done to her skull. Investigators from Seattle and King County grew increasingly concerned. There was no significant physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common apart from similar appearance: young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle.

In the early hours of June 11, 18-year-old UW student Georgann Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend&#x27;s dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing. Bundy later told Keppel that he lured Hawkins to his car and knocked her unconscious with a crowbar. After handcuffing her, he drove her to Issaquah, a suburb east of Seattle, where he strangled her and spent the entire night with her body. The next afternoon he returned to the UW alley and, in the very midst of a major crime scene investigation, located and gathered Hawkins&#x27; earrings and one of her shoes where he had left them in the adjoining parking lot and departed, unobserved. &quot;It was a feat so brazen,&quot; wrote Keppel, &quot;that it astonishes police even today.&quot; Bundy said he revisited Hawkins&#x27; corpse on three occasions.

After Hawkins&#x27; disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man on crutches, with a leg cast and carrying a briefcase, in an alley behind a nearby dormitory on the night of her disappearance. One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle. During this period, Bundy was working in Olympia as the assistant director of the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee, where he wrote a pamphlet for women on rape prevention. Later, he worked at the Department of Emergency Services (DES), a state government agency involved in the search for the missing women. At the DES he met and began dating Carole Ann Boone (1947–2018), a twice-divorced mother of two who would play an important role in the final phase of his life six years later.
Reports of the brutal attack on Sparks and the six missing women appeared prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. Pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, but the scarcity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police would not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: the disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work and were within a week of midterm or final exams. All of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans when they disappeared, and at many crime scenes there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.

The Washington and Oregon murders culminated on July 14 with the abductions in broad daylight of two women from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah. Four female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as &quot;Ted,&quot; he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Three refused; one accompanied him as far as his car, saw that there was no sailboat and fled. Three additional witnesses saw &quot;Ted&quot; approach Janice Ann Ott, 23, a probation caseworker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story and watched her leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud and FBI agent William Hagmaier that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund and that he forced one to watch as he assaulted and murdered the other, but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis on the eve of his execution.

King County police, finally armed with a detailed description of their suspect and his car, posted fliers throughout the Seattle area. A composite sketch was printed in regional newspapers and broadcast on local television stations. Kloepfer, Rule, a DES employee, and a UW psychology professor all recognized the profile, the sketch and the car, and reported Bundy as a possible suspect; but detectives—who were receiving up to 200 tips per day—thought it unlikely that a clean-cut law student with no adult criminal record could be the perpetrator. On September 6, two grouse hunters stumbled across the skeletal remains of Ott and Naslund near a service road in Issaquah, east of Lake Sammamish State Park. An extra femur and several vertebrae found at the site were later identified by Bundy as those of Hawkins. Six months later, forestry students from Green River Community College discovered the skulls and mandibles of Healy, Rancourt, Parks and Ball on Taylor Mountain, where Bundy frequently hiked, just east of Issaquah. Manson&#x27;s remains were never recovered.

=== Idaho, Utah, Colorado ===

In August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated &quot;at least a dozen&quot; other women. As he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, Bundy was devastated to find out that the other students &quot;had something, some intellectual capacity&quot; that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible. &quot;It was a great disappointment to me,&quot; he said. A new string of homicides began the following month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them shortly before his execution.

On September 2, Bundy raped and strangled a still-unidentified hitchhiker in Idaho, then returned the next day to photograph and dismember the corpse before disposing of the remains in a nearby river. On October 2, he abducted 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in Holladay, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Bundy confessed that Wilcox was walking on a poorly lit &quot;main roadway&quot; when he parked his car and forced her into an orchard. He then restrained her, put her into his vehicle and drove back to his apartment, where he allegedly kept her for 24 hours. Bundy informed investigators that her remains were buried near Capitol Reef National Park, some south of Holladay, but they were never found.

On October 18, Melissa Anne Smith—the 17-year-old daughter of the police chief of Midvale, another Salt Lake City suburb—disappeared after leaving a pizza parlor at around 9:30 p.m. Her nude body was found in a nearby mountainous area nine days later; post-mortem examination indicated that she may have remained alive for up to seven days following her disappearance. On October 31, Laura Ann Aime, also aged 17, disappeared south of Lehi after leaving a Halloween party by herself just after midnight; she was last seen trying to hitchhike. Her naked body was found by hikers to the northeast in American Fork Canyon on Thanksgiving Day. The medical examiner estimated that Aime had died on November 20; twenty days after her disappearance. Both Smith and Aime had been beaten, raped, sodomized and strangled with nylon stockings. Years later, Bundy described his post-mortem rituals with the corpses of Smith and Aime, including hair shampooing and application of makeup.

In the late afternoon of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, less than a mile from the Midvale restaurant where Smith was last seen. He identified himself as &quot;Officer Roseland&quot; of the Murray Police Department and told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car. He asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out to Bundy that he was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled onto the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the car door and escape.

Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school&#x27;s drama teacher and a student told police that &quot;a stranger&quot; had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from DaRonch&#x27;s wrist. Bundy eventually admitted to abducting Kent and keeping her at his apartment for a day, stating she was alive &quot;during half of it.&quot;

In November, Kloepfer called King County police a second time after reading that young women were disappearing in towns surrounding Salt Lake City. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify him from a photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy&#x27;s name was added to their list of suspects, but at that time no credible forensic evidence linked him to the Utah murders. In January 1975, Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent a week with Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.
In 1975, Bundy shifted much of his criminal activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. According to the coroner&#x27;s report, she had been killed by blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her assailant had slit her left earlobe and her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon.

On March 15, northeast of Snowmass Village, Vail ski instructor Julie Lyle Cunningham, aged 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her before sexually assaulting her at a secondary site near Rifle, west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.

Denise Lynn Oliverson, aged 25, disappeared near the Utah–Colorado border in Grand Junction on April 6 while riding her bicycle to her parents&#x27; house; her bike and sandals were found under a viaduct near a railroad bridge. Bundy stated he abducted Oliverson, killed her in his car near the Utah state line, and dumped her body in the Colorado River. This admission was supported by gas receipts, which showed that he was in the city on the same day that Oliverson went missing. On May 6, Bundy parked outside of the Alameda Junior High School in Pocatello, Idaho, north of Salt Lake City, and after seeing 12-year-old Lynette Dawn Culver walking along by herself, he lured her into his vehicle before driving her to his Holiday Inn hotel room. He then raped Culver and drowned her in the bathtub. He disposed of her body in the Snake River north of Pocatello. Bundy reportedly provided intimate details about Lynette&#x27;s personal life in his confession.
In mid-May, three of Bundy&#x27;s Washington State DES co-workers, including Boone, visited him in Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. He subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early-June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer made no mention of her multiple discussions with authorities in King County and Salt Lake County. Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student (known in various accounts as either Kim Andrews or Sharon Auer).

On June 28, 15-year-old Susan Curtis vanished from the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, south of Salt Lake City. Her murder became Bundy&#x27;s last confession, tape-recorded moments before he entered the execution chamber. The bodies of victims Wilcox, Kent, Cunningham, Oliverson, Culver and Curtis were never recovered. In August 1975, Bundy was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), although he was not an active participant in services and ignored most church restrictions. He would later be excommunicated by the LDS Church following his 1976 kidnapping conviction. When asked his religious preference after his arrest, Bundy answered &quot;Methodist,&quot; the religion of his childhood.

In Washington State, investigators were still struggling to analyze the Pacific Northwest murder spree that had ended as abruptly as it had begun. In an effort to make sense of an overwhelming mass of data, they resorted to the then-innovative strategy of compiling a database. They used the King County payroll computer, a &quot;huge, primitive machine&quot; by contemporary standards, but the only one available for their use. After inputting the many lists they had compiled—classmates and acquaintances of each victim, Volkswagen owners named &quot;Ted,&quot; known sex offenders and so on—they queried the computer for coincidences. Out of thousands of names, 26 turned up on four lists; one was Bundy. Detectives also manually compiled a list of their 100 &quot;best&quot; suspects, and Bundy was on that list as well. He was &quot;literally at the top of the pile&quot; of suspects when word came from Utah of his arrest.

== Arrest and first trial ==

On August 16, 1975, Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb. Hayward observed Bundy cruising a residential area in his Volkswagen Beetle during the pre-dawn hours, and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. He noticed that the Volkswagen&#x27;s front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy&#x27;s name from Kloepfer&#x27;s phone call a month later. In a search of Bundy&#x27;s apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful, where Kent had disappeared. Police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy, so he was released on his own recognizance. He later said that searchers missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.

Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle with two other detectives to interview Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy&#x27;s move to Utah, she had discovered objects that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t understand&quot; in her house and in Bundy&#x27;s apartment. These items included crutches, a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house and a meat cleaver that was never used for cooking. Additional objects included surgical gloves, an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment and a sack full of women&#x27;s clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected that he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he possessed. When she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, &quot;If you tell anyone, I&#x27;ll break your fucking neck.&quot; She said Bundy became &quot;very upset&quot; whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken in the middle of the night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—&quot;for protection&quot;. The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted from Lake Sammamish State Park. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Edwards and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.

In September, Bundy sold his Volkswagen Beetle to a Midvale teenager. Utah police impounded it, and FBI technicians dismantled and searched it. They found hairs matching samples obtained from Campbell&#x27;s body. Later, they also identified hair strands &quot;microscopically indistinguishable&quot; from those of Smith and DaRonch. FBI lab specialist Robert Neill concluded that the presence of hair strands in one car matching three different victims who had never met one another would be &quot;a coincidence of mind-boggling rarity&quot;.

On October 2, detectives put Bundy into a lineup. DaRonch immediately identified him as &quot;Officer Roseland,&quot; and witnesses from Bountiful recognized him as the stranger at the Viewmont High School auditorium. There was insufficient evidence to link him to Kent, whose body had not yet been found, but more than enough evidence to charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. Bundy denied knowing DaRonch but had no alibi, and was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer&#x27;s house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. &quot;When Ted and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere,&quot; Kloepfer wrote, &quot;so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500.&quot;

In November, the three principal Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met in Aspen, Colorado, and exchanged information with thirty detectives and prosecutors from five states. While officials left the meeting (later referred to as the Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged with any of the killings.

In February 1976, Bundy stood trial for the DaRonch kidnapping. On the advice of his attorney, John O&#x27;Connell, he waived his right to a jury due to the negative publicity surrounding the case. After a four-day bench trial and a weekend of deliberation, Judge Stewart Hanson Jr. found Bundy guilty of kidnapping and assault. In June, he was sentenced to one to 15 years in the Utah State Prison. In October, Bundy was found hiding in bushes in the prison yard carrying an &quot;escape kit&quot;—road maps, airline schedules and a Social Security card—and spent several weeks in solitary confinement. Later that month, Colorado authorities charged him with Campbell&#x27;s murder. After a period of resistance, he waived extradition proceedings and was transferred to Aspen in January 1977.

== Escapes ==

On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported from the Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a preliminary hearing. He had elected to serve as his own attorney, and as such was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess, Bundy asked to visit the courthouse&#x27;s law library to research his case. While shielded from his guards&#x27; view behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped to the ground from the second story, injuring his right ankle as he landed.

After shedding an outer layer of clothing, Bundy limped through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked south onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing and a rifle. The following day, Bundy left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, Bundy broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; however, instead of continuing southward, he walked back north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way. Three days later, he stole a car at the edge of an Aspen golf course. Cold, sleep-deprived and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, Bundy drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days. In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Campbell&#x27;s body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape had been planned.
Back in jail in Glenwood Springs, Bundy ignored the advice of friends and legal advisors to stay put. The case against him, already weak at best, was deteriorating steadily as pretrial motions consistently resolved in his favor and significant bits of evidence were ruled inadmissible. &quot;A more rational defendant might have realized that he stood a good chance of acquittal, and that beating the murder charge in Colorado would probably have dissuaded other prosecutors ... with as little as a year and a half to serve on the DaRonch conviction, had Ted persevered, he could have been a free man.&quot; Instead, Bundy assembled a new escape plan. He acquired a detailed floor plan of the Garfield County jail and a hacksaw blade from other inmates. He accumulated $500 in cash, smuggled in over a six-month period by visitors, Boone in particular. During the evenings, while other prisoners were showering, Bundy sawed a hole about one square foot (0.093 m2) between the steel reinforcing bars in his cell&#x27;s ceiling. Having lost , he was able to wriggle through and explore the crawl space above in the weeks that followed. Multiple reports from an informant of movement within the ceiling during the night were not investigated.

By late 1977, Bundy&#x27;s impending trial had become a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in the small town of Aspen, and Bundy filed a motion for a change of venue to Denver. On December 23, the Aspen trial judge granted the request, but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body and climbed into the crawl space. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer — who was out for the evening with his wife — changed into street clothes from the jailer&#x27;s closet and walked out the front door to freedom.

After stealing a car, Bundy drove eastward out of Glenwood Springs, but the car soon broke down in the mountains on Interstate 70. A passing motorist gave him a ride into Vail, to the east. From there he caught a bus to Denver, where he boarded a morning flight to Chicago. Back in Glenwood Springs, the jail&#x27;s skeleton crew did not discover the escape until noon on December 31, more than seventeen hours later. By then, Bundy was already in Chicago.

== Florida murders and rearrest ==
From Chicago, Bundy traveled by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was present in a local tavern on January 2. Five days later, he stole a car and drove south to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, on the morning of January 8. He stayed for one night at a hotel before renting a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing money and credit cards from women&#x27;s wallets left in shopping carts at local grocery stores.

In the early hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU&#x27;s Chi Omega sorority house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45 a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Elizabeth Bowman, aged 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Janet Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, aged 21, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, aged 21, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth and a crushed finger. Chandler and Kleiner survived the attack; Kleiner attributed their survival to automobile headlights illuminating the interior of their room and frightening away the attacker.

Tallahassee detectives determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing. After leaving the sorority house, Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked 21-year-old FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness in her left ear and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career. On Thomas&#x27; bed, police found a semen stain and a pantyhose &quot;mask&quot; containing two hairs &quot;similar to Bundy&#x27;s in class and characteristic&quot;.
On February 8, Bundy drove east to Jacksonville in a stolen FSU van. In a parking lot he approached 14-year-old Leslie Parmenter, the daughter of the Jacksonville Police Department&#x27;s chief of detectives, identifying himself as &quot;Richard Burton, Fire Department,&quot; but retreated when Parmenter&#x27;s older brother arrived and confronted him. That afternoon, he backtracked westward to Lake City. At Lake City Junior High School the following morning, 12-year-old Kimberly Dianne Leach was summoned to her homeroom by a teacher to retrieve a forgotten purse; she never returned to class. Seven weeks later, after an intensive search, her partially mummified remains were found in a pig farrowing shed near Suwannee River State Park, northwest of Lake City. Forensic experts surmised that Leach had been raped before having her throat cut and her genitals mutilated with a knife.

On February 12, with insufficient cash to pay his overdue rent and a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him, Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee, driving westward across the Florida Panhandle. Three days later, at around 1:00 a.m., he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a &quot;wants and warrants&quot; check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen. When told he was under arrest, Bundy kicked Lee&#x27;s legs out from under him and took off running. Lee fired two warning shots, then gave chase and tackled him. The two struggled over Lee&#x27;s gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy. In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students, 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set. Also found were a pair of dark-rimmed non-prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks, later identified as the disguise worn by &quot;Richard Burton, Fire Department&quot; in Jacksonville. As Lee transported his suspect to jail, unaware that he had just arrested one of the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, he heard Bundy say, &quot;I wish you had killed me.&quot;

== Subsequent trials, marriage ==

In May 1978, a Florida grand jury indicted Bundy on charges of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and burglary for the Chi Omega killings and assaults. He stood trial in June 1979 in the Florida Circuit Court for Dade County, with judge Edward Cowart presiding. The trial was covered by 250 reporters from five continents and was the first to be televised nationally in the United States. Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he &quot;sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion,&quot; Nelson later wrote. &quot;Ted [was] facing murder charges, with a possible death sentence, and all that mattered to him apparently was that he be in charge.&quot;

According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was negotiated in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because &quot;prospects of losing at trial were very good.&quot; Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea bargain not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a &quot;tactical move&quot;: he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal. At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. &quot;It made him realize he was going to have to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty,&quot; Minerva said. &quot;He just couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;
At trial, crucial testimony came from Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy in the vicinity of the sorority house that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the house clutching the murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Levy&#x27;s left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy&#x27;s teeth. The jury was also allowed to hear details of DaRonch&#x27;s previous kidnapping, and finally deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting Bundy on July 24, 1979, of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first-degree murder for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions. Bundy appealed his conviction and death sentence to the Supreme Court of Florida, but it affirmed them.

Six months later, a second trial took place in Orlando for the abduction and murder of Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours&#x27; deliberation, due principally to the testimony of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach&#x27;s body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.

During the penalty phase of the Leach trial, Bundy took advantage of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, in the presence of a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.

On February 10, 1980, Bundy was sentenced for a third time to death by electrocution. As the sentence was announced, he reportedly stood and shouted, &quot;Tell the jury they were wrong!&quot; This third death sentence would be the one ultimately carried out nearly nine years later. Louise was the only one who begged for mercy. On October 24, 1981, Boone gave birth to a daughter, Rose Bundy. While conjugal visits were not allowed at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, where Bundy was incarcerated, inmates were known to pool their money in order to bribe guards to allow them intimate time alone with their female visitors.

== Death row, confessions and execution ==
Shortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Speaking mostly in third person to avoid &quot;the stigma of confession,&quot; he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes. Bundy recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer&#x27;s long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned. &quot;The big payoff for me,&quot; he said, &quot;was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken.&quot; Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to &quot;totally possess&quot; his victims. At first, he killed his victims &quot;as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [being] caught&quot;; but later, murder became part of the &quot;adventure.&quot; &quot;The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life,&quot; he said. &quot;And then ... the physical possession of the remains.&quot;

Bundy also confided in Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier was struck by the &quot;deep, almost mystical satisfaction&quot; that Bundy took in murder. &quot;He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence,&quot; Hagmaier related. &quot;It becomes possession. They are part of you ... [the victim] becomes a part of you, and you [two] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them.&quot; Bundy told Hagmaier that he considered himself to be an &quot;amateur,&quot; an &quot;impulsive&quot; killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his &quot;prime&quot; or &quot;predator&quot; phase at about the time of Healy&#x27;s murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—although he never explicitly admitted having done so.
In July 1984, prison guards found two hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy&#x27;s cell. A steel bar in one of the cell&#x27;s windows had been sawed completely through at the top and bottom and glued back into place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later, guards found an unauthorized mirror, and Bundy was moved to a different cell. Shortly thereafter, he was charged with a disciplinary infraction for unauthorized correspondence with another high-profile criminal, John Hinckley Jr.

In October 1984, Bundy contacted Keppel and offered to share his self-proclaimed expertise in serial killer psychology in the ongoing hunt in Washington for the &quot;Green River Killer,&quot; later identified as Gary Ridgway. Keppel and Green River Task Force Detective Dave Reichert interviewed Bundy, but Ridgway remained at large for a further seventeen years. Keppel published a detailed documentation of the Green River interviews, and later collaborated with Michaud on another examination of the interview material.

In early 1986, an execution date (March 4) was set on the Chi Omega convictions; the U.S. Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled. In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Smith&#x27;s lifeless face and repeatedly washed Aime&#x27;s hair. &quot;If you&#x27;ve got time,&quot; he told Hagmaier, &quot;they can be anything you want them to be.&quot; Bundy decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads—probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)—in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them.

Less than 15 hours before the scheduled July 2 execution, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case back to the Southern District of Florida due to legal issues including Bundy&#x27;s mental competency to stand trial and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty—which, ultimately, were never resolved. A new date (November 18) was then set to carry out the Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17. In mid-1988, the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling over the dissents of Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. Within hours of that final denial, a firm execution date of January 24, 1989, was announced. Bundy&#x27;s journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: &quot;Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy as fast as they could ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy&#x27;s lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track.&quot;

With all appeal avenues exhausted and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. He confessed to Keppel that he had committed all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides for which he was the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify if indeed he ever knew their identities. He said he left a fifth corpse—Manson&#x27;s—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer&#x27;s fireplace. &quot;He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there,&quot; Keppel said. &quot;Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time.&quot; Nelson&#x27;s impressions were similar: &quot;It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me,&quot; she wrote, &quot;his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life&#x27;s accomplishments.&quot;

Bundy confessed to detectives from Idaho, Utah and Colorado that he had committed numerous additional homicides, including several that were unknown to the police. He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, &quot;where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines.&quot; A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. Despite warnings from his appellate attorneys that &quot;the spectacle of peddling information for time would turn the courts against [Bundy],&quot; Bundy began offering investigators piecemeal information regarding some of his murders. &quot;There are other buried remains in Colorado,&quot; he admitted, but he refused to elaborate. The new strategy—immediately dubbed &quot;Ted&#x27;s bones-for-time scheme&quot;—served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule and yielded little new detailed information. In cases where he did give details, nothing was found. Colorado Detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in &quot;total possession—the only person who knew his victims&#x27; true resting places.&quot;

When it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and Bundy&#x27;s last purported love interest, asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor Bob Martinez for a postponement to give Bundy time to reveal more information. All refused. &quot;The families already believed that the victims were dead and that Ted had killed them,&quot; wrote Nelson. &quot;They didn&#x27;t need his confession.&quot; Martinez made it clear that he would not agree to further delays in any case. &quot;We are not going to have the system manipulated,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable.&quot;

Boone had championed Bundy&#x27;s innocence throughout all of his trials and felt &quot;deeply betrayed&quot; by his admission that he was, in fact, guilty. She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the morning of his execution. &quot;She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner],&quot; Nelson wrote, &quot;and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days.&quot; Hagmaier was present during Bundy&#x27;s final interviews with investigators. On the eve of his execution, he talked of suicide. &quot;He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die,&quot; Hagmaier said.

Bundy rejected his last food and was executed in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16 a.m. EST on Tuesday, January 24, 1989. His last words were directed at his attorney Jim Coleman and Methodist minister Fred Lawrence: &quot;Jim and Fred, I&#x27;d like you to give my love to my family and friends.&quot; Hundreds of revelers sang, danced, and set off fireworks in a pasture across from the prison as the execution was carried out, then cheered as the white hearse containing Bundy&#x27;s corpse departed the prison. He was cremated in Gainesville, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.

== &quot;Modus operandi&quot; and victim profiles ==
Bundy was an unusually organized and calculating criminal who used his extensive knowledge of law enforcement methodologies to elude identification and capture for years. His crime scenes were distributed over large geographic areas; his victim count had risen to at least 20 before it became clear that numerous investigators in widely disparate jurisdictions were hunting the same man. Bundy&#x27;s assault methods of choice were blunt trauma and strangulation, two relatively silent techniques that could be accomplished with common household items. He deliberately avoided firearms due to the noise they made and the ballistic evidence they left behind. He was a &quot;meticulous researcher&quot; who explored his surroundings in minute detail, looking for safe sites to seize and dispose of victims. He was unusually skilled at minimizing physical evidence. Bundy&#x27;s fingerprints were never found at a crime scene, nor any other incontrovertible evidence of his guilt, a fact he repeated often during the years in which he attempted to maintain his innocence.
Other significant obstacles for law enforcement were Bundy&#x27;s generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, &quot;his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren&#x27;t even sure you were looking at the same person,&quot; said Stewart Hanson Jr., the judge in the DaRonch trial. &quot;He [was] really a changeling.&quot; Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.

Bundy&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; evolved in organization and sophistication over time, as is typical of serial killers, according to FBI experts. Early on, it consisted of forcible late-night entry followed by a violent attack with a blunt weapon on a sleeping victim. As his methodology evolved, he became progressively more organized in his choice of victims and crime scenes. He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. Bundy was regarded as handsome and charismatic, traits he exploited to win the confidence of his victims and the people around him in his daily life. &quot;Ted lured females,&quot; Michaud wrote, &quot;the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee.&quot; He would sometimes approach females pretending to be an authority figure or firefighter.

Once Bundy had victims near or inside his vehicle, he would overpower and bludgeon them, and then restrain them with handcuffs. He would then transport them to a pre-selected secondary site, often a considerable distance away, and rape them during ligature strangulation. In the case of his Utah victims, the secondary site would be his apartment building. Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping women. While he is often said to have been a torturer, and biographer Ann Rule in particular regarded him as a &quot;sadistic sociopath&quot; who took pleasure in human suffering, Bundy disputed these claims in one of his conversations with Michaud, insisting that he never deliberately tortured any of those he killed and that the murders had no sadistic focus on enjoyment derived from the infliction of pain and injury. To the contrary, he claimed that he went out of his way to mitigate his victims&#x27; physical torment. Though he also told Hagmaier that he would pose his victims to recreate detective magazine covers.

At secondary sites Bundy would remove and later burn the victim&#x27;s clothing, or in at least one case (Cunningham&#x27;s) deposit them in a Goodwill Industries collection bin. He explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him. A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to the Leach killing. He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia, and to groom or dress up the cadavers. Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen. Bundy took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. &quot;When you work hard to do something right,&quot; he told Hagmaier, &quot;you don&#x27;t want to forget it.&quot; Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an &quot;essential component,&quot; he told both Keppel and Michaud; he needed to be &quot;extremely drunk&quot; while on the prowl in order to &quot;significantly diminish&quot; his inhibitions and to &quot;sedate&quot; the &quot;dominant personality&quot; that he feared might prevent his inner &quot;entity&quot; from acting on his impulses.

All of Bundy&#x27;s known victims were white females, most of middle-class backgrounds. Almost all were between the ages of 15 and 25 and most were college students. He apparently never approached anyone he might have met before. In their last conversation before his execution, Bundy told Kloepfer he had purposely stayed away from her &quot;when he felt the power of his sickness building in him.&quot; Rule noted that most of the identified victims had long straight hair, parted in the middle—like Edwards, the woman who rejected him, and to whom he later became engaged and then rejected in return. Rule speculated that Bundy&#x27;s animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her. Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: &quot;[T]hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive,&quot; he told Aynesworth. &quot;Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ... [but] almost everything was dissimilar ... physically, they were almost all different.&quot; He did concede that youth and beauty were &quot;absolutely indispensable criteria&quot; in his choice of victims.

After Bundy&#x27;s execution, Rule was surprised and troubled to hear from numerous &quot;sensitive, intelligent, kind young women&quot; who wrote or called to say they were deeply depressed because Bundy was dead. Many had corresponded with him, &quot;each believing that she was his only one&quot;. Several said they suffered nervous breakdowns when he died. &quot;Even in death, Ted damaged women,&quot; Rule wrote. &quot;To get well, they must realize that they were conned by the master con-man. They are grieving for a shadow man that never existed.&quot;

== Pathology ==

Bundy underwent multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts&#x27; conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested the possibility of a multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony; a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy &quot;seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person ... [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger.&quot; Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: &quot;He said, &#x27;He became weird on me.&#x27; He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, &#x27;Almost a complete change of personality ... that was the day I was afraid of him.

While experts found Bundy&#x27;s precise diagnosis elusive, the majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients, such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. &quot;Guilt doesn&#x27;t solve anything, really,&quot; Bundy said in 1981. &quot;It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt.&quot; There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment and manipulative behavior. Upon assessment using the Psychopathy Checklist–revised (PCL-R), Bundy was reportedly evaluated as 39/40. Prosecutor George Dekle wrote, &quot;Sociopaths are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody.&quot; &quot;Sometimes he manipulates even me,&quot; admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: &quot;I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I&#x27;ll buy them dinner,&quot; she told Nelson. &quot;I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all.&quot; Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and its subtype malignant narcissism have both been proposed as alternative diagnoses in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.

On the afternoon before he was executed, Bundy granted a videotaped interview to James Dobson, a psychologist and founder of the Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new claims about violence in the media and the pornographic &quot;roots&quot; of his crimes. &quot;It happened in stages, gradually,&quot; he said. &quot;My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it.&quot; Violence in the media, he said, &quot;particularly sexualized violence,&quot; sent boys &quot;down the road to being Ted Bundys.&quot; The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. &quot;You are going to kill me,&quot; he said, &quot;and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that.&quot;

While Nelson was apparently convinced that Bundy&#x27;s concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers have concluded that his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson&#x27;s agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that &quot;true crime&quot; detective magazines had &quot;corrupted&quot; him and &quot;fueled [his] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer&quot;; yet in a 1977 letter to Rule, he wrote, &quot;Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [on only] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up.&quot; He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. &quot;The problem wasn&#x27;t pornography,&quot; wrote Dekle. &quot;The problem was Bundy.&quot; &quot;I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic,&quot; wrote Rule. &quot;But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us.&quot;
Rule and Aynesworth both noted that for Bundy, the fault always lay with someone or something else. While he eventually confessed to 30 murders, he never accepted responsibility for any of them, even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial, which would have spared him the death penalty. He deflected blame onto a wide variety of scapegoats, including his abusive grandfather, the absence of his biological father, the concealment of his true parentage by his mother, alcohol, the media, the police whom he accused of planting evidence, society in general, violence on television and, ultimately, true crime periodicals and pornography. He blamed television programming, which he watched mostly on sets that he had stolen, for &quot;brainwashing&quot; him into stealing credit cards. On at least one occasion, he even tried to blame his victims: &quot;I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability,&quot; he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer. &quot;Their facial expressions say &#x27;I am afraid of you.&#x27; These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage it?&quot; Another significant element of delusion permeated Bundy&#x27;s thinking:

&quot;Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed that one of his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place where everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other.&quot;

&quot;I don&#x27;t know why everyone is out to get me,&quot; Bundy complained to Lewis. &quot;He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done,&quot; she said. &quot;A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt,&quot; Keppel wrote, &quot;walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached.&quot; Nelson agreed. &quot;Each time he was forced to make an actual confession,&quot; she wrote, &quot;he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago.&quot;

== Victims ==

=== Confirmed ===
The night before his execution, Bundy confessed to 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage speculation. He told Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder &quot;publicized,&quot; there &quot;could be one that was not.&quot; When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, &quot;Add one digit to that, and you&#x27;ll have it.&quot; Years later he told Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Keppel wrote that &quot;[Ted] and I both knew [the total] was much higher.&quot; In an interview, Keppel stated his belief that Bundy had killed &quot;at least 50, and maybe 75.&quot;

John Henry Browne, a lawyer for Bundy, would later claim &quot;that the first person he killed was a young boy when they were playing some kind of sex game in the woods. And so he must have been only 12, 13, 14.&quot; Browne also said that &quot;Ted told me in that interview that he killed over 100 people.&quot; &quot;I told Ted Bundy that we now have the evidence to charge him with both cases,&quot; Leon County Sheriff Kenneth Katsaris recalled, referring to the Chi Omega murders and the slaying of Leach. &quot;He looked at me and said, &#x27;When you find the person that committed these crimes that you think I committed, that person is going to be wanted for murders of women in the three digits in six states.&#x27;&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them,&quot; said Reverend Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy&#x27;s last rites. &quot;That was my impression, my strong impression.&quot;

On the evening before his execution, Bundy reviewed his victim tally with Hagmaier on a state-by-state basis for a total of 30 homicides:
* in Washington, 11 (including Parks, abducted in Oregon but killed in Washington; and including 3 unidentified)
* in Utah, 8 (3 unidentified)
* in Colorado, 3
* in Florida, 3
* in Oregon, 2 (both unidentified)
* in Idaho, 2 (1 unidentified)
* in California, 1 (unidentified)

=== 1974 ===
==== Washington, Oregon ====
* January 4: &quot;Karen Sparks&quot; (18) – Bludgeoned and sexually assaulted in her bed as she slept in the University District of Seattle; survived but the extent of her injuries resulted in permanent brain damage.

* March 12: &quot;Donna Gail Manson&quot; (19) – Abducted while walking to a concert at Evergreen State College; body left according to Bundy at Taylor Mountain site, but never found. However, there is speculation that the partial remains of an unidentified female discovered near Eatonville, Washington, on August 29, 1978, could have belonged to Manson. Remains and clothing were reportedly destroyed on May 10, 1985, before a positive forensic identification could be made.
* April 17: &quot;Susan Elaine Rancourt&quot; (18) – Disappeared after attending an evening advisors&#x27; meeting at Central Washington State College; skull and mandible recovered at Taylor Mountain site in 1975. Both had been severely fractured.
* May 6: &quot;Roberta Kathleen Parks&quot; (22) – Vanished from Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon; skull and mandible recovered at Taylor Mountain site in 1975. She had been bludgeoned to death.
* June 1: &quot;Brenda Carol Ball&quot; (22) – Disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, and was last seen in the parking lot, talking to a man with his arm in a sling; skull and mandible recovered at Taylor Mountain site in 1975. Her skull had been fractured.
* June 11: &quot;Georgann Hawkins&quot; (18) – Abducted from an alley behind her sorority house; skeletal remains identified by Bundy as those of Hawkins recovered at Issaquah site. Hawkins remains listed as a missing person.

* July 14: &quot;Janice Ann Ott&quot; (23) – Abducted from Lake Sammamish State Park in broad daylight and was last seen leaving the park with Bundy who had asked her for assistance with putting his sailboat on his car; skeletal remains recovered at Issaquah site in 1974.
* July 14: &quot;Denise Marie Naslund&quot; (19) – Abducted four hours after Ott from Lake Sammamish State Park and was last seen walking towards the restrooms; skeletal remains recovered at Issaquah site in 1974.

==== Utah ====
* October 1: &quot;Nancy Wilcox&quot; (16) – Last seen leaving her home at 9:00 pm in Holladay, Utah, after getting into an argument with her father; body buried according to Bundy near Capitol Reef National Park, south of Salt Lake City, but never found.
* October 18: &quot;Melissa Anne Smith&quot; (17) – Vanished from Midvale, Utah, after leaving a pizza parlor to walk back to her home; body found nine days later on a hillside in Summit Park, Utah. Her head had been severely beaten with a crowbar, and her body had been battered before death.
* October 31: &quot;Laura Ann Aime&quot; (17) – Disappeared from Lehi, Utah, on her way home from a Halloween party; body discovered by hikers in American Fork Canyon. Her face was beaten beyond recognition, and she had been strangled and sexually assaulted.
* November 8: &quot;Carol DaRonch&quot; (18) – Picked up from the Fashion Place shopping mall in Murray, Utah, lured by Bundy&#x27;s guise of claiming to be a police officer investigating vehicle break-ins in the parking lot; she escaped by jumping out of Bundy&#x27;s vehicle after he inadvertently fastened a pair of handcuffs on the same wrist.
* November 8: &quot;Debra Jean Kent&quot; (17) – Vanished after leaving a school play in Bountiful, Utah; body left according to Bundy near Fairview, south of Bountiful; one patella was found which was positively identified by DNA as Kent&#x27;s in 2015.

=== 1975 ===
==== Utah, Colorado, Idaho ====

* February 9: &quot;Kimberly Dianne Leach&quot; (12) – Abducted from Lake City Junior High School in Lake City, Florida, and was last seen being led to a white van by a man who was later identified as Bundy; mummified remains found near Suwannee River State Park, west of Lake City, with &quot;homicidal violence about the neck region.&quot;

=== Unconfirmed ===
Bundy remains a suspect in several unsolved homicides and disappearances, and is likely responsible for others that may never be identified; in 1987, he confided to Keppel that there were &quot;some murders&quot; that he would &quot;never talk about,&quot; because they were committed &quot;too close to home,&quot; &quot;too close to family&quot; or involved &quot;victims who were very young&quot;. Minutes before his execution, Hagmaier queried Bundy about unsolved homicides in New Jersey, Vermont, Illinois, Texas and Florida. Bundy provided directions—later proven inaccurate—to Curtis&#x27; burial site in Utah, but denied involvement in any of the open cases. In 2011, Bundy&#x27;s complete DNA profile, obtained from a vial of his blood found in an evidence vault, was added to the FBI&#x27;s DNA database for future reference in these and other unsolved murder cases:
* Ann Marie Burr, 8, vanished from her Tacoma residence on August 31, 1961, when Bundy was aged 14. An unknown tennis shoe imprint was found by the overturned bench used to enter her house. Due to the small size of the shoe, police believed the perpetrator was a teenager or youth. The Burr house was on Bundy&#x27;s newspaper delivery route and Burr&#x27;s father was certain that he saw Bundy in a ditch at a construction site on the nearby UPS campus the morning his daughter disappeared. Other circumstantial evidence implicates Bundy as well, but detectives familiar with the case have never agreed on the likelihood of his involvement. Bundy repeatedly denied culpability and wrote a letter of denial to the Burr family in 1986. However, Keppel has observed that the Burr case fits all three categories of murders Bundy would &quot;never talk about&quot;: &quot;too close to home,&quot; &quot;too close to family&quot; and &quot;very young.&quot; Forensic testing of material evidence from the Burr crime scene in 2011 yielded insufficient intact DNA sequences for comparison with Bundy&#x27;s, and as such his involvement remains speculative.
* Flight attendants Lisa Wick and Lonnie Ree Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a piece of lumber as they slept in their basement apartment in Seattle&#x27;s Queen Anne neighborhood in the early morning hours of June 23, 1966. An autopsy concluded that Trumbull had died at approximately midnight from a blow to the head she had received about an hour earlier. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. The crime was also similarly comparable to Bundy&#x27;s earlier verifiable assaults on women, who were bludgeoned while in their beds in Seattle basement apartments. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss as a result of the attack, later contacted Rule: &quot;I know that it was Ted Bundy who did that to us,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but I can&#x27;t tell you how I know.&quot; Police records state that when Bundy&#x27;s fingerprints were compared in January 1977 to those left at the crime scene, they did not match, although many people were allowed into the unsecured crime scene and may have left their fingerprints, thereby causing unwanted alteration of evidence. Bundy&#x27;s involvement remains unconfirmed.
* Vacationing Pennsylvania college friends Susan Margarite Davis and Elizabeth Potter Perry, both 19, were stabbed to death in Somers Point, New Jersey, on May 30, 1969. The women had been visiting Ocean City and were on their way back to Pennsylvania at about 4:30 a.m. before they stopped at the Somers Point Diner for breakfast. They left the diner one hour later and vanished. Their car was found that day abandoned beside the Garden State Parkway near Atlantic City, southeast of Philadelphia; their bodies were discovered in nearby woods three days later tied to trees with their hair. Davis was naked with her clothing and accessories in a pile beside her. Except for her missing underwear, Perry was fully-dressed. Bundy attended Temple University from January through May 1969 and apparently did not move west until after Memorial Day weekend. While his accounts of his earliest crimes varied considerably between interviews, he told forensic psychologist Art Norman that his first murder victims were two women in the Philadelphia area. Biographer Richard Larsen believed that Bundy committed the murders using his feigned-injury ruse, based on an investigator&#x27;s interview with Bundy&#x27;s aunt: Ted, she said, was wearing a leg cast due to an automobile accident on the weekend of the homicides, and therefore could not have traveled from Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore; there is no official record of any such accident. Bundy is considered a &quot;strong suspect&quot; but the case remains open.
* Rita Patricia Curran, a 24-year-old elementary school teacher and part-time motel maid, was murdered in her basement apartment on July 19, 1971, in Burlington, Vermont; she had been strangled, bludgeoned and raped. The time of death was later given as approximately midnight. The location of the motel where she worked which was adjacent to Bundy&#x27;s birthplace, the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers, and similarities to known Bundy crime scenes led retired FBI agent John Bassett to propose him as a suspect. Bundy told Keppel that he murdered a young woman in 1971 in Burlington when he was there to obtain information about his birth, but denied specific involvement in the Curran case to Hagmaier on the eve of his execution. No evidence firmly places Bundy in Burlington on that date, but municipal records note that a person named &quot;Bundy&quot; was bitten by a dog that week, and long stretches of Bundy&#x27;s time—including the summer of 1971—remain unaccounted for. In 2023, the Burlington Police Department announced that Curran&#x27;s killer was her next-door neighbor, who had been identified using DNA extracted from a discarded cigarette butt found at the crime scene.
* Joyce Margaret LePage, 21, was last seen on the evening of July 22, 1971, when friends dropped her off at her apartment on the campus of Washington State University (WSU), where she was an undergraduate. Later, her vehicle was discovered by police parked four blocks from her residence. Nine months later, LePage&#x27;s skeletal remains were found wrapped in two &quot;military&quot; blankets, bound with rope, in a deep ravine south of Pullman, Washington. Her remains were also covered with a sizable piece of green shag carpet that had been previously reported missing from Stevens Hall, a women&#x27;s residence on the WSU campus, which was vacant and undergoing renovations in the summer of 1971. The cause of her death was confirmed to be three knife wounds to her chest, which was determined during an FBI forensic examination of her bones. Police concluded from the available evidence that she had been stabbed to death in Stevens Hall before being wrapped in carpet and taken to the ravine. Whitman County authorities have said that multiple suspects—including Bundy—have &quot;never been cleared.&quot;
* Kerry May-Hardy, 22, disappeared whilst hitchhiking on June 13, 1972, from Woodland Park, Seattle. Hardy&#x27;s skeletal remains were unearthed on September 6, 2010, by construction machinery, in a grave measuring two feet (0.6 meters) in depth. DNA from the skeleton matched the family&#x27;s sample on June 1, 2011. Hardy&#x27;s body was discovered five miles from Bundy&#x27;s mass grave at Taylor Mountain and she is known to have shared a mutual acquaintance with Bundy, although it is uncertain if they actually knew each other. The case remains unsolved.
* In 1989, Bundy confessed to two homicides in Oregon without identifying the victims. Oregon law enforcement subsequently identified Bundy as a prime suspect in the 1973 disappearances of Vicki Lynn Hollar, aged 24, who disappeared from Eugene on August 20 and Suzanne Rae Justis, aged 23, who was last seen in Portland on November 5. Hollar was last seen getting into her car at a parking lot en route to her apartment. Justis was last heard from when she telephoned her parents from outside the Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Bundy was linked to the cases due to the fact that Hollar and Justis both fitted his preferred victim profile and he was known to have been in the area at the time they disappeared. Another possible victim identified by detectives was 17-year-old Rita Lorraine Jolly who disappeared from West Linn on June 29, 1973, after leaving her residence on Horton Road to go for a walk. Jolly was last seen between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., walking uphill on Sunset Avenue. Authorities were unable to obtain an interview with Bundy and all three women remain classified as missing.
* Katherine Merry Devine, aged 14, was abducted on November 25, 1973; her body was found the following month in the Capitol State Forest near Olympia, Washington. Brenda Joy Baker, also aged 14, was last seen hitchhiking near Puyallup, on May 27, 1974; her body was found in Millersylvania State Park a month later. Her throat had been slit. Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel that he had no knowledge of either case. DNA analysis led to the arrest and conviction of William Cosden for Devine&#x27;s murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved, although Cosden is also considered the prime suspect in her case.
* Sandra Jean Weaver, 19, a Wisconsin native who had been living in Tooele, Utah, was last seen leaving the Warehouse District in Salt Lake City for her lunch break at around 10:30 a.m. on July 1, 1974. Her nude body was discovered the following day by tourists hiking in De Beque by the Colorado River near Grand Junction, Colorado. She had been sexually assaulted and stranguled to death before being dumped off a service road. Salt Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s Detective Jerry Thompson later stated that Weaver&#x27;s case was &quot;very similar&quot; to the subsequent deaths of Smith and Aime. However, Weaver&#x27;s murder officially remains unsolved.
* 21-year-old University of Utah student Rhonda Stapley was waiting at a bus stop in Salt Lake City on October 11, 1974, when she was allegedly approached by Bundy, who had pulled over and offered her a ride in his Volkswagen Beetle. After entering his vehicle, Bundy drove to an isolated canyon picnic spot, shut off the engine, turned to her and said: &quot;Do you know what? I am going to kill you now.&quot; He then repeatedly choked and raped Stapley over a period of three hours until Bundy, who thought she was dead, was distracted by something near his car and she was able to run into the woods. Although Stapley would not publicly acknowledge the incident until 2011, her account was supported by Ann Rule, who said that it was consistent with the FBI&#x27;s timeline of Bundy&#x27;s activities in 1974.
* Melanie Suzanne Cooley, 18, disappeared on April 15, 1975, after leaving Nederland High School in Nederland, Colorado, northwest of Denver. She was last seen by classmates hitchhiking nearby after her classes were over. Her corpse was discovered by road maintenance workers two weeks later in Coal Creek Canyon, away from where she was last seen. Gas station receipts place Bundy in nearby Golden on the day Cooley disappeared. Jefferson County authorities consider the evidence in Cooley&#x27;s case to be inconclusive and continue to treat her homicide as a cold case.
* Shelley Kay Robertson, 24, failed to show up for work in Golden on July 1, 1975. Her nude, decomposed body was found by two mining students on August 21, inside a mine on Berthoud Pass near Winter Park Resort. Credit card receipts placed Bundy in Golden on the day of Robertson&#x27;s disappearance, but there is no direct evidence of his involvement.
* Nancy Perry Baird, 23, disappeared from the gas station where she worked as a service attendant in Layton, Utah, north of Salt Lake City, on July 4, 1975, and remains classified as a missing person. A police officer on patrol saw her working alone there, and at 5:30 p.m., less than fifteen minutes later, she was discovered missing. Bundy admitted to eight Utah homicides shortly before his execution and authorities suspected that one of the unidentified victims could have been Baird. However, her suspected kidnapping did not fit the profile of Bundy&#x27;s past crimes in a number of respects, and he explicitly denied involvement during the interviews he gave on death row.
* Deborah Diane Smith, aged 17, was last seen in Salt Lake City in early-February 1976, shortly before the DaRonch trial began; her body was found by a utility worker in an open pasture near Salt Lake City International Airport on April 1, 1976. Salt Lake Detective Jim Bell suspected that Bundy may have killed Smith. &quot;We&#x27;re still in limbo on the Debbie Smith one,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;re going to wait for a time chart. We haven&#x27;t come up with anything on Bundy, but we haven&#x27;t ruled anything out, either.&quot;
* Joy Kathleen Harmon, 22, was last seen exiting the Better Days Bar in Salt Lake City on the evening of March 2, 1976. On March 6, a hiker between Parley&#x27;s Canyon and Emigration Canyon found her partially clothed body north of Interstate 80. Harmon had been strangled and beaten; her murder occurred the day after Bundy was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping and three months before he was sentenced to prison and incarcerated on June 30. Her case is still unsolved.

<doc id="143379" wikidata="Q275010" url="?curid=143379" title="Moloch">
<text>Moloch, Molech, or Molek is a word which appears in the Hebrew Bible several times, primarily in the Book of Leviticus. The Bible strongly condemns practices that are associated with Moloch, which are heavily implied to include child sacrifice.

Traditionally, the name &quot;Moloch&quot; has been understood as referring to a Canaanite god. However, since 1935, scholars have speculated that Moloch refers to the sacrifice &quot;itself&quot;, since the Hebrew word &quot;mlk&quot; is identical in spelling to a term that means &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the closely related Punic language. This second position has grown increasingly popular, but it remains contested. Among proponents of this second position, controversy continues as to whether the sacrifices were offered to Yahweh or another deity, and whether they were a native Israelite religious custom or a Phoenician import.

Since the medieval period, Moloch has often been portrayed as a bull-headed idol with outstretched hands over a fire; this depiction takes the brief mentions of Moloch in the Bible and combines them with various sources, including ancient accounts of Carthaginian child sacrifice and the legend of the Minotaur.

Beginning in the modern era, &quot;Moloch&quot; has been figuratively used in reference to a power which demands a dire sacrifice. A god Moloch appears in various works of literature and film, such as John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667), Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Salammbô&quot; (1862), Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), and Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; (1955).

==Etymology==

The etymology of Moloch is uncertain: a derivation from the root , which means &quot;to rule&quot; is &quot;widely recognized&quot;. Since it was first proposed by Abraham Geiger in 1857, some scholars have argued that the word &quot;Moloch&quot; has been altered by using the vowels of &quot;shame&quot;. Other scholars have argued that the name is a &quot;qal&quot; participle from the same verb. R. M. Kerr criticizes both theories by noting that the name of no other god appears to have been formed from a &quot;qal&quot; participle, and that Geiger&#x27;s proposal is &quot;an out-of-date theory which has never received any factual support&quot;. Paul Mosca, Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia, similarly argued that &quot;the theory that a form would immediately suggest to the reader or hearer the word (rather than or ) is the product of nineteenth century ingenuity, not of Massoretic or pre-Massoretic tendentiousness&quot;.

Scholars who do not believe that Moloch represents a deity instead compare the name to inscriptions in the closely related Punic language where the word ( or ) refers to a type of sacrifice, a connection first proposed by Otto Eissfeldt (1935). Eissfeldt himself, following Jean-Baptiste Chabot, connected Punic and &quot;Moloch&quot; to a Syriac verb meaning &quot;to promise&quot;, a theory also supported as &quot;the least problematic solution&quot; by Heath Dewrell (2017). Eissfeldt&#x27;s proposed meaning included both the act and the object of sacrifice. Scholars such as W. von Soden argue that the term is a nominalized causative form of the verb , meaning &quot;to offer&quot;, &quot;present&quot;, and thus means &quot;the act of presenting&quot; or &quot;thing presented&quot;. Kerr instead derives both the Punic and Hebrew word from the verb , which he proposes meant &quot;to own&quot;, &quot;to possess&quot; in Proto-Semitic, only later coming to mean &quot;to rule&quot;; the meaning of Moloch would thus originally have been &quot;present&quot;, &quot;gift&quot;, and later come to mean &quot;sacrifice&quot;. 

The spelling &quot;Moloch&quot; follows the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate; the spelling &quot;Molech&quot; or &quot;Molek&quot; follows the Tiberian vocalization of Hebrew, with &quot;Molech&quot; used in the English King James Bible.

==Biblical attestations==
===Masoretic text===

The word &quot;Moloch&quot; (מלך) occurs eight times in the Masoretic text, the standard Hebrew text of the Bible. Five of these are in Leviticus, with one in 1 Kings, one in 2 Kings and another in The Book of Jeremiah. Seven instances include the Hebrew definite article (&#x27;the&#x27;) or have a prepositional form indicating the presence of the definite article. All of these texts condemn Israelites who engage in practices associated with Moloch, and most associate Moloch with the use of children as offerings.

Leviticus repeatedly forbids the practice of offering children to Moloch:

The majority of the Leviticus references come from a single passage of four lines:

In 1 Kings, Solomon is portrayed as introducing the cult of Moloch to Jerusalem:

This is the sole instance of the name Moloch occurring without the definite article in the Masoretic text: it may offer a historical origin of the Moloch cult in the Bible, or it may be a mistake for Milcom, the Ammonite god (thus the reading in some manuscripts of the Septuagint).

In 2 Kings, Moloch is associated with the tophet in the valley of Gehenna when it is destroyed by king Josiah:

The same activity of causing children &quot;to pass over the fire&quot; is mentioned, without reference to Moloch, in numerous other verses of the Bible, such as in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 12:31, 18:10), 2 Kings (2 Kings 16:3; 17:17; 17:31; 21:6), 2 Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6), the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:31, 19:5) and the Book of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:21; 20:26, 31; 23:37).

Lastly, the prophet Jeremiah condemns practices associated with Moloch as showing infidelity to Yahweh:

Given the name&#x27;s similarity to the Hebrew word &quot;king&quot;, scholars have also searched the Masoretic text to find instances of that may be mistakes for Moloch. Most scholars consider only one instance as likely a mistake, in Isaiah:
===Septuagint and New Testament===
The standard text of the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament, contains the name &quot;Moloch&quot; (Μολόχ) at 2 Kings 23:10 and Jeremiah 30:35, as in the Masoretic text, but without an article. Moreover, the Septuagint uses the name Moloch in Amos where it is not found in the Masoretic text:

Additionally, some Greek manuscripts of Zephaniah 1:5 contain the name &quot;Moloch&quot; or &quot;Milcom&quot; rather than the Masoretic text&#x27;s &quot;their king,&quot; the reading also found in the standard Septuagint. Many English translations follow one or the other of these variants, reading either &quot;Moloch&quot; or &quot;Milcom&quot;. However, instead of &quot;Moloch&quot;, the Septuagint translates the instances of Moloch in Leviticus as &quot;ruler&quot; (), and as &quot;king&quot; () at 1 Kings 11:7. 

The Greek version of Amos with Moloch is quoted in the New Testament and accounts for the one occurrence of Moloch there (Acts 7:43).

==Theories==
===As a deity===

Before 1935, all scholars held that Moloch was a pagan deity, to whom child sacrifice was offered at the Jerusalem tophet. Some modern scholars have proposed that Moloch may be the same god as Milcom, Adad-Milki, or an epithet for Baal.

G. C. Heider and John Day connect Moloch with a deity &quot;Mlk&quot; attested at Ugarit and &quot;Malik&quot; attested in Mesopotamia and proposes that he was a god of the underworld, as in Mesopotamia &quot;Malik&quot; is twice equated with the underworld god Nergal. Day also notes that Isaiah seems to associate Moloch with Sheol. The Ugaritic deity &quot;Mlk&quot; also appears to be associated with the underworld, and the similarly named Phoenician god Melqart (literally &quot;king of the city&quot;) could have underworld associations if &quot;city&quot; is understood to mean &quot;underworld&quot;, as proposed by William F. Albright. Heider also argued that there was also an Akkadian term referring to the shades of the dead.

The notion that Moloch is the name of a deity has been challenged for several reasons. Moloch is rarely mentioned in the Bible, is not mentioned at all outside of it, and connections to other deities with similar names are uncertain. Moreover, it is possible that some of the supposed deities named &quot;Mlk&quot; are epithets for another god, given that &quot;mlk&quot; can also mean &quot;king&quot;. The Israelite rite conforms, on the other hand, to the Punic rite in that both involved the sacrifice of children. None of the proposed gods Moloch could be identified with are associated with human sacrifice, the god &quot;Mlk&quot; of Ugarit appears to have only received animal sacrifice, and the sacrifice is never offered to a god named &quot;Mlk&quot; but rather to another deity.

Brian Schmidt argues that the use of Moloch without an article at 1 Kings 11:7 and the use of Moloch as a proper name without an article in the Septuagint may indicate that there was a tradition of a god Moloch when the Bible was originally composed. However, this god may have only existed in the imagination of the composers of the Bible rather than in historical reality.

===As a form of sacrifice===

In 1935, Otto Eissfeldt proposed, on the basis of Punic inscriptions, that Moloch was a form of sacrifice rather than a deity. Punic inscriptions commonly associate the word with three other words: (lamb), (citizen) and (human being). and never occur in the same description and appear to be interchangeable. Other words that sometimes occur are (flesh). When put together with , these words indicate a &quot;-sacrifice consisting of...&quot;. The Biblical term would thus be translated not as &quot;to Moloch&quot;, as normally translated, but as &quot;as a molk-sacrifice&quot;, a meaning consistent with uses of the Hebrew preposition elsewhere. Bennie Reynolds further argues that Jeremiah&#x27;s use of &quot;Moloch&quot; in conjunction with Baal in Jer 32:35 is parallel to his use of &quot;burnt offering&quot; and Baal in Jeremiah 19:4–5.

The view that Moloch refers to a type of sacrifice was challenged by John Day and George Heider in the 1980s. Day and Heider argued that it was unlikely that biblical commentators had misunderstood an earlier term for a sacrifice as a deity and that Leviticus 20:5&#x27;s mention of &quot;whoring after Moloch&quot; necessarily implied that Moloch was a god. Day and Heider nevertheless accepted that &quot;mlk&quot; was a sacrificial term in Punic, but argue that it did not originate in Phoenicia and that it was not brought back to Phoenicia by the Punic diaspora. More recently, Anthony Frendo argues that the Hebrew equivalent to Punic (the root of Punic ) is the verb &quot;to pass over&quot;; in Frendo&#x27;s view, this means that the Hebrew Moloch is not derived from the same root as Punic .

Since Day&#x27;s and Heider&#x27;s objections, a growing number of scholars have come to believe that Moloch refers to the &quot;mulk&quot; sacrifice rather than a deity. Francesca Stavrakopoulou argues that &quot;because both Heider and Day accept Eissfeldt&#x27;s interpretation of Phoenician-Punic as a sacrificial term, their positions are at once compromised by the possibility that biblical could well function in a similar way as a technical term for a type of sacrifice&quot;. She further argues that &quot;whoring after Moloch&quot; does not need to imply a deity as refers to both the act of sacrificing and the thing sacrificed, allowing an interpretation of &quot;whor[ing] after the mlk-offering&quot;. Heath Dewrell argues that the translation of Leviticus 20:5 in the Septuagint, which substitutes &quot;archons, princes&quot; for &quot;Moloch&quot;, implies that the biblical urtext did not include the phrase &quot;whoring after Moloch&quot;. Bennie Reynolds further notes that at least one inscription from Tyre does appear to mention sacrifice (&quot;RES&quot; 367); therefore Day and Heider are incorrect that the practice is unattested in Canaan (Phoenicia). Reynolds also argues for further parallels. However, Dewrell argues that the inscription is probably a modern forgery based on the unusual layout of the text and linguistic abnormalities, among other reasons.

Among scholars who believe that Moloch refers to a form of sacrifice, debate remains as to whether the Israelite &quot;mlk&quot; sacrifices were offered to Yahweh or another deity. Armin Lange suggests that the Binding of Isaac represents a &quot;mlk&quot;-sacrifice to Yahweh in which the child is finally substituted with a sheep, noting that Isaac was meant to be a burnt offering. This opinion is shared by Stavrakopoulou, who also points to the sacrifice of Jephthah of his daughter as a burnt offering. Frendo, while he argues that &quot;Moloch&quot; refers to a god, accepts Stavrakopoulou&#x27;s argument that the sacrifices in the tophet were originally to Yahweh. Dewrell argues that although sacrifices were offered to Yahweh, they were distinct from other forms of human or child sacrifice found in the Bible (such as that of Jephthah) and were a foreign custom imported by the Israelites from the Phoenicians during the reign of Ahaz.

===As a divine title===

Because the name &quot;Moloch&quot; is almost always accompanied by the definite article in Hebrew, it is possible that it is a title meaning &quot;the king&quot;, as it is sometimes translated in the Septuagint. In the twentieth century, the philosopher Martin Buber proposed that &quot;Moloch&quot; referred to &quot;Melekh Yahweh&quot;. A similar view was later expressed by T. Römer (1999). Brian Schmidt, however, argues that the mention of Baal in Jeremiah 32:35 suggests that &quot;the ruler&quot; could have instead referred to Baal.

===As a rite of passage===
A minority of scholars, mainly scholars of Punic studies, has argued that the ceremonies to Moloch are in fact a non-lethal dedication ceremony rather than a sacrifice. These theories are partially supported by commentary in the Talmud and among early Jewish commentators of the Bible. Rejecting such arguments, Paolo Xella and Francesca Stavrakopoulou note that the Bible explicitly connects the ritual to Moloch at the tophet with the verbs indicating slaughter, killing in sacrifice, deities &quot;eating&quot; the children, and holocaust. Xella also refers to Carthaginian and Phoenician child sacrifice found referenced in Greco-Roman sources.

==Religious interpretation==
===In Judaism===

The oldest classical rabbinical texts, the mishnah (3rd century CE) and Talmud (200s CE) include the Leviticus prohibitions of giving one&#x27;s seed to Moloch, but do not clearly describe what this might have historically entailed. Early midrash regarded the prohibition to giving one&#x27;s seed to Moloch at Leviticus 21:18 as no longer applicable in a literal sense. The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael explains that Moloch refers to any foreign religion, while Megillah in the Babylonian Talmud explains that Moloch refers to the gentiles. Likewise, the late antique Targum Neofiti and the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, interpret the verse to mean a Jewish man having sex with a gentile. The earlier Book of Jubilees (2nd century BCE) shows that this reinterpretation was known already during the Second Temple Period; Jubilees uses the story of Dinah to show that marrying one&#x27;s daughter to a gentile was also forbidden (Jubilees 30:10). Such non-literal interpretations are condemned in the Mishnah (Megilla 4:9).

Medieval rabbis argued about whether the prohibition of giving to Moloch referred to sacrifice or something else. For instance, Menachem Meiri (1249–1315) argued that &quot;giving one&#x27;s seed unto Moloch&quot; referred to an initiation rite and not a form of idolatry or sacrifice. Other rabbis disagreed. The 8th or 9th-century midrash Tanḥuma B, gives a detailed description of Moloch worship in which the Moloch idol has the face of a calf and offerings are placed in its outstretched hands to be burned. This portrayal has no basis in the Bible or Talmud and probably derives from sources such as Diodorus Siculus on Carthaginian child sacrifice as well as various other classical portrayals of gruesome sacrifice. The rabbis Rashi (1040–1105) and Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor (12th century) may rely on Tanḥuma B when they provide their own description of Moloch sacrifices in their commentaries. The medieval rabbinical tradition also associated Moloch with other similarly named deities mentioned in the Bible such as Milcom, Adrammelek, and Anammelech.

===In Christianity===
The Church fathers only discuss Moloch occasionally, mostly in commentaries on the Book of Amos or the Acts of the Apostles (where Stephen summarizes the Old Testament before being martyred). Early Christian commentators mostly either used Moloch to show the sinfulness of the Jews or to exhort Christians to morality. Discussion of Moloch is also rare during the medieval period, and was mostly limited to providing descriptions of what the commentators believed Moloch sacrifice entailed. Such descriptions, as found in Nicholas of Lyra (1270–1349), derive from the rabbinical tradition.

During the Reformation, on the other hand, protestant commentators such as John Calvin and Martin Luther used Moloch as a warning against falling into idolatry and to disparage Catholic practices. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses understand Moloch as a god of worship of the state, following ideas first expressed by Scottish minister Alexander Hislop (1807–1865).

==In art and culture==
===In art===

Images of Moloch did not grow popular until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Western culture began to experience a fascination with demons. These images tend to portray Moloch as a bull- or lion-headed humanoid idol, sometimes with wings, with arms outstretched over a fire, onto which the sacrificial child is placed. This portrayal can be traced to medieval Jewish commentaries such as that by Rashi, which connected the biblical Moloch with depictions of Carthaginian sacrifice to Cronus (Baal Hammon) found in sources such as Diodorus, with George Foot Moore suggesting that the bull&#x27;s head may derive from the mythological Minotaur. John S. Rundin suggests that further sources for the image are the legend of Talos and the brazen bull built for king Phalaris of the Greek city of Acragas on Sicily. He notes that both legends, as well as that of the Minotaur, have potential associations with Semitic child sacrifice.

In contrast, William Blake portrayed Moloch as an entirely humanoid idol with a winged demon soaring above in his &quot;Flight of Moloch&quot; one of his illustrations of Milton&#x27;s poem &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot;.

===In literature===

Moloch appears as a child-eating fallen angel in John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667). He is described as &quot;horrid king besmeared with blood / Of human sacrifice, and parents’ tears&quot; (1:392–393) and leads the procession of rebel angels. Later, Moloch is the first speaker at the council of hell and advocates for open war against heaven. Milton&#x27;s description of Moloch is one of the most influential for modern conceptions of this demon or deity. Milton also mentions Moloch in his poem &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot;, where he flees from his grisly altars. Similar portrayals of Moloch as in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; can be found in Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Messias&quot; (1748–1773), and in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dawn&quot;, where Moloch represents the barbarism of past ages.

In Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Salammbô&quot;, a historical novel about Carthage published in 1862, Moloch is a Carthaginian god who embodies the male principle and the destructive power of the sun. Additionally, Moloch is portrayed as the husband of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit. Sacrifices to Moloch are described at length in chapter 13. The sacrifices are portrayed in an orientalist and exoticized fashion, with children sacrificed in increasing numbers to burning furnaces found in the statue of the god. Flaubert defended his portrayal against criticism by saying it was based on the description of Carthaginian child sacrifice found in Diodorus Siculus.

From the nineteenth century onward, Moloch has often been used in literature as a metaphor for some form of social, economic or military oppression, as in Charles Dickens&#x27; novella &quot;The Haunted Man&quot; (1848), Alexander Kuprin&#x27;s novel &quot;Moloch&quot; (1896), and Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s long poem &quot;Howl&quot; (1956), where Moloch symbolizes American capitalism.

Moloch is also often used to describe something that debases society and feeds on its children, as in Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s long poem &quot;Peter Bell the Third&quot; (1839), Herman Melville&#x27;s poem &quot;The March into Virginia&quot; (1866) about the American Civil War, and Joseph Seamon Cotter, Jr.&#x27;s poem &quot;Moloch&quot; (1921) about the First World War.

===As social or political allegory===
In modern times, a metaphorical meaning of Moloch as a destructive force or system that demands sacrifice, particularly of children, has become common. Beginning with Samuel Laing&#x27;s &quot;National Distress&quot; (1844), the modern city is often described as a Moloch, an idea found also in Karl Marx; additionally, war often comes to be described as Moloch.

The Munich Cosmic Circle (c. 1900) used Moloch to describe a person operating under cold rationalism, something they viewed as causing the degeneration of Western civilization. Conservative Christians often rhetorically equate abortion with the sacrifice of children to Moloch. Bertrand Russell, on the other hand, used Moloch to describe a kind of cruel, primitive religion in &quot;A Freeman&#x27;s Worship&quot; (1923); he then used it to attack religion more generally.

=== In film and television ===
The 1914 Italian film &quot;Cabiria&quot; is set in Carthage and is loosely based on Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Salammbô&quot;. The film features a bronzed, full-three dimensional statue of Moloch which is today kept in National Museum of Cinema in Turin, Italy. The titular female slave Cabiria is saved from the priests of Moloch just before she was to be sacrificed to the idol during the night. The depiction of the sacrifices to Moloch are based on Flaubert&#x27;s descriptions, while the entrance of Moloch&#x27;s temple is modeled on a hellmouth. &quot;Cabiria&#x27;s&quot; depiction of the temple and statue of Moloch would go on to influence other filmic depictions of Moloch, such as that in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), in which it is workers rather than children who are sacrificed, and Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;The Colossus of Rhodes&quot; (1961).

Moloch has continued to be used as a name for horrific figures who are depicted as connected to the demon or god but often bear little resemblance to the traditional image. This includes television appearances in &quot;Stargate SG1&quot; as an alien villain, in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;Sleepy Hollow.

<text>Bethesda Softworks LLC is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. The company was founded by Christopher Weaver in 1986 as a division of Media Technology Limited. In 1999, it became a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media. In its first 15 years, it was a video game developer and self-published its titles. In 2001, Bethesda spun off its in-house development team into Bethesda Game Studios, leaving Bethesda Softworks to focus on publishing operations.

In March 2021, Microsoft acquired Bethesda&#x27;s parent company ZeniMax Media, maintaining that the company will continue to operate as a separate business. Part of the Microsoft Gaming division, Bethesda Softworks retains its function as the publisher of games developed by the different studios under ZeniMax Media.

== History ==
===1980s===

Before founding Bethesda Softworks, Christopher Weaver was a technology forecaster and a communications engineer in the television and cable industries. After finishing graduate school, he was hired by the American Broadcasting Company, where he wrote several memos about &quot;the importance of alternative distribution systems and how satellites and broadband networks would impact network television&quot;, which landed him the position of manager of technology forecasting. After several national magazines quoted his articles on &quot;the exciting prospects for cabled distribution systems&quot;, he was recruited by the National Cable Television Association and created its Office of Science and Technology, where he helped design high-speed data communication systems for several member companies of the association. Eventually, Weaver became the chief engineer for the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, where he influenced legislation that affected the telephone, television, and cable industries.

In the meantime, Weaver also founded VideoMagic Laboratories with a friend from the Architecture Machine Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They authored and assembled a 400-page business plan to commercialize their prior lab work and, through the Industrial Liaison Office at MIT, came in contact with a wealthy family in the electronics industry that provided VideoMagic with venture capital. The company developed several technologies, including location-based entertainment systems, that Weaver deemed &quot;radical and cutting-edge&quot; but put out prematurely, causing little commercial return. The funding family, having financial issues of its own, dropped out of the venture and sold off some of VideoMagic&#x27;s properties. After leaving the House Subcommittee some years later, Weaver established Media Technology Associates, Limited (renamed Media Technology Limited in March 1988) in June 1981. The company provided engineering and media consulting for private companies and government organizations. Media Technology had offices in Maryland and New York.

At Media Technology, Weaver worked with Ed Fletcher, an electrical engineer with whom he had collaborated at VideoMagic, on video games for LaserDisc-based systems until that industry crashed in 1984. While waiting for potential new contracts, the company acquired an Amiga personal computer with which the two began to experiment. Fletcher was a fan of American football and suggested that they develop a football video game for the system, which Weaver supported despite no interest in the sport. Fletcher developed the game, later named &quot;Gridiron!&quot;, out of Weaver&#x27;s house in Bethesda, Maryland, in roughly nine months. His initial approach was to use lookup tables to map player inputs to predetermined outcomes. Weaver disliked this concept and, at his behest, he and Fletcher devised a more realistic, physics-based system. No artists or animators were involved in the project, which gave the game a sub-par graphical presentation for the time.

Weaver formed Bethesda Softworks &quot;on the proverbial kitchen table&quot; of his Bethesda home as a division of Media Technology on June 28, 1986. The formation was described as an experiment &quot;to see if the PC market was a viable place to develop games&quot;. Weaver originally named the company &quot;Softwerke&quot; but found that the name was taken by a company based in Virginia. Weaver and the owner of that company agreed to co-exist rather than fight over the title, and Weaver changed the name of his company to Bethesda Softworks. He had considered creating a unique name, such as one using the word &quot;magic&quot; after a quote from Arthur C. Clarke, but &quot;Bethesda Softworks&quot; ultimately stuck. Unlike VideoMagic, Bethesda Softworks was entirely self-funded, starting with roughly , and was not attached to any business plan. &quot;Gridiron!&quot; was released as the company&#x27;s first game later in 1986 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 systems. The initial release of a few hundred copies distributed in plastic bags was sold out within one week, to the surprise of Bethesda Softworks.

Early games scored respectably in the gaming press. Electronic Arts was working on the first &quot;John Madden Football&quot;, and hired Bethesda to help finish developing it, and acquired distribution rights for future versions of &quot;Gridiron!&quot;. In June 1988, after no new cross-console version of &quot;Gridiron!&quot; had been released, Bethesda stopped work on the project and sued Electronic Arts for , claiming EA halted the release while incorporating many of its elements into &quot;Madden&quot;. The case was resolved out of court.

Courteney Cox, later known for her role in the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, worked at the publisher briefly in the 1980s.

===1990s===
In 1990, the company moved from Bethesda to Rockville, Maryland. By February 1993, the company employed 40 people.

The first game Bethesda published and developed, based on a popular film franchise, was The Terminator for MS-DOS. The title was released in July 1991, coinciding with the theatrical release of the film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;.

In 1994, the company released its best-known project at the time, &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot;. The game, the first in &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; role-playing video game series was the work of Programmer Julian Lefay, Director and Producer Vijay Lakshman as well as others. Several sequels have been released since including &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;, which was released in September 1996.

Between 1994 and 1997, Bethesda was developing a space combat game titled &quot;The 10th Planet&quot;. It was a collaboration between Bethesda and Roland Emmerich&#x27;s Centropolis Entertainment. During development, Centropolis chose to stop working on the game due to the company&#x27;s commitments to its films. The project was never released.

In 1995, Bethesda Softworks acquired &quot;Noctropolis&quot; developer Flashpoint Productions, which Brent Erickson had founded in 1992.

In July 1995, Bruce Nesmith joined Bethesda as Senior Producer.

In August 1995, Bethesda Softworks launched its website on the World Wide Web.

In 1997, Bethesda acquired XL Translab, a Washington, D.C., graphics company that stemmed from the Catholic University School of Architecture and Planning. It was moved to Bethesda Softworks&#x27; Rockville headquarters. XL Translab had previously done work for PBS and &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies. By 1996, the company had become the third-biggest player in the privately held PC publishing industry after LucasArts and Interplay Entertainment with 75 employees by that year and revenues of $25 million by 1997.

In June and July 1997, Bethesda announced a partnership with CBS Enterprises to produce the first-ever true companion PC series of games for the television series &quot;&quot;. By December 1997, the first CD-ROM game was still in production.

In 1997 and 1998, Bethesda released two &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; spin-offs based on &quot;Daggerfall&quot; code—&quot;Battlespire&quot; and &quot;Redguard&quot;—neither of which enjoyed the success of &quot;Daggerfall&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot;. The downturn in sales was not limited just to &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; franchise, and the company considered filing for bankruptcy as a result.

In October 1999, Pete Hines joined Bethesda to head up its marketing department, running it as what he described as a one-man band. At the start of his tenure, the company had employed around 15 people in its Rockville headquarters.

In 1999, Weaver and Robert A. Altman formed the holding company ZeniMax Media. In an interview with &quot;Edge&quot;, he described the company as being a top-level administrative structure rather than a &quot;parent company&quot; for its holdings, explaining that &quot;ZeniMax and Bethesda for all intents and purposes are one thing. Bethesda has no accounting department, we have no finance, we have no legal, our legal department [and] our financial department is ZeniMax, we all operate as one unit.&quot; According to the designer Bruce Nesmith, Altman was principally interested in Bethesda&#x27;s web development business at Vir2L Studios, not the game development aspect. ZeniMax acquired Media Technology in July 1999 and Bethesda Softworks was reorganized as a division of ZeniMax. By then Bethesda employed nearly 100 people.

===2000s===
In 2001, Bethesda Game Studios was established as the development team, leaving Bethesda Softworks to focus on all publishing operations of ZeniMax Media.

In 2002, Weaver stopped being employed by ZeniMax. He later filed a lawsuit against ZeniMax, claiming he was ousted by his new business partners after giving them access to his brand and was owed in severance pay. ZeniMax filed counterclaims and moved to dismiss the case, claiming Weaver had gone through emails of other employees to find evidence. This dismissal was later vacated on appeal, and the parties settled out of court. Weaver remained a major shareholder in the company; as of 2007, he said that he still owned 33% of ZeniMax&#x27;s stock. Providence Equity bought 25% of ZeniMax&#x27;s stock in late 2007, and an additional stake in 2010.

In 2004, the &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise was acquired by Bethesda Softworks from Interplay Entertainment and the development of &quot;Fallout 3&quot; was handed over to Bethesda Game Studios. &quot;Fallout 3&quot; was released on October 28, 2008. Five downloadable content packs for &quot;Fallout 3&quot; were released in the year following its release — &quot;Operation: Anchorage&quot;, &quot;The Pitt&quot;, &quot;Broken Steel&quot;, &quot;Point Lookout&quot;, and &quot;Mothership Zeta&quot;. Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s new &quot;Fallout&quot; title, &quot;&quot; was published in 2010. &quot;Fallout 4&quot; was released on November 10, 2015.

Between 2004 and 2008, ZeniMax&#x27;s subsidiaries Mud Duck Productions and Vir2L Studios released four bowling games for various platforms — &quot;AMF Bowling 2004&quot;, &quot;AMF Xtreme Bowling 2006&quot;, &quot;AMF Bowling World Lanes&quot;, and &quot;AMF Bowling Pinbusters!&quot;.

In January 2006, Bethesda acquired the rights to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series of video games. The first game published by the company was &quot;Star Trek: Encounters&quot;, released in 2006.

In September 2009, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against Interplay Entertainment, after being unsatisfied with Interplay&#x27;s development of the &quot;Fallout&quot; massively multiplayer online game project. Bethesda stopped funding the project, and Interplay was forced to abandon work on it.

Between 2007 and 2010, Bethesda raised in new capital from Providence Equity Partners to fund expansion efforts. In February 2008, the company opened a European publishing arm in London, named ZeniMax Europe, to distribute titles throughout UK/EMEA territories under the Bethesda Softworks brand. This was followed in by opening publishing offices in Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris, Eindhoven, Hong Kong, Sydney and Moscow in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2018 respectively.

On June 24, 2009, ZeniMax Media acquired id Software, whose titles, including &quot;Rage&quot;, would be published by Bethesda Softworks. Between 2009 and 2012, the company expanded publishing operations, with games from independent third-party developers such as Rebellion Developments&#x27;s &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;, Artificial Mind and Movement&#x27;s &quot;Wet&quot;, Splash Damage&#x27;s &quot;Brink&quot;, and inXile&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

===2010s===
In 2011, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against Mojang (developers of &quot;Minecraft&quot;) for using &quot;Scrolls&quot; as the name of a new digital card game, which sounded too close to &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; trademarked by Bethesda.

In the early 2010s, Bethesda Softworks published games such as &quot;Dishonored&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Evil Within&quot;.

In the mid-2010s, Bethesda began to experiment with new kinds of games, releasing &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;, its first mobile, free-to-play game in the summer of 2015. A year later, it released a reboot of id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot;, after several years of development as a failed attempt to produce a sequel to &quot;Doom 3&quot;. Later that year, Zen Studios released virtual pinball adaptations of three games that Bethesda released during the decade thus far (&quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot; and the 2016 reboot of &quot;Doom&quot;) as the &quot;Bethesda Pinball&quot; collection for its pinball games. Bethesda went on to release two more free-to-play mobile games based on &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series, a card battle game titled &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Legends&quot; in 2017 and a first-person role-playing game titled &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Blades&quot; in 2019.

When Nintendo unveiled its new hybrid console, the Nintendo Switch, Bethesda expressed support for it and released ports of &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; for that system in November 2017. A year later, it also ported &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;, and has future plans to do the same for its two &quot;Elder Scrolls&quot; mobile games.

Games such as &quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Evil Within 2&quot;, and &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; have not sold as well as compared to &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; according to Bethesda&#x27;s Pete Hines.

In late 2018, Bethesda announced and released its first massively multiplayer online game, &quot;Fallout 76&quot;, a prequel to the &quot;Fallout&quot; series. Upon its initial release, it was given mixed reviews for its poor quality and was embroiled in several other controversies, including problems with tie-in products and a data breach.

The following year saw Bethesda announce sequels to &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Rage 2&quot; and &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;. The former was released on May 14, while the latter released in early 2020 shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States, following a series of delays for polish after the negative reception of &quot;Fallout 76&quot;″s initial launch.

In November 2019, Human Head Studios shut down while Bethesda established a new studio, Roundhouse Studios, offering all Human Head employees a position within it.

In 2016, Bethesda had released its own application launcher for PC. &quot;Fallout 76&quot; and &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; were exclusives to the launcher before eventually released on Steam. In 2022, Bethesda shut down the launcher. The launcher was mostly met with negative reception. PC Gamer said that &quot;Bethesda&#x27;s launcher seems to be designed more as a pretty interface to purchase Bethesda&#x27;s games than a way of managing them. [...] the client feels more like a store than anything.&quot;

===2020s===
In March 2020, Bethesda Softworks published &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, a sequel to the 2016 reboot for PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One and the Stadia games streaming service from Google. The game&#x27;s release was one of many that was affected by the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the games industry, prompting retailers such as GameStop to begin selling physical copies a day in advance of its general release to minimize crowding of customers. To coincide with &quot;Eternal&quot;″s original release, a remaster of &quot;Doom 64&quot; was also launched as both a standalone release, and as a pre-order bonus for the former game on the aforementioned platforms. The re-release was co-developed by id Software and Nightdive Studios, and includes a new post-campaign expansion.

In September 2020, Microsoft entered an agreement to acquire Bethesda&#x27;s parent company ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion, gaining ownership over all of Bethesda&#x27;s associated development teams, now as part of Microsoft Gaming. The agreement stipulated that Bethesda continued to finance and self-publish their games and that titles on other platforms would be decided on a &quot;case-by-case&quot; basis, but that the merger would also allow Bethesda&#x27;s existing back-catalog of titles to become available on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass service for console, PC and cloud, and that select future games from the publisher would become exclusives for Windows and the Xbox Series X/S consoles, which simultaneously launched that November. The acquisition of ZeniMax Media was formally completed on March 9, 2021. Following the merger&#x27;s completion, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer clarified that future titles from Bethesda would primarily ship on any platforms hosting Xbox Game Pass. 

In September 2021, Bethesda published &quot;Deathloop&quot;, a first-person shooter with time-warping mechanics from Arkane Lyon. The following March, Bethesda released &quot;&quot;, a first-person horror-themed action-adventure game developed by Tango Gameworks. Both games were announced as being timed console exclusives for PlayStation 5 before Microsoft purchased ZeniMax Media, an existing contractual obligation that would be honored by Microsoft despite the amended terms. Both titles were eventually released on Xbox Series X/S a year following their respective PlayStation 5 versions. 

In January 2023, Bethesda announced and released &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; from Tango Gameworks. The publisher purposely kept the game&#x27;s development secret by due to possible skepticism and uncertainty regarding audience feedback. In May 2023, Bethesda launched &quot;Redfall&quot; for Windows and Xbox Series X/S from Arkane Austin, though it received a largely mixed to negative reception, with scrutiny directed towards the uninspired narrative, the overall repetitiveness in objectives during the campaign, and consistent technical problems. In September 2023, Bethesda published &quot;Starfield&quot; for Windows and Xbox Series X/S. Developed by Bethesda Game Studios, the game marked the studio&#x27;s first wholly original intellectual property in over 25 years. Upon the early access launch, the game reached a peak of 230,000 concurrent players on Steam within two hours. Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced on launch day that the game subsequently became the most played Xbox Series X/S-exclusive game since the console&#x27;s launch, as well as the most wish-listed game on Steam for either Xbox or Bethesda in their respective histories. &quot;Starfield&quot; reached ten million players across Xbox and PC by September 19, making it the biggest launch period in Bethesda&#x27;s history as a publisher.

In October 2023, Bethesda&#x27;s head of publishing Pete Hines announced he would be retiring. Later that month, a corporate restructuring of the newly formed Microsoft Gaming subsidiary took place following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, that saw the promotion of executive Matt Booty from president of Xbox to overseeing their entire Game Content and Studios business, with Jamie Leder still retaining supervision over ZeniMax Media as a &quot;limited integration entity&quot; that would now report to Matt. In December 2023, Jill Braff was appointed to the role as head of Bethesda and ZeniMax Media&#x27;s development teams, while simultaneously retaining her existing duties as the General Manager of Integrations and Casual Games for Xbox Game Studios.

In May 2024, Microsoft announced that they were closing Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks and Alpha Dog Games as part of a significant organization restructure of Bethesda&#x27;s operations. Xbox Game Content and Studios head Matt Booty explained that the shuttering of the studios reflected a desire to prioritize the development of &quot;high-impact titles&quot; and investing more in Bethesda&#x27;s catalogue of blockbuster franchises. Mobile developer Roundhouse Studios also ceased activity, with its team being consolidated into ZeniMax Online Studios. Development of all DLC content for &quot;Redfall&quot; also ceased. Xbox president Sarah Bond cited a necessity to keep their gaming business growing through periods of transition and industry stagnation, as a reason for the studio closures. Addressing Tango Gameworks directly, she proposed that the varying metrics for success on a game-by-game basis was examined when deciding to shut the studio down. Despite Tango&#x27;s closure, Matt Booty reiterated the necessity for Xbox to house smaller budget titles for &quot;prestige and awards&quot; much like &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot;. On August 12, 2024, South Korean publisher Krafton announced they had entered an agreement with Microsoft Gaming and Bethesda to revive and acquire Tango Gameworks in its entirety, which also included the transferral of the &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; license. Publishing rights to either the original &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; or Tango Gameworks&#x27; previous games remained with Microsoft.

==Technology==
&quot;XnGine&quot; is a 3-D graphics engine that was developed by Bethesda in the 1990s. It incorporated technology advances that made games more realistic. The engine featured quicker action, unrestricted viewing angles and freedom of movement. Its proprietary technology integrates 360-degree rotation with fully textured polygons, SVGA/VGA graphics and specialized video effects. XnGine can generate weather effects, such as snow, sleet and fog; realistic shading; and textured, contoured terrain. In an Interview with PCM&amp;E Magazine in 1996, Todd Howard described the engine as a true 3D engine that delivered above any other engine in its lighting in that it uses real-time phong shading, which means that light effects from fires, explosions, the moon, or whatever will bleed off and light up anything the light will touch. 

&quot;The Terminator: Future Shock&quot; was the first game to use the engine, and also the first 3D PC game to use the now popular mouse-look interface, which was initially unpopular with gamers. The engine was later used in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Daggerfall&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and other titles.

==Conflicts with other developers==
In 2001, Bethesda Softworks published &quot;Echelon&quot; in the United States, a video game developed by the Russian development studio Madia. Madia stated that Bethesda did not pay for boxed sales of the game, as was allegedly specified in the contract. The developers at Madia wrote an open letter to Bethesda in which they have detailed the affair, but Bethesda refused to pay. In the end Madia decided not to take it to court. Pete Hines, VP of PR at Bethesda, stated that Madia presented misleading allegations about Bethesda&#x27;s role as publisher of &quot;Echelon&quot; in North America and that Bethesda had no contractual obligations to Madia.

Bethesda Softworks and ZeniMax Media have been accused of attempting a hostile acquisition of Human Head Studios, as well as a successful hostile acquisition of Arkane Studios before that. According to a report from IGN, ZeniMax started purposefully failing Human Head&#x27;s project milestones so that they would not get paid, allowing ZeniMax to buy the company at a reduced rate. They were accused of doing the same thing with Arkane Studios, although in Arkane&#x27;s case, the studio gave in and allowed themselves to be bought. The failed hostile acquisition of Human Head Studios led to cancellation of Human Head&#x27;s &quot;Prey 2&quot;, according to the report.

Bethesda also pressured developer No Matter Games to change the name of their game &quot;Prey for the Gods&quot; to &quot;Praey for the Gods&quot;, as Bethesda felt the initial title infringed upon the trademark of their own game, &quot;Prey&quot;. Pete Hines, who serves as Bethesda&#x27;s VP of marketing, said Bethesda would have risked losing their &quot;Prey&quot; trademark if they had not requested the title change.

===Lawsuits===
In September 2009, Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment over &quot;Fallout&quot; trademark infringement. After a lengthy legal battle the lawsuit was settled in January 2012, with Interplay receiving while Bethesda Softworks gained the right to develop a &quot;Fallout&quot; massively multiplayer online game, as well as the rights to &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2&quot; and &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; after December 31, 2013.

In September 2011, Bethesda&#x27;s parent company, ZeniMax Media, filed a lawsuit against Mojang, claiming that Mojang&#x27;s planned trademark of the title &quot;Scrolls&quot; infringed upon Bethesda&#x27;s trademark of &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series. On October 18, Markus Persson announced that Mojang had won the interim injunction, but that Bethesda still had the option to file an appeal. In March 2012, Mojang and Bethesda reached a settlement, in which Mojang would not trademark Scrolls, but Bethesda would not contest Mojang&#x27;s naming of &quot;Scrolls&quot;, so long as it would not be a direct competitor against &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;.

In 2018, Bethesda Softworks sued Behaviour Interactive, the company responsible for developing &quot;Fallout Shelter&quot;, for appearing to copy the game&#x27;s design onto a tie-in mobile game for the &quot;Westworld&quot; franchise. The issue was settled with undisclosed terms, allowing Bethesda to drop the lawsuit.

== Microsoft closures ==
In May 2024, Microsoft announced that four Bethesda studios would be closed in relation to a major restructure to the publisher&#x27;s operations. Arkane Austin (&quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;Redfall&quot;), Tango Gameworks (&quot;The Evil Within&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot;) and Alpha Dog Games (&quot;Mighty DOOM&quot;) ceased activity entirely, while Roundhouse Studios was consolidated into ZeniMax Online Studios. Xbox&#x27;s Game Content and Studios manager Matt Booty explained that the closure of the aforementioned teams was due to an internal shift in focus towards other areas in Bethesda and Microsoft&#x27;s portfolio, including more &quot;priority games&quot;. The closure of the studios drew significantly negative reactions, with particular fan ire directed towards the sudden shuttering of Tango Gameworks a year following &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot;″s launch and positive critical reception, as well as its proximity to the game&#x27;s launch on PlayStation 5. Fans additionally cited the hypocrisy present in past statements by Microsoft Gaming executives, namely an older tweet by Xbox marketing head Aaron Greenberg insinuating &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; was a success in &quot;all key measurements and expectations&quot;, as well as an older anecdote from the web documentary &quot;Power On: The Story of Xbox&quot; (2021), in which both Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and president of Xbox Sarah Bond reflected on the closure of former &quot;Fable&quot; developer Lionhead Studios in 2016, implying they were learning from their mismanagement of the studio. Users on Steam also review bombed &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; with positive reception in support and gratitude towards Tango Gameworks following the announcement. 

The closures of Tango and Arkane Austin similarly drew widespread backlash across the games industry. Dinga Bakaba, studio director at Arkane&#x27;s Lyon team at Bethesda, lambasted the closures as a &quot;fucking gut stab&quot;, and went on to liken Microsoft&#x27;s actions and address of the situation towards being used as &quot;strawmen for miscalculations/blind spots&quot; in addition to producing work environments comparable to &quot;darwinist jungles.&quot; Former Bethesda Game Studios designer and Something Wicked Games CEO Jeff Gardiner observed a game development climate where &quot;the people who made the games [that] have to suffer, not the people who simply made money off the games.&quot; David Goldfarb, studio creative director and founder of &quot;&quot; (2022) developer The Outsiders, expressed disillusionment towards the affected teams losing their creative autonomy. Former PlayStation executive and Iron Galaxy co-CEO Adam Boyes posted an image on his Twitter page that noted the irony of these closures occurring just as Microsoft posted a 17% increase in revenue over the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year. An IGN article chronicling the reactions to the Xbox business&#x27; current controversies cited two former employees of the company with anonymity; one recalled having conversations with multiple key alumni from the original Xbox team that all concluded &quot;It&#x27;s no longer Xbox, but &quot;Microsoft Gaming&quot;&quot;. The second source likened the situation to &quot;an anaconda trying to ingest an elephant&quot;, additionally criticizing Microsoft for their inability to quickly integrate Bethesda into their overall strategy before moving to acquire Activision Blizzard, a publisher roughly &quot;three times the size&quot; of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox division. Original Xbox team head Seamus Blackley sent his wishes to the developers let go by Microsoft, remarking on how &quot;scary&quot; it is to pursue creative ideas in game design, while also stating his awareness towards &quot;the stench of money-guy decision making&quot; and its ability to impede on development teams and their aspirations. He also exclaimed his belief in the Xbox team and that he was confident &quot;this isn&#x27;t the end of the story.&quot;

In August 2024, Krafton announced it had acquired Tango and the &quot;Hi-Fi Rush&quot; IP from Microsoft and Bethesda, with plans to &quot;continue developing the Hi-Fi RUSH IP and explore future projects.&quot; In a statement attributed to news outlet Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson said &quot;We&#x27;re working with Krafton to enable the team at Tango Gameworks to continue to build games together and we look forward to playing their next great game. There will be no impact to the existing catalog of Tango games.&quot;

<text>Singesar, also spelt Sangesar and Sangsar (Persian/Pashto: سنگيسار), is a Pashtun village west of Kandahar, Afghanistan, in the Zheray district.

== About ==
The village&#x27;s name originates from the phrase &quot;sang-e-hisar&quot;, or stone fort, after an old fort in the area constructed by the British in the 19th century.

It was the former home of Taliban leader Mullah Omar, who lived there between the end of the anti-Soviet jihad in 1989 and the launch of the Taliban movement in 1994. He worked there as a preacher and religious instructor.

== Notable people ==
*Abdul Ali Deobandi, pro-Taliban cleric
