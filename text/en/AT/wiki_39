<text>Hartford is a city in Washington and Dodge counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 16,000. All of this population resided in Washington County; the portion of the city in Dodge County consists of only industrial and commercial parcels. Located approximately northwest of downtown Milwaukee and from city limits, Hartford is located on the outer edge of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
===Early history and settlement===
In the early 19th century, Hartford was inhabited by the Potawatomi and Menominee people, who had a trading post on the Rubicon River and a village on the eastern shore of Pike Lake. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington, and the Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. However, when the first White settlers arrived in 1843, they found that the Potawatomi were still living at the Pike Lake village. Some Native Americans remained in the area and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by White settlers. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

In July 1843, Timothy Hall became the first White person to purchase and settle land in the Hartford area, although when he arrived he found a Canadian named Jehial Case squatting near his land. Later that year, German immigrant settlers John Thiel and Nicolaus Simon surveyed the Hartford area and determined that the Rubicon River would be a suitable location for a hydropowered mill. The following year, James and George Rossman joined Simon and Thiel&#x27;s venture. The men purchased forty acres abutting the rapids of the Rubicon River and constructed a dam and a sawmill that harnessed the river&#x27;s power to make lumber from the old-growth forests covering the area. In 1846, a third Rossman brother, Charles, arrived in Hartford and constructed a gristmill to process grain grown by the settlers. On January 31, 1846, the land was incorporated as the Town of Wright, before the name was changed to the Town of Hartford in February 1847, after Hartford, Connecticut. Many of the original settlers were Yankees from New England and were part of a wave of farmers who headed west in the early 1800s, though some other settlers—including Theil and Simon—were German immigrants. The early settlers cleared land for farming; constructed roads; created a post office; erected churches, starting with the First Congregational Church of Hartford which formed in 1847 and followed by Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, and Catholic churches in the 1850s; and established businesses to serve the town&#x27;s agricultural economy, including equipment wholesalers, general stores, and dry goods dealers.

The La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad was constructed through the community in 1855, with Louis Thiel, son of surveyor John Thiel, being a gatekeeper at the St. Paul railroad. And while rail connections were important to Hartford&#x27;s growth into the early 1900s, the company failed in 1861. Many local landowners had taken out mortgages on land for the railroad in exchange for company shares. The company&#x27;s failure left the landowners with mortgages to pay off, creating a local crisis in which some families were forced to sell their farms. The &quot;Hartford Home League&quot; newspaper started during the crisis to advocate for the farmers.

The community&#x27;s early years saw increasing tension between the settlers and Native Americans. For example, on August 25, 1861, a group of approximately a dozen Native Americans was living near Horicon Marsh, northwest of Hartford. They owned a horse, which got loose and wandered into a neighboring settler&#x27;s cornfield. The settler shot and killed the horse, and the Native Americans vowed to take revenge. The story traveled quickly, becoming increasingly exaggerated as it spread. By the time the story reached Hartford on August 26, the dozen peaceful Native Americans had been transfigured into an army of 5,000 warriors preparing to massacre the settlers in the area. Many able-bodied men in Hartford armed themselves, formed a war party, and set out to fight the Native Americans. But when they arrived at Horicon Marsh they found that the threat was entirely fictional. The incident caused widespread fear among the local Native American community as well as in the surrounding settler communities.

===Growth and industrialization===

Hartford incorporated as a city in 1883. While Hartford had a large German-American population in the 19th century and was home to several German cultural associations, including the Hartford Turners, the Hartford Schützenverein, and a chapter of the Sons of Hermann, the Germans in Hartford tended to be more assimilated than Germans in other Washington County communities. In 1912, one historian observed that in Washington County &quot;there have always been places where the American [culture] predominated. Take the example of the two cities in the county. Hartford always was more of an American community than West Bend.&quot;

In the final decades of the 1800s and first years of the 1900s, Hartford&#x27;s economy shifted from being a small market town serving the local farmers to being a larger industrial community. In 1906, the Kissel Motor Car Company opened and quickly became the community&#x27;s largest employer, creating hundreds of jobs and bringing European immigrant laborers into the community. Hartford was also home to the International Stamping Company, which manufactured automobile parts; the Hartford Canning Company, which processed local farmers&#x27; crops such as peas, which were a cash crop in the area; the knitting mills of the Paramount Knitting Company; a glove factory; three tanneries, and a brewery.

During World War II, Hartford&#x27;s factories contributed to the war effort. The Kissel car factory, which was sold to the West Bend Aluminum Company in 1944, was retooled to make shell casings, rocket containers, affordable kitchenware and canisters for gas masks. The Hartford Canning Company produced military rations. In the summer of 1944, the U.S. military tried to fill labor shortages in the Hartford area by contracting German prisoners of war to work on pea farms. Initially, the prisoners were transported from a requisitioned hotel on Lake Keesus in Waukesha County. In October 1944, the military requisitioned the Schwartz Ballroom on Jefferson Street (operating as the &quot;Chandelier Ballroom&quot; as of 2020) to serve as a prisoner of war camp for 600 Germans. The prisoners were contracted to work on farms as well as in canneries, hemp mills, dairy facilities and tanneries. The camp closed in January 1946 and the prisoners were repatriated to Germany.

Hartford&#x27;s population grew during the post–World War II economic expansion. The population more than doubled between 1950 and 1960, and the community has continued to grow in subsequent decades. While many of the early 20th century manufacturers, including the Kissel Motor Car Company, have closed, Hartford is home to several large manufacturers, including Broan-NuTone, which manufactures ventilation systems. In 1990, the city annexed land from the neighboring Town of Rubicon in Dodge County to expand its industrial zone.

===Historic landmarks===
Several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and among them are some of the Kissel houses as well as houses they built for others.

The Hartford post office contains an oil on canvas mural, &quot;Autumn Wisconsin Landscape&quot;, painted in 1940 by Ethel Spears. It was produced for the Section of Painting and Sculpture (later the Section of Fine Arts) of the Treasury Department as part of the WPA Depression-era employment projects.

===Kissel===

In 1883 Ludwig &quot;Louis&quot; Kissel moved to Hartford and by 1890 he formed a partnership with his sons, Adolph P., Otto P., William L. and George A. that included many businesses beginning with the L. Kissel &amp; Sons Hardware store. Other enterprises ultimately included the Hartford Plow Works (1892) manufacturing and distribution of farm machinery, In addition to distributing engines through Kissel Manufacturing Company for other manufacturers, the Kissels developed their own gasoline engines, both two and four stroke, that even included a boat motor for Sears and Roebuck. Other businesses included the Hartford Electric Company, a stone quarry, and a sand pit.

In 1906, Louis, his four sons, and US District Attorney H. K. Butterfield incorporated the Kissel Motor Car Company. The new auto company started full-scale production in 1907 and continued until 1930. In 1906 Otto, along with John Liver, H. K. Butterfield, and 18 other members formed the First National Bank of Hartford, with capital of $50,000. John was elected president, H. K. Butterfield was elected vice-president and Otto Kissel was elected second vice president. Henry H. Esser was appointed cashier. Liver died in 1925 and Otto was appointed president. In 1923 the Hartford Chamber of Commerce was organized with Otto Kissel, Henry Esser and John Liver as charter members. In 1936 Kissel Industries was formed, the old factory regained, and the company manufactured the Kissel outboard motor, sold as the &quot;Waterwitch&quot; from 1936 to 1944 exclusively by Sears and Roebuck.

==Education==
The School District of Hartford provides public education to elementary students in Hartford. Lincoln and Rossman Elementary Schools each serve roughly half of the city&#x27;s kindergarten through fifth grade student population. Both schools are feeders to Central Middle School, which serves all Hartford students in grades 6 through 8.

Secondary education is provided by Hartford Union High School (HUHS), which is independent of the School District of Hartford. It has an enrollment of about 1500 students. The high school serves the city of Hartford, the Town of Hartford, and most of the surrounding communities including Richfield, Erin, Friess Lake, and Neosho.

Several parochial schools are in the community, including St. Kilian Roman Catholic School and Peace Lutheran.

The city&#x27;s library is the Jack Russell Memorial Library.

<doc id="141738" wikidata="Q16741" url="?curid=141738" title="Comet Hyakutake">
<text>Comet Hyakutake (formally designated C/1996 B2) is a comet discovered on 31 January 1996. It was dubbed the Great Comet of 1996; its passage to within of the Earth on 25 March was one of the closest cometary approaches of the previous 200 years. Reaching an apparent visual magnitude of zero and spanning nearly 80°, Hyakutake appeared very bright in the night sky and was widely seen around the world. The comet temporarily upstaged the much anticipated Comet Hale–Bopp, which was approaching the inner Solar System at the time.

Hyakutake is a long-period comet that passed perihelion on 1 May 1996. Before its most recent passage through the Solar System, its orbital period was about 17,000 years, but the gravitational perturbation of the giant planets has increased this period to 70,000 years. This is the first comet to have an X-ray emission detected, which is most likely the result of ionised solar wind particles interacting with neutral atoms in the coma of the comet. The &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft fortuitously crossed the comet&#x27;s tail at a distance of more than from the nucleus, showing that Hyakutake had the longest tail known for a comet.

== Discovery ==
The comet was discovered on 30 January 1996, by Yuji Hyakutake, an amateur astronomer from southern Japan. He had been searching for comets for years and had moved to Kagoshima Prefecture partly for the dark skies in nearby rural areas. He was using a powerful set of binoculars with objective lenses to scan the skies on the night of the discovery.

This comet was actually the second Comet Hyakutake; Hyakutake had discovered comet C/1995 Y1 several weeks earlier. While re-observing his first comet (which never became visible to the naked eye) and the surrounding patch of sky, Hyakutake was surprised to find another comet in almost the same position as the first had been. Hardly believing a second discovery so soon after the first, Hyakutake reported his observation to the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan the following morning. Later that day, the discovery was confirmed by independent observations.

At the time of its discovery, the comet was shining at magnitude 11.0 and had a coma approximately 2.5 arcminutes across. It was approximately 2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. Later, a precovery image of the comet was found on a photograph taken on January 1, when the comet was about 2.4 AU from the Sun and had a magnitude of 13.3.

== Orbit ==
When the first calculations of the comet&#x27;s orbit were made, scientists realized that it was going to pass just 0.1 AU from Earth on 25 March. Only four comets in the previous century had passed closer. Comet Hale–Bopp was already being discussed as a possible &quot;great comet&quot;; the astronomical community eventually realised that Hyakutake might also become spectacular because of its close approach.

Moreover, Comet Hyakutake&#x27;s orbit meant that it had last been to the inner Solar System approximately 17,000 years earlier. Because it had probably passed close to the Sun several times before, the approach in 1996 would not be a maiden arrival from the Oort cloud, a place from where comets with orbital periods of millions of years come. Comets entering the inner Solar System for the first time may brighten rapidly before fading as they near the Sun, because a layer of highly volatile material evaporates. This was the case with Comet Kohoutek in 1973; it was initially touted as potentially spectacular, but only appeared moderately bright. Older comets show a more consistent brightening pattern. Thus, all indications suggested Comet Hyakutake would be bright.

Besides approaching close to Earth, the comet would also be visible throughout the night to northern hemisphere observers at its closest approach because of its path, passing very close to the pole star. This would be an unusual occurrence, because most comets are close to the Sun in the sky when the comets are at their brightest, leading to the comets appearing in a sky not completely dark.

== Earth passage ==
Hyakutake became visible to the naked eye in early March 1996. By mid-March, the comet was still fairly unremarkable, shining at 4th magnitude with a tail about 5 degrees long. As it neared its closest approach to Earth, it rapidly became brighter, and its tail grew in length. By March 24, the comet was one of the brightest objects in the night sky, and its tail stretched 35 degrees. The comet had a notably bluish-green colour.
The closest approach occurred on 25 March at a distance of . Hyakutake was moving so rapidly across the night sky that its movement could be detected against the stars in just a few minutes; it covered the diameter of a full moon (half a degree) every 30 minutes. Observers estimated its magnitude as around 0, and tail lengths of up to 80 degrees were reported. Its coma, now close to the zenith for observers at mid-northern latitudes, appeared approximately 1.5 to 2 degrees across, roughly four times the diameter of the full moon. The comet&#x27;s head appeared distinctly blue-green, possibly due to emissions from diatomic carbon (C2) combined with sunlight reflected from dust grains.

Because Hyakutake was at its brightest for only a few days, it did not have time to permeate the public imagination in the way that Comet Hale–Bopp did the following year. Many European observers in particular did not see the comet at its peak because of unfavourable weather conditions.

== Perihelion and afterwards ==
After its close approach to the Earth, the comet faded to about 2nd magnitude. It reached perihelion on 1 May 1996, brightening again and exhibiting a dust tail in addition to the gas tail seen as it passed the Earth. By this time, however, it was close to the Sun and was not seen as easily. It was observed passing perihelion by the &quot;SOHO&quot; Sun-observing satellite, which also recorded a large coronal mass ejection being formed at the same time. The comet&#x27;s distance from the Sun at perihelion was 0.23 AU, well inside the orbit of Mercury.

After its perihelion passage, Hyakutake faded rapidly and was lost to naked-eye visibility by the end of May. Its orbital path carried it rapidly into the southern skies, but following perihelion it became much less monitored. The last known observation of the comet took place on November 2.

Hyakutake had passed through the inner Solar System approximately 17,000 years ago; gravitational interactions with the gas giants during its 1996 passage stretched its orbit greatly, and barycentric fits to the comet&#x27;s orbit predict it will not return to the inner Solar System again for approximately 70,000 years.

== Scientific results ==

=== Spacecraft passes through the tail ===

The &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft made an unexpected pass through the tail of the comet on 1 May 1996. Evidence of the encounter was not noticed until 1998. Astronomers analysing old data found that &quot;Ulysses&quot;″ instruments had detected a large drop in the number of protons passing, as well as a change in the direction and strength of the local magnetic field. This implied that the spacecraft had crossed the &#x27;wake&#x27; of an object, most likely a comet; the object responsible was not immediately identified.

In 2000, two teams independently analyzed the same event. The magnetometer team realized that the changes in the direction of the magnetic field mentioned above agreed with the &quot;draping&quot; pattern expected in a comet&#x27;s ion, or plasma tail. The magnetometer team looked for likely suspects. No known comets were located near the satellite, but looking further afield, they found that Hyakutake, away, had crossed &quot;Ulysses&quot;″ orbital plane on 23 April 1996. The solar wind had a velocity at the time of about , at which speed it would have taken eight days for the tail to be carried out to where the spacecraft was situated at 3.73 AU, approximately 45 degrees out of the ecliptic plane. The orientation of the ion tail inferred from the magnetic field measurements agreed with the source lying in Comet Hyakutake&#x27;s orbital plane.

The other team, working on data from the spacecraft&#x27;s ion composition spectrometer, discovered a sudden large spike in detected levels of ionised particles at the same time. The relative abundances of chemical elements detected indicated that the object responsible was definitely a comet.

Based on the &quot;Ulysses&quot; encounter, the comet&#x27;s tail is known to have been at least 570 million km (360 million miles; 3.8 AU) long. This is almost twice as long as the previous longest-known cometary tail, that of the Great Comet of 1843, which was 2 AU long. This record was broken in 2002 by comet 153P/Ikeya–Zhang, which had a tail-length of at least .

=== Composition ===
Terrestrial observers found ethane and methane in the comet, the first time either of these gases had been detected in a comet. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which may imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules. Hyakutake&#x27;s ices must have formed at temperatures of 20 K or less, indicating that it probably formed in a denser-than-average interstellar cloud.

The amount of deuterium in the comet&#x27;s water ices was determined through spectroscopic observations. It was found that the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen (known as the D/H ratio) was about 3, which compares to a value in Earth&#x27;s oceans of about 1.5. It has been proposed that cometary collisions with Earth might have supplied a large proportion of the water in the oceans, but the high D–H ratio measured in Hyakutake and other comets such as Hale–Bopp and Halley&#x27;s Comet have caused problems for this theory.

=== X-ray emission ===
One of the great surprises of Hyakutake&#x27;s passage through the inner Solar System was the discovery that it was emitting X-rays, with observations made using the &quot;ROSAT&quot; satellite revealing very strong X-ray emission. This was the first time a comet had been seen to do so, but astronomers soon found that almost every comet they looked at was emitting X-rays. The emission from Hyakutake was brightest in a crescent shape surrounding the nucleus with the ends of the crescent pointing away from the Sun.

The cause of the X-ray emission is thought to be a combination of two mechanisms. Interactions between energetic solar wind particles and cometary material evaporating from the nucleus is likely to contribute significantly to this effect. Reflection of solar X-rays is seen in other Solar System objects such as the Moon, but a simple calculation assuming even the highest X-ray reflectivity possible per molecule or dust grain is not able to explain the majority of the observed flux from Hyakutake, as the comet&#x27;s atmosphere is very tenuous and diffuse. Observations of comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) with the &quot;Chandra&quot; satellite in 2000 determined that X-rays observed from that comet were produced predominantly by charge exchange collisions between highly charged carbon, oxygen and nitrogen minor ions in the solar wind, and neutral water, oxygen and hydrogen in the comet&#x27;s coma.

=== Nucleus size and activity ===


Radar results from the Arecibo Observatory indicated that the comet nucleus was about across, and surrounded by a flurry of pebble-sized particles ejected at a few metres per second. This size measurement corresponded well with indirect estimates using infrared emission and radio observations.

The small size of the nucleus (Halley&#x27;s Comet is about across, while Comet Hale–Bopp was about across) implies that Hyakutake must have been very active to become as bright as it did. Most comets undergo outgassing from a small proportion of their surface, but most or all of Hyakutake&#x27;s surface seemed to have been active. The dust production rate was estimated to be about 2 kg/s at the beginning of March, rising to 3 kg/s as the comet approached perihelion. During the same period, dust ejection velocities increased from 50 m/s to 500 m/s.

Observations of material being ejected from the nucleus allowed astronomers to establish its rotation period. As the comet passed the Earth, a large puff or blob of material was observed being ejected in the sunward direction every 6.23 hours. A second smaller ejection with the same period confirmed this as the rotation period of the nucleus.

<text>Marshfield is a city in Wood and Marathon counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 18,929 at the 2020 census; of this, 18,119 were in Wood County and 810 were in Marathon County. It is a principal city of the Marshfield–Wisconsin Rapids micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Wood County and had a population of 74,207 in 2020.

It is located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 10, Highway 13 and Highway 97. Marshfield is home to the Marshfield Clinic, a large healthcare system that serves much of Central, Northern, and Western Wisconsin.

==History==
In 1851 and 1853, when the area was still forested, surveyors working for the U.S. government marked all the section corners in the square which now includes Marshfield, Hewitt, and Cameron, working on foot with compass and chain. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township is nearly all Dry land, there being no Swamp of consequence in it. There being too much clay &amp; rocks in it. Particularly that part which contains Fir &amp; Hemlock. The surface is rough &amp; uneven(?) and rather to flat for anything but meadow. There is some good Pine it but too much scattering to make it an object. The Township is well watered with small streams but none of them are of sufficient size for Milling purposes. The streams are lined with Alder &amp; many of them producing good hay. There are no improvements in this Township.&quot;

Marshfield was settled much later than many surrounding towns. DuBay started his trading post east on the Wisconsin River around 1818. A sawmill was built at Nekoosa in 1832. A sawmill was built at Neillsville around 1847. The first building at Marshfield came in 1872.

In 1872 the Wisconsin Central Railway was building the leg of its line from Stevens Point through the forest to what would become Colby, heading north for Lake Superior. The railway needed a supply depot between those two towns, and Marshfield was about midway. At the railroad&#x27;s request, Louis Rivers, his wife and child, and his brother Frank came to the area and started cutting an opening in the forest. They built a two-room log hotel at what is now the corner of Depot and Chestnut streets, with bunks in the west room and tables, benches, bar and store in the east room. That crude building between the stumps was the first permanent structure in Marshfield.

Marshfield&#x27;s name is explained two ways. It might have been named for John J. Marsh, one of the original owners of land in the area. Marshfield might also have been named after Marshfield, Massachusetts, since the Wisconsin Central Railway was financed with money from Massachusetts and other stops along the WC&#x27;s line were named after towns in Massachusetts, including Amherst, Medford and Chelsea.

The first industry was a stave and spoke factory located near the railroad. In 1878 William H. Upham, a &quot;Yankee&quot; migrant of English descent from Massachusetts and later governor of Wisconsin, built a sawmill near the railway, with a millpond. By 1885 he had added a general store, a planing mill, a furniture factory and a flour and feed mill. Other businesses started, too: an alcohol factory, hotels, saloons, stores, newspapers, blacksmith, and a milliner. There were also churches and schools. The city was incorporated in 1883. By 1885 the population exceeded 2,000, ranging from the Uphams in their fine Italianate homes to laborers living in shacks along the railroad.

In 1887, a fire started and got out of control. On June 27, after a dry three weeks, a fire broke out among the drying piles in the Upham mill&#x27;s lumberyard, ignited by a spark from a train. The fire spread, consuming the sawmill and flour mill, and headed south into homes and the business district. Men tried to stop the inferno, even dynamiting stores to create a fire break, but the updraft lifted embers and dropped them onto more buildings. When it was over, 250 buildings were destroyed, but there were no deaths. The next day, Upham announced he would rebuild his businesses. Neighbors in Stevens Point, Spencer and Wisconsin Rapids sent trainloads of supplies. The city ruled that buildings on Central should henceforth be built from brick, even though Marshfield had been largely built on wealth generated by lumber.

The late 1800s saw a burst of railroad building. In 1872 the Wisconsin Central built the first line through town. In 1887 Upham Manufacturing started a line south from town to haul logs from Cameron and Richfield. In 1890 a line to Neillsville was built. In 1891 a line was built from Centralia (now Wisconsin Rapids), another was built to Greenwood, and a third from Wausau to Marshfield came from the north. In 1901 a second line was built from Wisconsin Rapids to Marshfield. In 1903 38 passenger trains stopped daily in Marshfield. So many tracks intersected in the community that Marshfield was nicknamed &quot;Hub City&quot;.

The hub was also agricultural. Dairying began to organize as cheese factories started up, such as the one at Nasonville in 1885. Roddis and then Blum Brothers made wooden cheese boxes in Marshfield. By 1921 the Blum plant was making 3,500 boxes a day. In 1907 the first cold storage plant was built in town, to store local cheese before shipping it by rail to larger markets. Ice cream factories followed, and processing of eggs, chickens, and liquid milk. In 1923 a spokesman for the Soo Line Railroad said that Marshfield shipped more dairy products than any other city in the United States.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital began with six beds in 1890. Operated by the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, it offered early health insurance. Lumbermen could pay a flat rate, and in exchange St. Joseph&#x27;s would care for them in case of injury. In 1916, six local doctors formed a group practice clinic in the second story of the Thiel building downtown, calling themselves Marshfield Clinic.

German immigrants made up two-thirds of Marshfield&#x27;s population in the 1890s. One of the two early newspapers, &quot;Die Demokrat&quot;, was published in German. Many had family back in Germany as World War I approached, and had mixed sympathies. In one of Marshfield&#x27;s old Victorian houses, a once-hidden paper-hanger&#x27;s signature boasts, &quot;...1917, when the Germans licked the World.&quot; Feelings were again mixed during World War II. In the summer of 1945, 243 German POWs were brought in to fill a labor shortage at the canning factory north of the current Wildwood Park.

Woodworking and building continued long after the pines were cut. During World War II, Roddis Lumber and Veneer, which produced plywood and other composites, was &quot;the Allies&#x27; largest pre-fabricator of wood for Liberty ships&quot;. Felker Brothers also produced components for the Liberty ships. The Frey brothers started building Rollohomes in 1947 and were followed by other manufacturers of mobile and modular homes. With the consolidation of dairy farms and the late-2000s recession, some of these industries have contracted, and the medical complex has expanded. Roehl Transport has also become a large enterprise. Around 2011 three new plants opened on the east side of town to process sand for hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells.

<doc id="141813" wikidata="Q3453658" url="?curid=141813" title="Ruthwell">
<text>Ruthwell is a village and parish on the Solway Firth between Dumfries and Annan in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. In 2022 the combined population of Ruthwell and nearby Clarencefield was 400.

Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, gave Ruthwell to his nephew, Sir William Murray, confirmed to Sir John Murray, of Cockpool, in 1509 by King James VI. He was later given the title Earl of Annandale: their landownings in Ruthwell passed by inheritance to Lord Stormont in 1658, and after 1792 to the Earls of Mansfield.

Ruthwell&#x27;s most famous inhabitant was the Rev. Henry Duncan. He was a minister, author, antiquarian, geologist, publisher, philanthropist, artist and businessman. In 1810 Dr Duncan opened the world&#x27;s first commercial savings bank, Ruthwell Savings Bank, paying interest on its investors&#x27; modest savings. The Savings Bank Museum tells the story of early home savings in Britain. The museum is on the site of the Ruthwell Savings Bank.

In 1818, Duncan restored the Ruthwell Cross, one of the finest Anglo-Saxon crosses in the United Kingdom, now in Ruthwell church, which had been broken up in the Scottish Reformation. This cross is remarkable for its sculpture and inscriptions in Latin and Old English, some in Anglo-Saxon runes, which include excerpts from &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;, an Old English poem. After the Disruption of 1843 in the Church of Scotland, Dr. Duncan became one of the founding ministers of the Free Church of Scotland.

During his youth, Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne spent summer holidays at &quot;Clarence Cottage&quot; in the hamlet of Clarencefield near Ruthwell, the home of his maternal aunt. During these visits he would often call to see &quot;Uncle&quot; Henry Duncan at the manse. M&#x27;Cheyne&#x27;s parents were born in this part of Scotland.

The Brow Well is situated west of the village of Ruthwell. This well, stained reddish by the high levels of iron salts in the water, is the place where Scottish poet Robert Burns hoped to cure his final illness by drinking the iron-rich water.

The village was once served by Ruthwell railway station.

<text>An isthmus (; : isthmuses or isthmi) is a narrow piece of land connecting two larger areas across an expanse of water by which they are otherwise separated. A tombolo is an isthmus that consists of a spit or bar, and a strait is the sea counterpart of an isthmus, a narrow stretch of sea between two landmasses that connects two larger bodies of water.

==Isthmus vs land bridge vs peninsula==
&quot;Isthmus&quot; and &quot;land bridge&quot; are related terms, with isthmus having a broader meaning. A land bridge is an isthmus connecting Earth&#x27;s major land masses. The term &quot;land bridge&quot; is usually used in biogeology to describe land connections that used to exist between continents at various times and were important for the migration of people and various species of animals and plants, e.g. Beringia and Doggerland.

An isthmus is a land connection between two bigger landmasses, while a peninsula is rather a land protrusion that is connected to a bigger landmass on one side only and surrounded by water on all other sides. Technically, an isthmus can have canals running from coast to coast (e.g. the Panama Canal), and thus resemble two peninsulas; however, canals are artificial features distinguished from straits.

==Major isthmuses==
The world&#x27;s major isthmuses include:

* Karelian Isthmus in Europe 
* Kra Isthmus in Mainland Southeast Asia 
* Bird&#x27;s Neck Isthmus in Western New Guinea
* Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Middle America 
* Isthmus of Perekop in Ukraine
* Isthmus of Panama in Middle America
* Isthmus of Suez between North Africa and Western Asia

Of historic importance were:

* Isthmus of Catanzaro in Italy
* Isthmus of Corinth in Greece

The cities of Auckland, Madison, Manila, and Seattle are located on isthmuses.

==Canals==
Canals are often built across isthmuses, where they may be a particularly advantageous shortcut for marine transport. For example: 

* The Panama Canal crosses the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
* The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea (part of the Atlantic Ocean) and the Red Sea (part of the Indian Ocean), cutting across the western side of the Isthmus of Suez, formed by the Sinai Peninsula
* The Crinan Canal crosses the isthmus between Loch Crinan and Loch Gilp, which connects the Kintyre peninsula with the rest of Scotland
* The Welland Canal in the Niagara Peninsula (technically an isthmus); it connects Lake Ontario to Lake Erie
* The Corinth Canal connects the Gulf of Corinth in the Ionian Sea with the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean Sea

<doc id="141829" wikidata="Q294568" url="?curid=141829" title="Henryk Górecki">
<text>Henryk Mikołaj Górecki ( , ; 6 December 1933 – 12 November 2010) was a Polish composer of contemporary classical music. According to critic Alex Ross, no recent classical composer has had as much commercial success as Górecki. He became a leading figure of the Polish avant-garde during the post-Stalin cultural thaw. His Anton Webern-influenced serialist works of the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by adherence to dissonant modernism and influenced by Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Kazimierz Serocki. He continued in this direction throughout the 1960s, but by the mid-1970s had changed to a less complex sacred minimalist sound, exemplified by the transitional Symphony No. 2 and the Symphony No. 3 (&quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot;). This later style developed through several other distinct phases, from such works as his 1979 &quot;Beatus Vir&quot;, to the 1981 choral hymn &quot;Miserere&quot;, the 1993 &quot;Kleines Requiem für eine Polka&quot; and his requiem &quot;Good Night&quot;.

Górecki was largely unknown outside Poland until the late 1980s. In 1992, 15 years after it was composed, a recording of his &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot; with soprano Dawn Upshaw and conductor David Zinman, released to commemorate the memory of those lost during the Holocaust, became a worldwide commercial and critical success, selling more than a million copies and vastly exceeding the typical lifetime sales of a recording of symphonic music by a 20th-century composer. Commenting on its popularity, Górecki said, &quot;Perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music ... somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed.&quot; This popular acclaim did not generate wide interest in Górecki&#x27;s other works, and he pointedly resisted the temptation to repeat earlier success, or compose for commercial reward. Nevertheless, his music drew the attention of Australian film director Peter Weir, who used a section of Symphony No. 3 in his 1993 film &quot;Fearless&quot;.

Apart from two brief periods studying in Paris and a short time living in Berlin, Górecki spent most of his life in southern Poland.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Henryk Górecki was born on 6 December 1933, in the village of Czernica, in present-day Silesian Voivodeship, southwest Poland. His family lived modestly, though both parents had a love of music. His father Roman (1904–1991) worked at the goods office of a local railway station, but was an amateur musician, while his mother Otylia (1909–1935), played piano. Otylia died when her son was just two years old, and many of his early works were dedicated to her memory. Henryk developed an interest in music from an early age, though he was discouraged by both his father and new stepmother to the extent that he was not allowed to play his mother&#x27;s old piano. He persisted, and in 1943 was allowed to take violin lessons with Paweł Hajduga, a local amateur musician, instrument maker, sculptor, painter, poet and &quot;chłopski filozof&quot; (peasant philosopher).

In 1937, Górecki fell while playing in a neighbor’s yard and dislocated his hip. The resulting suppurative inflammation was misdiagnosed by a local doctor, and delay in proper treatment led to tubercular complications in the bone. The illness went largely untreated for two years, by which time permanent damage had been sustained. He spent the following twenty months in a hospital in Germany, where he underwent four operations. Górecki continued to suffer ill health throughout his life and as a result said he had &quot;talked with death often&quot;.

In the early 1950s, Górecki studied in the Szafrankowie Brothers State School of Music in Rybnik. Between 1955 and 1960, he studied at the State Higher School of Music in Katowice. In 1965 He joined the faculty of his alma mater in Katowice, where he was made a lecturer in 1968, and then rose to provost before resigning in 1979.

===Rydułtowy and Katowice===

Between 1951 and 1953, Górecki taught 10- and 11-year-olds at a school suburb of Rydułtowy, in southern Poland. In 1952, he began a teacher training course at the Intermediate School of Music in Rybnik, where he studied clarinet, violin, piano, and music theory. Through intensive studying, Górecki finished the four-year course in just under three years. During this time, he began to compose his own pieces, mostly songs and piano miniatures. Occasionally, he attempted more ambitious projects—in 1952, he adapted the Adam Mickiewicz ballad &quot;Świtezianka&quot;, though it was left unfinished. Górecki&#x27;s life during this time was often difficult. Teaching posts were generally badly paid, while the shortage economy made manuscript paper at times difficult and expensive to acquire. With no access to radio, Górecki kept up to date with music by weekly purchases of such periodicals as &quot;Ruch muzyczny&quot; (&quot;Musical Movement&quot;) and &quot;Muzyka&quot;, and by purchasing at least one score a week.

Górecki continued his formal study of music at the Academy of Music in Katowice, where he studied under the composer Bolesław Szabelski, a former student of Karol Szymanowski. Szabelski drew much of his inspiration from Polish highland folklore. He encouraged Górecki&#x27;s growing confidence and independence by giving him considerable space in which to develop his own ideas and projects; several of Górecki&#x27;s early pieces were straightforwardly neo-classical, during a period when Górecki was also absorbing the techniques of twelve-tone serialism. He graduated from the Academy with honours in 1960.

===Professorship===
In 1975, Górecki was promoted to professor of composition at the State Higher School of Music in Katowice, where his students included Eugeniusz Knapik, Andrzej Krzanowski, Rafał Augustyn, and Górecki&#x27;s son, Mikołaj. Around this time, he came to believe the Polish Communist authorities were interfering too much in the academy&#x27;s activities, and called them &quot;little dogs always yapping&quot;. As a senior administrator but not a member of the Party, he was in almost perpetual conflict with the authorities in his efforts to protect his school, staff and students from undue political influence. In 1979, he resigned from his post in protest at the government&#x27;s refusal to allow Pope John Paul II to visit Katowice, and formed a local branch of the &quot;Catholic Intellectuals Club&quot;, an organisation devoted to the struggle against the Communist Party (Polish United Workers&#x27; Party).

In 1981, he composed his &quot;Miserere&quot; for a large choir in remembrance of police violence against the Solidarity movement. In 1987, he composed &quot;Totus Tuus&quot; for John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Poland.

==Style and compositions==
Górecki&#x27;s music covers a variety of styles, but tends towards relative harmonic and rhythmical simplicity. He is considered a founder of the &quot;New Polish School&quot;. According to Terry Teachout, Górecki&#x27;s &quot;more conventional array of compositional techniques includes both elaborate counterpoint and the ritualistic repetition of melodic fragments and harmonic patterns.&quot;

Górecki&#x27;s first works, dating from the last half of the 1950s, were in the avant-garde style of Webern and other serialists of that time. Some of these twelve-tone and serial pieces include &quot;Epitaph&quot; (1958), First Symphony (1959), and &quot;Scontri&quot; (1960). At that time, Górecki&#x27;s reputation was not lagging behind that of Penderecki and his status was confirmed in 1960s when &quot;Monologhi&quot; won a first prize. Even until 1962, he was firmly ensconced in the minds of the Warsaw Autumn public as a leader of the Polish Modern School, alongside Penderecki.

Danuta Mirka has shown that Górecki&#x27;s compositional techniques in the 1960s were often based on geometry, including axes, figures, one- and two-dimensional patterns, and especially symmetry. She proposes the term &quot;geometrical period&quot; for his works between 1962 and 1970. Building on Krzysztof Droba&#x27;s classifications, she further divides this period into two phases: &quot;the phase of sonoristic means&quot; (1962–63) and &quot;the phase of reductive constructicism&quot; (1964–70).

During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, Górecki progressively moved away from his early career as radical modernist, and began to compose in a more traditional, romantic mode of expression. His change of style was viewed as an affront to the then avant-garde establishment, and though he continued to receive commissions from various Polish agencies, by the mid-1970s Górecki was no longer regarded as a composer of importance. In the words of one critic, his &quot;new material was no longer cerebral and sparse; rather, it was intensely expressive, persistently rhythmic and often richly colored in the darkest of orchestral hues&quot;.

===Early modernist works===
The first public performances of Górecki&#x27;s music in Katowice in February 1958 programmed works clearly displaying the influence of Szymanowski and Bartók. The Silesian State Philharmonic in Katowice held a concert devoted entirely to the 24-year-old Górecki&#x27;s music. The event led to a commission to write for the Warsaw Autumn Festival. The &quot;Epitafium&quot; (&quot;Epitaph&quot;) he submitted marked a new phase in his development, and was said to represent &quot;the most colourful and vibrant expression of the new Polish wave&quot;. The festival announced Górecki&#x27;s arrival on the international scene, and he quickly became a favorite of the West&#x27;s avant-garde musical elite. In 1991, the music critic James Wierzbicki wrote that at this time &quot;Górecki was seen as a Polish heir to the new aesthetic of post-Webernian serialism, with his taut structures, lean orchestrations and painstaking concern for the logical ordering of pitches&quot;.

Górecki wrote his First Symphony in 1959, and graduated with honours from the Academy the next year. At the 1960 Warsaw Autumn Festival, his &quot;Scontri&quot; for orchestra caused a sensation among critics due to its use of sharp contrasts and harsh articulations. By 1961, Górecki was at the forefront of the Polish avant-garde, having absorbed the modernism of Webern, Iannis Xenakis and Pierre Boulez, and his Symphony No. 1 gained international acclaim at the Paris Biennial Festival of Youth. He moved to Paris to continue his studies, and while there was influenced by contemporaries including Olivier Messiaen, Roman Palester, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Górecki began to lecture at the Academy of Music in Katowice in 1968, where he taught score-reading, orchestration and composition. In 1972, he was promoted to assistant professor, and developed a fearsome reputation among his students for his often blunt personality. According to the Polish composer Rafał Augustyn, &quot;When I began to study under Górecki it felt as if someone had dumped a pail of ice-cold water over my head. He could be ruthless in his opinions. The weak fell by the wayside but those who graduated under him became, without exception, respected composers&quot;. Górecki admits, &quot;For quite a few years, I was a pedagogue, a teacher in the music academy, and my students would ask me many, many things, including how to write and what to write. I always answered this way: If you can live without music for 2 or 3 days, then don&#x27;t write...It might be better to spend time with a girl or with a beer...If you cannot live without music, then write.” Due to his commitments as a teacher and also because of bouts of ill health, he composed only intermittently during this period.

===Move from modernism===

By the early 1970s, Górecki had begun to move away from his earlier radical modernism, and was working toward a more traditional mode of expression dominated by the human voice. His change of style affronted the avant-garde establishment, and although various Polish agencies continued to commission works from him, Górecki ceased to be viewed as an important composer. One critic later wrote, &quot;Górecki&#x27;s new material was no longer cerebral and sparse; rather, it was intensely expressive, persistently rhythmic and often richly colored in the darkest of orchestral hues&quot;. Górecki progressively rejected the dissonance, serialism and sonorism that had brought him early recognition, and pared and simplified his work. He began to favor large slow gestures and the repetition of small motifs.
The Symphony No. 2, &quot;Copernican&quot; &quot;(II Symfonia Kopernikowska)&quot;, was written in 1972 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Written in a monumental style for solo soprano, baritone, choir and orchestra, it features text from Psalms no. 145, 6 and 135 as well as an excerpt from Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;. It is in two movements, and a typical performance lasts 35 minutes. It was commissioned by the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York, and presented an early opportunity for Górecki to reach an audience outside Poland. As was usual, he undertook extensive research on the subject, and was in particular concerned with the philosophical implications of Copernicus&#x27;s discovery, not all of which he viewed as positive. As the historian Norman Davies commented, &quot;His discovery of the earth&#x27;s motion round the sun caused the most fundamental revolutions possible in the prevailing concepts of the human predicament&quot;.

By the mid-1980s, Górecki began to attract a more international audience, and in 1989 the London Sinfonietta held a weekend of concerts in which his work was played alongside that of the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke. In 1990, the American Kronos Quartet commissioned and recorded his First String Quartet, &quot;Already It Is Dusk&quot;, Op. 62, an occasion that marked the beginning of a long relationship between the quartet and Górecki.

Górecki&#x27;s most popular piece is his Third Symphony, also known as the &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot; &quot;(Symfonia pieśni żałosnych)&quot;. The work is slow and contemplative, and each of its three movements is for orchestra and solo soprano. The libretto for the first movement is taken from a 15th-century lament, while the second movement uses the words of a teenage girl, Helena Błażusiakówna (Helena Błażusiak), which she wrote on the wall of a Gestapo prison cell in Zakopane to invoke the protection of the Virgin Mary.

The third uses the text of a Silesian folk song which describes the pain of a mother searching for a son killed in the Silesian Uprisings. The symphony&#x27;s dominant themes are motherhood and separation through war. While the first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, the second is from that of a child separated from a parent.

The completion of Górecki&#x27;s Fourth Symphony, subtitled &quot;Tansman Episodes&quot;, was delayed for many years, partly by Górecki&#x27;s unease at his newfound fame. Indeed, it had not even been orchestrated when he died in 2010, and his son Mikołaj completed it after his death from the piano score and notes left behind by his father. It uses similar repetition techniques as the Second and Third Symphonies, but to very different effect; for example, its opening consists of a series of very loud, repeated cells that together spell out the name of the composer Alexandre Tansman via a musical cryptogram, punctuated with heavy strokes on the bass drum and clashing bitonality between the chords of A and E-flat.

Despite the Third Symphony&#x27;s success, Górecki resisted the temptation to compose again in that style, and, according to AllMusic, continued to work, not to further his career or reputation, but largely &quot;in response to inner creative dictates&quot;.

In February 1994, the Kronos Quartet performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music four concerts honoring postmodern revival of interest in new music. The first three concerts featured string quartets and the works of three living composers: two Americans (Philip Glass and George Crumb) and one Pole (Górecki).

Górecki&#x27;s later work includes a 1992 commission for the Kronos Quartet, &quot;Songs are Sung&quot;; &quot;Concerto-Cantata&quot; (written in 1992 for flute and orchestra); and &quot;Kleines Requiem für eine Polka&quot; (1993 for piano and 13 instruments). &quot;Concerto-Cantata&quot; and &quot;Kleines Requiem für eine Polka&quot; have been recorded by the London Sinfonietta and the Schönberg Ensemble, respectively. &quot;Songs are Sung&quot; is his third string quartet, inspired by a poem by Velimir Khlebnikov. When asked why it took almost 13 years to finish, he replied, &quot;I continued to hold back from releasing it to the world. I don’t know why.&quot;

===Last decade===
During the last decade of his life, Górecki suffered from frequent illnesses. His Symphony No. 4 (oP. 85, 2006) was due to be premiered in London in 2010 by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, but the event was cancelled due to the composer&#x27;s ill health. He died on 12 November 2010, in his home city of Katowice, from complications arising from a lung infection. Reacting to his death, the head of the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music, Professor Eugeniusz Knapik, said &quot;Górecki&#x27;s work is like a huge boulder that lies in our path and forces us to make a spiritual and emotional effort&quot;. Adrian Thomas, professor of music at Cardiff University, said, &quot;The strength and startling originality of Górecki&#x27;s character shone through his music ... Yet he was an intensely private man, sometimes impossible, with a strong belief in family, a great sense of humour, a physical courage in the face of unrelenting illness, and a capacity for firm friendship&quot;. He was married to Jadwiga, a piano teacher. His daughter, Anna Górecka-Stanczyk, is a pianist, and his son, Mikołaj Górecki, is a composer. He was survived by five grandchildren.

President of the Republic of Poland Bronisław Komorowski awarded Górecki the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest honour, a month before his death. The Order was presented by Komorowski&#x27;s wife in Górecki&#x27;s hospital bed. Earlier, Górecki received the Order of Polonia Restituta II class and III class and the Order of St. Gregory the Great.

The world premiere of his Symphony No. 4 took place on 12 April 2014. It was performed, as originally scheduled in 2010, by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall, London, but with Andrey Boreyko conducting instead of Marin Alsop. Symphony No. 4 is an extensive, 37-minute composition set for an approximately 100-person orchestra with piano and organ obbligato. The composer left a cryptogram that explains the way he built the theme for the symphony using musical letters from the first and last names of Alexandre Tansman.

In 2004, Górecki left the piano reduction of &quot;Two Tristan Postludes and Chorale&quot; for orchestra, which received Op. 82. It was orchestrated by his son Mikolaj Górecki and premiered at the Tansman Festival, on October 16, 2016, at the Polish Radio Witold Lutosławski Studio Hall in Warsaw, by Jerzy Maksymiuk and the Sinfonia Varsovia orchestra.

===Use in film and television===
Some of Górecki&#x27;s music has been adapted for film soundtracks, most notably fragments of his &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot;. They are featured in Peter Weir&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Fearless&quot;, Julian Schnabel&#x27;s 1996 biographical drama film &quot;Basquiat&quot;, Shona Auerbach&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Seven&quot;, Jaime Marqués&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Ladrones&quot;, Terrence Malick&#x27;s 2012 experimental romantic drama &quot;To the Wonder&quot;, Paolo Sorrentino&#x27;s 2013 art drama film &quot;The Great Beauty,&quot; Felix van Groeningen&#x27;s 2018 biographical film &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, and Malick&#x27;s 2019 historical drama &quot;A Hidden Life&quot;. It has also appeared on television in numerous TV shows, including the American crime drama television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, American TV series &quot;Legion&quot;, crime thriller television series &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, and the historical drama &quot;The Crown&quot;. In 2017, Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite set the first movement of the &quot;Symphony of Sorrowful Songs&quot; as a ballet, &quot;Flight Pattern&quot;. In 2022, she set the whole symphony as a larger work, &quot;Light of Passage&quot;. French filmmaker Bertrand Blier used &quot;Beatus Vir&quot; in his 1996 film &quot;My Man&quot;.

==Critical opinion==
When placing Górecki in context, musicologists and critics generally compare his work with such composers as Olivier Messiaen and Charles Ives. He himself said that he also felt kindred with such figures as Bach, Mozart and Haydn, though he felt most affinity with Franz Schubert, particularly in terms of tonal design and treatment of basic materials. In the Dutch documentary film series &quot;Toonmeesters&quot;, of which episode 4 (1994) is about Górecki, he likened playing Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart every day to eating healthy whole grain bread every day. In the same episode he said that in Mozart and Schubert he found many new things, new musical answers.

Since Górecki moved away from serialism and dissonance in the 1970s, he is frequently compared to composers such as Arvo Pärt, John Tavener and Giya Kancheli. Although none have admitted to common influence, the term holy minimalism is often used to group these composers, due to their shared simplified approach to texture, tonality and melody, in works often reflecting deeply held religious beliefs. Górecki&#x27;s modernist techniques are also compared to those of Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Paul Hindemith and Dmitri Shostakovich.

In 1994, Boguslaw M. Maciejewski published the first biography of Górecki, &quot;Górecki – His Music And Our Times&quot;. It includes a great deal of detail about his life and work, including that he achieved cult status thanks to valuable exposure on Classic FM.

Discussing his audience in a 1994 interview, Górecki said,
I do not choose my listeners. What I mean is, I never write for my listeners. I think about my audience, but I am not writing for them. I have something to tell them, but the audience must also put a certain effort into it. But I never wrote for an audience and never will write for because you have to give the listener something and he has to make an effort in order to understand certain things. If I were thinking of my audience and one likes this, one likes that, one likes another thing, I would never know what to write. Let every listener choose that which interests him. I have nothing against one person liking Mozart or Shostakovich or Leonard Bernstein, but doesn&#x27;t like Górecki. That&#x27;s fine with me. I, too, like certain things.

Górecki received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Concordia professor Wolfgang Bottenberg called him one of the &quot;most renowned and respected composers of our time&quot;, and said that Górecki&#x27;s music &quot;represents the most positive aspects of the closing years of our century, as we try to heal the wounds inflicted by the violence and intolerance of our times. It will endure into the next millennium and inspire other composers&quot;. In 2007, Górecki claimed 32nd place on the list of Top 100 Living Geniuses compiled by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. In 2008, he received an honorary doctorate from the Academy of Music in Kraków. At the awarding ceremony a selection of his choral works was performed by the choir of the city&#x27;s Franciscan Church.

<text>The Carlyle Group Inc. is an American multinational company with operations in private equity, alternative asset management and financial services. As of 2023, the company had $426 billion of assets under management.

Carlyle specializes in private equity, real assets, and private credit. One of the world&#x27;s largest investment firms, it ranked first among private equity firms by capital raised from 2010-2015, according to the PEI 300 index. 

In June 2024, The Carlyle Group ranked sixth in Private Equity International&#x27;s PEI 300 ranking among the world&#x27;s largest private equity firms.

Founded in 1987 in Washington, D.C., the company has nearly 2,200 employees in 28 offices on four continents . On May 3, 2012, Carlyle completed a million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as a boutique investment bank by five partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David Rubenstein, Daniel A. D&#x27;Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum. The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City (named for Thomas Carlyle) where Norris and Rubenstein had planned the new investment business. Rubenstein, a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D&#x27;Aneillo had worked together at Marriott Corporation; Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Rosenbaum left in the first year and Norris departed in 1995. Rubenstein, Conway and D&#x27;Aneillo remain active in the business. Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital deal-by-deal to pursue leveraged buyout investments, including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi&#x27;s. The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including, in 1991, a $500 million investment in Citigroup by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family.

Carlyle developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems. Carlyle would sell the business to Tracor in October 1994. Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993. Carlyle sold Magnavox for about $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman. Carlyle&#x27;s most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle&#x27;s largest investment to that point. Carlyle completed an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001, then sold the rest of the stock in April 2004. In more recent years, Carlyle has invested less in the defense industry.

===Carlyle in the early 2000s===
Carlyle&#x27;s 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the &quot;guest of honor&quot;, and that they were investors in Carlyle-managed funds. Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle&#x27;s $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time. These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle&#x27;s funds in October 2001, just after the September 11 attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group&#x27;s name became impolitic.

Buyouts declined after the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001. But after the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain high-yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex, the third-largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex&#x27;s purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006.

Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, replaced Frank Carlucci as chairman of Carlyle in January 2003. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008. The hiring of Gerstner was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm. At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier, had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.

Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004. Carlyle&#x27;s investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.
As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as KKR, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.

The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company&#x27;s co-founder and a former president of Enron.

In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale&#x27;s former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale&#x27;s chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.

Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman &amp; Friedman, KKR and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout. Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010 as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.

=== Carlyle after the global financial crisis===
In 2011, Carlyle acquired AlpInvest Partners in a joint venture with the firm&#x27;s management, entering into a new line of business managing fund of funds, secondary investments and co-investments. Two years later, in 2013, Carlyle acquired the remaining ownership stake in AlpInvest after which that business became a wholly-owned subsidiary.

===Since 2017===
In October 2017, the Carlyle Group announced that its founders would remain executive chairmen on the board of directors but step down as the day-to-day leaders of the firm; they named Glenn Youngkin and Kewsong Lee to succeed them, as co-CEOs, effective January 1, 2018.

In October 2017, the Carlyle Group made a $500 million investment in the brand Supreme valuing the company at $1 billion. In 2020, the investment was acquired by VF Corporation, which owns The North Face, Timberland, and Vans for $2.1 billion.

On October 14, 2019, the Carlyle Group and private equity firm Stellex Capital Management announced it had completed the acquisition and merger of shipbuilder Vigor Industrial LLC, Portland, Ore., and MHI Holdings LLC, a ship repair and maintenance company based in Norfolk, Va. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

On June 2, 2020, the Carlyle Group and T&amp;D Holdings reported that they had concluded their purchase of a 76.6% stake in Fortitude Group Holdings, the latter of which comprises Fortitude Re, and American International Company Inc. Also in June 2020, Unison had been purchased by the Carlyle Group and Unison management strategic investment company.

In September 2020, the Carlyle Group acquired a majority stake in Minneapolis-based sanitizing machine maker Victory Innovations. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

At the end of September 2020, Youngkin retired from the firm, stating his intention to focus on community and public service; this left Lee as the sole CEO. Youngkin would later go on to be elected Governor of Virginia in the state&#x27;s 2021 gubernatorial election.

In January 2021, the Carlyle Group acquired a majority stake in Jagex, a British video game development studio known for the massively multiplayer online game &quot;RuneScape&quot;.

In May 2021, the Carlyle Group entered a partnership agreement with SPX Capital to enter the Brazilian market. The Carlyle Group&#x27;s employees would join SPX Capital to establish its private equity strategy. SPX Capital would also become a subadvisor to the Carlyle Group&#x27;s $776 million buyout fund focused on South America.

In March 2022, the Carlyle Group acquired Dainese - an Italian motorcycle kit and clothing company from Investcorp. Following this in May 2022, the Carlyle Group announced the acquisition deal of US government contractor for cyber security and IT defence, ManTech International. The deal, worth $3.9 billion, will include the firm to buyout shares at $96 a share, representing a 32% premium to ManTech&#x27;s closing price on February 2, 2022. The acquisition aimed to increase the firms steady stream of recurring revenue.

In August 2022, the Carlyle Group acquired Abingworth, a transatlantic bioscience investment firm.

In November 2022, it was announced the Carlyle Group has acquired the international marketing agency, Incubeta.

In February 2023, Harvey Schwartz was appointed CEO of the group, replacing Kewsong Lee, who left the position abruptly the previous summer following a power struggle with the co-founders.

In 2023, Carlyle invested in Anthesis Group, a provider of sustainability services for businesses.

In September 2023, it was announced Carlyle initiated a tender offer to acquire the Tokyo-headquartered paper and ink chemicals manufacturer, Seiko PMC from its parent company DIC Corporation for $221 million.

In June 2024, Carlyle announced the formation of a new Mediterranean-focused oil and gas company, led by former BP CEO Tony Hayward, after acquiring Energean&#x27;s assets in Egypt, Italy, and Croatia for up to $945 million.

In October 2024, Carlyle Group strengthened its partnership with Korea Investment &amp; Securities to discover attractive global products on the one-year anniversary of its strategic alliance.

In February 2025, The Carlyle Group entered India&#x27;s auto components market by acquiring a controlling stake in an entity formed through the merger of Indian auto parts companies Highway Industries and Roop Automotives.

In February 2025, Carlyle Group announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Bluebird Bio to be acquired by a fund managed by SK Capital Partners.

===Ownership changes===
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle&#x27;s management company for $175 million. The investment was valued at about $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.

In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.

In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubadala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money &quot;with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights.&quot; The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development, was later withdrawn.

In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed about $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle&#x27;s three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D&#x27;Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company&#x27;s largest shareholders.

In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.

The Carlyle Group has been a majority shareholder of Seidor since August 2024.

=== Global Private Equity ===

Carlyle&#x27;s Corporate Private Equity division manages a series of leveraged buyout and growth capital investment funds with specific geographic or industry focuses. Carlyle invests primarily in the following industries: aerospace, defense &amp; government services, consumer &amp; retail, energy, financial services, health care, industrial, real estate, technology and business services, telecommunications &amp; media, and transportation.

Carlyle&#x27;s Corporate Private Equity segment advises 23 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, with $75 billion in Assets Under Management (&quot;AUM&quot;) as of March 31, 2018.

Carlyle&#x27;s Real Assets segment advises 11 U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, two infrastructure funds, two power funds, an international energy fund, and four Legacy Energy funds (funds that Carlyle jointly advises with Riverstone). The segment also includes nine funds advised by NGP. The Real Assets segment had about $44 billion in AUM as of March 31, 2018.

=== Global Credit ===

Carlyle&#x27;s Global Credit pursues investment opportunities across various segments of private credit managing $194 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2024. Global Credit&#x27;s key areas of focus are:

* Liquid Credit, managing collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles.
* Direct Lending, focused on leveraged finance investments primarily in private equity-owned companies.
* Opportunistic Credit, which invests in mezzanine capital and distressed securities
* Real Assets Credit, investing in debt securities in infrastructure projects
* Asset-based lending

=== Investment Solutions - AlpInvest Partners ===
Carlyle&#x27;s Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity through its subsidiary, AlpInvest Partners.

AlpInvest Partners is a global private equity asset manager with over $85 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2024. The firm invests on behalf of more than 500 institutional investors from North America, Asia, Europe, South America and Africa.

AlpInvest operates through three core investment teams: 
* Primary Fund Investments
* Secondary and Portfolio Finance investments
* Co-Investments.

AlpInvest&#x27;s investments span a broad spectrum of private market strategies including: large buyout, middle-market buyout, private credit, venture capital, growth capital, mezzanine, distressed and energy investments, including sustainable energy investments.

As of the end of 2024, the firm had invested in more than 800 private equity funds managed by more than 350 private equity firms. According to the PEI 300, AlpInvest ranked among the 50 largest private equity firms globally.

Since 2011, AlpInvest has operated as a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm. Prior to 2011, AlpInvest has been owned through a joint venture of its two clients, the Dutch pension funds (ABP and PFZW).

Founded in 1999, AlpInvest has offices in New York, Amsterdam, London, Hong Kong, Indianapolis, Singapore and Tokyo with over 100 investment professionals and over 260 employees.

Carlyle had previously acquired a real estate fund of funds group, Metropolitan Real Estate, to provide investors with access to multi-manager real estate funds and strategies with more than 85 fund managers in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Metropolitan was sold in 2021 to BentallGreenOak.

==Subsidiaries and joint-ventures==
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.

===Carlyle Capital Corporation===
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation – established in August 2006 for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities – defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expected its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle&#x27;s 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street&#x27;s primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.

On March 12, 2008, BBC News Online reported that &quot;instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset&quot; and that Carlyle Capital Corp. &quot;will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets.&quot; On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey for a &quot;compulsory winding up proceeding&quot; to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.

The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be &quot;minimal from a financial standpoint&quot;.

In September 2017, the court ruled that Carlyle had no liability in the lawsuit.

==In documentaries==
Carlyle has been profiled in Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and William Karel&#x27;s &quot;The World According to Bush&quot;.

In &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group. Moore focused on Carlyle&#x27;s connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group &quot;gained&quot; from the September 11 attacks because it owned military contractor United Defense. A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other private equity firms.

In &quot;The World According to Bush&quot;, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden&#x27;s estranged brother, at Carlyle&#x27;s annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.

<text>Peter Seeger (May 3, 1919 – January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer-songwriter, musician and social activist. He was a fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, and had a string of hit records in the early 1950s as a member of The Weavers, notably their recording of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Goodnight, Irene,&quot; which topped the charts for 14 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, workers&#x27; rights, counterculture, environmental causes, and ending the Vietnam War.

Among the prolific songwriter&#x27;s best-known songs are &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; (with additional lyrics by Joe Hickerson), &quot;If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)&quot; (with Lee Hays of the Weavers), &quot;Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&quot; (also with Hays), and &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)&quot;, which has been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement. &quot;Flowers&quot; was a hit recording for The Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963) while The Byrds had a number one hit with &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; in 1965.

Seeger was one of the folk singers responsible for popularizing the spiritual &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; (also recorded by Joan Baez and many other singer-activists), which became the acknowledged anthem of the civil rights movement, soon after folk singer and activist Guy Carawan introduced it at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. In the PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; episode &quot;Pete Seeger: The Power of Song&quot;, Seeger said it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional &quot;We will overcome&quot; to the more singable &quot;We shall overcome&quot;.

==Early life==
Seeger was born on May 3, 1919, at French Hospital in New York City. His family, which Seeger called &quot;enormously Christian, in the Puritan, Calvinist New England tradition&quot;, traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a physician from Württemberg, Germany, had emigrated to America during the American Revolution and married into the old New England family of Parsons in the 1780s.

Seeger&#x27;s father, the Harvard-trained composer and musicologist Charles Louis Seeger Jr., was born in Mexico City to American parents. Charles established the first musicology curriculum in the United States at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1910s. He also helped organize the American Musicological Society and was a key founder of the academic discipline of ethnomusicology. Peter&#x27;s mother, Constance de Clyver Seeger (née Edson), raised in Tunisia and trained at the Paris Conservatory of Music, was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the Juilliard School.

In 1911, Charles was hired to establish the music department at UC Berkeley, but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken pacifism during World War I. Charles and Constance moved back east, making their base of operations on the estate of Charles&#x27;s parents in Patterson, New York, about 50 miles north of New York City. When Peter was eighteen months old, Charles and Constance set out with him and his two older brothers in a homemade trailer to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South. Upon their return, Constance taught violin and Charles taught composition at the New York Institute of Musical Art (later Juilliard), whose president, family friend Frank Damrosch, was Constance&#x27;s adoptive &quot;uncle&quot;. Charles also taught part-time at the New School for Social Research.

At four, Peter was sent away to boarding school, but was brought home a year and a half later when his parents learned the school failed to inform them that he had contracted scarlet fever. He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York before being sent away to another boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Career and money tensions led to marital problems between Charles and Constance. When Charles discovered in 1927 that Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, he became enraged and a series of separations and temporary reconciliations ensued. Peter was eight at the time of the first marital split. As Seeger biographer David King Dunaway writes, &quot;Like many children of divorce, Peter was caught between parents and developed an aversion to family quarrels.&quot; In 1932, Charles married his composition student and assistant, Ruth Crawford, now considered by many to be one of the most important modernist composers of the 20th century. Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to Carl Sandburg&#x27;s influential folk song anthology, the &quot;American Songbag&quot; (1927), and later created original settings for eight of Sandburg&#x27;s poems. Beginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government&#x27;s Farm Resettlement program, the WPA&#x27;s Federal Music Project (1938–1940) and the wartime Pan American Union. After World War II, he taught ethnomusicology at UC Berkeley and Yale University.

In 1935, Peter was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun (CRS), the George E. Jonas Foundation&#x27;s international leadership camp, held every summer in upstate New York. He remained a loyal alumnus through the decades and attended a CRS event at age 93 in July 2012.

Peter&#x27;s eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, would go on to become a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the Dalton School in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at Fieldston Lower School in the Bronx. Peter&#x27;s uncle, Alan Seeger, a noted American war poet (&quot;I Have a Rendezvous with Death&quot;), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in World War I. All four of Peter&#x27;s half-siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage—Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny)—became folk singers. Peggy Seeger, a well-known performer in her own right, married British folk singer and activist Ewan MacColl. Mike Seeger was a founder of the New Lost City Ramblers, one of whose members, John Cohen, married Peter&#x27;s half-sister Penny, also a talented singer, who died young. Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folk songs for children.

==Career==
===Musical development===
Despite being classical musicians, Peter&#x27;s parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, he enrolled in the Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut, from which he graduated in 1936. During the summer of 1935, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo for the first time at the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, as he related in an April 1963 interview on Folk Music Worldwide. The festival was organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects. The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:

watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford&#x27;s daughter would later recall, those country people &quot;held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park.&quot;

For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a &quot;conversion experience&quot;. Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic plucking technique from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo. The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played &quot;Cindy&quot; and &quot;Old Joe Clark&quot; with his students Charlie and Jackson Pollock; friends from the &quot;hillbilly&quot; recording industry; and avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell. It was at one of Benton&#x27;s parties that Pete heard &quot;John Henry&quot; for the first time. 

Seeger enrolled at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938. He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York state with the Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater &quot;inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico&quot;. One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An October 2, 1939 &quot;Daily Worker&quot; article reported on the Puppeteers&#x27; six-week tour this way:

That fall, Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father&#x27;s, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger&#x27;s job was to help Lomax sift through commercial &quot;race&quot; and &quot;hillbilly&quot; music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–1953). Lomax also encouraged Seeger&#x27;s folk-singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray&#x27;s weekly Columbia Broadcasting show &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; (1940–41) alongside Josh White, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer&#x27;s Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; was unique in having a racially integrated cast. The show was a success, but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. 

From 1942 to 1945, Seeger served in the U.S. Army as an Entertainment Specialist, eventually attaining the rank of corporal. He had been initially trained as an airplane mechanic, but was reassigned to entertain American troops with music, including in the South Pacific. Later, when people asked him what he did in the war, he always answered, &quot;I strummed my banjo.&quot; During the war, he also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by Norman Corwin.

In 1949, Seeger worked as the vocal instructor for the progressive City and Country School in Greenwich Village, New York.

===Early activism===
In 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the Young Communist League (YCL), then at the height of its influence. In 1942, he joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), but left in 1949.

In early 1941, while still only 21, Seeger started performing as a member of the Almanac Singers along with Millard Lampell, Cisco Houston, Woody Guthrie, Butch Hawes and Bess Lomax Hawes, and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of 78s on Keynote and other labels: &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), &quot;Talking Union&quot;, and an album each of sea shanties and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines, such as &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil,&quot; that were sharply critical of Roosevelt&#x27;s unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which maintained that the war was &quot;phony&quot; and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the time, as did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the Popular Front, which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL&#x27;s members still smarted from Roosevelt and Churchill&#x27;s arms embargo on Loyalist Spain (which Roosevelt later called a mistake), and the alliance frayed in the confusing welter of events.

A June 16, 1941, review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which, under its owner, Henry Luce, had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs&#x27; &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; album, accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called &quot;the mendacious Moscow tune&quot; that &quot;Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J.P. Morgan war&quot;. Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album &quot;in bad taste&quot;, though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly, as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government Carl Joachim Friedrich, an adviser on domestic propaganda to the United States military. In a review in the June 1941 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, entitled &quot;The Poison in Our System&quot;, he pronounced &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; &quot;strictly subversive and illegal&quot;, &quot;whether Communist or Nazi financed&quot;, and &quot;a matter for the attorney general&quot;, observing further that &quot;mere&quot; legal &quot;suppression&quot; would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison, the poison being folk music and the ease with which it could be spread.

While the U.S. had not officially declared war on the Axis powers in mid-1941 (and would not do so until the Pearl Harbor attack that December), the country was energetically producing arms and ammunition for its allies overseas. Despite the boom in manufacturing this concerted rearming effort brought, African Americans were barred from working in defense plants. Racial tensions rose as Black labor leaders (such as A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin) and their white allies began organizing protests and marches. To combat this social unrest, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (the Fair Employment Act) on 25 June 1941. The order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union, at which time the Communist Party quickly directed its members to get behind the draft and forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war—angering some leftists. Copies of &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot; were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors. The Almanac Singers&#x27; &quot;Talking Union&quot; album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by Folkways (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year, the Almanacs issued &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:

Seeger&#x27;s critics, however, continued to bring up the Almanacs&#x27; repudiated &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot;. In 1942, a year after the &quot;John Doe&quot; album&#x27;s brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York &quot;World Telegram&quot; (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich&#x27;s 1941 article &quot;The Poison in Our System&quot; was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and Henry Luce&#x27;s right-hand man, C. D. Jackson, Vice President of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, had founded &quot;to combat all the Nazi, fascist, communist, pacifist&quot; antiwar groups in the United States).

After returning from WWII service, Seeger and others established People&#x27;s Songs, conceived as a nationwide organization with branches on both coasts and designed to &quot;create, promote and distribute songs of labor and the American People&quot;. With Pete Seeger as its director, People&#x27;s Songs worked for the 1948 presidential campaign of Roosevelt&#x27;s former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, Henry A. Wallace, who ran as a third-party candidate on the Progressive Party ticket. Despite attracting enormous crowds nationwide, Wallace did not win any electoral votes. Following the election, he was excoriated for accepting campaign help from Communists and fellow travelers, such as Seeger and singer Paul Robeson.

===Spanish Civil War songs===
Seeger had been a fervent supporter of the republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In 1943, with Tom Glazer and Bess and Baldwin Hawes, he recorded an album of 78s called &quot;Songs of the Lincoln Battalion&quot; on Moe Asch&#x27;s Stinson label. This included such songs as &quot;There&#x27;s a Valley in Spain Called Jarama&quot; and &quot;Viva la Quince Brigada&quot;. In 1960, this collection was re-issued by Moe Asch as one side of a Folkways LP called &quot;Songs of the Lincoln and International Brigades&quot;. On the other side was a reissue of the legendary &quot;Six Songs for Democracy&quot; (originally recorded in Barcelona in 1938 while bombs were falling), performed by Ernst Busch and a chorus of members of the Thälmann Battalion, made up of volunteers from Germany. The songs were &quot;Moorsoldaten&quot; (&quot;Peat Bog Soldiers&quot;, composed by political prisoners of German concentration camps); &quot;Die Thaelmann-Kolonne&quot;, &quot;Hans Beimler&quot;, &quot;Das Lied von der Einheitsfront&quot; (&quot;Song of the United Front&quot; by Hanns Eisler and Bertolt Brecht), &quot;Lied der Internationalen Brigaden&quot; (&quot;Song of the International Brigades&quot;), and &quot;Los cuatro generales&quot; (&quot;The Four Generals&quot;, known in English as &quot;The Four Insurgent Generals&quot;).

===Group recordings===
As a self-described &quot;split tenor&quot; (between a tenor and a countertenor), Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: the Almanac Singers and the Weavers. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with Millard Lampell and Arkansas singer and activist Lee Hays, was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement, racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, Bess Lomax Hawes, Sis Cunningham, Josh White, and Sam Gary. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name &quot;Pete Bowers&quot; to avoid compromising his father&#x27;s government career.

In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, named after the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann, about a workers&#x27; strike (which contained the lines &quot;We&#x27;ll stand it no more, come what may!&quot;). They did benefits for strikers, at which they sang songs such as &quot;Talking Union&quot;, about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and automobile workers. Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger&#x27;s place. In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers&#x27; repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers&#x27; string of major hits began with &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot; and an arrangement of Lead Belly&#x27;s signature waltz, &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;, which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950, and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of &quot;Irene&quot; was the Israeli song &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;. Other Weavers hits included &quot;Dusty Old Dust&quot; (&quot;So Long It&#x27;s Been Good to Know You&quot; by Woody Guthrie), &quot;Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&quot; (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the Zulu song by Solomon Linda, &quot;Wimoweh&quot; (about Shaka), among others.

The Weavers&#x27; performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953, at the peak of their popularity, when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent reunion tour, which produced a hit version of Merle Travis&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, as well as LPs of their concert performances. &quot;Kumbaya&quot;, a Gullah black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.

In the late 1950s, the Kingston Trio was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter&#x27;s repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hits and, in its turn, spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.

In the documentary film &quot;Pete Seeger: The Power of Song&quot; (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a jingle for a cigarette commercial.

===Banjo and 12-string guitar===

In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of &quot;How to Play the Five-String Banjo&quot;, a book that many banjo players credit with starting them off on the instrument. He went on to invent the &quot;long-neck&quot; or &quot;Seeger&quot; banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger&#x27;s championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in David King Dunaway&#x27;s biography, &quot;by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string&quot;, Pete Seeger &quot;gentrified&quot; the more percussive traditional Appalachian &quot;frailing&quot; style, &quot;with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head&quot;. Although what Dunaway&#x27;s informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.

Inspired by his mentor Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was labeled &quot;This machine kills fascists&quot;, Seeger emblazoned his banjo head in 1952 with the slogan &quot;This Machine Surrounds Hate and Forces It to Surrender&quot;, writing those words on every subsequent banjo he owned.

From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the 12-string guitar, an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with Lead Belly, who had styled himself &quot;the King of the 12-String Guitar&quot;. Seeger&#x27;s distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28&quot;) and capo-to-key techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of drop-D (DADGBE) tuning, tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.

===Interest in steelpan===
In 1956, Seeger and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to seek out information on the steelpan, sometimes called a steel drum, or &quot;ping-pong&quot;. The two searched out a local panyard director, Kim Loy Wong, and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then-new national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago (https://whensteeltalks.ning.com/video/music-from-oil-drums-1956). He was attempting to include the unique flavor of the steelpan in American folk music.

===McCarthy era===
In the 1950s, and indeed consistently throughout his life, Seeger continued his support of civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Henry Wallace campaign), and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. However, with the ever-growing revelations of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s atrocities and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Socialism. He left the CPUSA in 1949, but remained friends with some who did not leave it, although he argued with them about it.

On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Alone among the many witnesses after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the Fifth Amendment (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self-incriminating). Instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, he declined to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his First Amendment rights: &quot;I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this.&quot; Seeger&#x27;s refusal to answer questions that he believed violated his fundamental constitutional rights led to a March 26, 1957 indictment for contempt of Congress. For some years thereafter, he had to keep the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten one-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.

In 1960, the San Diego school board told him that he could not play a scheduled concert at a high school unless he signed an oath pledging that the concert would not be used to promote a communist agenda or an overthrow of the government. Seeger refused, and the American Civil Liberties Union obtained an injunction against the school district, allowing the concert to go on as scheduled. Almost 50 years later, in February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of its predecessors.

===Folk music revival===
To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger worked gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps, and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for Moe Asch&#x27;s Folkways Records label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger&#x27;s anti-war songs, such as &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot; (co-written with Joe Hickerson), &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; adapted from the Book of Ecclesiastes, and &quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot; by the Welsh poet Idris Davies (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger was the first person to make a studio recording of &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot; in 1956. Seeger also was closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement and in 1963 helped organize a landmark Carnegie Hall concert, featuring the youthful Freedom Singers, as a benefit for the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. This event, and Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August of that same year, brought the civil rights anthem &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; to wide audiences. He sang it on the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, along with 1,000 other marchers.
By this time, Seeger was a senior figure in the 1960s folk revival centered in Greenwich Village, as a longtime columnist in &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, the successor to the People&#x27;s Songs &quot;Bulletin&quot;, and as a founder of the topical &quot;Broadside&quot; magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase &quot;Woody&#x27;s children&quot;, alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of People&#x27;s Songs, used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the Industrial Workers of the World or Wobblies&#x27; &quot;Little Red Song Book&quot;, compiled by Swedish-born union organizer Joe Hill (1879–1915) (the &quot;Little Red Song Book&quot; had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie, who was known to carry it around).

Seeger toured Australia in the fall of 1963. He helped spark a folk boom throughout the country at a time when popular music tastes competed between folk, the surfing craze, and the British rock invasion that gave the world The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, among others. Seeger&#x27;s single &quot;Little Boxes&quot;, written by Malvina Reynolds, peaked at #24 on the Australian record charts in February 1964. Folk clubs sprang up all over the nation; folk performers were accepted in established venues; Australian performers singing Australian folk songs—many of their own composing—emerged in concerts and festivals, on television, and on recordings; and folk-music performers from overseas were encouraged to tour Australia.

The long television blacklist of Seeger began to ease in the mid-1960s when he hosted a regionally broadcast educational folk-music television show, &quot;Rainbow Quest&quot;. Among his guests were Johnny Cash, June Carter, Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Watson, the Stanley Brothers, Elizabeth Cotten, Patrick Sky, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Tom Paxton, Judy Collins, Hedy West, Donovan, The Clancy Brothers, Richard Fariña and Mimi Fariña, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Mamou Cajun Band, Bernice Johnson Reagon, the Beers Family, Roscoe Holcomb, Malvina Reynolds, Sonia Malkine, and Shawn Phillips. Thirty-nine hour-long programs were recorded at WNJU&#x27;s Newark studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi, with Sholom Rubinstein. The Smothers Brothers ended Seeger&#x27;s national blacklisting by broadcasting him singing &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy&quot; on their CBS variety show on February 25, 1968, after his similar performance in September 1967 was censored by CBS.

In November 1976, Seeger wrote and recorded the anti-death penalty song &quot;Delbert Tibbs&quot;, about the death-row inmate Delbert Tibbs, who was later exonerated. Seeger wrote the music and selected the words from poems written by Tibbs.
Seeger also supported the Jewish Camping Movement. He came to Surprise Lake Camp in Cold Spring, New York, over the summer many times. He sang and inspired countless campers.

====Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan====
Pete Seeger was one of the earliest backers of Bob Dylan; he was responsible for urging A&amp;R man John Hammond to produce Dylan&#x27;s first LP on Columbia, and for inviting him to perform at the Newport Folk Festival, of which Seeger was a board member. There was a widely repeated story that Seeger was so upset over the extremely loud amplified sound that Dylan, backed by members of the Butterfield Blues Band, brought into the 1965 Newport Folk Festival that Seeger threatened to disconnect the equipment. There are multiple versions of what went on, some fanciful. What is certain is that tensions had been running high between Dylan&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman and Festival board members (who besides Seeger also included Theodore Bikel, Bruce Jackson, Alan Lomax, festival MC Peter Yarrow, and George Wein) over the scheduling of performers and other matters. Two days earlier, there had been a scuffle and a brief exchange of blows between Grossman and Alan Lomax. The festival&#x27;s board, in an emergency session, had voted to ban Grossman from the grounds, but then backed off when George Wein pointed out that Grossman also managed highly popular draws Odetta and Peter, Paul and Mary. Although Seeger has been portrayed as a folk purist who opposed Dylan&#x27;s &quot;going electric&quot;, when asked in 2001 about how he recalled his &quot;objections&quot; to the electric style, Seeger said:

I couldn&#x27;t understand the words. I wanted to hear the words. It was a great song, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm,&quot; and the sound was distorted. I ran over to the guy at the controls and shouted, &quot;Fix the sound so you can hear the words.&quot; He hollered back, &quot;This is the way they want it.&quot; I said &quot;Damn it, if I had an axe, I&#x27;d cut the cable right now.&quot; But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, &quot;you didn&#x27;t boo Howlin&#x27; Wolf yesterday. He was electric!&quot; Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of the second half of the twentieth century, to use my father&#x27;s old term.

One version of the Newport Festival controversy, as well as a glowing depiction of Seeger&#x27;s early 1960s efforts to boost an unknown Bob Dylan, is dramatized in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;, where Edward Norton plays Seeger.

===Vietnam War era and beyond===

A longstanding opponent of the arms race and of the Vietnam War, Seeger satirically attacked then-President Lyndon Johnson with his 1966 recording, on the album &quot;Dangerous Songs!?&quot;, of Len Chandler&#x27;s children&#x27;s song &quot;Beans in My Ears&quot;. Beyond Chandler&#x27;s lyrics, Seeger said that &quot;Mrs. Jay&#x27;s little son Alby&quot; had &quot;beans in his ears&quot;, which, as the lyrics imply, ensures that a person does not hear what is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the Vietnam War, the phrase implied that &quot;Alby Jay&quot;, a loose pronunciation of Johnson&#x27;s nickname &quot;LBJ&quot;, did not listen to anti-war protests as he too had &quot;beans in his ears&quot;.

During 1966, Seeger and Malvina Reynolds took part in environmental activism. The album &quot;God Bless the Grass&quot; was released in January of that year and became the first album in history wholly dedicated to songs about environmental issues. Their politics were informed by the same ideologies of nationalism, populism, and criticism of big business.

Seeger attracted wider attention starting in 1967 with his song &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy&quot;, about a captain—referred to in the lyrics as &quot;the big fool&quot;—who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in Louisiana during World War II. With its lyrics about a platoon being led into danger by an ignorant captain, the song&#x27;s anti-war message was obvious—the line &quot;the big fool said to push on&quot; is repeated several times. In the face of arguments with the management of CBS about whether the song&#x27;s political weight was in keeping with the usually light-hearted entertainment of the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, the final lines were &quot;Every time I read the paper/those old feelings come on/We are waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on.&quot; The lyrics could be interpreted as an allegory of Johnson as the &quot;big fool&quot; and the Vietnam War as the foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 show, after wide publicity, it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on the Smothers&#x27; Brothers show on February 25, 1968.

At the November 15, 1969, Vietnam Moratorium March on Washington, DC, Seeger led 500,000 protesters in singing John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; as they rallied across from the White House. Seeger&#x27;s voice carried over the crowd, interspersing phrases like &quot;Are you listening, Nixon?&quot; between the choruses of protesters singing, &quot;All we are saying ... is give peace a chance.&quot;

In the documentary film &quot;The Power of Song&quot;, Seeger mentions that he and his family visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1972. Phạm Tuyên composed &quot;Let me hear your guitar, my U.S. friend&quot; (&quot;Gảy đàn lên hỡi người bạn Mỹ&quot;) as a tribute to Seeger&#x27;s support for the DRV. When Seeger and his wife arrived at the airport, Phạm Tuyên greeted them and they sang the song together. 
Being a supporter of progressive labor unions, Seeger had supported Ed Sadlowski in his bid for the presidency of the United Steelworkers of America. In 1977, Seeger appeared at a fundraiser in Homestead, Pennsylvania. In 1978, Seeger joined American folk, blues, and jazz singer Barbara Dane at a rally in New York for striking coal miners. He also headlined a benefit concert—with bluegrass artist Hazel Dickens—for the striking coal miners of Stearns, Kentucky, at the Lisner Auditorium in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1979. Also in 1979, he was honored with the Eugene V. Debs Award for Social Justice by the Eugene V. Debs Foundation, in Terre Haute, Indiana.

In 1980, Pete Seeger performed in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The performance was later released by Smithsonian Folkways as the album &quot;Singalong Sanders Theater, 1980&quot;.

===Hudson River sloop &quot;Clearwater&quot;===
In 1966, Seeger and his wife Toshi founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a nonprofit organization based in Beacon, New York, that sought to protect the Hudson River and surrounding wetlands and waterways through advocacy and public education. It constructed a floating ambassador for this environmental mission, the sloop &quot;Clearwater&quot;, and began an annual music and environmental festival, today known as the Great Hudson River Revival.

===Reflection on support for Soviet communism===
In 1982, Seeger performed at a benefit concert for the 1982 demonstrations in Poland against the Polish government. His biographer David Dunaway considers this the first public manifestation of Seeger&#x27;s decades-long personal dislike of socialism in its Soviet form. In the late 1980s, Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer that he was really in favor of incremental change and that &quot;the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time&quot;. In his autobiography &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone&quot; (1993, 1997, reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, &quot;Should I apologize for all this? I think so.&quot; He went on to put his thinking in context:

How could Hitler have been stopped? Litvinov, the Soviet delegate to the League of Nations in &#x27;36, proposed a worldwide quarantine but got no takers. For more on those times check out pacifist Dave Dellinger&#x27;s book, &quot;From Yale to Jail ... &quot; At any rate, today I&#x27;ll apologize for a number of things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a &quot;hard driver&quot; and not a &quot;supremely cruel misleader&quot;. I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the Inquisition, the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by Crusaders. White people in the U.S.A. ought to apologize for stealing land from Native Americans and enslaving blacks. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for Genghis Khan. And supporters of Roosevelt could apologize for his support of Somoza, of Southern White Democrats, of Franco Spain, for putting Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Who should my granddaughter Moraya apologize to? She&#x27;s part African, part European, part Chinese, part Japanese, part Native American. Let&#x27;s look ahead.
In a 1995 interview, however, he insisted that &quot;I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it&quot;.
In later years, as the aging Seeger began to garner awards and recognition for his lifelong activism, he also found himself criticized once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, David Boaz—Voice of America and NPR commentator and president of the libertarian Cato Institute—wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, entitled &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Songbird&quot;, in which he excoriated &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as &quot;someone with a longtime habit of following the party line&quot; who had only &quot;eventually&quot; parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the Almanac Singers&#x27; May 1941 &quot;Songs for John Doe&quot;, contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from &quot;Dear Mr. President&quot;, issued in 1942, after the United States and the Soviet Union had entered the war.

In 2007, in response to criticism from historian Ron Radosh, a former Trotskyist who now writes for the conservative &quot;National Review,&quot; Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, &quot;Big Joe Blues&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;I&#x27;m singing about old Joe, cruel Joe.
He ruled with an iron hand.
He put an end to the dreams
Of so many in every land.
He had a chance to make
A brand new start for the human race.
Instead he set it back
Right in the same nasty place.
I got the Big Joe Blues.
Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast.
I got the Big Joe Blues.
Do this job, no questions asked.
I got the Big Joe Blues.&lt;/poem&gt;

The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, &quot;I think you&#x27;re right, I should have asked to see the gulags when I was in U.S.S.R. [in 1965].&quot;

===Later work===

Seeger appears in the 1997 documentary film &quot;An Act of Conscience&quot;, which was filmed between 1988 and 1995. In the film, Seeger joins a group of demonstrators protesting in support of war tax resisters Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner, whose home was seized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) after the couple openly refused to pay their federal income taxes as a protest against war and military spending.

In 2003, Pete Seeger was a participant in an anti-Iraq war protest.

On March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister Peggy, his brothers Mike and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the American Folklife Center in honor of the Seeger family, held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.

In September 2008, Appleseed Recordings released &quot;At 89&quot;, Seeger&#x27;s first studio album in 12 years. On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, singing &quot;Take It From Dr. King&quot;.

On January 18, 2009, Seeger and his grandson Tao Rodríguez-Seeger joined Bruce Springsteen and the crowd in singing Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; in the finale of Barack Obama&#x27;s inaugural concert in Washington, D.C. The performance was noteworthy for the inclusion of two verses not often included in the song, one about a &quot;private property&quot; sign the narrator cheerfully ignores, and the other making a passing reference to a Depression-era relief office. The former&#x27;s final line, however, &quot;This land was made for you and me&quot;, is modified to &quot;That side was made for you and me&quot;.

Over the years, he lent his fame to support numerous environmental organizations, including South Jersey&#x27;s Bayshore Center, the home of New Jersey&#x27;s tall ship, the oyster schooner &quot;A.J. Meerwald&quot;. Seeger&#x27;s benefit concerts helped raise funds for groups so they could continue to educate and spread environmental awareness. On May 3, 2009, at the Clearwater Concert, dozens of musicians gathered in New York at Madison Square Garden to celebrate Seeger&#x27;s 90th birthday (which was later televised on PBS during the summer), ranging from Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp, Billy Bragg, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Morello, Eric Weissberg, Ani DiFranco and Roger McGuinn to Joan Baez, Richie Havens, Joanne Shenandoah, R. Carlos Nakai, Bill Miller, Joseph Fire Crow, Margo Thunderbird, Tom Paxton, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, and Arlo Guthrie. Cuban singer-songwriter Silvio Rodríguez was also invited to appear, but his visa was not approved in time by the United States government. Consistent with Seeger&#x27;s longtime advocacy for environmental concerns, the proceeds from the event benefited the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a non-profit organization founded by Seeger in 1966, to defend and restore the Hudson River. Seeger&#x27;s 90th birthday was also celebrated at The College of Staten Island on May 4.
On September 19, 2009, Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, which was particularly notable because the festival does not normally feature folk artists.

In 2010, still active at the age of 91, Seeger co-wrote and performed the song &quot;&quot;&quot;God&#x27;s Counting on Me, God&#x27;s Counting on You&quot; with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. A performance of the song by Seeger, Wyatt, and friends was recorded and filmed aboard the sloop &quot;Clearwater&quot; in August for a single and video produced by Richard Barone and Matthew Billy, released on election day, November 6, 2012.

On October 21, 2011, at age 92, Pete Seeger was part of a solidarity march with Occupy Wall Street to Columbus Circle in New York City. The march began with Seeger and fellow musicians exiting Symphony Space (95th and Broadway), where they had performed as part of a benefit for Seeger&#x27;s Clearwater organization. Thousands of people crowded Pete Seeger by the time they reached Columbus Circle, where he performed with his grandson, Tao Rodríguez-Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, David Amram, and other celebrated musicians. The event, promoted under the name OccupyTheCircle, was livestreamed, and was dubbed by some &quot;the Pete Seeger March&quot;.

In January 2012, Seeger joined the Rivertown Kids in paying tribute to his friend Bob Dylan, performing Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot; on the Amnesty International album &quot;Chimes of Freedom.&quot; This song, Seeger&#x27;s last single, marked Seeger&#x27;s only music video, which went viral in the wake of his death two years later.

On December 14, 2012, Seeger performed, along with Harry Belafonte, Jackson Browne, Common, and others, at a concert to bring awareness to the 37-year-long ordeal of Native American activist Leonard Peltier. The concert was held at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.

On April 9, 2013, Hachette Audio Books issued an audiobook entitled &quot;Pete Seeger: The Storm King; Stories, Narratives, Poems&quot;. This two-CD spoken-word work was conceived of and produced by noted percussionist Jeff Haynes and presents Pete Seeger telling the stories of his life against a background of music performed by more than 40 musicians of varied genres. The launch of the audiobook was held at the on April 11, 2013, to an enthusiastic audience of around two hundred people, and featured many of the musicians from the project (among them Samite, Dar Williams, Dave Eggar, and Richie Stearns of the Horse Flies and Natalie Merchant) performing live under the direction of producer and percussionist Haynes.

On August 9, 2013, one month widowed, Seeger was in New York City for the 400-year commemoration of the Two Row Wampum Treaty between the Iroquois and the Dutch. On an interview he gave that day to Democracy Now!, Seeger sang &quot;I Come and Stand at Every Door&quot;, as it was also the 68th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki.

On September 21, 2013, Seeger performed at Farm Aid at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York. Joined by Wille Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, and Dave Matthews, he sang &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, and included a verse he said he had written specifically for the Farm Aid concert.

==Personal life==

In 1943, Seeger married Toshi Aline Ohta, whom he credited with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible. The couple remained married until Toshi&#x27;s death in July 2013. Their first child, Peter Ōta Seeger, was born in 1944 and died at six months while Seeger was deployed overseas; Seeger never saw him. They went on to have three more children: Daniel (an accomplished photographer and filmmaker), Mika (a potter and muralist), and Tinya (a potter), as well as grandchildren Tao Rodríguez-Seeger (a musician), Cassie (an artist), Kitama Cahill-Jackson (a psychotherapist), Moraya (a marriage and family therapist married to the former NFL player Chris DeGeare), Penny, and Isabelle, and great-grandchildren Dio and Gabel. Tao, a folk musician in his own right, sings and plays guitar, banjo, and harmonica with the Mammals. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the 2007 PBS documentary &quot;Pete Seeger: The Power of Song&quot;.

When asked by Beliefnet about his religious or spiritual beliefs, and his definition of God, Seeger replied:

He was a member of a Unitarian Universalist Church in New York.

Seeger lived in Beacon, New York. He and Toshi purchased their land in 1949 and lived there first in a trailer, then in a log cabin they built themselves. He remained engaged politically and maintained an active lifestyle in the Hudson Valley region of New York throughout his life. For years during the Iraq War, Seeger maintained a weekly protest vigil alongside Route 9 in Wappingers Falls, near his home. He told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter that &quot;working for peace was like adding sand to a basket on one side of a large scale, trying to tip it one way despite enormous weight on the opposite side.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Some of us try to add more sand by teaspoons ... It&#x27;s leaking out as fast as it goes in and they&#x27;re all laughing at us. But we&#x27;re still getting people with teaspoons. I get letters from people saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m still on the teaspoon brigade.&#x27;&quot;

Toshi died in Beacon on July 9, 2013, at the age of 91, and Seeger died at New York–Presbyterian Hospital in New York City on January 27, 2014, at the age of 94.

==Legacy==
Response and reaction to Seeger&#x27;s death quickly poured in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called &quot;America&#x27;s tuning fork&quot; and that he believed in &quot;the power of song&quot; to bring social change, &quot;Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers&#x27; rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger.&quot; Folksinger and fellow activist Billy Bragg wrote that &quot;Pete believed that music could make a difference. Not change the world, he never claimed that – he once said that if music could change the world he&#x27;d only be making music – but he believed that while music didn&#x27;t have agency, it did have the power to make a difference.&quot; Bruce Springsteen said of Seeger&#x27;s death, &quot;I lost a great friend and a great hero last night, Pete Seeger,&quot; before performing &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; while on tour in South Africa.

Not all responses to Seeger&#x27;s passing were complimentary. Michael Moynihan of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; wrote an obituary entitled &quot;The Death of &#x27;Stalin&#x27;s Songbird&#x27;&quot; and included these remarks:

===Tributes===
* A proposal was made in 2009 to name the Walkway Over the Hudson in his honor.

<text>Anticosti () is an island located between the Jacques Cartier and Honguedo Straits, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Anticosti (Municipality), Minganie MRC, Côte-Nord, Quebec, Canada.

==UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage==
On September 19, 2023, Anticosti was inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List. It is recognized for its exceptional fossil assemblage representing the first global mass extinction of animal life on Earth. 

Located within protected areas free from any industrial activity, the site is endowed with exceptionally well-preserved, abundant and diverse fossil fauna. This Anticosti fauna represents the first mass extinction of animal life on a global scale, 447 – 437 million years ago, at the end of the Ordovician period.
The Vauréal River, with its source in Lake Vauréal, flows 25 km, south then northeast, in the eastern part of the island. The salmon go up the river to the Vauréal Falls, 13 km from the coast, crossing the Vauréal canyon where the river is enclosed between two limestone walls.

==Toponymy==
Anticosti has had several First Nations names: Natigôsteg, “advanced land” in Mi&#x27;kmaq; Natashquan, “where we catch bears”, in Innu.

In 1535, Jacques Cartier wrote: &quot;the said island which we have named the island of Assumption&quot;, after having written Antiscoti (1612) and Antiscoty (1613), Samuel de Champlain spelled the name of this island Enticosty (1625) and Antycosty (1632). The name in French is &quot;Île d’Anticosti&quot;.

==Geography==
Anticosti Island is located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the edge of St. Lawrence River estuary. At in size, the island has a length of 222 km and a maximum width of 56 km, its highest peak rises to 306 m.

It is the 90th largest island in the world and 20th largest island in Canada. Anticosti Island is separated on the north from the Côte-Nord region of Quebec (the Labrador Peninsula) by the Jacques Cartier Strait, and on the south from the Gaspé Peninsula by the Honguedo Strait.

Anticosti Island is larger than Prince Edward Island but sparsely populated (218 people in 2016), with most of the permanent population in the village of Port-Menier on the western tip of the island; this population once consisted chiefly of the keepers of the lighthouses erected by the Canadian government. The entire island constitutes one municipality known as L&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Anticosti.

Due to more than 400 shipwrecks off its coasts, Anticosti Island is sometimes called the &quot;Cemetery of the Gulf&quot;.&lt;
Anticosti Island is part of the eastern St. Lawrence lowlands. It is long and has a maximum breadth of — times as large as the province of Prince Edward Island. Its coastline is long, and is rocky and dangerous, offering little shelter for ships except in Gamache, Ellis, and Fox Bays. There are large shoals to the south.

The largest lake on the island is Lake Wickenden, which feeds the Jupiter River. There are numerous rivers on Anticosti, many of which flow through deep gorges and canyons to the north and south shores.

Topographically, Anticosti Island can be divided into three distinct regions: two lowland areas, rarely exceeding in elevation, in the eastern and western thirds of the island linked along the coast; and a central highland forming a plateau that rises to just over . This plateau is an unidirectional structure slightly tilted to the south, and is characterized by rolling cuestas. The rocks exposed on the island form a continuous sedimentary stratum more than thick. These are the most complete strata in eastern North America of the Ordovician and Silurian periods.

=== Climate ===
Anticosti Island has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), affected by the maritime influence of the Gulf of St. Lawrence which reduces seasonal temperature variation. The average annual temperature is . The month of July is the warmest with an average temperature of . Conversely, February is the coldest month, averaging . Snowfall is abundant, usually accumulating over in the western and central parts.

==History==
===Indigenous history===
For thousands of years, Anticosti Island was the territory of the indigenous peoples who lived on the mainland and used it as a hunting ground. The Innu called it &quot;Notiskuan&quot;, translated as &quot;where bears are hunted&quot; and the Mi&#x27;kmaq called it &quot;Natigôsteg&quot;, meaning &quot;forward land&quot;.

===Colonisation and settlement===
The French explorer Jacques Cartier sailed along its shore in the summer of 1534. He provided its first written description and named it &quot;Isle de l&#x27;Assomption&quot;, because he reached it on the Day of the Assumption of Mary. This name had fallen into disuse by 1656. About 1586, the historian André Thevet wrote that &quot;the savages named [it] Naticousti&quot;, while Samuel de Champlain spelled it Antiscoti (1612), Antiscoty (1613), Enticosty (1625) and Antycosty (1632). From that time on, France had officially incorporated the island into its colonial empire.

The island&#x27;s first European settlers arrived in 1680 when Louis XIV gave Louis Jolliet the Seigneury of the Mingan Archipelago and Anticosti Island as compensation for reconnoitring the Mississippi and Hudson Bay. Louis Jolliet erected a fort on Anticosti and in the spring of 1681 settled there with his wife, four children and six servants. His fort was captured and occupied during the winter of 1690 by some of the Massachusetts troops of William Phips during their retreat after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Quebec City. After Jolliet&#x27;s death in 1700, the island was divided among his three sons and the Jolliet family retained ownership until 1763 when the island became part of British North America under the terms of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years&#x27; War. That same year, the island was annexed to Newfoundland until 1774 when it was returned to Lower Canada and annexed again to Newfoundland from 1809 to 1825. It became a part of Quebec (as Lower Canada came to be called) at the Canadian Confederation in 1867. During these years the island property changed hands several times, its owners generally using it for the harvesting of timber; otherwise no real development took place. For example, the French Canadian Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau owned it among other seigneuries and made money from them.

In 1874, it was bought by the Anticosti Island Company and they founded the villages at English Bay and Fox Bay. Most of the inhabitants, however, continued to be the few keepers of the island&#x27;s many lighthouses. Because of the number of shipwrecks around the island, stores of provisions were also maintained around the island for sailors who might be washed ashore. In 1882, the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Assomption was founded, a term referring to Cartier&#x27;s name for the island. In 1884, the island became property of the Stockwell brothers who formed a forestry company two years later. But they were unsuccessful and the company lasted only five years. By the 1890s, the fish and wildlife of the island had been almost eradicated through the new locals&#x27; indiscriminate slaughter.

In 1895, Anticosti was sold for $125,000 to French chocolate maker Henri Menier who also leased the shore fishing rights. Menier named the island&#x27;s high Vauréal Falls after the town of Vauréal in France where he owned a home. He constructed the entire village of Port-Menier, built a cannery for packing fish and lobsters, and attempted to develop its resources of lumber, peat and minerals. Many of the original houses still stand today. Furthermore, he converted the island into a personal game preserve and introduced nonindigenous animals for this purpose, including a herd of 220 white-tailed deer. The deer thrived and today the population exceeds 160,000 while the island&#x27;s moose population is about 1,000. It has been reported that black bears, which rely on berries to bulk on for the winter, had lived on the island until the introduction, but have disappeared perhaps because of the deer eating the berry bushes bare.

Henri Menier died in 1913 and his brother Gaston became the owner of Anticosti Island. He used and maintained it for a time but eventually decided it was not an economically viable operation and sold it to the Wayagamack Pulp and Paper Company in 1926 for $6,000,000. For the next five decades, the island was used almost exclusively by forestry companies which harvested timber and built some infrastructure, mainly roads, but abandoned the villages at English Bay and Fox Bay.

Wayagamack&#x27;s timber production was successful until the Great Depression when the paper market collapsed. The island property was taken over by Consolidated Paper Corporation Limited in 1931, but they showed little interest in it and put it up for sale. Offers came from Canadian, American, British, French and Belgian parties. In July 1937, an offer was received from a consortium of Dutch and German capitalists who intended to build a sulphite mill and wanted a steady supply of pulpwood and access to Canadian capital. In the autumn of that year, a team of German surveyors travelled to the island to examine its timber and export potential. When this story broke in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; of 2 December 1937, it caused an immediate controversy since the story claimed that the survey team was really made up of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s agents and that most were naval, military and fortifications experts. Despite the substantial offer, the promise of thousands of new jobs, and the fact that there were no legal methods to block the sale, the suspicions remained. A committee was set up to investigate the affair but concluded that &quot;there was no evidence to indicate that the project has other than a commercial purpose&quot;. However, when the deadline to purchase the island passed on 15 September 1938, the offer expired and controversy died out.

In 1974, the government of Quebec purchased the island from the forestry company Consolidated Bathurst Ltd. for $23,780,000. Anticosti was placed under management by the Ministry of Recreation, Hunting and Fishing (&quot;ministère du Loisir de la Chasse et de la Pêche&quot;) and in 1983 the process began to set up a working municipal structure. Today, about 60% is under management by Sépaq and since April 2001, has been designated as a national conservation park. With its 24 rivers and streams bountiful with salmon and trout, the island is now a tourist destination for anglers and hunters, particularly from the United States and Canada, as well as for paleontologists, bird watchers and hikers.

In 2023, the perimeter of Anticosti Island, with two rivers, was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for its abundance of fossils. The World Heritage Site includes the entire coastline of the island (except for the region around the village of Port-Menier), and the banks of the Jupiter and Vauréal rivers. A one-kilometer buffer zone extends inland from the coasts and riverbanks.

==Access and transportation==
Access to the island is either by boat or plane. From April to mid-January, the commercial shipping company Relais Nordik services Port-Menier twice weekly with a passenger and cargo vessel.

The Port-Menier Airport is serviced by Air Liaison which provides regular scheduled flights to Sept-Îles and Havre-St-Pierre. There are two other aerodromes on the island, both towards the eastern end. Rivière-aux-Saumons (CTH7) is located on the northern side of the island and was paved in July 2010; Rivière Bell (CRB5) is gravel and is located on the southern side. These are used by outfitters and charter companies that provide private air services during the tourist season.

The Henri-Menier Road or Transanticostienne Road, the island&#x27;s unpaved main road, stretches from Port-Menier to the eastern tip, with numerous forest roads branching off to provide access to various tourist locations and logging concessions. Car rental is available in Port-Menier.

==Flora==
Every summer from 1924 to 1928, Brothers Marie-Victorin and Rolland-Germain explored the Anticosti-Minganie, the two botanists made many discoveries, including Sececio pseudo-arnica var. rollandii or Senecio rollandii as well as the Mingan thistle Cirsium minganense and Botrychium minganense. The botanists explored the coasts of Anticosti Island aboard a refurbished old fishing vessel, the Virginia.

The archives of the University of Montreal present on Flickr: Anticosti, a land of immense spaces, the sea all around and a social world of the 1920s gone forever, series of photos by Marie-Victorin: Brother Kirouac (1885-1944).

In 2004, the island&#x27;s vascular flora was estimated at 700 species. Rare Plants of the Mingan Archipelago, Parks Canada 2023, said that nearly a tenth of Anticosti Island&#x27;s flora are rare plants, most of which colonize open habitats associated with rivers (cliffs, taluses or pebbled surfaces) and mineral bogs.
Anticosti Island is home to the rare orchid, Cypripedium arietinum Ait. f. — Cypripède tête-de-bélier. — (Ram&#x27;s Head Lady&#x27;s Slipper). While populations are declining elsewhere in eastern North America, the orchid flourishes here abundantly, making Anticosti a refuge for this plant.

The forests of Anticosti Island are typical boreal forest, with common species such as White spruce, Balsam fir, and Black spruce. It is distinguished by some minor stands of American white birch and Trembling aspen.
*Picea glauca (Moench) Voss. — Épicéa glauque. — Épinette blanche. — (White spruce).
* Abies balsamea (Linné) Miller. — Sapin baumier. — Sapin. — (Balsam fir).
* Picea mariana (Miller) BSP. — Épicéa marial. — Épinette noire. — (Black spruce).
* Betula papyrifera Marshall. — Bouleau à papier. — Bouleau blanc, Bouleau à canot. — (Canoë birch, American white birch).
* Populus tremuloides Michaux. — Peuplier faux-tremble. — Tremble. — (Aspen).

Balsam fir is slowly being replaced with White spruce because of intensive grazing done by White tail deer and by periodic outbreaks of Hemlock looper and Spruce budworm. About a quarter of the island is covered by peat lands.

==Fauna==
In Anticosti Island, the wildlife is characteristic of an isolated marine environment. Of the 24 mammal species, 14 or 15 of these are marine mammals that include Grey Seal and Harbor Seal.
* Halichoerus grypus. — Phoque gris. — (Grey Seal).
* Phoca vitulina. — Phoque commun. — (Harbour Seal).

Even large whales ply the nearby cold waters, thirteen species of cetaceans frequent the waters of the estuary and the gulf of the St. Lawrence River

1. Hyperoodon ampullatus. — Hypéroodon boreal, Hypéroodon arctique. — (Northern Bottlenose Whale).&lt;br&gt;
2. Delphinapterus leucas. — Béluga, Bélouga, Baleine blanche, Dauphin blanc, Marsouin blanc. — (Beluga Whale).&lt;br&gt;
3. Physeter macrocephalus. — Grand cachalot, Cachalot, Cachalot macrocéphale. — (Sperm whale).&lt;br&gt;
4. Lagenorhynchus acutus. — Lagénorhynque à flancs blancs, Dauphin à flancs blancs. — (Atlantic white-sided dolphin).&lt;br&gt;
5. Lagenorhynchus albirostris. — Dauphin à nez blanc, Dauphin à bec blanc, Lagénorhynque à bec blanc. — (White-beaked dolphin).&lt;br&gt;

9. Eubalaena glacialis. — Baleine franche de l&#x27;Atlantique nord, Baleine noire de l&#x27;Atlantique nord, Baleine de Biscaye. — (North Atlantic Right Whale).&lt;br&gt;
10. Balaenoptera acutorostrata. — Petit rorqual. — (Minke whale).&lt;br&gt;
11. Balaenoptera musculus. — Baleine bleue, Rorqual bleu. — (Blue whale).&lt;br&gt;
12. Megaptera novaeangliae. — Rorqual à bosse, Baleine à bosse. — (Humpback whale).&lt;br&gt;
13. Balaenoptera physalus. — Rorqual commun. — (Fin whale).&lt;br&gt;
Originally, there were probably only seven indigenous species of land mammals, the Martes americana and Ursus americanus have now been extirpated:
*Vulpes vulpes. — Renard roux. — (Red fox).
*Lontra canadensis. — Loutre de rivière. — (River otter). 
*Peromyscus maniculatus. — Souris sylvestre, Souris du soir. — (Deer mouse).

*Eptesicus nilssonii. — Sérotine de Nilsson, Sérotine boréale. — (Northern bat).
*Melanistic foxes have been seen on the island.

In order to make Anticosti Island a hunter&#x27;s &quot;paradise&quot;, several animal species have been introduced; starting in 1896, the island became an unprecedented biological experiment. In all, sixteen introduced species have been attempted, with six proving to be unsuccessful, namely bison, caribou, elk, mink and fisher. However, for ten species, it has been a beneficial introduction; six species of terrestrial mammals (white-tailed deer, moose, beaver, snowshoe hare and muskrat), two species of frogs, and two species of non-migratory birds (ruffed grouse and the spruce grouse). Of all these species introduced, the success of white-tailed deer is particularly noteworthy. From an initial group of about 200 (introduced in 1896 and 1897), the number of white-tailed deer has grown to an estimated 37,000 animals in 2018, representing a density of 4.7 deer/km2. Without predators, this man-made deer population has had noticeable impacts on the island ecosystem. Balsam fir trees covered about 40% of the island, prior to the introduction of the deer. The deer eat tender sprouts from the ground, and prevent fir regeneration; in turn, the firs are being replaced by white spruce.

The brook trout, Atlantic salmon and American eel visit the island&#x27;s shores and swim up several rivers of the island.

Some 221 bird species, distributed among 21 avian families, have been observed on Anticosti Island. It is home to nearly 60% of the known breeding sites of the bald eagle in the province of Quebec.

==Tourism==

Because of its untamed wilderness and abundant wildlife, Anticosti Island is known for its hunting, fishing and outdoor opportunities and it attracts some 3,000 to 4,000 hunters per year.

Most of Anticosti Island () is under management by Sépaq Anticosti, a division of the provincial parks and wildlife reserves agency Sépaq. It actively promotes tourism on the island, in particular hunting and fishing tours. Another is protected in the Anticosti National Park (&quot;Parc national d&#x27;Anticosti&quot;). In addition to hunting and fishing, many other outdoor recreational activities are supported in this park, such as hiking, horseback riding, nature viewing and sea kayaking.

There are also five commercial outfitters that hold exclusive hunting and fishing rights to of the island.

==Utica Shale==
The Utica Shale, a stratigraphical unit of Middle Ordovician age that is potentially rich in shale gas reserves, underlies the Anticosti Islands and extends to surrounding areas in Quebec, Ontario and much of northeastern United States. On February 8, 2011, the citizen group &quot;Non au Pétrole et au Gaz au Québec&quot; released one of the biggest petitions in Quebec history against fracking in the province of Quebec with 128,000 signatures thinking it would prevent the oil and gas exploration on Anticosti. In June 2011, the Quebec firm Pétrolia claimed to have discovered about 30 billion barrels of oil on the island of Anticosti, which is the first time that significant reserves have been found in the province.

In February 2014, Premier of Quebec Pauline Marois announced that the provincial government would help finance two exploratory shale gas operations as a prelude to hydraulic fracturing on the island, with the province pledging $115-million to finance drilling for two separate joint ventures in exchange for rights to 50% of the licences and 60% of any commercial profit. It was the first oil and gas deal of any size for the province. With the change in government that occurred in April 2014, the Liberals of Philippe Couillard could change that decision. Petrolia Inc., Corridor Resources and Maurel &amp; Prom formed one joint-venture, while Junex Inc. was still seeking a private partner.

On June 4, 2013, the citizen group &quot;Non au Pétrole et au Gaz au Québec&quot;, realizing that fracking continued to be a viable method of oil extraction on Anticosti, released another petition that garnered 26,000 signatures against fracking, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas on Anticosti Island and asked for a moratorium and an environmental evaluation. Geological engineer Marc Durand gave a presentation at a conference explaining that a minimum of 12,000 wells would be necessary for this exploitation and would put Quebec in debt, considering the 12 million dollar cost of one of these wells. A year later, when Pauline Marois announced an investment of 115 million dollars for Petrolia to continue the exploration, the same petition increased up to 36,000 signatures. The government started a BAPE (environmental evaluation) specific for Anticosti and the report, published on October 3, is in favour of creating a protected area on the island.

<text>A poker tournament is a tournament where players compete by playing poker. It can feature as few as two players playing on a single table (called a &quot;heads-up&quot; tournament), and as many as tens of thousands of players playing on thousands of tables. The winner of the tournament is usually the person who wins every poker chip in the game and the others are awarded places based on the time of their elimination. To facilitate this, in most tournaments, blinds rise over the duration of the tournament. Unlike in a ring game (or cash game), a player&#x27;s chips in a tournament cannot be cashed out for money and serve only to determine the player&#x27;s placing.

==Buy-ins and prizes==
To enter a typical tournament, a player pays a fixed &quot;buy-in&quot; and at the start of play is given a certain quantity of tournament poker chips. Commercial venues may also charge a separate fee, or withhold a small portion of the buy-in, as the cost of running the event. Tournament chips have only notional value; they have no cash value, and only the tournament chips, not cash, may be used during play. Typically, the amount of each entrant&#x27;s starting tournament chips is an integer multiple of the buy-in. Some tournaments offer the option of a &quot;re-buy&quot; or &quot;buy-back&quot;; this gives players the option of purchasing more chips. In some cases, re-buys are conditional (for example, offered only to players low on or out of chips) but in others they are available to all players (called &quot;add-ons&quot;). Player with no chips remaining (and who have exhausted or declined all re-buy options, if any are available) are eliminated from the tournament. 

In most tournaments, the number of players at each table is kept even by moving players, either by switching one player or (as the field shrinks) taking an entire table out of play and distributing its players amongst the remaining tables. A few tournaments, called &quot;shoot-outs&quot;, do not do this; instead, the last player (sometimes the last two or more players) at a table moves on to a second or third round, akin to a single-elimination tournament found in other games.

The prizes for winning are usually derived from the buy-ins, though outside funds may be entered as well. For example, some invitational tournaments do not have buy-ins and fund their prize pools with sponsorship revenue and/or gate receipts from spectators. Tournaments without a buy-in are referred to as freerolls. A freeroll tournament is free to enter and usually the player is given one chance in the tournament. A variation on a freeroll tournament is called a &quot;freebuy&quot;. In a freebuy event, a player can enter with a free entry, but if the player loses their chips during the registration period they are able to buy themselves back into the event.

Play continues, in most tournaments, until all but one player is eliminated, though in some tournament situations, especially informal ones, players have the option of ending by consensus.

Players are ranked in reverse chronological order — the last person standing in the game earns 1st place, the second-to-last earns 2nd, and so on. This ranking of players by elimination is unique amongst games, and also precludes the possibility of a tie for first place, since one player alone must have all the chips to end the tournament. (Ties are possible for all other places, though they are rare since the sole tiebreaker is the number of chips one has at the start of the hand in which one is eliminated, and hence two people would need to start a hand with exactly the same number of chips and both be eliminated on that same hand in order to tie with each other.)

Sometimes tournaments end by mutual consensus of the remaining players. For example, in a ten-person, $5 game, there may be two players remaining with $29 and $21, respectively, worth of chips. Rather than risk losing their winnings, as one of them would if the game were continued, these two players may be allowed to split the prize proportional to their in-game currency (or however they agree).

Certain tournaments, known as bounty tournaments, place a bounty on some or all of the players. If a player knocks an opponent out, the player earns the opponent&#x27;s bounty. Individual bounties or total bounties collected by the end of a tournament may be used to award prizes. Bounties usually work in combination with a regular prize pool, where a small portion of each player&#x27;s buy-in goes towards his or her bounty.

Other tournaments allow players to exchange some or all of their chips in the middle of a tournament for prize money, giving the chips cash value. Separate portions of each player&#x27;s buy-in go towards a prize pool and a &quot;cash out&quot; pool. The cash out rate is typically fixed, and a time when players may not cash out (such as the final table) is usually established. The remaining cash out pool is either paid out to the remaining field or added to the regular prize pool.

Prizes are awarded to the winning players in one of two ways:
* &quot;Fixed&quot;: Each placing corresponds to a certain payoff. For example, a ten-person, $20 buy-in tournament might award $100 to the first-place player, $60 for second-place, $40 for third, and nothing for lower places.
* &quot;Proportional&quot;: Payouts are determined according to a percentage-based scale. The percentages are determined based upon the number of participants and will increase payout positions as participation increases. As a rule, roughly one player in ten will &#x27;cash&#x27;, or make a high enough place to earn money. These scales are very top-heavy, with the top three players usually winning more than the rest of the paid players combined.

Tournaments can be open or invitational. The World Series of Poker, whose Main Event (a $10,000 buy-in no limit Texas hold &#x27;em tournament) is considered the most prestigious of all poker tournaments, is open.

&quot;Multi-table tournaments&quot; involve many players playing simultaneously at dozens or even hundreds of tables. &quot;Satellite tournaments&quot; to high-profile, expensive poker tournaments are the means of entering a major event without posting a significant sum of cash. These have significantly smaller buy-ins, usually on the order of one-tenth to one-fiftieth the main tournament&#x27;s buy-in, and can be held at various venues and, more recently, on the Internet. Top players in this event, in lieu of a cash prize, are awarded seats to the main tourney, with the number of places dependent on participation. Chris Moneymaker, who won the 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event, was able to afford his seat by winning an Internet tournament with a $39 buy-in. Greg Raymer, 2004 World Series of Poker champion, acquired his seat via a $165 Internet tournament.

The opposite of a multi-table tournament is a &quot;single-table tournament&quot;, often abbreviated &quot;STT.&quot; A number of places (typically, two, six or nine) are allocated at a single table, and as soon as the required number of players has appeared, chips are distributed and the game starts. This method of starting single-table tournaments has caused them to be referred to as &quot;sit-and-go&quot; (&quot;SNG&quot;) tournaments, because when the required number of players &quot;sit&quot;, the tournament &quot;goes.&quot; Sit-and-go tournaments of more than one table are becoming more common, however, especially in Internet poker. A single-table tournament effectively behaves the same as the final table of a multi-table tournament, except that the players all begin with the same number of chips, and the betting usually starts much lower. Almost invariably, fixed payoffs are used.

A tournament series may consist of either single-table or multi-table tournaments. In a tournament series, multiple tournaments are played in which prizes are awarded. However, a series leaderboard or standings system is often used and additional prizes, drawn from the individual tournament buy-ins, are awarded to those who perform best overall in the series. Major poker tournaments such as the World Poker Tour and World Series of Poker, use standings to determine a player of the year.

== Playing format ==
The most common playing format for poker tournaments is the &quot;freezeout&quot; format. All players still playing in a tournament constitute a dynamic pool. Whenever a player loses all his chips and gets eliminated, his table shrinks. To combat the constant shrinking of tables and avoid having tables play with varying numbers of players, players are moved between tables, with unnecessary tables getting closed as the tournament progresses. In the end, all remaining players are seated on just one table, known as the &quot;final table&quot;. Most sit and go tournaments are freezeouts.

In some tournaments, known as &quot;rebuy tournaments&quot;, players have the ability to re-buy into the game in case they lost all their chips and avoid elimination for a specific period of time (usually ranging from one to two hours). After this so-called &quot;rebuy period&quot;, the play resumes as in a standard freezeout tournament and eliminated players do not have the option of returning to the game any more. Rebuy tournaments often allow players to rebuy even if they have not lost all their chips, in which case the rebuy amount is simply added to their stack. A player is not allowed to rebuy in-game if he has too many chips (usually the amount of the starting stack or half of it). At the end of the rebuy period remaining players are typically given the option to purchase an &quot;add-on&quot;, an additional amount of chips, which is usually similar to the starting stack.

Another playing format is the &quot;shootout&quot; tournament. A shootout tournament divides play in rounds. In a standard shootout tournament, 2-10 players sit on each table and the table roster remains the same until everyone but one player is eliminated. The table winners progress to the final table where the tournament winner is determined. In a shootout tournament players are usually awarded places in tiers based on how many rounds they lasted and in which place they were eliminated. Shootouts can include multiple rounds (triple, quadruple or quintuple shootout) or feature several players from each table progressing (usually up to three). Shootouts are also a common format for large heads-up multi-table tournaments, although these may feature double or triple elimination instead of the standard single knockout method.

A recent innovation is the &quot;mix-max&quot; or &quot;mixed max&quot; tournament, in which the table sizes vary during the course of the event. A typical example is the mix-max event held at the 2012 World Series of Poker, in which the first day of play was nine-handed, the second day six-handed, and the rest of the tournament heads-up. This effectively made it a hybrid freezeout–shootout tournament, with freezeout play at larger tables and shootout play in the heads-up phase.

==Betting format==
Betting in tournaments can take one of three forms:
*In a &quot;structured&quot; (fixed limit) betting system, bets and raises are restricted to specific amounts, though these amounts typically increase throughout the tournament. For example, for a seven-card stud tournament with the stakes at 10/20, raises would be $10 in the first three rounds of betting, and $20 in the latter rounds.
*&quot;Semi-structured&quot; betting provides ranges for allowed raises. Usually, in this format, one may not raise less than a previous player has raised. For example, if one player raises $20, it would be illegal for another player to raise an additional $5. Pot limit is a semi-structured format in which raises cannot exceed the current size of the pot. Spread limit is a semi-structured format in which bets (and subsequent raises) must be between a minimum and maximum amount.
*&quot;Unstructured&quot; betting, usually called no limit. While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players are free to bet as much as they wish, even early in a round of betting. To bet all of one&#x27;s chips (risking one&#x27;s tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go &quot;all-in&quot;. In no-limit tournaments, players will sometimes take this risk even early in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold &#x27;Em tournaments, it is not uncommon for players to bet &quot;all-in&quot; before the flop.

The betting structure is one of the most defining elements of the game; even if other aspects are equivalent, a fixed-limit version and its no-limit counterpart are considered to be very different games, because the strategies and play styles are very different. For instance, it is much easier to bluff in a no-limit game, which allows aggressive betting, than in a fixed-limit game. No-limit games also vary widely according to the proclivities of the players; an informal, emergent, betting structure is developed by the players&#x27; personal strategies and personalities.

The stakes of each round, as well as blinds, bring-ins, and antes as appropriate per game, typically escalate according either to the time elapsed or the number of hands played.

==Variants of poker==
While some tournaments offer a mix of games, like H.O.R.S.E. events which combine hold&#x27;em, Omaha, Razz, stud, stud eight or better, and dealer&#x27;s choice events, at which one may choose from a similar menu of games, most tournaments feature one form of stud or community card poker, such as seven-card stud, seven card high-low stud, Omaha hold &#x27;em or Texas hold &#x27;em. Both Omaha and Texas hold &#x27;em tournaments are commonly offered in fixed-limit and pot limit, and no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em tournaments are very common (no-limit Omaha is almost nonexistent in tournament play).

==Tournament venues==
Informal tournaments can be organized by a group of friends. Casinos, cardrooms, and online gambling sites may offer tournaments. The venue will post tournament schedules on its website or in its poker room.

However, these are not the only venues. Poker cruises offer tournaments at sea. Hosts of larger poker tournaments will often hold the event in the convention center of a casino; for example, the 2022 World Series of Poker was in the convention centers of both Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas.

==Major tournaments==
The largest and most well-known tournament in the USA is the World Series of Poker, held in Las Vegas. The World Series was on ESPN from 1987 to 2020 before CBS Sports became the domestic television partner for 2021 and beyond. Since 2007, PokerGO has been partnered with the WSOP to provide live streams and on-demand content.

In the 1980s the Super Bowl of Poker was the second largest and most prestigious tournament.

The 2005 World Series of Poker was the first held outside of Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe Casino, though the final few days of the main event were held in the legendary Benny&#x27;s Bullpen. Later tournaments have been held at one of the Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment and later Caesars Entertainment properties; the Rio served as the venue from 2005-2021.

The largest and most well-known tournament in Europe is the European Poker Tour, which was founded in 2004 by John Duthie and is now the largest poker tour in the world by both total players and prize pool. The World Series of Poker Europe began in 2007 in London, moved in 2011 to Cannes, and moved again in 2013 to the Paris region.

The largest and most well-known tournament in Asia is the Asia Pacific Poker Tour Macau event.

The largest and most well-known tournament in Latin America is the Latin American Poker Tour Argentina event.

The Crown Australian Poker Championship, also known as the Aussie Millions, is the largest tournament in the Pacific region. WSOP owner Caesars Entertainment and Aussie Millions host Crown Melbourne teamed up to launch the World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific, which held its first edition in 2013.

In addition to these events, there are other major tournaments throughout the year. The World Poker Tour is held at different venues worldwide and broadcasts a series of open tournaments throughout the U.S. and Caribbean with buy-ins from $5,000 to $25,000, as well as European events with a €10,000 buy-in. Some of these events are stand alone tournaments like the Caribbean Poker Adventure, but most are held in conjunction with a tournament series being held at the host casino, like the Commerce Casino&#x27;s LA Poker Classic, the Grand Sierra&#x27;s World Poker Challenge and the Bicycle Casino&#x27;s Legends of Poker. A North American Poker Tour was launched in 2010.

Atlantic City hosts The United States Poker Championship at the Trump Taj Mahal casino, which has been broadcast by ESPN in recent years.

The main live poker tournament in Africa is the All Africa Poker Tournament hosted by the Piggs Peak Casino in Piggs Peak, Swaziland.

The National Heads-Up Poker Championship is 64 players compete in heads-up matches single elimination style to determine a winner. It is one of the most prestigious heads up poker tournaments and it is the first tournament produced by a television network.

The internet poker revolution has sparked online poker tournaments and series that have become larger than many live tournaments. The World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) and the Full Tilt Online Poker Series (FTOPS) are two of the biggest online poker tournament series, with tournament prizes surpassing the million-dollar mark.

In 2022, after 17 years at the Rio, the World Series of Poker moved to Bally&#x27;s and Paris.

<doc id="141839" wikidata="Q1348763" url="?curid=141839" title="Magdalen Islands">
<text>The Magdalen Islands (, ) are an archipelago in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Since 2005, the 12-island archipelago is divided into two municipalities: the majority-francophone Municipality of Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the majority-anglophone Municipality of Grosse-Île, in the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, Quebec, Canada.

== Geography ==
The Magdalen Islands are the jagged remains of a vanished part of the mainland. Approximately , they form a string of islands and beaches in the southeastern part of the Gulf of St Lawrence.

The rocks that make up the island massifs are of three kinds: horizontal and soft sandstones, of a blood-red color, which give the archipelago a distinctive character. These red sandstones are juxtaposed with harder, grey sandstones, which also form cliffs in some places. Finally, volcanic actions created rounded, symmetrical domes like breasts, which were given the name of Demoiselles, though this is disputed. Where volcanic effusions have come into contact with sandstones, large masses of gypsum are found.

A group of seven islands form the central core of the archipelago: Île du Havre Aubert (known locally as Amherst Island), Île du Cap aux Meules (known locally as Grindstone), Île du Havre aux Maisons (known locally as House Harbour), Île aux Loups (known locally as Seal Island), Grosse Île (home to most of the Islands&#x27; English-speaking community), Île d&#x27;Entrée (known locally as Entry Island, home to a small English-speaking community) and Île de la Grande-Entrée. These islands are connected together by sand spits or tombolos.

On the outskirts of the main islands are a series of islets and rocks which are remnants of marine erosion; in the lagoons separating these islands, are Île aux Goélands and the surrounding islets near Étang-du-Nord on the south-west coast of Île du Cap aux Meules (Grindstone), Île Rouge and Île Paquet (formerly Île aux Cochons) at the entrance to the lagoon of Havre aux Maisons (House Harbour), Île Shag to the east of the Dune du Sud. In the gulf north of the archipelago, cliffs of the reddish and greyish green sandstone, a few hundred feet high and relatively unmarked by sea erosion, give a fortress-like appearance to Île Brion and the Rochers aux Oiseaux.

Supporting the islands is a series of shoals and reefs that are permanent hazards to maritime navigation. The archipelago has been considered, for more than 400 years, as one of the richest marine regions of Eastern Canada.

==Coastal dynamics==
In the Magdalen Islands, the coastal dynamics are amplified by the wind, with waves most often high breaking on the coast at a rate of four to seven seconds, depending on their height.

Adding up the many bays and indentations, the coastline is inordinately long: in all, more than 60% of which is sandy beaches, often topped by a dune. The territory is constantly changing, the unconsolidated deposits are expanding at the expense of the rocky cores they connect. 

The red sandstone cliffs, the most widespread and friable, are rarely more than high. They are subject to rapid erosion (often more than per year) due to the action of frost, ice, waves and sea spray that make numerous openings while undermining their base. Erosion features and shapes such as caves, towers, and corbels.

=== Piping plover (&quot;Charadrius melodus&quot;) ===

In the 21st century, the islands&#x27; beaches provide a habitat for the endangered piping plover (&quot;Charadrius melodus&quot;). 

Many of the piping plover&#x27;s nesting areas are subject to human disturbance or other threats, and it is now considered an endangered or threatened species in all parts of its range. During courtship, males perform display flights over breeding territory, with slow wingbeats and piping call notes. On the ground, males approach females, stand upright with neck stretched, and rapidly stamp their feet with an odd high-stepping gait. Usually, the nest has four eggs, sometimes two or three, and rarely five; the eggs are pale buff, spotted with black and dark brown. Their incubation period lasts 26 to 28 days.

The plover&#x27;s diet includes insects, marine worms, and crustaceans; the young feed themselves. At first, both parents brood their young during cool weather, and within a few days, female birds depart, leaving males to care for young.
=== Rochers aux Oiseaux (Bird Rocks) ===

The Rochers aux Oiseaux () include the Bird Rock and the Margaulx Rock; these rocks emerge in the Gulf of St. Lawrence about from Grosse-Île. On June 25, 1534, Jacques Cartier discovered these rocks, which he named the Îles de Margaulx because of the myriad gannets (), razorbills, and great auks (now extinct) that were found there. In 1919 Brother Marie-Victorin used the name Rochers aux Oiseaux during his visit to the Rocks; since 1974, the Canadian Wildlife Service has made them a Migratory Bird Sanctuary.
* Bird Rock is long by wide and high, and forms a kind of red sandstone citadel that is practically inaccessible but inhabited by thousands of birds and a lighthouse that is now automated. 
* Margaulx Rock is to the northwest, and refers to three small cays.

=== Pointe de l&#x27;Est National Wildlife Area ===
The Pointe de l&#x27;Est National Wildlife Area is located on La Grosse Île and the reserve occupies an area of in the village of the same name. It offers landscapes characteristic of the Islands: a reddish rocky core, coastal belts reshaped by the wind into dunes, moors, huge beaches and freshwater, saltwater or brackish water ponds. The reserve has six hiking trails from in length: L&#x27;Échouerie, Le Rabougri, La Camarine, La Lande, Le Mitan, Le Bol-à-Soupe.

==Nomenclature==
Owing to the succession of French and English influences, it is not surprising that each of the islands has several names.

The names used by the Acadians of the archipelago are as follows: Grande-Entrée island (Coffin), Boudreau island, Cap de l&#x27;Est island, Grosse-Île, Pointe-aux-Loups island, Havre-aux-Maisons island (Alright or House Harbour), Cap-aux-Meules (Grindstone) island, Havre-Aubert island (Amherst), Corps-Mort island (Deadman), and Entrée islands. Uninhabited islets as Bird Rocks and Brion Island complete the archipelago.

==Geography==

While the Îles de la Madeleine are a land area of in the province of Québec, they are in fact closer to the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland than to the Gaspé Peninsula on the Québec mainland. The Mi&#x27;kmaq consider the islands a part of the Epegwitg aq Pigtug district of Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki—the traditional territory of the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation—and call the islands Menagoesenog.

Administratively, the islands are part of the Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine region in the Canadian province of Québec. The islands form the territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and the census division (CD) of Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Their geographical code is 01.

The islands are also coextensive with the urban agglomeration of Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine, which is divided into two municipalities: Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine (2011 census pop. 12,291), the central municipality, and Grosse-Île (pop. 490). Their mayors are Gaétan Richard and Rose Elmonde Clarke, respectively.
Within the area known as Dawnland, these islands were once called &quot;Menquit&quot; by the Mi&#x27;kmaw Nation, meaning &quot;islands battered by waves.&quot; Around the mid 19th century as Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk (the Mi&#x27;kmaw language) shifted, the name changed to become &quot;Menagoesenog&quot; reflecting islands &quot;battered by the surf.&quot; Although not a distinct district within Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, the archipelago falls within the territorial bounds of the Mi&#x27;kmaw homeland.

==Climate==
The maritime climate of the Îles de la Madeleine is markedly different from that of the mainland. The huge water masses that circle the archipelago both temper the weather and create milder conditions in each season. On the islands, winter is mild, spring is cool, summer has a few heat waves, and fall is typically warm. The Îles de la Madeleine have the least annual frost in Quebec. The warm breezes of summer persist well into September and sometimes early October. However, under the Köppen climate classification its climate is humid continental (Dfb) because its winters average far below freezing by maritime standards. Seasonal lag is strong because of the freezing water and the time that it takes for the gulf to warm up again. Also, in winter, sea ice occasionally forms, impeding offshore communications and activities.

The highest temperature ever recorded was on 31 July 1949. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 14 February 1891.

The Îles de la Madeleine have warmed 2.3 °C (4 °F) in the late 19th century, twice the global average. As a result, the residents are facing a growing number of problems, as extreme climate change transforms the land and water around them. The sea ice that used to encase and protect the islands from most winter storms is shrinking at a rate of about annually. Parts of the shoreline have eroded into the sea at a rate as much as per year in the 2010s. Important roads are at risk of washouts, and important infrastructure, including the hospital and city hall, sit near deteriorating cliffs. Recently the sea has been rising at a rate of per decade, threatening to contaminate freshwater aquifers.

== Erosion ==
Several news articles in 2019 pointed out that erosion of the coastline had already become a significant issue. Researchers have found that the amount has doubled since 2005, and was averaging per year. Recent events that added to the problem included a significant windstorm in November 2018 and the post-tropical storm Dorian that hit the islands in September 2019.

A report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in late October 2019 also indicated that increasing temperatures have led to reduced ice cover over the years, leading to less protection from winter storms. &quot;That ice has been disappearing ... [and the] sea-level rise, have caused the islands to crumble into the sea&quot;.
Researchers have found that the rise in sea levels has been approximately double that of the global norm and that the sea ice is shrinking at approximately 12% per decade. A November 2019 report from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; provided these specifics about the effects of erosion:&quot;Some parts of the shoreline have lost as much as per year to the sea over the past decade. Key roads face perpetual risk of washing out. The hospital and the city hall sit alarmingly close to deteriorating cliffs. Rising waters threaten to contaminate aquifers used for drinking water ... Nearly a dozen homes on the islands have been relocated, and most everyone expects that number to grow.&quot; The sole benefit has been the increase in lobster yields on the islands, at least double what was the norm in the past.

==Economy==
===Tourism===

Tourism is a major component of the islands&#x27; economy, as they have many kilometres (miles) of white sand beaches and steadily-eroding sandstone cliffs. Also, they are a destination for bicycle camping, sea kayaking, windsurfing, and kitesurfing. During the winter months, beginning in mid-February, ecotourists visit to observe newborn and young harp seal pups on the pack ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which surrounds the islands. However the ice cover has reduced recently and the observation &quot;season&quot; has been cancelled several times.

===Industry===
The island is home to Canadian Salt Company Seleine Mines, which produces road salt for use in Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the United States&#x27; eastern seaboard. Opened in 1982, the salt mine and plant is located in Grosse-Île and extracts salt from an underground mine below Grande-Entrée Lagoon. It produces of salt, and employs 200 people.

Although fishing is a traditional occupation, lobster have become a more lucrative local business. It was once common for lobstermen to haul in during a nine-week season that begins each spring, but now it is not unusual to bring home twice that amount, or more. This may be due to climate change that has warmed the surrounding waters to some extent, yielded increasing lobster harvests. An identification guide for
marine fishes of the estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence was completed in 2008.

=== Energy ===
The islands currently generate electricity at the Cap-aux-Meules oil-fired thermal power plant. The 67 MW plant generates 125,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year, or about 40% of Hydro-Québec&#x27;s direct emissions. Hydro-Québec plans to build an undersea HVDC cable from the mainland 225 km (140 miles) away, connecting the islands to the main grid upon completion in 2027. The plan will cost $2.3 billion over 40 years, saving approximately 12%, and reduce emissions by 94%.

<doc id="141840" wikidata="Q211772" url="?curid=141840" title="Anthemius">
<text>Procopius Anthemius (; died 11 July 472) was the Western Roman emperor from 467 to 472. Born in the Eastern Roman Empire, Anthemius quickly worked his way up the ranks. He married into the Theodosian dynasty through Marcia Euphemia, daughter of Eastern emperor Marcian. He soon received a significant number of promotions to various posts, and was presumed to be Marcian&#x27;s planned successor. However, Marcian&#x27;s sudden death in 457, together with that of Western emperor Avitus, left the imperial succession in the hands of Aspar. He instead appointed Leo, a low-ranking officer, to the Eastern throne, probably out of fear that Anthemius would be too independent. Eventually, this same Leo designated Anthemius as Western emperor in 467, following a two-year interregnum that started in November 465.

Anthemius attempted to solve the two primary military challenges facing the remains of the Western Roman Empire: the resurgent Visigoths, under Euric, whose domain straddled the Pyrenees; and the unvanquished Vandals, under Geiseric, in undisputed control of North Africa. Anthemius&#x27;s insistence on ruling independently placed him into direct conflict with the Gothic general Ricimer. Previously the real power behind the throne, Ricimer found that Anthemius&#x27;s reign threatened his own interests. This eventually escalated into open warfare between the two, with the result that Anthemius lost not only his throne, but also his head, in 472.

==Early life==
Anthemius belonged to a noble family, the Procopii, which gave several high officers, both civil and military, to the Eastern Roman Empire. His maternal grandfather was Anthemius, praetorian prefect of the East (404–415) and Roman consul in 405. His father was Procopius, &quot;magister militum&quot; &quot;per Orientem&quot; from 422 to 424, who descended from Procopius, a cousin of Emperor Julian and a usurper against the Eastern emperor Valens (r. 365–366).

Born in Constantinople, he went to Alexandria to study in the school of the Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus; among his fellow students, there were Marcellinus (&quot;magister militum&quot; and governor of Illyricum), Flavius Illustrius Pusaeus (Praetorian prefect of the East and Consul in 467), Messius Phoebus Severus (Consul in 470 and &quot;praefectus urbi&quot;), and Pamprepius (pagan poet).

In 453, he married Marcia Euphemia, daughter of the Eastern emperor Marcian (450–457); after the marriage, he was elevated to the rank of &quot;comes&quot; and sent to the Danubian frontier with the task of rebuilding the border defences, neglected after Attila&#x27;s death in 453. In 454, he was recalled to Constantinople, where he received the title of &quot;patricius&quot; in 454 or 455 and became one of the two &quot;magistri militum&quot; or &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; of the East. In 455, he received the honour of holding the consulate with the Western emperor Valentinian III as a colleague.

This succession of honourable events – the wedding with Marcian&#x27;s daughter; a promotion to an important military rank, but with administrative rather than military tasks; the prestigious rank of &quot;patricius&quot; and the highest military position; the consulate held with an Emperor as a colleague – suggests that Marcian had selected Anthemius as a possible candidate for the Eastern or Western throne. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that Anthemius&#x27; prestige misled the 6th-century historian John Malalas to state that Marcian had designated Anthemius as Western Emperor after Avitus.

In October 456, the Western emperor Avitus was deposed; Marcian probably considered Anthemius as his successor, but the Eastern emperor died in January 457 before choosing his colleague. Therefore, both empires had no emperor, and the power was in the hands of the Western generals, Ricimer and Majorian, and the Eastern &quot;Magister militum&quot;, the Alan Aspar. As Aspar could not sit on the throne because of his barbarian origin, he opposed Anthemius, whose prestige would have made him independent, and chose a low-ranking military officer, Leo; in the West, as his barbarian origin barred Ricimer from the throne, it was Majorian who received the purple.

Anthemius stayed in service under the new emperor; as &quot;magister militum&quot;, his task was to defend the Empire from the barbarian populations pressing on its border. Around 460, he defeated the Ostrogoths of Valamir in Illyricum. During the winter of 466/467, he defeated a group of Huns, led by Hormidac, who had crossed the frozen Danube and pillaged Dacia. The raiders had conquered Serdica, and Anthemius besieged the city until the starved Huns decided to accept open battle; despite the treachery of his cavalry commander (a Hun), Anthemius led his infantry to victory, and when Hormidac offered surrender Anthemius asked for the deserter to be given to him.

==Rise to the throne==
The newly elected Eastern Roman emperor, Leo I the Thracian, had a major foreign affairs problem: the Vandals of King Geiseric and their raids on the Italian coasts. After the death of Libius Severus in 465, the Western Empire had no Emperor. Gaiseric had his own candidate, Olybrius, who was related to Gaiseric because both Olybrius and a son of Gaiseric&#x27;s had married the two daughters of emperor Valentinian III.

With Olybrius on the throne, Gaiseric would become the real power behind the throne of the Western Empire. Leo, on the other hand, wanted to keep Gaiseric as far as possible from the imperial court at Ravenna, and took time to choose a successor to Severus. To put Leo under pressure, Gaiseric extended his attacks on Sicily and Italy to the territories of the Eastern Empire, sacking and enslaving people living in Illyricum, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greece, so Leo was obliged to take action.

In 467, Leo I designated Anthemius as Western emperor and sent him to Italy with an army led by the &quot;Magister militum per Illyricum&quot; Marcellinus. On 12 April, Anthemius was proclaimed Emperor (&quot;augustus&quot;) at the third or twelfth mile from Rome. Anthemius&#x27; election was celebrated in Constantinople with a panegyric by Dioscorus.

By choosing Anthemius, Leo obtained three results: he sent a possible candidate to the Eastern throne far away; he repulsed Gaiseric&#x27;s attempt to put a puppet of his own on the Western throne; and he put a capable and proven general with a trained army in Italy, ready to fight the Vandals.

==Rule==
===Foreign affairs===

====Relationship with the Eastern Empire====
The reign of Anthemius was characterised by a good diplomatic relationship with the Eastern Empire; for example, Anthemius is the last Western Emperor to be recorded in an Eastern law. Both courts collaborated in the choice of the yearly consuls, as each court chose a consul and accepted the other&#x27;s choice. Anthemius had the honour of holding the consulate &quot;sine collega&quot; (without a colleague) in 468, the first year he started as Emperor, following a similar honour given to Leo in 466. The following year the two consuls were Anthemius&#x27; son, Marcian, and Leo&#x27;s son-in-law, Flavius Zeno (later successor of Leo on the Eastern throne).

In 470 the consuls were Messius Phoebus Severus, Anthemius&#x27; old friend and fellow student at Proclus&#x27; school, and the &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot; Flavius Iordanes. In 471, the year in which Leo held his fourth consulate with the Praetorian prefect of Italy Caelius Aconius Probianus as colleague, the two emperors strengthened their bonds with a marriage between Anthemius&#x27; son, Marcian, and Leo&#x27;s daughter, Leontia; Marcian was honoured with his second consulate the following year, this time chosen by the Eastern court.

Anthemius&#x27; matrimonial policy also included the marriage of his only daughter, Alypia, and the powerful &quot;Magister militum&quot; Ricimer. The poet Sidonius Apollinaris arrived in Rome on the occasion of the wedding at the end of 467 and described the celebrations in which all social classes were involved; he also hints that Alypia might have not liked her husband, a barbarian.

====Campaigns against the Vandals====
The Vandals were the major problem of the Western Empire. In late 467, Anthemius organised a campaign of the western Roman army, probably under the command of Marcellinus. The campaign to overthrow the Vandals was on a large scale, with more than 100,000 men. However, the war would end in failure: the bad weather obliged the Roman fleet to return to its base before completing the operation.

In 468, Leo the Thracian, Anthemius and Marcellinus organized a major operation against the Vandal Kingdom in Africa. The commander-in-chief of the operation was Leo&#x27;s brother-in-law Basiliscus (who would become Eastern emperor seven years later). A fleet consisting of upwards of one thousand vessels was collected to transport the combined Eastern-Western-Illyric army, and while most of the expenses were paid for by the Eastern Empire, Anthemius and the Western treasury contributed to the costs. The Roman fleet took a massive defeat at the Battle of Cape Bon due to Basiliscus allowing Gaiseric five days to draw up conditions for a peace, which he used to gather his ships and surprise attack the Roman fleet, destroying at least half of the Roman ships. Basiliscus escaped the battle to Sicily to meet with Marcellinus, although Marcellinus was later killed by an assassin.

Leo decided to sign a separate peace with Gaiseric. Anthemius lost his allies and, with the imperial treasury almost emptied by the failed operation, renounced taking Africa back. Peter Heather considers this expedition to have been the final opportunity to restore the Empire, which from this point would now only control the Italian peninsula and Sicily.

====Campaigns against the Visigoths====
After the disastrous campaign in Africa, Anthemius concentrated on the second problem of his Empire, keeping under his control the Western provinces targeted by Visigothic expansion. He turned to the reconquest of Gaul, occupied by Visigoths under the ambitious King Euric who had exploited the weak Roman control caused by political instability. Euric&#x27;s sphere of influence had also separated some imperial provinces from the rest of the Empire. Even though Arelate and Marseille in Southern Gaul were still governed by the Western court, Avernia was isolated from the rest of the Empire and governed by Ecdicius, son of Emperor Avitus, while the territory later included in the so-called Domain of Soissons was located further north.

In 470, Anthemius recruited Britons living in either Britain or Armorica to fight Euricus. The Britons, under King Riothamus, were initially successful and occupied Bourges with twelve thousand men. However, when they entered the core of Visigoth territory, trying to conquer Déols, they were outnumbered and defeated by a Visigoth army, and Riothamus was forced to flee to the Burgundians, who were Roman allies.

Anthemius took the matter into his own hands and decided to attack the Visigoths directly. He collected an army under the nominal leadership of his own son, Anthemiolus, but actually commanded by the generals Torisarius, Everdingus, and Hermianus. Anthemiolus moved from Arelate and crossed the Rhone river, but he was intercepted by Euric, who defeated and killed the Roman generals and pillaged the area.

===Internal affairs and relationship with the Roman Senate===
While Africa was lost and the control over Western provinces was shaky, Anthemius&#x27; power over Italy was threatened by internal opposition; he was of Greek origin, had been chosen by the Eastern Emperor from among members of the Eastern court, and was suspected of being a pagan.

In order to obtain the support of the senatorial aristocracy, Anthemius conferred the rank of &quot;patricius&quot; on members of the Italian and Gallic governing class. He introduced the practice, common in the East, of appointing even civilians to the patrician rank, and honoured so many members of the aristocracy with this title that it suffered a sort of inflation. Among the new &quot;patricii&quot; there were Italian senators, e.g. Romanus and Messius Phoebus Severus, but against common practice he also appointed Gallic senators and even aristocrats without noteworthy careers, such as Magnus Felix and the Gallic poet Sidonius Apollinaris.

Sidonius had come to Rome to bring a petition from his people; his contact in the court, the consul Caecina Decius Basilius, suggested that he should compose a panegyric to be performed at the beginning of Anthemius&#x27; consulate, on 1 January 468. The Emperor honoured the poet, conferring on him the patrician rank, the high rank of &quot;Caput senatus&quot;, and even the office of &quot;Praefectus urbi&quot; of Rome, usually reserved to members of the Italian aristocracy. Sidonius was so influential that he convinced the Emperor to commute the death penalty of Arvandus, the Praetorian prefect of Gaul who had allied himself with the Visigoths.

====Coinage====

The good relationship between the two Roman Emperors was good news in the recent affairs between the two halves of the Roman Empire, and was used in imperial propaganda. Anthemius had his mints (at Mediolanum, Ravenna and Rome) issue &quot;solidi&quot; depicting the two Emperors joining hands in a show of unity.

Anthemius had restored his court in Rome, and thus this mint became more and more important, overshadowing the other two mints.

Some coins are in the name of his wife Marcia Euphemia; among these there is a &quot;solidus&quot; depicting two Empresses on the thrones, probably a reference to Alypia&#x27;s marriage.

==Death==
The most important figure at the Western court was Ricimer, the powerful &quot;magister militum&quot;, who had already decided the fate of several emperors. The new emperor, however, had been chosen by the Eastern court, and, despite the bond of the marriage between Ricimer and Anthemius&#x27; daughter, Alypia, they were not on good terms. The tipping point of their relationship was the trial of Romanus, an Italian senator and &quot;patricius&quot; supported by Ricimer; Anthemius accused Romanus of treachery and condemned him to death in 470.

Ricimer had gathered 6,000 men for the war against the Vandals, and after the death of Romanus he moved with his men to the north, leaving Anthemius in Rome. Supporters of the two parties fought several brawls, but Ricimer and the emperor signed a one-year truce after the mediation of Epiphanius, the Bishop of Pavia.

At the beginning of 472, the struggle between them renewed, and Anthemius was obliged to feign an illness and took refuge in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Eastern Roman emperor, Leo, sent Olybrius to mediate between Ricimer and Anthemius but, according to John Malalas, had sent a secret letter to Anthemius, urging him to kill Olybrius. Ricimer intercepted the letter, showed it to Olybrius, and had him proclaimed emperor.

The struggle became an open war. Anthemius, with the aristocracy and the people of the city, faced the Gothic &quot;magister militum&quot; and the barbarian units of the army, which included Odoacer&#x27;s men. Ricimer blockaded Anthemius in Rome; five months of fighting followed. Ricimer entered the city and succeeded in separating the port on the Tiber from the Palatine, starving the supporters of the emperor.

Both sides appealed to the army in Gaul, but the &quot;Magister militum per Gallias&quot;, the Burgundian Gundobad, supported his uncle Ricimer. Anthemius elevated Bilimer to the rank of &quot;Rector Galliarum&quot; and had him enter Italy with the loyal army. Bilimer arrived in Rome but died trying to prevent Ricimer entering the centre of the city from the other side of the Tiber, through the Pons Aelius in front of the Mausoleum of Hadrian.

Losing any hope of external help and pressed by the scarcity of food, Anthemius tried to rally, but his men were defeated and killed in great numbers. The emperor fled for the second time to St. Peter&#x27;s (or, according to other sources, to Santa Maria in Trastevere), where he was captured and beheaded by Gundobad or by Ricimer on 11 July 472.

Sources for Anthemius&#x27;s life are richer than for most fifth century Western Emperors, partly because of his origin in Constantinople, where the tradition of court histories was kept alive, and partly because of the details that can be extracted from a panegyric delivered on 1 January 468 by the Gallo-Roman poet Sidonius Apollinaris.

<text>Arthur Honegger (; 10 March 1892 – 27 November 1955) was a Swiss composer who was born in France and lived a large part of his life in Paris. Honegger was a member of Les Six. For Halbreich, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot; is &quot;more even than &quot;Le Roi David&quot; or &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, his most universally popular work&quot;.

==Biography==
Born Oscar-Arthur Honegger (the first name was never used) to Swiss parents in Le Havre, France, he initially studied harmony with Robert-Charles Martin (to whom he dedicated his first published work) and violin in Le Havre. He then moved to Switzerland, where he spent two years (September 1909 – June 1911) at the Zurich Conservatory being taught by Lothar Kempter and Friedrich Hegar. In 1911, he enrolled in the Paris Conservatoire from 1911 to 1918 (except for a brief period during the winter of 1914–1915, when he was mobilised in Switzerland), studying with Charles-Marie Widor, Lucien Capet, André Gédalge and Vincent d&#x27;Indy. Gédalge encouraged him to compose and Honegger announced his decision to become a composer in a letter to his parents dated 28 April 1915. He then praised his teacher Gédalge and his &quot;Traité de la fugue&quot; (1904), &quot;the most complete work ever written on the subject&quot;. Gédalge taught his pupils the craft while respecting their ideas and personalities, he went on, and added that while some teachers trained their pupils well to succeed in competitions, &quot;the most advanced musicians in terms of modern spirit were Gédalge&#x27;s pupils&quot;.

Among his notable early works are his &quot;Six Poèmes d&#x27;Apollinaire&quot; (poems from &quot;Alcools&quot;), premiered in 1916 and 1918; &#x27;Hommage à Ravel&#x27; from the &quot;Trois pièces pour piano&quot; (1915); &quot;Quatre Poèmes&quot; H. 7 (1914–1916); &quot;Trois Poèmes de Paul Fort&quot; (1916); his very Debussian &quot;Prélude pour Aglavaine et Sélysette&quot; (inspired by Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play : the prelude was premiered at the orchestral class in 1917, with a public premiere in 1920); &quot;Le Dit des Jeux du monde&quot;, commissioned in April 1918 by the Belgian poet , premiered by Walther Straram at Jane Bathori&#x27;s Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, in December 1918 (Composed of thirteen short pieces that at times evoke Schönberg, this work dedicated to Fernand Ochsé, &quot; caused a scandal comparable in every way to those of The Rite of Spring or of Parade&quot;); &quot;Le Chant de Nigamon&quot; (1918, public premiere by the Orchestre Pasdeloup in 1920: his first symphonic piece, inspired by Gustave Aimard&#x27;s adventure novel &quot;Le Souriquet&quot; with Native American themes (thanks to Julien Tiersot&#x27;s &quot;Notes d&#x27;ethnographie musicale&quot;); his first String Quartet, &quot;the composer&#x27;s first fully accomplished masterpiece&quot; (Halbreich 1992, p. 311) premiered in 1919 by the Quatuor Capelle; music for &quot;Vérité ? Mensonge ?&quot;, a ballet by André Hellé: four out of the ten tableaux were premiered at the Salon d&#x27;automne, on 25 November 1920, with Yvonne Daunt; and in 1920–1921 &quot;Pastorale d&#x27;été&quot; premiered by Vladimir Golschmann.

While at the conservatoire, Honegger befriended Jacques Ibert, then Milhaud, and then met Germaine Tailleferre and later Georges Auric was well as the pianist Andrée Vaurabourg. The first concert of the Nouveaux Jeunes took place at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier on 15 January 1918: Jane Bathori and Andrée Vaurabourg gave the &quot;Six Poèmes d&#x27;Apollinaire&quot; (now complete for the first time). Roland-Manuel was present, Halbreich notes that he might well have been one of the Six, as well as Jacques Ibert. Those who would later be known as &quot;Les Six&quot; wanted to create a fresh, French style of composition. Honegger was far from blending in with the group as his style was somewhat more serious (&quot;I don&#x27;t have a cult for street fairs or the music-hall&quot;, he wrote in a letter to Paul Landormy) and complex. Nevertheless, this association was important in establishing his reputation in the Parisian music scene. Honegger collaborated with the other members of Les Six only in 1920 (with a short &#x27;Sarabande&#x27; for L&#x27;Album des Six), and 1921 (with a &#x27;Marche funèbre&#x27; for Les mariés de la tour Eiffel, and finally in 1952 (with a &#x27;Toccata&#x27; for La Guirlande de Campra).

Honegger&#x27;s &quot;Sonata for cello and piano&quot; H. 32 composed in 1920 was premiered in 1921 by Diran Alexanian et Andrée Varabourg : it « should be part of every cellist&#x27;s repertoire » (Halbreich 1992, p. 330). He also wrote &quot;Danse de la chèvre&quot; (1921), which has become a staple in the flute repertoire. The work is dedicated to René Le Roy and written for solo flute.

Loie Fuller danced on three of the dances of &quot;Le Dit des Jeux du monde&quot; early in 1921. Also in 1921 Ernest Ansermet conducted the avant-garde music of the ballet-pantomime &quot;Horace victorieux&quot; in Lausanne (in a concert version). It evokes the fight of the Horatii and Curiatii and concludes with Camilla&#x27;s death. Still in 1921, René Morax commissioned Honegger to write &quot;Le Roi David&quot;: he completed his score in two months, and on 11 June the &#x27;dramatic psalm&#x27; (written as incidental music) was triumphantly received. On 13 March 1924, Honegger shot to fame when the French version re-orchestrated for large orchestra of &quot;Le Roi David&quot; was performed in Paris under the baton of Robert Siohan. It is still in the choral repertoire. &quot;Making &quot;Le Roi David&quot; into an oratorio [or a &#x27;psaume symphonique&#x27;] is one of the key events in the musical life of the first half of the 20th century,&quot; musicologist Mathieu Ferey wrote in the booklet for the recording of &quot;Le roi David&quot; by Daniel Reuss (Mirare). In this version, the spoken voices are replaced by a narrator, but the instrumentation remains the same: the work is written for the seventeen instruments available at the Théâtre du Jorat: no strings except for a double bass, winds, percussion, piano, harmonium and celesta. It was conducted by Georges Martin Witkowski in Lyon in January 1923 and is still played and recorded today.

Honegger&#x27;s works were played in the US from 1921 when Rudolph Ganz directed &quot;Horace&quot; and &quot;Pastorale d&#x27;été&quot;.

In 1922, Honegger became one of the first major composers (after Camille Saint-Saëns) to write music specifically for films. His score (of which only the &#x27;Ouverture&#x27; remains) for the silent film &quot;La Roue&quot; (1923) by Abel Gance marked the beginning of his long involvement with film music. 1922 He had met Gance through the French writer Ricciotto Canudo, an advocate of cinema as the &quot;Seventh Art&quot;. He worked for Gance again in 1927 for Napoleon and in 1943 for Captain Fracasse.

1922 is also the year Honegger lost his mother (in February) and father (in September).

In 1923, Honegger composed a short piece which was to become one of this most often recorded works: &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, for the Concerts Koussevitzky at the Opéra de Paris in May 1924– although Serge Koussevitzky was already music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The music captures the interest of the casual music lover as it mimics the sounds and motion of a steam locomotive – Honegger said &quot;I have always loved locomotives passionately. For me they are living creatures…&quot; but for the composer, the main point was to &quot;giv[e] the impression of a mathematical acceleration of rhythm, while the movement itself slows down.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Chanson de Ronsard&quot; H.54 (on Ronsard&#x27;s &#x27;Plus tu connais que je brûle pour toi&#x27;, composed to mark the 450th anniversary of the poet&#x27;s birth, exists in a version for voice and piano (premiered by Claire Croiza, 1924), and above all for voice, flute and string quartet (Régine de Lormoy, 1925).

Another significant work was &quot;Judith&quot; for René Morax&#x27;s play, which continued his interest in religious themes. It was premiered as a biblical drama in December 1924 or January 1925 at the Théâtre du Jorat, then reworked as an &quot;opéra sérieux&quot; (1926, Monte-Carlo), and finally became an oratorio (1927, Rotterdam). It is dedicated to Claire Croiza (the mother of his son Jean-Claude, 1926–2003) who sang the part of Judith in the first version. Halbreich (p. 550) says that &quot;Judith is full of marvellous, inspired music although the whole piece is imperfect.&quot;

In 1922, Honegger had written a very brief piece of incidental music for Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; based on the tragedy by Sophocles. The composer then developed it between 1924 and 1927 for the opera Antigone which premiered on 28 December 1927 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie under Maurice Corneil de Thoran&#x27;s baton, with sets designed by Pablo Picasso and costumes by Coco Chanel. It is dedicated to &quot;Vaura&quot; : Andrée Vaurabourg.

In 1926, he married Andrée Vaurabourg, a pianist and fellow student at the Paris Conservatoire, on the condition that they live in separate apartments because he required solitude for composing. Andrée lived with her mother, and Honegger visited them for lunch every day. They lived apart for the duration of their marriage, with the exception of one year from 1935 to 1936 following Vaurabourg&#x27;s injury in a car accident, and the last year of Honegger&#x27;s life, when he was not well enough to live alone. They had one daughter, Pascale, born in 1932.

In 1928 Honegger composed a new symphonic movement called &quot;Rugby,&quot; inspired by the sport. The music reflects &quot;the attacks and counter-attacks of the game, the rhythm and colour of a match at the Colombe stadium&quot;, according to the composer himself. &quot;La Tempête&quot;, incidental music for Shakespeare&#x27;s play, was composed between 1923 and 1929 and premiered in 1929.

In December 1930, at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens, the first of Honegger&#x27;s three operettas, &quot;Les Aventures du roi Pausole&quot;, revealing a Honegger full of humour, was a huge success with no less than 800 performances according to Halbreich (p. 671) The composer admitted to having three models here: Mozart, Chabrier and Messager (p. 671). In 1932 &quot;Les Cris du monde&quot;, an oratorio on a text by René Bizet (1887–1947) inspired (loosely) by John Keats&#x27; sonnet &#x27;To Solitude&#x27;, expressed Honegger&#x27;s great pessimism : it was a warning against &quot;everything that contributes to the loss of the soul and the death of the individual&quot; including pollution, noise, mass culture, etc.

The &quot; Symphony No. 1 &quot; composed in 1929–30, was premiered in Boston and then in Paris in 1931. It is described by Harry Halbreich as &quot;written in a language that is rougher and less spare than the following ones, despite a perfectly mastered form, at the crossroads of youth and maturity&quot;. &quot;Mouvement symphonique No 3&quot; (composed in 1932–1933) was premiered in March 1933 by those who commissioned it: Wilhelm Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic. G. K. Spratt thought it was his best symphonic piece so far.

From 1925 onwards (&quot;L&#x27;Impératrice aux rochers&quot; with very Fauréan passages), the patron Ida Rubinstein (a former dancer with the Ballets Russes) financed several works by Honegger, who collaborated with Paul Valéry for &quot;Amphion&quot; (1931), as well as the ballet &quot;Sémiramis&quot; (1934), created by Ida Rubinstein at the Opéra. The former is best remembered for the composer&#x27;s &quot;Prelude, Fugue et Postlude&quot; (first performed in 1948).

Honegger also collaborated with Serge Lifar for &quot;Icare&quot; (1935) for percussion and double bass, then for &quot;Le Cantique des cantiques&quot;, premiered in 1938. On this occasion the choreographer published his manifesto &quot;La Danse et la Musique&quot; (&quot;Revue Musicale&quot;, March 1938) in which he claimed the pre-eminence of dancers and choreographers in the conception of ballets.

L&#x27;Aiglon, drame lyrique (on a libretto by Henri Cain based on Edmond Rostand&#x27;s 1900 play, L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;), about the life of Napoleon II, was written in collaboration avec Jacques Ibert in 1936 and premiered in 1937. Kent Nagano released a good CD recording of it in 2016. With the same composer (Ibert) Honegger wrote the operetta &quot;Les Petites Cardinal&quot;, in the same vein as &quot;Le Roi Pausole&quot; (Bouffes-Parisiens, 1938). He also wrote a very short piano piece with an original title in English, &quot;Scenic Railway&quot; in 1937, premiered in 1938. It was his contribution to a collaborative work, &quot;Parc d&#x27;Attractions – Expo. 1937: Hommage à Marguerite Long&quot;.

He remained active in the field of film music, notably with scores for Raymond Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1934), Pierre Chenal&#x27;s&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;; &quot;Les Mutinés de l&#x27;Elseneur&quot; and Anatole Litvak&#x27;s&quot;Mayerling&quot; (1936 film) p648, in collaboration with Maurice Jaubert (1936); and &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938). In 1939, the film score for &quot;Love Cavalcade&quot; was written partly by Milhaud (&quot;La cheminée du roi René&quot; is a suite drawn from his score) and partly by Honegger (His &quot;O Salutaris&quot; for voice, piano and organ or just organ (premiered in 1943) is derived from this work).

The &quot;Quartet n° 3&quot;, &quot;unquestionably the pinnacle of his chamber music &quot; for was also composed in 1936–37; it was premiered in October 1937 by the Pro Arte Quartet. It had been commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. After this work, Honegger stopped writing chamber music, with only a few exceptions.

On a new commission from Ida Rubinstein he wrote a &quot;dramatic oratorio&quot;, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot;, to a libretto by Paul Claudel, premiered by Paul Sacher in Basel in 1938. It is thought of as one of his finest works, blending spoken word, music, and choral elements to tell the story of Joan of Arc. It remains one of his most frequently performed compositions. There is a DVD version recorded by Don Kent.

For Le Chant du Monde, he harmonized several French folk songs recorded under Désormière&#x27;s direction: &quot;La femme du marin&quot; (CdM 513, May 1938) and &quot;Les trois princesses au pommier doux&quot; (CdM 520, October 1938) and two of his works were recorded, again by Désormière: &quot;Jeunesse&quot; recorded by the Chorale de la jeunesse, with an orchestra directed by Roger Désormière (CdM 501, fév 1938) and &quot;Petite suite en trois parties&quot;.

Things were not all good during the 1930s: in 1932, Honegger published &quot;Pour prendre congé&quot;, an article in which he complained that his music was not understood, he felt he was on a dead end. When Hitler came to power, Honegger&#x27;s works were banned (in Germany and later in the countries that were annexed). In 1934, Vaura was seriously injured a car accident – Honegger escaped without serious injury. Above all, the political climate in Europe was increasingly tense. In 1937, Honegger had written &quot;Jeunesse&quot; for the Fédération musicale populaire: it was a song celebrating the singing tomorrows after the success of the Front Populaire. The lyrics were by Paul Vaillant-Couturier, a journalist at L&#x27;Humanité who tried to alert people to the realities of Hitler&#x27;s regime and founded the first (which included the Fédération musicale populaire) in France. Honegger took a clear stand against the Nazi regime in the June 1939 issue of the magazine &quot;Clarté&quot;: &quot;He who creates cannot reconcile his dignity as an artist with the enslavement that fascism imposes&quot;. In 1931 Honegger, like many musicians and intellectuals, had already expressed his support for the manifesto for peace published in &quot;Notre temps&quot; which concluded with: &quot;It is therefore important that this country [France], made so rich by its past achievements, should dare to proclaim that the new Europe and a Franco-German entente, which is its keystone, can only arise from agreements freely entered into by their pacified populations.&quot;

During World War II, Honegger, although he was Swiss, chose to remain in Paris, which was under Nazi occupation from 14 June 1940 to 24 August 1944. Honegger initially fled south, but returned to Paris at the end of October 1940. Nevertheless, he was allowed to continue his work without too much interference and even to travel abroad several times during the war years, mostly to conduct his music – only twice to Switzerland, and without his family.

In March 1940, in Basel, Sacher premiered the sacred oratorio &quot;La Danse des morts&quot;, whose libretto was by Paul Claudel (and based on the Bible), and it was a great success. It was commissioned by Paul Sacher and the music was written between July and November 1938. In April 1940, the first of three radio plays for &quot;Radio Lausanne&quot; was broadcast, based on a text by the actor : &quot;Christophe Colomb&quot;, the score of which dates from 1940 (and which can be heard in English on YouTube). Two more radio plays were written under the same conditions: &quot;Battements du monde&quot; (1944) and &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot; (1949).
The premiere of &quot;Nicholas of Flüe&quot;, composed in 1938–39 and scheduled for Zurich, finally took place in Solothurn, not far from Bern, in October 1940. The oratorio, written to the glory of the patron saint of Switzerland, Nicholas of Flüe, based on the work of Denis de Rougemont, was inspired by the euphoria triggered (initially) by the Munich agreements – which stirred the composer&#x27;s pacifist feelings. &quot;Honegger excelled in these large-scale frescoes that require a powerful breath. Rising very high, while retaining the popular character that befits them, he knew how to put into them as much poetry as familiar grandeur,&quot; wrote the critic of &quot;Le Monde&quot;. The composition of the &quot;Sonata for solo violin&quot; premiered later by Christian Ferras (1953 Decca recording on YouTube) dates from the same period.

In 1941 Honegger became a music critic for &quot;Comœdia&quot;, from its first to its last issue on 5 August 1944 (his contributions became irregular after the issue of 16 October 1943, perhaps due to his exclusion from the Front National des Musiciens). &quot;Comœdia&quot; was a journal of cultural information more or less dependent on the occupation authorities. Some time later, Honegger joined the Front National des Musiciens, a resistance organisation founded within the Communist Party: he later considered that he had been co-opted because he wrote in &quot;Comœdia&quot;, to defend French music.

1941 saw the premiere of &quot;Trois poèmes de Claudel&quot; (written in 1939–1940) by Pierre Bernac and Poulenc, &quot;the pinnacle of the composer&#x27;s entire melodic oeuvre&quot; (H358)&quot;; the composition of &quot;Petit cours de morale&quot; on extracts from the novel &quot;Suzanne et le Pacifique&quot; by Jean Giraudoux, premiered in 1942; and above all the writing of the second symphony.

The composer returned to incidental music with two small works premiered on 2 April 1941: &quot;La Mandragore&quot; (for Machiavelli&#x27;s play &quot;The Mandrake&quot;) and &quot;Prélude et postlude pour &#x27;L&#x27;Ombre de la Ravine&quot;&#x27; (for Synge&#x27;s &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot;).

Honegger was later criticised for accepting an invitation from the Third Reich to attend the celebrations in Vienna for the 150th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s death, but it was on this occasion that he brought out of France the score of his second symphony (written in 1941–1942), which had been commissioned by the patron and yet conductor Paul Sacher, and which was premiered in Zurich in 1942 under Sacher&#x27;s direction. The &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot; is a work for strings and trumpet, and it reflects the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the war years, but the atmosphere changes in its final movement and finally offers a glimmer of hope with the introduction of a trumpet – about one minute from the end of the symphony. Halbreich considers it as the &#x27;supreme masterpiece of its composer&#x27; and adds that it is one of his most frequently recorded pieces, along with &quot;Pacific 231&quot;.

On 3 February 1942, another event for which he was later reproached took place: he attended a reception at the Hotel Ritz organized by Heinz Schmidtke, head of the section, given in honor of Heinz Drewes &quot;and attended by various personalities from the Parisian musical world&quot;. Drewes was head of Division X (in charge of music) of the Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda. Some suspected that Honegger had taken advantage of the situation to further his own interests, but Halbreich makes light of this accusation.

Works from this year include the &quot;Three Psalms&quot;, completed in January 1941 and premiered in April 1942. At the same time, he was working on his &quot;Passion de Selzach&quot;, based on a libretto by his compatriot Cäsar von Arx. The work begun in 1938, resumed in 1940–41 and again in 1942 and December 1944, finally came to nothing, but Honegger reused part of his work in the &quot;Cantate de Noël&quot;.

In May 1942, Paul Sacher conducted the premiere of the &quot;Second Symphony&quot; in Zurich. In June 1942, a whole series of concerts took place to celebrate the composer&#x27;s fiftieth birthday. Of particular note was the concert at which Charles Münch conducted the French premiere of the &quot;Second Symphony&quot;, followed by &quot;Joan of Arc at the stake&quot;. In October, he wrote the score requested by resistance fighter Pierre Blanchar for his film &quot;Secrets&quot;. He collaborated again with Blanchar, when he wrote the score of the following summer.

Among the important events of 1943 were the recording of &quot; Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot; on disc by and the premiere of Antigone at the Opéra de Paris – but for only seventeen performances between 1943 and 1952. Honegger also wrote small pieces for Henry de Montherlant&#x27;s play &quot;Pasiphaé&quot; (1936), Claudel&#x27;s Le Soulier de Satin, as well as a few very short works for six trombone players and percussions, &quot;Sodome et Gomorre&quot;, for Giraudoux&#x27;s play &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;.

The premiere recording of his &quot;Cello Concerto&quot; (composed in 1929 and premiered in 1930) was also made in 1943 by dedicatee and premiere performer Maurice Maréchal under the composer&#x27;s baton.

Moreover, Honegger composed a score for the film &quot;Mermoz&quot; based on the life of the aviator Jean Mermoz (mai 1943), and extracted two orchestral suites, &quot;one of the most beautiful scores Honegger ever wrote for the cinema&quot;. He also composed for Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;Le Capitaine Fracasse&quot; just before Gance had to flee to Spain in August 1943. The piano score was recorded by Jean-Francois Antonioli but the full orchestra score seems to be lost. He also wrote a score for &quot;Callisto, la petite nymphe de Diane&quot;, an animated cartoon by André Édouard Marty, in collaboration with Roland-Manuel.

Finally, he wrote the music for a ballet, &quot;L&#x27;appel de la montagne&quot;, which was premiered only in July 1945.

Honegger was expelled from the Front national des musiciens in 1943, maybe in September or October, presumably because he was considered too close to the enemy. Writing in &quot;Comœdia&quot; (now considered too collaborationist) now worked against him...

From January 1944, Honegger composed his music for the radio play &quot;Battements du monde&quot; and wrote several short pieces for &quot;Charles le téméraire&quot; (&quot;Charles the Bold&quot;), which premiered at the Théâtre du Jorat in May. He composed the 3rd and 4th songs of &quot;Quatre chansons pour voix grave&quot;. Songs n°2 (text by ), n°3 (on Paul Verlaine&#x27;s &#x27;Un grand sommeil noir&#x27;) and n°4 (on Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s &#x27;La terre les eaux va buvant&#x27;) were premiered in May 1944 by Ginette Guillamat (1911–1999) and Pierre Sancan, at the Salle du Conservatoire. The first song, based on a text by Arshag Chobanian, was not composed until December 1945. Then there was the composition of the &#x27;Prologue&#x27; to &quot;Jeanne au bûcher&quot; – the work with its prologue was premiered only in February 1946, in Brussels. The other musical event of the year was, in March, the completion of the recording of &quot;Symphonie n°2&quot; by his friend Charles Münch; the first part of the recording had taken place in October 1942.

Two more significant events took place: firstly, the death of his friend Max Jacob who was arrested by the Gestapo in February and transferred to the Drancy internment camp. He died before the next convoy left for Auschwitz. Then, only a few days before the liberation of Paris, Louise and Fernand Ochsé were arrested in Cannes, in July. When they were driven to Drancy, Honegger did his best on their behalf, in vain.

After the liberation of Paris and of France, Honegger, a Swiss citizen, was not exactly &quot;épuré&quot; (tried). Although he was not officially reproached for anything, it so happened that his works disappeared from concert programmes.

From January 1945 (and until April 1946), Honegger began work on his third symphony, called &quot;Symphonie liturgique&quot;, dedicated to Münch, who conducted its premiere in Zurich in 1946. The three movements take their titles from the parts of the Requiem Mass (like Britten&#x27;s earlier Sinfonia da Requiem): Dies irae, De profundis clamavi and Dona nobis pacem. Honegger evokes war, then what remains in man that drives him to elevate himself, and finally what the composer calls &quot;the inevitable rise of the stupidity of the world&quot; – before, in the final few bars, &quot;the symphony ends with an – alas! – utopian evocation of what life could be like in mutual brotherhood and love&quot; says Honegger whose voice was recorded.

According to René Dumesnil, the &quot;Symphonie liturgique&quot; achieves a grandeur to which very few musicians have attained&quot;: it was &quot;for about ten years one of the most performed works of contemporary music&quot;. Halbreich sees the &#x27;De profundis&#x27; as &quot;one of the highest peaks of his work&quot;.

Apart from this symphony, he also wrote a &quot;Morceau de concours pour violon et piano&quot; (a competition piece) in June, in time for the Conservatoire exams (but good enough to have been recorded): he was a member of the boards of examiners of the Conservatoire and the École Normale de Musique de Paris – although he started teaching (at the ENM) only in 1946; a short piece for cello solo, &quot;Paduana&quot; in July, a &quot;truly superb piece&quot; for Halbreich&quot;; he also set to music a poem by painter Henri Martin (1860–1943), &quot;Ô temps, suspends ton vol&quot; (the title echoes a line from &#x27;Le Lac&#x27;, a famous poem by Lamartine) for voice and piano; and, in December, the last of the &quot;Quatre Chansons pour voix grave&quot; (which became the first).

By August 1945 Honegger was back at the Paris Opéra, with &quot;L&#x27;Appel de la Montagne&quot;, &quot;a ballet that is both folkloric and fairytale-like, set in the pre-Romantic era and in the setting of the Bernese Alps&quot; to a libretto by . The music used popular Swiss and Scottish themes. It featured Yvette Chauviré and , dancer and choreographer. The press widely echoed it, and the critic of &#x27;, wrote: &quot;This is the first novelty given by the Opéra since the Liberation: it is worthy of the honour.&quot;. Honegger then produced a concert suite from it, &quot;Jour de Fête suisse&quot;.

Honegger again returned to ballet music by composing two tableaux (I and IV) of the ballet &quot;Chota Roustaveli&quot; on Nikolai Evreinov&#x27;s libretto based on the poem by the great Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli (c. 1160 – after c. 1220), &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;, with Alexander Tcherepnin (act II) and Tibor Harsányi (act III), with a rhythmic base provided by Serge Lifar (Monte-Carlo, May 1946).

He also composed some film music, for Raymond Bernard&#x27;s &quot;Un ami viendra ce soir&quot; (released in 1946): &quot;Souvenir de Chopin&quot; and &quot;Chant de la Délivrance&quot; are part of this score (although the latter had been composed earlier). His other film score was for Yves Allégret&#x27;s &quot;Les démons de l&#x27;aube&quot; (1946), written in collaboration with his friend Arthur Hoérée.

1946 was marked by numerous trips in France and Europe, including during his holidays in Switzerland. In May, Claire Croiza died. In June, Honegger began his fourth symphony. In November he began giving classes at the École Normale de Musique de Paris, where his students included Yves Ramette.

He composed several pieces of incidental music (&quot;Prométhée&quot; for Aeschylus&#x27; Prometheus Bound; &quot;Hamlet&quot; for a performance of the play in André Gide&#x27;s new translation) and a score for Christian-Jaque&#x27;s Un revenant. He also wrote a score for four ondes Martenot for &quot;Sortilèges&quot;, a ballet based on a storyline by Leyla Bedir Khan, first performed in summer 1946 at the Comédie des Champs-Elysées, but it is unfortunately lost.

His most important work, though, was that on his Symphony No. 4 subtitled &quot;Deliciae Basilienses&quot; (&quot;The Delights of Basel&quot;), dedicated to his friend Paul Sacher. It is &quot;a kind of &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; that pays tribute both to the beautiful city of Basel, bathed by the Rhine and where life is good, and to the friendship that bound the Swiss composer to the patron and conductor Paul Sacher&quot;. Completed in October, it was premiered by the dedicatee, in Basel, in January 1947. At the end of the second movement, the solo horn quotes Franz Abt&#x27;s setting of Basel-born Johann Peter Hebel&#x27;s poem &quot;Z&#x27;Basel, a mim Rhi&quot;, and two minutes before the end of the third movement Honegger describes a carnival march: this is an evocation of Guggenmusik, typical brass bands of German-speaking Switzerland using the piccolo and the Basel drum, before a phrase full of nostalgia followed by a brief mocking farewell.

There was one more (short) piece written in December: &quot;Mimaamaquim&quot;, for voice (originally for Madeleine Martinetti&#x27;s deep contralto voice) and piano. It was orchestrated in June 1947. According to Halbreich, it is (at least the version with orchestra) &quot;one of the peaks of his work&quot; in which he finds &quot;the typical intonations of synagogue chant&quot;.

During the first months of 1947, Honegger was bursting with activity as his works were given in concert all over Europe. In April 1947, he found the time to compose a competition piece, &quot;Intrada&quot;, for trumpet and piano. In June he wrote some incidental music, &quot;Œdipe&quot;, for Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, which was premiered in December 1947.

Honegger was then invited by Serge Koussevitzky at the beginning of July to give summer courses at the Tanglewood Music Center, following which he planned to go on tour throughout the US, then to Mexico and South America, where he was well-known thanks to Jane Bathori, who had made &quot;Le roi David&quot; and &quot;Judith&quot; known. A fortnight after he arrived, however, he suffered a heart attack that left him bedridden. A month later he suffered a massive heart attack. The composer nevertheless managed to recover and he returned to Paris on 15 November. He did not return to work until spring 1948.

In the spring of 1948, Honegger wrote &quot;Prélude, Fugue, Postlude&quot;, a suite after &quot;Amphion&quot;, premiered in November by Ansermet, then left for his first water cure at Bagnoles-de-l&#x27;Orne where he worked a little. Next came the Concerto da camera for flute, English horn and strings, finished in October 1948 and premiered in 1949, an &quot;exquisite masterpiece&quot;. In October, he wrote incidental music (the score of which is lost) for Albert Camus&#x27;s play &quot;The State of Siege &quot;, directed by Jean-Louis Barrault. In November, in Genoa, he resumed his conducting career, which he was to give up a year later (except in 1951 when he conducted the Orchestre National De La Radiodiffusion Française in &quot;Le Roi David&quot; in a recording studio, for Ducretet Thomson).

In June 1949, he completed a score for a final radio play in collaboration with Aguet, &quot;Saint-François d&#x27;Assise&quot;, whose broadcast was announced by &quot;Le Monde&quot;: &quot;... this musico-literary radio work, specially noticed and recommended by the &quot;Premio Italia&quot; panel and premiered by Radio-Lausanne in June 1949, will be transmitted live from Lausanne by the national program this evening, Friday 2 December at 9 pm. Its performance will feature the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, conducted by Ernest Ansermet, the Montreux choir and the Radio-théâtre de Lausanne troupe&quot;. This is, for Halbreich, &quot;the most important and the most beautiful&quot; of his collaborations with Aguet.

In 1949, he resumed his frenetic pace, leaving him time to compose only two new radio plays: &quot;Marche contre la mort&quot;, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, in tribute to Henri Guillaumet, whose plane was shot down on 27 November 1940, and &quot;Tête d&#x27;or&quot;, adapted from which he completed in January 1950.

By 1950, his health had deteriorated again. Nevertheless, he wrote a score for a documentary film, &quot;Bourdelle&quot; (about the sculptor, obviously), by René Lucot; another score for the documentary &quot;Paul Claudel&quot;, Paul Claudel&#x27;s interview with Jean Amrouche filmed by André Gillet; and above all a new symphony, and a suite.

The &quot;Symphonie n° 5&quot;, written from August to December, premiered in 1951, is subtitled &quot;Di tre re&quot; (which refers to the three D notes at the end of each movement). It is marked by a stark and somber tone, reflecting the author&#x27;s belief that the end of civilization was near: the work ends with a vision of nothingness.

On 18 December, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au Bûcher&quot; finally entered the repertoire of the Paris Opera, under the direction of Louis Fourestier. The event was once again hailed by &quot;Le Monde&quot;: &quot;&quot;Jeanne au bûcher&quot;, in the stage version and in French, achieved in December 1950 one of the greatest, most spontaneous successes ever seen at this theatre&quot;.

In the first quarter of 1951, despite his increasingly failing health, Honegger still managed to compose an important orchestral piece, &quot;Monopartita&quot;, followed, at the end of the year, by two very short pieces for &quot;La rédemption de François Villon&quot;, a radio play by José Bruyr as well as his &quot;Toccata sur un thème de Campra&quot;, his contribution to &quot;La Guirlande de Campra&quot;, as well as a film score for Georges Rony&#x27;s documentary &quot;La tour de Babel&quot; (1951) with the collaboration of Tibor Harsányi and Arthur Hoérée.

At the suggestion of Henri Büsser, Florent Schmitt and J.-G. Domergue, he was elected foreign associate member of the music section of the Académie des Beaux-Arts on 3 April 1952.

In April 1952, he completed a final stage score for &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, this time in Thierry Maulnier&#x27;s translation, premiered at the Comédie-Française in May.

At the end of 1952, despite his health problems, he began to reorganise work he had done for an aborted &quot;Passion de Selzach&quot; project. This became A Christmas Cantata, premiered in Basel by his friend Sacher in December. The French premiere, on 10 January 1954, was celebrated in &quot;Le Monde&quot; by René Dumesnil.

After a long stay in Switzerland, he managed to return to Paris in June 1954, when &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au Bûcher&quot; was about to be revived at the Opéra, directed by Roberto Rossellini and starring Ingrid Bergman: this was the version in 1956.

In December 1954, he was made a &quot;Grand Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Early 1955 saw the recording of &quot;Arthur Honegger vous parle et présente son œuvre&quot; (Honegger speaks to you and presents his work; see on YouTube, in French).

Arthur Honegger died in his studio, 71 boulevard de Clichy, on 27 November 1955. His funeral took place on 2 December 1955 at the Oratoire du Louvre, in the presence of a representative of French President René Coty and of Elisabeth, Queen of the Belgians. The eulogy was delivered by Pastor Fritz Münch, director of the Strasbourg Conservatory and brother of friend Charles Münch, to the sound of the &quot;lamento&quot; from the &quot;Danse des morts&quot; and the &quot;Alleluia&#x27; from &quot;Le Roi David&quot;. During the cremation at Père Lachaise Cemetery, several personalities made speeches, including Jean Cocteau. The urn passed between a hedge of Republican Guards presenting arms (although he remained a Swiss national and never took French citizenship), and was then taken to Saint-Vincent Cemetery, in the Montmartre district, where it is now placed under a simple tombstone.

The Paris Opéra paid tribute to him on 18 December 1955 with the &quot;Symphonie n°3&quot; conducted by Louis Fourestier, followed by &quot;Jeanne au Bûcher&quot;, with Claude Nollier, creator of the role. In November 1956, his friends Georges Tzipine, Fernand Oubradous and Arthur Hoérée organized a series of concerts featuring works by Honegger, and the &quot;Quintet No. 4 for 2 violins, viola and 2 cellos&quot;, Op. 350, composed by his friend Darius Milhaud and dedicated to Honegger. In 1962, Poulenc, too, dedicated &quot;à la mémoire de Arthur Honegger&quot; one of the last pieces he completed, his &quot;Clarinet Sonata&quot;.

Many of Honegger&#x27;s works were championed by his longtime friend Georges Tzipine, who conducted the premiere recordings of some of them (&quot;Cris du Monde&quot;, &quot;Nicolas de Flüe&quot;).

Honegger&#x27;s discography is very extensive.

==Style==
The principal elements of Honegger&#x27;s style are Bachian counterpoint, driving rhythms, melodic amplitude, highly coloristic harmonies, an impressionistic use of orchestral sonorities, and a concern for formal architecture. His style is weightier and more solemn than that of his colleagues in Les Six. Far from reacting against German romanticism as the other members of Les Six did, Honegger&#x27;s mature works show evidence of a distinct influence by it. &quot;I place great importance on musical architecture&quot;, he wrote, &quot;which I would never want to see sacrificed for literary or pictorial reasons. I have a perhaps exaggerated tendency to seek polyphonic complexity. My great model is J. S. Bach. I am not aiming, as some anti-impressionist composers do, for a return to harmonic simplicity. On the contrary, I believe we should use the harmonic materials developed by the school that preceded us, but in a different way—as a base for lines and rhythms. Bach makes use of the elements of tonal harmony, just as I wish to make use of modern harmonic overlays. I do not subscribe to the cult of the Music Hall or of the street fair; on the contrary, I am committed to chamber music and symphonic music in their most serious and austere aspects).

Despite the differences in their styles, he and fellow Les Six member Darius Milhaud were close friends, having studied together at the Paris Conservatoire (as well as Taillefer). Milhaud dedicated his fourth string quintet to Honegger&#x27;s memory, while Francis Poulenc similarly dedicated his Clarinet Sonata.

&quot;The work of composer Arthur Honegger stands out for its great diversity, ranging from tonality to atonality, without forgetting polytonality, using all registers, and respecting both the achievements of the past and the contributions of his contemporaries… he is not classifiable in any school.&quot;. This diversity in reality reflects an artistic journey whose coherence comes from the deep conviction that music is a true means of communication with the public. Halbreich notes that after &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;The need to communicate took precedence over all others, and in his freely chosen mission as &quot;musician in the city of men&quot; Honegger considered the maintenance of an esoteric and avant-garde language as a narcissistic luxury contrary to his humanist demands, even if the aesthetes of art for art&#x27;s sake suffered and disapproved of his choice. His only subsequent attempt at opera, &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, was aimed at the immediate (and, it was accepted, perhaps ephemeral) approval of a vast popular audience, not that of a hypothetical and elitist posterity&quot;. It is for this reason that Honegger often aspired to a music free from too much formalism, too much seduction, and above all, in general, from musical habits. All his life he feared the danger of cultural habits, of different forms of collective consciousness (&quot;Cris du monde&quot;, 1931, the subject of which is &quot;the revolt of the individual against the crowd that crushes him&quot; according to Honegger, &quot;&quot;, December 1931). This fear was justified by his ideology of authentic and above all meaningful music, capable of carrying a message, sometimes even a philosophical one as in his &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot;, 1945, which, according to the composer, &quot;musically depicts the struggle in the heart of man between abandonment to the blind forces that enslave him and the instinct for happiness, the love of peace, the feeling of divine refuge&quot;.

The diversity of his works is therefore easy to understand: what each of them had to say in a new way required, in his eyes, a new language. He thus explored different genres and techniques, taking an equal interest in Claude Debussy&#x27;s or Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s harmony, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s rhythm, Beethovenian form, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s genius – excluding serialism – in &quot;Le Dit des Jeux du Monde&quot;. He also made use of new instruments, or instruments used in new ways: He also made use of new instruments, or instruments used in new ways: the bowed instruments invented by Léo Sir in &quot;Hymne&quot;; the saw in &quot;Antigone&quot; (1927), tam-tam (&quot;Pacific 231&quot; and many other pieces), three saxophones in &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot;, a bouteillophone (bottles filled with varying amounts of water) for No. 7 of &quot;Dit des Jeux du Monde&quot;, a piece for solo percussion; and even electronic instruments such as the ondes Martenot (in &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot;, played by Maurice Martenot himself at the premiere in 1938, but already used in films such as Berthold Bartosch&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Idée&quot;, 1934).

The apparent simplicity of some passages of his music masks the work he did on each passage of his major works in the sense of objectivity, i.e. the strictly musical coherence of the piece: everything depends on it, including the complexity of the techniques, which, according to him, should only be pushed if necessary, as in &quot;Horace Victorieux&quot; (1921, &quot;his most radical and daring masterpiece&quot;, or in his symphonies. The complexity and, above all, the interest of his main compositions lies in the work of relative objectivity. He often played on the scope of the subjects he dealt with. He sought to reach a profound and universal dimension of humanity. This is why his religious works (he was a Protestant) go beyond the strict framework of religion to reach a more universal and human dimension. This explains the success of &quot;Joan of Arc at the stake&quot;, for example. This did not stop him from sometimes being more concerned with reacting to the culture of his time, as in Pacific 231 (1923), for example, where Honegger was nevertheless careful not to fall into the anecdote of noise music.

==Legacy==
Honegger was pictured on the Swiss twenty franc banknote (eighth series), issued October 1996 and replaced in 2017.

Honegger&#x27;s symphonic movement &quot;Rugby&quot; was recorded with him conducting the Paris Symphony Orchestra in a 1929 electrical recording. Many of Honegger&#x27;s recordings as conductor of his music have been reissued on CD by Pearl and Dutton.

The ice hockey player Doug Honegger is his grandnephew.

<text>Charles-Marie-Jean-Albert Widor (21 February 1844 – 12 March 1937) was a French organist, composer and teacher of the late Romantic era. As a composer he is known for his ten organ symphonies, especially the toccata of his fifth organ symphony, which is frequently played as recessional music at weddings and other celebrations.

As of 2022, he is the longest-serving organist of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, a role he held for 63 years (January 1870 – 31 December 1933). He also was organ professor at the Paris Conservatory from 1890 to 1896 (following César Franck) and then he became professor of composition at the same institution, following Théodore Dubois.

Widor was a prolific composer, writing music for organ, piano, voice and ensembles. Apart from his ten organ symphonies, he also wrote three symphonies for orchestra and organ, several songs for piano and voice, four operas and a ballet. He was one of the first composers to use the term &quot;symphony&quot; for some of his organ compositions, helped in this by the organs built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll.

==Life==

Widor was born in Lyon to a family of organ builders, and initially studied music there with his father, Hungarian-born François-Charles Widor, who was the titular organist of Saint-François-de-Sales from 1838 to 1889. His mother was Françoise-Elisabeth Peiron. The French organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, reviver of the art of organ building, was a friend of the Widor family; he arranged for the talented young organist to study in Brussels in 1863 with Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens for organ technique and with the elderly François-Joseph Fétis, director of the Brussels Conservatoire, for composition. After this term of study, Widor moved to Paris where he resided for the rest of his life. At the age of 24, he was appointed assistant to Camille Saint-Saëns at Église de la Madeleine.

In January 1870, with the combined lobbying of Cavaillé-Coll, Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod, the 25-year-old Widor was appointed as &quot;provisional&quot; organist of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, the most prominent position for a French organist. The organ at St-Sulpice was Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s masterwork; the instrument&#x27;s spectacular capabilities proved an inspiration to Widor. Despite his job&#x27;s ostensibly &quot;provisional&quot; nature, Widor remained as organist at St-Sulpice for nearly 64 years until the end of 1933. He was succeeded in 1934 by his former student and assistant, Marcel Dupré.

In 1890, upon the death of César Franck, Widor succeeded him as organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire. The class he inherited was initially stunned by this new teacher, who suddenly demanded a formidable technique and a knowledge of J. S. Bach&#x27;s organ works as prerequisites to effective improvisation. In 1896 he gave up this post to become composition professor at the same institution. Widor had several students in Paris who were to become famous composers and organists in their own right, most notably the aforementioned Dupré, Louis Vierne, Charles Tournemire, Darius Milhaud, Alexander Schreiner, Edgard Varèse, Hans Klotz, and the Canadian Henri Gagnon. Albert Schweitzer also studied with Widor, mainly from 1899; master and pupil later collaborated on an annotated edition of J. S. Bach&#x27;s organ works, published in 1912 – 1914. Widor, whose own master Lemmens was an important Bach exponent, encouraged Schweitzer&#x27;s theological exploration of Bach&#x27;s music.

Among the leading organ recitalists of his time, Widor visited many different nations in this capacity, including Russia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland. In addition, he participated in the inaugural concerts of many of Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s greatest instruments, notably the organs at Notre-Dame de Paris, Saint-Germain-des-Près, the Trocadéro, and Saint-Ouen de Rouen.

Well-known as a man of great culture and learning, Widor was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1892, and reached the rank of a Grand-Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1933. He was named to the Institut de France in 1910, and was elected &quot;Secrétaire perpetuel&quot; (permanent secretary) of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1914, succeeding Henry Roujon.

In 1921, Widor founded the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau with Francis-Louis Casadesus. He was the director until 1934, when he was succeeded by Maurice Ravel. His close friend, Isidor Philipp gave piano lessons there, and Nadia Boulanger taught an entire generation of new composers.

At the age of 76, Widor married Mathilde de Montesquiou-Fézensac on 26 April 1920 at Charchigné. The 36-year-old Mathilde was a member of one of the oldest and most prominent families of Europe. They had no children; she died in 1960.

On 31 December 1933, at age 89, Widor retired from his position at Saint-Sulpice. Three years later, he suffered a stroke which paralysed the right side of his body, although he remained mentally alert to the last. He died at his home in Paris on 12 March 1937 at the age of 93, and his remains were interred in the crypt of Saint-Sulpice four days later. His tomb bears an incorrect birth year (1845).

==Organ symphonies==
Widor wrote music for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles (some of his songs for voice and piano are especially notable) and composed four operas and a ballet, but only his works for organ are played with any regularity today. These include: ten organ symphonies, three symphonies for orchestra with organ, &quot;Suite Latine&quot;, &quot;Trois Nouvelles Pièces&quot;, and six arrangements of works by Bach under the title &quot;Bach&#x27;s Memento&quot; (1925). The organ symphonies are his most significant contribution to the organ repertoire.

It is unusual for a work written for one instrument to be assigned the term &quot;symphony&quot;. However, Widor was at the forefront of a revival in French organ music, which utilized a new organ design pioneered by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll that was &quot;symphonic&quot; in style. The organ of the Baroque and Classical periods was designed to project a clear and crisp sound capable of handling contrapuntal writing. Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s organs, on the other hand, had a much warmer sound and a vast array of stops that extended the &quot;timbre&quot; of the instrument. This new style of organ, with a truly orchestral range of voicing and unprecedented abilities for smooth crescendos and diminuendos, encouraged composers to write music that was fully symphonic in scope. This trend was not limited to France, and was reflected in Germany by the organs built by Friedrich Ladegast and the works of Franz Liszt, Julius Reubke, and Max Reger.

Widor&#x27;s symphonies can be divided into three groups. The first four symphonies comprise Op. 13 (1872) and are more properly termed &quot;suites&quot;. (Widor himself called them &quot;collections&quot;.) They represent Widor&#x27;s early style. Widor made later revisions to the earlier symphonies. Some of these revisions were quite extensive.

With the Opus 42 symphonies, Widor shows his mastery and refinement of contrapuntal technique, while exploring to the fullest the capabilities of the Cavaillé-Coll organs for which these works were written. The Fifth Symphony has five movements, the last of which is the famous Toccata. The Sixth Symphony is also famous for its opening movement &quot;Allegro&quot;. The Seventh and Eighth Symphonies are the longest and least performed of Widor&#x27;s Symphonies. The Seventh Symphony contains six movements, and the first version of the Eighth Symphony had seven. (Widor subsequently removed the Prélude for the 1901 edition.)

The ninth and tenth symphonies, respectively termed &quot;Gothique&quot; (Op. 70, of 1895) and &quot;Romane&quot; (Op. 73, of 1900), are much more introspective. They both derive thematic material from plainchant: Symphonie Gothique uses the Christmas Day Introit &quot;Puer natus est&quot; in the third and fourth movements, while the Symphonie Romane has the Easter Gradual &quot;Haec dies&quot; woven throughout all four movements. They also honored, respectively, the Gothic Church of St. Ouen, Rouen and the Romanesque Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse, with the new Cavaillé-Coll organs installed in each. The second movement of the Symphonie Gothique, entitled &quot;Andante sostenuto&quot;, is one of Widor&#x27;s most-beloved pieces. Dating from this same period, and also based on a plainsong theme, is the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; movement, a late addition to the much earlier second symphony.
Widor&#x27;s best-known piece for the organ is the final movement of his &quot;Symphony for Organ No. 5&quot;, a toccata, which is often played as a recessional at wedding ceremonies and at the close of the Christmas Midnight Mass at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Vatican City. Although the Fourth Symphony also opens with a Toccata, it is in a dramatically different (and earlier) style. The Toccata from &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; is the first of the toccatas characteristic of French Romantic organ music, and served as a model for later works by Gigout, Boëllmann, Mulet, Vierne and Dupré. Widor was pleased with the worldwide renown this single piece afforded him, but he was unhappy with how fast many other organists played it. Widor himself always played the Toccata rather deliberately. Many organists play it at a very fast tempo whereas Widor preferred a more controlled articulation to be involved. He recorded the piece, at St. Sulpice in his eighty-ninth year; the tempo used for the Toccata is quite slow. Isidor Philipp transcribed the Toccata for two pianos.

Over his long career, Widor returned again and again to edit his earlier music, even after publication. His biographer, John Near, reports: &quot;Ultimately, it was discovered that over a period of about sixty years, as many as eight different editions were issued for some of the symphonies.&quot;

<text>Super Mario Bros. 2 is a 1988 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After the smash hit &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in 1985, Nintendo quickly released a minor adaptation of the original with advanced difficulty titled &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, for its mature market in Japan in 1986. However, Nintendo of America found this sequel too similar to its predecessor, and its difficulty too frustrating, for the nascent American market. This prompted a second &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; sequel based on Nintendo&#x27;s 1987 Family Computer Disk System game which had been based on a prototype platforming game and released as an advergame for Fuji Television&#x27;s Yume Kōjō &#x27;87 media technology expo. The characters, enemies, and themes in &quot;Doki Doki Panic&quot; have the mascots and theme of the festival, and were adapted into the &quot;Super Mario&quot; theme to make a Western &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; sequel.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was a resounding success, becoming the fifth-best-selling game on the NES, and was critically well-received for its design aspects and for differentiating the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series. It was re-released in Japan for the Famicom as (1992), and has been remade twice, first included in the &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; (1993) collection for the Super NES, and as &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; (2001) for the Game Boy Advance. It is included as part of the Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online services.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game. The objective is to navigate the player&#x27;s character through the dream world Subcon and defeat the main antagonist Wart. Before each stage, the player chooses one of four protagonists: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool. All four characters can run, jump, and climb ladders or vines, but each character possesses a unique advantage that causes them to be controlled differently. For example, Mario has balanced speed, jumping height, and strength; Luigi can jump the highest, but moves slightly slower and has weaker strength; Princess Toadstool can float because of her dress but has the lowest speed and strength; Toad has the highest speed and strength, which allows him to pick up items quickly, but jumps the lowest. Unlike &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, this game has no multiplayer functionality and no time limit. The original only scrolls from left to right, but this game can also scroll right to left, and even vertically in some areas. Unlike other &quot;Mario&quot; games, the characters cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them but can stand on, pick up, and throw most enemies at each other to defeat them. Other objects that can be thrown at enemies include vegetables pulled from the ground and mushroom blocks.

The game consists of 20 different levels across the seven worlds comprising Subcon. Each world has three levels, except World 7, which has two. Each world has a particular theme that dictates the obstacles and enemies encountered in its levels, such as desert areas with dangerous quicksand and snowy areas with slippery surfaces. Levels contain multiple sections or rooms that are connected via doors or ladders. Some rooms are accessible by entering certain jars. Magic potions found in each level are used to temporarily access &quot;Sub-space&quot;, a reflected, unscrollable area where the player can collect coins and Mushrooms that increase the character&#x27;s maximum health. In addition, certain jars, when entered in Sub-space, will warp the player to the later worlds, skipping levels altogether. Other items available include cherries, which are collected in order to acquire a Star; the POW Block, which can be used to destroy all the enemies visible on the screen quickly; and a stopwatch that can stop enemies from moving for a short period of time. The player must defeat a boss enemy at the end of each of the first six worlds, then defeat Wart himself at the end of World 7 to complete the game.

The player starts &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; with three lives, one of which is lost each time the player&#x27;s character loses all health from enemy or hazard damage or when the character falls off the screen, represented by hearts. The player can replenish health by collecting floating hearts that appear upon defeating a certain number of enemies. The player will receive a Game Over upon losing the last life, though the player may continue up to twice in one game. Extra lives may be obtained by collecting hidden 1-Up Mushrooms or by using the coins collected from Sub-space to play the Bonus Chance minigame between the levels.

== Plot ==
Mario has a dream of a staircase leading to a mysterious door to a mysterious place. A voice identifies the world as the dreamland of Subcon, and asks for Mario&#x27;s help in defeating the villainous frog named Wart, a tyrant who has cursed Subcon and its people. Mario suddenly awakes and decides to tell Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool, who all report experiencing the same dream. The group goes on a picnic, but discovers a cave with a long staircase. Through a door at the top, they are transported to Subcon, revealing their dreams to have been real. After defeating Wart, the people of Subcon are freed and everyone celebrates. Mario suddenly awakes in his bed, unsure if these events were a dream. He soon goes back to sleep.

== Development ==
=== Background and conception ===
Nintendo originally released a different game called &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; on Japan&#x27;s Family Computer Disk System in 1986 (later released as &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot; for Super NES as part of &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;). Its engine is an enhanced &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, with the same gameplay and more complex level designs, character features, and weather features. Some of the advanced level content had been culled from &quot;Vs. Super Mario Bros.&quot;, a 1986 coin-operated arcade version of the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; for NES. All of these factors combined to yield an incremental game design with significantly higher difficulty.

Also that year, the young subsidiary Nintendo of America was just beginning its launch of the new Nintendo Entertainment System and its flagship game, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; This international adaptation of the Famicom platform had been deliberately rebranded in the wake of the American video game crash of 1983, a regional market recession which had not directly affected the mature Japanese market. Nintendo of America did not want the increasingly popular &quot;Mario&quot; series to be too difficult to a recovering, transfiguring, and expanding market — nor to be stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; could be eventually converted to the NES&#x27;s cartridge format, localized, and mass-produced for America. Utilizing its regional autonomy to avoid risking the franchise&#x27;s popularity in this nascent market, Nintendo of America declined the Japanese sequel&#x27;s localization to America and instead requested a newer and more player-friendly &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; sequel for release outside Japan.

=== &quot;Doki Doki Panic&quot; ===
An early prototype with vertical scrolling was developed by Kensuke Tanabe, designed by a team led by Shigeru Miyamoto, and programmed by Nintendo&#x27;s frequent partner, SRD, shortly after Tanabe was hired in April 1986. The first prototype&#x27;s gameplay emphasizes vertically scrolling levels with two-player cooperative action: lifting, carrying, and throwing each other; lifting, carrying, throwing, stacking, and climbing objects; and incrementally scrolling the screen upward when reaching the top. Dissatisfied so far, Miyamoto then added the traditional horizontal scrolling, saying to &quot;make something a little bit more Mario-like&quot;, and saying &quot;Maybe we need to change this up ... As long as it&#x27;s fun, anything goes&quot;. However, the prototype software was too complex for Famicom hardware at the time, and the gameplay was still considered lacking, especially in single-player mode.

Unwilling to compromise on gameplay, Tanabe suspended development of the prototype until eventually receiving instruction to use the Yume Kōjō festival mascots in a game. He recalls, &quot;I remember being pulled over to Fuji Television one day, being handed a sheet with game characters on it and being told, &#x27;I want you to make a game with this&#x27;.&quot; Tanabe re-implemented that prototype&#x27;s elements in his new game, and released the advergame-themed &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan on July 10, 1987.

The title is derived from &quot;doki doki&quot;, a Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a quickly beating heart. The title and character concept were inspired by a license cooperation between Nintendo and Fuji Television to promote the broadcaster&#x27;s Yume Kōjō &#x27;87 event, which showcased several of its latest TV shows and consumer products. The Yume Kōjō festival&#x27;s mascots became the game&#x27;s protagonists: a family consisting of the boy Imajin, his girlfriend Lina, and his parents Mama and Papa. The rest of the game&#x27;s characters, including the main villain named Mamu, were created by Nintendo for the project. &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; takes place within a book with an Arabian setting. All four characters are optionally playable, though the game is not fully completed until the player clears all levels using each protagonist.

=== Conversion to &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; ===
Nintendo of America&#x27;s Gail Tilden recalls that president Minoru Arakawa&#x27;s request to convert the thematically unrelated &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; into a &quot;Mario&quot; sequel was &quot;odd&quot; at first but not unusual for Nintendo, which had already converted a canceled &quot;Popeye&quot; prototype into &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and reconceived that into &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot;. Summarizing Tanabe&#x27;s recollections within a 2011 interview, &quot;Wired&quot; said &quot;Although the initial concept for the game had been scrapped, the development of that original two-player cooperative prototype inspired all the innovative gameplay of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;&quot;.

For the international conversion into &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, many graphical changes were made to the scenery and characters&#x27; look, animation, and identity. The R&amp;D4 staff modified the character likenesses of Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, and Toad, building them over their respective counterpart models of Imajin, Mama, Lina, and Papa. This marked the first time that Mario and Luigi had noticeably different heights, and Miyamoto originated the scuttling animation of Luigi&#x27;s legs, to justify the enhanced jumping ability seen in the corresponding Mama character. &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot; needed only a few alterations for its conversion into the &quot;Mario&quot; series because its gameplay elements were already so heavily rooted in it: Starman for invincibility, the sound effects of coins and jumps, POW blocks, warp zones, and a soundtrack by &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; composer Koji Kondo. To reduce the game&#x27;s overall difficulty, the designers made minor technical changes. They opted not to retain &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot;″s ultimate requirement to complete each level using each protagonist; therefore, this new &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; can be completed in only one pass by any combination of characters. A late prototype of the game covering these changes was exhibited in the first issue of Nintendo Power, dated July/August 1988. In the tradition of the &quot;Mario&quot; series, they added the ability to run by holding the B button.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was first released in North America in September 1988. In PAL regions, the game released the following year. It was such a commercial success and its contributions so substantial over &quot;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&quot;, that it was eventually re-released in Japan in 1992 with the title &quot;Super Mario USA&quot;. Likewise, Nintendo later re-released the Japanese &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; in America in the form of &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;, a part of the 1993 re-release compilation &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; on the Super NES. Nintendo has continued to re-release both games, each with the official sequel title of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; in their respective regions.

== Re-releases ==
=== &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; ===

In 1993, Nintendo released an enhanced Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation titled &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;. It includes the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; games released for the Famicom/NES. The version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; included in the compilation has modernized graphics and sound to match the Super NES&#x27;s 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations in some collision mechanics. It is possible to change the character after losing a single life, while the original version allows changing it only after completing a level or when the player loses all their lives and chooses &quot;Continue&quot;, making the game more forgiving when choosing a character not adept at some specific level. The player begins with five lives instead of three, and the slot game gains an additional bonus: if the player obtains three sevens, the player wins 10 lives which is something that was not featured in the original NES version of the game. However, the game has a 99-life limit.

=== &quot;BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge&quot; ===
In March–April 1996, Nintendo&#x27;s partnership with the St.GIGA satellite radio station released an &quot;&quot; or &quot;gaiden&quot; version of the game for the Satellaview system, titled . Like all Satellaview games, it was released episodically in a number of weekly volumes, only in Japan, and only in this format.

It features 16-bit audiovisual enhancements to the 8-bit original in the fashion of &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, plus &quot;SoundLink&quot; narration (radio drama-style streaming voice data intended to guide players through the game and give helpful hints and advice) and broadcast CD-quality music. Due to the nature of SoundLink broadcasts, these games were only broadcast to players between 6:00 and 7:00 PM on broadcast dates, at which times players could download the game from the Events Plaza on the &quot;BS-X&quot; application cartridge. A single rerun of the broadcasts was conducted in the same weekly format from June 3, 1996, to June 29, 1996, at 5:00 to 6:00 PM. The &quot;BS-X&quot; download location for the rerun changed to Bagupotamia Temple.

While the underlying gameplay itself is largely similar, new and arranged content has been added. For instance, the BS version newly featured a score counter. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game, Mario is the only playable character. Later in the game, time-dependent events occur triggering, among other things, the possibility of using other characters. Another feature unique to the game is the inclusion of gold Mario statues (ten in total for each chapter) that are hidden in various locations (including Sub-Space). Collection of the statues in-game grants the player an extra life and refills the life meter. After clearing a level, the player could press &quot;Select&quot; to see some statistics such as the number of statues, coins, cherries, and mushrooms collected, as well as displaying which bosses had been defeated.

As a 4-volume broadcast, each week bore a different subtitle. These are the names of the volumes:

=== &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; ===
On March 21, 2001, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; received another release, based on the &quot;All-Stars&quot; remake, as part of &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot;, which also contains a remake of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; was developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2, and was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance. The &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; includes several new features such as the addition of the enemy Robirdo, a robotic Birdo, replacing Mouser as the boss of World 3; the addition of the &quot;Yoshi Challenge&quot;, in which players may revisit stages to search for Yoshi Eggs; and a new point-scoring system, similar to that used in the aforementioned &quot;BS Super Mario USA Power Challenge&quot;. Graphical and audio enhancements appear in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, digital voice acting, and such minor stylistic and aesthetic changes as an altered default health-meter level, boss-order, backgrounds, the size of hearts, Princess Toadstool being renamed to the now-standard &quot;Princess Peach&quot;, and the inclusion of a chime to announce Stars. The game was released for the Wii U Virtual Console on July 16, 2014, in Japan and later in North America on November 6, 2014. It was released for the Nintendo Switch as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership plan on May 26, 2023.

&quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

== Reception ==


Upon release, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was the top-selling video game in the United States for fourteen consecutive months, from October 1988 through late 1988, into 1989 through spring and summer, to November 1989. By early 1990, copies were sold in the United States, eventually totaling million copies worldwide, making it the fourth highest-selling game ever released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Although only the fourth highest-selling NES game overall, it is the best-selling standalone NES game which was never a pack-in game.

Although &quot;The Lost Levels&quot; was considered too difficult to play, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed it as the eighth best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, mentioning that regardless of its predecessor not being in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise, it was distinguished on its own merits and its unique takes on the franchise&#x27;s signature format. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked it the 6th best NES game ever made. The staff complimented it and other third-generation games for being a greater improvement than sequels around 2012, which they thought had seen only small improvements. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked the game as the #6 greatest game available in 1991, saying: &quot;The second and still the best of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise&quot;. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked the &quot;All-Stars&quot; edition as the 14th best console video game of all time, calling the level designs &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve seen before&quot; and highly praising the boss challenges. In the &quot;Pak Source&quot; edition of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, which rated all NES games released in North America from October 1985 to March 1990, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was among the only three games (aside &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;) to receive the maximum score of 5 in at least one of the categories evaluated, which was not awarded to either &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; nor &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. It was awarded the score of 5 for both &quot;Challenge&quot; and &quot;Theme Fun&quot;.

The re-release as &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; in 2001 received generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 84/100 on Metacritic. One reviewer concluded &quot;all nostalgia and historical influence aside, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; is still a game worth playing on the merits of its gameplay alone&quot;, and that &quot;the only reason you may not want to pick it up is if ... you already own it in another form.&quot; However, &quot;GameSpot&quot; thought that &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; or &quot;Super Mario World&quot; would have been a better choice for a launch game considering their respective popularity; both games were eventually also remade as part of the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; series. Conversely, &quot;IGN&quot; praised the choice, calling it &quot;one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era&quot;. The game was named one of the best NES games ever by &quot;IGN&quot;, saying that the game offers greater diversity in graphics and gameplay than the original, making it a great bridge game between the other NES &quot;Mario&quot; games. &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; named Wart&#x27;s battle theme in a list of the top ten best 8-Bit Final Boss Themes. &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed the game 30th on their top 100 video games of all time in 2001. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 27th on a list of greatest Nintendo games.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Game Boy Advance version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;This classic probably shouldn&#x27;t have been brought back. It&#x27;s well translated but hasn&#x27;t aged gracefully.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Many elements in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; have endured in subsequent sequels and in related franchise. The ability to lift and toss enemies and objects—a defining feature of its earliest prototype—has become part of the permanent repertoire of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise, appearing in numerous subsequent &quot;Super Mario&quot; games. The Wii U game &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; features the same playable characters with the same basic physical abilities from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;.

Many characters and features of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; have been assimilated into the greater &quot;Mario&quot; universe, such as Birdo, Pokey, Bob-omb, and Shy Guy. This is the first game in which Princess Toadstool and Toad are playable characters. Princess Toadstool established a floating jump and stars in later &quot;Mario&quot; games such as &quot;Super Princess Peach&quot;. Toad stars in later &quot;Mario&quot; games like &quot;Wario&#x27;s Woods&quot;, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, and &quot;Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker&quot;. In &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, Luigi became distinguished from Mario&#x27;s form, especially his tall stature and scuttle jump. The &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series gained many direct homages to this game. The 1989 cartoon television show &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; is based on characters, settings, and music from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;.

<doc id="141871" wikidata="Q150857" url="?curid=141871" title="German battleship Bismarck">
<text>Bismarck was the first of two s built for Nazi Germany&#x27;s . Named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship was laid down at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. &quot;Bismarck&quot; and her sister ship were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.

In the course of the warship&#x27;s eight-month career, &quot;Bismarck&quot; conducted only one offensive operation that lasted eight days in May 1941, codenamed . The ship, along with the heavy cruiser , was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait, the battlecruiser initially engaged &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, probably by mistake, while engaged &quot;Bismarck&quot;. In the ensuing battle &quot;Hood&quot; was destroyed by the combined fire of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, which then damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and forced her retreat. &quot;Bismarck&quot; suffered sufficient damage from three hits by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to force an end to the raiding mission.

The destruction of &quot;Hood&quot; spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France for repairs, &quot;Bismarck&quot; was attacked by fifteen Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier ; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship&#x27;s steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled &quot;Bismarck&quot; was engaged by two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, and sustained incapacitating damage and heavy loss of life. The ship was scuttled to prevent her being boarded by the British, and to allow the ship to be abandoned so as to limit further casualties. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually.

The wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.

== Design ==
The two s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and her sister were nominally within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty that governed battleship construction in the interwar period. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan&#x27;s withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an &quot;escalator clause&quot; that permitted displacements as high as .

===General characteristics===
&quot;Bismarck&quot; displaced as built and fully loaded, with an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draft of . The battleship was Germany&#x27;s largest warship, and displaced more than any other European battleship, with the exception of , commissioned after the war. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s hull used 90 percent welded construction to save weight; it was divided into 22 watertight compartments and had a double bottom that ran for 83 percent of the ship&#x27;s length.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; was powered by three Blohm &amp; Voss geared steam turbines driving three 3-bladed screw propellers. Steam was provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated boilers, which were vented through a single large funnel amidships. The propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of , but the ship significantly exceeded both figures on speed trials, reaching for . The ship stored of oil for the boilers, which gave her a cruising range of at .

The standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men. When &quot;Bismarck&quot; left port, fleet staff, prize crews, and war correspondents increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men. Roughly 600 of the crew came from the light cruiser , which had been lost during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s crew published a ship&#x27;s newspaper titled &quot;Die Schiffsglocke&quot; (The Ship&#x27;s Bell). &quot;Bismarck&quot; carried four Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes in a double hangar amidships and two single hangars abreast the funnel, with a double-ended thwartship catapult.

===Armament and armour===
&quot;Bismarck&quot; was armed with a main battery of eight SK C/34 guns arranged in four twin gun turrets: two super-firing turrets forward—&quot;Anton&quot; and &quot;Bruno&quot;—and two aft—&quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Dora&quot;. Secondary armament consisted of twelve L/55 guns. The main-battery and secondary guns were aimed from three fire-control director stations, using mechanical computers to plot target distances and courses and to calculate angles for the guns. On top of each fire-control station a rangefinder was mounted in a rotating cupola, a FuMO 23 Seetakt radar set was installed by March 1941 on the front of all three cupolas.

The heavy anti-aircraft armament consisted of sixteen C/33 guns in eight twin mountings. The forward two pairs of gun mountings were of the old C/31 type whilst the aft two pairs were of the newer C/37 type. The middle and light anti-aircraft armament consisted of sixteen C/30, and initially twelve  C/30 anti-aircraft guns. In April 1941 two of the single 2 cm guns mounted on the searchlight platform on the foretop were replaced by two quadruple 2 cm C/38 guns. Anti-aircraft fire control for the 10.5 cm guns was provided by four stabilized SL-8 directors, though the 3.7 and 2 cm guns were only given portable rangefinders.

The ship&#x27;s main belt was thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were and thick, respectively. The turrets were protected by thick faces and thick sides.

== Service history ==

&quot;Bismarck&quot; was ordered under the name (&quot;&quot;Hannover&quot; replacement&quot;), a replacement for the old pre-dreadnought , under contract &quot;F&quot;. The contract was awarded to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, where the keel was laid on 1 July 1936 at Helgen IX. The ship was launched on 14 February 1939 and during the elaborate ceremonies was christened by Dorothee von Löwenfeld, granddaughter of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the ship&#x27;s namesake. Adolf Hitler made the christening speech. Fitting-out work followed the launch, during which time the original straight stem was replaced with a raked &quot;Atlantic bow&quot; similar to those of the s. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940 for sea trials, which were conducted in the Baltic. Ernst Lindemann took command of the ship at the time of commissioning.

On 15 September 1940, three weeks after commissioning, &quot;Bismarck&quot; left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. &quot;Sperrbrecher 13&quot; escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, and then on to Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship&#x27;s power-plant was given a thorough workout; &quot;Bismarck&quot; made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship&#x27;s stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that &quot;Bismarck&quot; could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; &quot;Bismarck&quot; returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.

The ship was scheduled to return to Kiel on 24 January 1941, but a merchant vessel had been sunk in the Kiel Canal and prevented use of the waterway. Severe weather hampered efforts to remove the wreck, and &quot;Bismarck&quot; was not able to reach Kiel until March. The delay greatly frustrated Lindemann, who remarked that &quot;[&quot;Bismarck&quot;] had been tied down at Hamburg for five weeks ... the precious time at sea lost as a result cannot be made up, and a significant delay in the final war deployment of the ship thus is unavoidable.&quot; While waiting to reach Kiel, &quot;Bismarck&quot; hosted Captain Anders Forshell, the Swedish naval attaché to Berlin. He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the Swedish Navy. The information provided the Royal Navy with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.

On 6 March, &quot;Bismarck&quot; received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and a pair of armed merchant vessels, along with an icebreaker. At 08:45 on 8 March, &quot;Bismarck&quot; briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of dazzle paint to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an icebreaker, escorted &quot;Bismarck&quot; through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.

The Naval High Command ( or OKM), commanded by Admiral Erich Raeder, intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against Allied merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean. The two &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class battleships were based in Brest, France, at the time, having just completed Operation Berlin, a major raid into the Atlantic. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; rapidly approached completion. &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Tirpitz&quot; were to sortie from the Baltic and rendezvous with the two &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.

Work on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was completed later than anticipated, and she was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in drydock. required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie. Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers and . The two ships would not be ready for action until July or August. Admiral Günther Lütjens, (Fleet Chief) of the Kriegsmarine, chosen to lead the operation, wished to delay the operation at least until either &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; or &quot;Tirpitz&quot; became available, but the OKM decided to proceed with the operation, codenamed Operation Rheinübung, with a force consisting of only &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser . At a final meeting with Raeder in Paris on 26 April, Lütjens was encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy gaining any respite.

=== Operation Rheinübung ===

On 5 May 1941, Hitler and Wilhelm Keitel, with a large entourage, arrived to view &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in Gotenhafen. The men were given an extensive tour of the ships, after which Hitler met Lütjens to discuss the forthcoming mission. On 16 May, Lütjens reported that &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; were fully prepared for Operation Rheinübung; he was therefore ordered to proceed with the mission on the evening of 19 May. As part of the operational plans, a group of eighteen supply ships would be positioned to support &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. Four U-boats would be placed along the convoy routes between Halifax and Britain to scout for the raiders.

By the start of the operation, &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s crew had increased to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral&#x27;s staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; departed Gotenhafen and made for the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship&#x27;s crew via loudspeaker of the ship&#x27;s mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.

An hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish cruiser ; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the Kattegat. &quot;Gotland&quot; transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: &quot;Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10–12 aircraft passed Marstrand, course 205°/20&#x27;.&quot; The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by &quot;Gotland&quot;, though both Lütjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost. The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attaché to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the Admiralty. The code-breakers at Bletchley Park confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had decrypted reports that &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; had taken on prize crews and requested additional navigational charts from headquarters. A pair of Supermarine Spitfires was ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the flotilla.

German aerial reconnaissance confirmed that one aircraft carrier, three battleships, and four cruisers remained at anchor in the main British naval base at Scapa Flow, which persuaded Lütjens that the British were unaware of his operation. On the evening of 20 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast. At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached Bergen and anchored at Grimstadfjord, where the ships&#x27; crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard &quot;outboard grey&quot; worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.

When &quot;Bismarck&quot; was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect her from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of and take photos of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and her escorts. Upon receipt of the information, Admiral John Tovey ordered the battlecruiser , the newly commissioned battleship , and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the Denmark Strait. The rest of the Home Fleet was placed on high alert in Scapa Flow. Eighteen bombers were dispatched to attack the Germans, but weather over the fjord had worsened and they were unable to find the German warships.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; did not replenish her fuel stores in Norway, as her operational orders did not require her to do so. She had left port short of a full load, and had since expended another on the voyage from Gotenhafen. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; took on of fuel. At 19:30 on 21 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, and the three escorting destroyers left Bergen. At midnight, when the force was in the open sea, heading towards the Arctic Ocean, Raeder disclosed the operation to Hitler, who reluctantly consented to the raid. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off Trondheim. At around 12:00, Lütjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the break-out into the open Atlantic. The same bad weather that had encouraged Lütjens to start the break-out attempt, prevented any reconnaissance flights over Bergen. But at 16:00 a Martin Maryland managed to take off from RNAS Hatston and made it to Bergen where it could see the harbour was empty. On receiving the report, Tovey left Scapa Flow with the Home Fleet at 22:15.

By 04:00 on 23 May, Lütjens ordered &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to increase speed to to make the dash through the Denmark Strait. Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMO radar detection equipment sets. &quot;Bismarck&quot; led &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; by about ; mist reduced visibility to . The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to . Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid ice floes. At 19:22, hydrophone and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser at a range of approximately . &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;″s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by &quot;Suffolk&quot; and learned that their location had been reported.

Lütjens gave permission for &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to engage &quot;Suffolk&quot;, but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held fire. &quot;Suffolk&quot; quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser joined &quot;Suffolk&quot;, but approached the German raiders too closely. Lütjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; &quot;Bismarck&quot; fired five salvoes, three of which straddled &quot;Norfolk&quot; and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38 cm guns&#x27; firing disabled &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted Lütjens to order &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.

At around 22:00, Lütjens ordered &quot;Bismarck&quot; to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him. Although &quot;Bismarck&quot; was visually obscured in a rain squall, &quot;Suffolk&quot;″s radar quickly detected the manoeuvre, allowing the cruiser to evade. The cruisers remained on station through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships. The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07, hydrophone operators aboard &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of , reporting &quot;Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280° relative bearing!&quot;

==== Battle of the Denmark Strait ====
At 05:45 on 24 May, German lookouts spotted smoke on the horizon; this turned out to be from &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, under the command of Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland. Lütjens ordered his ships&#x27; crews to battle stations. By 05:52, the range had fallen to and &quot;Hood&quot; opened fire, followed by &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; a minute later. &quot;Hood&quot; engaged &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, which the British thought to be &quot;Bismarck&quot;, while &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; fired on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Adalbert Schneider, the first gunnery officer aboard &quot;Bismarck&quot;, twice requested permission to return fire, but Lütjens hesitated. Lindemann intervened, muttering &quot;I will not let my ship be shot out from under my ass.&quot; He demanded permission to fire from Lütjens, who relented and at 05:55 ordered his ships to engage the British.

The British ships approached the German ships head on, which permitted them to use only their forward guns; &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; could fire full broadsides. Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20° turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on &quot;Hood&quot;. About a minute after opening fire, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; scored a hit with a high-explosive shell; the explosion detonated unrotated projectile ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished. After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to &quot;Hood&quot;; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s eight 38 cm guns. He also ordered the ship&#x27;s 15 cm secondary guns to engage &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Holland then ordered a second 20° turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. Lütjens ordered &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to shift fire and target &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; scored a pair of hits on the battleship that started a small fire.

Lütjens then ordered &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to drop behind &quot;Bismarck&quot;, so she could continue to monitor the location of &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;, which were still to the east. At 06:00, &quot;Hood&quot; was completing the second turn to port when &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38 cm armour-piercing shells struck &quot;Hood&quot; and penetrated her thin deck armour. The shell reached &quot;Hood&quot;″s rear ammunition magazine and detonated of cordite propellant. The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle. The stern also rose as water rushed into the ripped-open compartments. Schneider exclaimed &quot;He is sinking!&quot; over the ship&#x27;s loudspeakers. In only eight minutes of firing, &quot;Hood&quot; had disappeared, taking all but three of her crew of 1,419 men with her.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; then shifted fire to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The British battleship scored a hit on &quot;Bismarck&quot; with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship&#x27;s command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; scored three hits on &quot;Bismarck&quot; in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead, completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.

At 06:13, Leach gave the order to retreat; only five of his ship&#x27;s ten guns were still firing and his ship had sustained significant damage. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; made a 160° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and destroying her, Lütjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy, firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to head for the North Atlantic. In the engagement, &quot;Bismarck&quot; had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return. The forecastle hit allowed of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. Lütjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship. The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as &quot;Bismarck&quot; had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree list to port and a 3-degree by the bow.

While &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was retreating, the hydrophone operators on &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; detected torpedoes. It was unlikely that torpedoes were actually fired but both German ships took evasive manoeuvres. At the same time a shadowing Short Sunderland flying boat from No. 201 Squadron RAF approached too closely and the German heavy anti-aircraft artillery fired on it. A Lockheed Hudson from No. 269 Squadron RAF witnessed the battle from a distance and remained in touch until 08:08. After the battle, the Sunderland reported the oil slick and guided the destroyer to the site where &quot;Hood&quot; had blown up. The destroyer found only three survivors.

==== Chase ====

After the engagement, Lütjens reported, &quot;Battlecruiser, probably &quot;Hood&quot;, sunk. Another battleship, &quot;King George V&quot; or &quot;Renown&quot;, turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact.&quot; At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; for commerce raiding and to make for Saint-Nazaire for repairs. Shortly after 10:00, Lütjens ordered &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to fall behind &quot;Bismarck&quot; to determine the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming &quot;broad streams of oil on both sides of [&quot;Bismarck&quot;″s] wake&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; returned to the forward position. About an hour later, the shadowing Sunderland reported the oil slick to &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot;, which had been joined by the damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Rear Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker, the commander of the two cruisers, ordered &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to remain behind his ships.

When Dönitz offered the assistance of all Atlantic U-boats, Lütjens requested to set up a patrol line on the extrapolated route of &quot;Bismarck&quot; into the open Atlantic. Five U-boats—, , , , and were ordered to take up positions south of Greenland where they were expected to make contact in the morning of 25 May. Since Lütjens had intentions to make for a French port, a second group of U-boats consisting of , , , , and was stationed in the Bay of Biscay. Three other U-boats—, , and —were rushing to reinforce the trap. and were ordered to sail from port to reinforce the Biscay group.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. Tovey&#x27;s Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers , , and to patrol the Denmark Strait in case Lütjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship , which had been escorting and was due for a refit in the Boston Navy Yard, joined Tovey. Two old s were ordered into the hunt: , from Halifax, and , which was escorting Convoy HX 127. In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase. By around 17:00, the crew aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack &quot;Bismarck&quot; if the opportunity arose.

With the weather worsening, Lütjens attempted to detach &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker&#x27;s cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. &quot;Bismarck&quot; turned around to face Wake-Walker&#x27;s formation, forcing &quot;Suffolk&quot; to turn away at high speed. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; fired twelve salvos at &quot;Bismarck&quot;, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to slip away. After &quot;Bismarck&quot; resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker&#x27;s three ships took up station on &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s port side.

Although &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been damaged in the engagement with &quot;Hood&quot; and forced to reduce speed, she was still capable of reaching , the maximum speed of Tovey&#x27;s . Unless &quot;Bismarck&quot; could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent her from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her torpedo bombers. At 22:00, &quot;Victorious&quot; launched the strike, which comprised nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron, led by Lt Cdr Eugene Esmonde. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked &quot;Norfolk&quot; and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter on their approach; the confusion alerted &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners.

&quot;Bismarck&quot; also used her main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers. None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. One of the Swordfish lost its way in the cloud and failed to attack. &quot;Bismarck&quot; evaded seven of the torpedoes launched at her, but the eighth struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others. The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to . Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to , the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.

Shortly after the Swordfish departed from the scene, &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship&#x27;s speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.

As the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker&#x27;s ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, &quot;Bismarck&quot; was out of range of &quot;Suffolk&quot;″s radar. At 03:00 on 25 May, Lütjens decided to abandon the plan to lure the pursuers to the U-boat trap and to head directly for France. He ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was . He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; &quot;Bismarck&quot; successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. &quot;Suffolk&quot;″s captain assumed that &quot;Bismarck&quot; had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.

The Royal Navy search widened, despite the fact that many of the British ships were low on fuel. &quot;Victorious&quot; and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker&#x27;s ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. Force H, with the aircraft carrier and steaming up from Gibraltar, was still at least a day away. Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, Lütjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board &quot;King George V&quot;, leading Tovey to believe that &quot;Bismarck&quot; was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, &quot;Bismarck&quot; had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.

British code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for &quot;Bismarck&quot; making for Brest, decrypted by Jane Fawcett on 25 May 1941. The French Resistance provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which &quot;Bismarck&quot; would have to pass. Two Consolidated Catalina flying boats from No. 209 Squadron RAF and No. 240 Squadron RAF based out of RAF Castle Archdale in Northern Ireland joined the search, covering areas where &quot;Bismarck&quot; might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by British Flying Officer Dennis Briggs and co-piloted by Ensign Leonard B. Smith of the US Navy located her, some northwest of Brest. At her current speed, she would have been close enough to reach the protection of U-boats and the Luftwaffe in less than a day. Most British forces were not close enough to stop her.

The only possibility for the Royal Navy was &quot;Ark Royal&quot; with Force H, under the command of Admiral James Somerville. &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, &quot;Suffolk&quot; and were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortage; the only heavy ships remaining apart from Force H were &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot;, but they were too distant. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Swordfish were already searching nearby when the Catalina found her. Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about away from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser to shadow &quot;Bismarck&quot;, though &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s aviators were not informed of this. As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with magnetic detonators, accidentally attacked &quot;Sheffield&quot;. The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and &quot;Sheffield&quot; emerged unscathed.

Upon returning to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 19:50, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Renown&quot; passed the position of &quot;U-556&quot;. The U-boat was in an ideal shooting position, but had expended all torpedoes on previous operations and could not launch an attack. Before attacking, the Swordfish made first contact at 20:00 with &quot;Sheffield&quot;, which gave them a direction to &quot;Bismarck.&quot; They could however not find the German ship and at 20:30 asked again a direction from &quot;Sheffield.&quot; Finally at 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, &quot;Bismarck&quot; again fired her main battery at the aircraft, trying to catch planes in splash columns. The Swordfish then attacked; &quot;Bismarck&quot; began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.

The second torpedo struck &quot;Bismarck&quot; in her stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.

==== Sinking ====
With the port rudder jammed, &quot;Bismarck&quot; was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey&#x27;s forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships &quot;King George V&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; were still available, along with the heavy cruisers &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot;. Lütjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: &quot;Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer.&quot; The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself. As the Swordfish returned to the carrier, &quot;Bismarck&quot; briefly fired her main battery at the shadowing &quot;Sheffield&quot;. The first salvo went a mile astray, but the second salvo straddled the cruiser. Shell splinters rained down on &quot;Sheffield&quot;, killing three men and wounding two others. Four more salvoes were fired but no hits were scored. &quot;Sheffield&quot; quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. &quot;Sheffield&quot; lost contact in the low visibility and Captain Philip Vian&#x27;s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot; through the night.

These destroyers encountered &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with her main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the Polish destroyer . The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian&#x27;s destroyers harried &quot;Bismarck&quot;, illuminating her with star shells and firing sixteen torpedoes in nine separate attacks, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship&#x27;s war diary, footage of the engagement with &quot;Hood&quot;, and other important documents. The third shell hit from &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft, it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard. Lütjens then asked at 07:10 if a U-boat could rendezvous with &quot;Bismarck&quot; to fetch these documents. &quot;U-556&quot; was assigned at once to this task, but the U-boat missed the signalled order because it was submerged. &quot;U-556&quot; was anyway too low on fuel to be able to carry out the order.

After daybreak on 27 May, &quot;King George V&quot; led the attack. &quot;Rodney&quot; followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at &quot;Bismarck&quot; until he was about away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target. At 08:43, lookouts on &quot;King George V&quot; spotted her, some away. Four minutes later, &quot;Rodney&quot;″s two forward turrets, comprising six guns, opened fire, then &quot;King George V&quot;″s guns began firing. &quot;Bismarck&quot; returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled &quot;Rodney&quot;. Thereafter, &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s ability to aim her guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.

As the range fell, the ships&#x27; secondary batteries joined the battle. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; closed and began firing with their guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from &quot;Rodney&quot; struck &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s forward superstructure, killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and Lütjens and the rest of the bridge staff, although other survivors stated that they saw Lindemann on the deck as the ship sank. The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it fired one last salvo at 09:27. Lieutenant Müllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action. One of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s shells exploded 20 feet off &quot;Rodney&quot;″s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube—the closest &quot;Bismarck&quot; came to a direct hit on her opponents. At 09:10 &quot;Rodney&quot; launched six of her torpedoes from a distance of and &quot;Norfolk&quot; launched four from . All torpedoes missed.

With the bridge personnel no longer responding, the executive officer &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; Hans Oels took command of the ship from his station at the Damage Control Central. Some near misses alongside the port side, and the fact that the ship was no longer able to fight back, caused Oels to decide at around 09:30 to scuttle &quot;Bismarck&quot; to prevent the ship being boarded by the British, and to allow the crew to abandon ship so as to reduce casualties. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was also slowly sinking due to an increasing list that allowed water to enter the ship via damage to the main deck, leading to significant free surface effects, although the ship&#x27;s very large metacentric height kept her afloat. At around 09:30 Oels ordered the men below decks to abandon ship; he instructed the engine room crews to open the ship&#x27;s watertight doors and to prepare scuttling charges. The order to prepare to scuttle meant that watertight hatches between decks would be left open, ensuring that water that entered the battery deck via shell damage would start to penetrate below the battery deck, significantly increasing the list and eventually causing &quot;Bismarck&quot; to capsize.

Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned, so Junack primed the charges and ordered his men to abandon ship. They left the engine spaces at around 10:10. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate as they made their way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. At around 10:05 to 10:10, a 14-inch shell from &quot;King George V&quot; penetrated the upper citadel belt and exploded in the ship&#x27;s aft canteen, killing Oels on the gun deck and about a hundred others.

By 10:00, Tovey&#x27;s two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range. &quot;Rodney&quot; closed to , point-blank range for guns of that size, and continued to fire. &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern. She was slowly settling by the stern from uncontrolled flooding with a 20 degree list to port. Tovey would not cease fire until the Germans struck their ensigns or it became clear they were abandoning ship. Overall the four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at &quot;Bismarck&quot;, and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink &quot;Bismarck&quot; by gunfire. The heavy gunfire at virtually point-blank range devastated &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s superstructure and the sections of the hull that were above the waterline, causing very heavy casualties, but it contributed little to the eventual sinking of the ship. &quot;Rodney&quot; fired two torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, &quot;if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another&quot;.

The scuttling charges detonated around 10:20. By 10:35, the ship had assumed a heavy port list, capsizing slowly and sinking by the stern. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; to sink &quot;Bismarck&quot; with torpedoes and ordered his battleships back to port. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; fired a pair of torpedoes into &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s starboard side, one of which hit. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. &quot;Bismarck&quot; disappeared beneath the surface at 10:40.

Junack, who had abandoned ship by the time it capsized, observed no underwater damage to the ship&#x27;s starboard side. Müllenheim-Rechberg reported the same but assumed that the port side, which was then under water, had been more significantly damaged. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank. Around eight-hundred to a thousand men were now in the water; &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and the destroyer moved in and lowered ropes to pull the survivors aboard. At 11:40, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;″s captain ordered the rescue effort abandoned after lookouts spotted what they thought was a U-boat. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; had rescued 85 men and &quot;Maori&quot; had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene. , which had been watching the action from a distance, rescued three men from a rubber dinghy in the evening at 19:30. The next day the German trawler rescued another two from a raft at 22:45. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.

== Wreckage ==
=== Discovery by Robert Ballard ===

The wreck of &quot;Bismarck&quot; was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Robert Ballard, the oceanographer responsible for finding . &quot;Bismarck&quot; was found to be resting on her keel at a depth of approximately , about west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some above the surrounding abyssal plain, triggering a landslide. &quot;Bismarck&quot; slid down the mountain, coming to a stop about two-thirds of the way down. Ballard kept the wreck&#x27;s exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts from the ship, a practice he considered a form of grave robbing.

Ballard&#x27;s survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship&#x27;s fully armoured citadel. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow&#x27;s starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only. Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin noted that the British battleships were shooting at very close range; the flat trajectory of the shells made it difficult to hit the relatively narrow target represented by the belt armour above the waterline due to the high waves, caused by gale force winds, which shielded the belt armour as shells that fell short would either strike the water and ricochet up into the superstructure or explode after striking the waves.

Ballard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that &quot;&quot;Bismarck&quot; did not implode.&quot; This suggests that &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory. Ballard added &quot;we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact&quot;. They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by her crew, as claimed by German survivors.

The whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure. The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank stern first and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. While no one onboard &quot;Bismarck&quot; when it sunk could confirm or deny that, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;″s stern collapsed after it was similarly torpedoed in the stern in 1942. This prompted the Germans to straighten the stern structures on all German capital ships.

=== Subsequent expeditions ===
In June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built mini-submarines. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, &quot;You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline.&quot; The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.

An Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano—the only one in that area—to locate the wreck. Using ROVs to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader David Mearns claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: &quot;My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes&quot;.

The 2002 documentary &quot;&quot;, directed by James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using smaller and more agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. Unlike the Ballard expedition, Cameron&#x27;s investigation was able to examine parts of the sides of the hull. When &quot;Bismarck&quot; hit the bottom bow first, massive &quot;hydraulic outburst&quot; separated much of the shell plating of the hull along the line where it joined the bottom of the armour belt. The decks under the armour deck have been compressed by 3 to 4 metres. The most extensive damage, including the gashes Mearns observed, was thus due to impact of the hull with the ocean floor as opposed to directly due to battle damage.

Although around 719 large calibre shells were fired at &quot;Bismarck&quot; that morning, Cameron&#x27;s survey noted only two instances where the 320 mm main side belt armour had actually been fully penetrated in the visible parts of the hull. These were both on the starboard side amidships. One hole is forward of the 320 mm displaced armour belt. In the second case the explosion dislodged a rectangular segment of the 320 mm armour. Instead, the expedition argues long range plunging fire hitting the deck was almost completely responsible for the damage that directly contributed to the sinking of the ship. The later close-range shelling (including by secondary armament) &quot;devastated the superstructure and exposed parts of the hull above the waterline, and caused massive casualties&quot;, but contributed little to the sinking of the ship. British gunnery accuracy was &quot;mediocre at best&quot;, partially due to the &quot;miserable&quot; firing conditions and the ship&#x27;s list to port, with only around 10% of fired medium calibre shots hitting.

The Cameron report stated that &quot;The devastation caused by the shellfire combined with the effects of several torpedo hits to overwhelm and defeat the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, causing the ship to begin sinking due to uncontrollable progressive flooding. The German crew sped the inevitable demise of their ship by initiating scuttling measures.&quot; It suggests the torpedoes may have increased the subsequent extensive damage to the ship when it hit the ocean floor. In some cases the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads. and some hits claimed may have been torpedoes that exploded prematurely due to the heavy seas. However the locations of other hits were buried in mud or were impossible to distinguish due to the extent of overall damage to the ship. Overall the report disputed Mearns&#x27; claim that scuttling was irrelevant to the timing of the sinking.

Despite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that &quot;Bismarck&quot; would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that &quot;Bismarck&quot; could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving on the destroyer at the time). Kennedy stated, &quot;That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later.&quot; The Cameron expedition&#x27;s report asserts &quot;Bismarck unquestionably would have sunk due to progressive flooding hours after the battle ended&quot;. In Mearns&#x27; subsequent book &quot;Hood and Bismarck&quot;, he conceded that scuttling &quot;may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes.&quot; Ballard later concluded that &quot;As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow.&quot;

<doc id="141875" wikidata="Q201905" url="?curid=141875" title="Constantius III">
<text>Constantius III (died 2 September 421) was briefly Western Roman emperor in 421, having earned the throne through his capability as a general under Honorius. By 411 he had achieved the rank of &quot;magister militum&quot;, and in the same year he suppressed the revolt of the usurper Constantine III. Constantius went on to lead campaigns against various barbarian groups in Hispania and Gaul, recovering much of both for the Western Roman Empire. He married Honorius&#x27;s sister Galla Placidia in 417, a sign of his ascendant status, and was proclaimed co-emperor by Honorius on 8 February 421. Constantius reigned for seven months before dying on 2 September 421.

==Life==

===Early life===

Constantius was born in Naissus, Moesia, (present-day Niš, Serbia) of Illyrian origin. Constantius served as a general under Honorius, rising to the rank of &quot;Magister militum&quot; (Master of the Soldiers) by 411.

===Revolt of Constantine III===
In 411 Constantius was sent by Honorius to put down the revolt of Constantine III, who had declared himself emperor in Britain in 407. Constantius thereafter led his soldiers to Arles, the capital and residence of Constantine. Upon arriving, he defeated the army of Gerontius, a general who was rebelling against Constantine, before besieging the city.

Constantine refused to surrender, hoping to last until the return of his general Edobichus, who was raising troops in northern Gaul. When Edobichus did return to Arles, he was swiftly defeated by Constantius. Constantine soon after lost much of the remainder of his forces, as his army which had been guarding the Rhine chose to support the usurper Jovinus instead, forcing Constantine to surrender. Despite Constantius&#x27;s assurances that Constantine would be able to safely retire to a clerical office, Constantius had him imprisoned, and further had him beheaded during his return to Ravenna, in either August or September 411. Honorius&#x27;s remaining rivals were soon defeated, with Gerontius committing suicide in Hispania, and Jovinus being defeated by Athaulf, king of the Visigoths. Despite this, Honorius was unable to regain control of Britain, nor was any Roman after him.

===The war against Heraclianus===
The appointment of Constantius as commander-in-chief led to a war in 412 with the rival general Heraclianus, who, like Constantius, had done good services for Emperor Honorius. Heraclianus revolted, appointed himself emperor and stopped grain supplies to Italy. At the beginning of March 413, the usurper landed in Italy near Rome with an army to go to war against Honorius. He engaged in a battle with Constantius&#x27;s Roman army, but was defeated. After his defeat, Heraclianus fled. He was captured and murdered.

===Campaigns===

Constantius initiated a campaign against the Visigoths in northern Hispania in 416, blockading them in order to starve them and force their submission. Soon after, the Visigoth king, Wallia, surrendered to Rome, agreeing to return Galla Placidia (the sister of Honorius, who had been captured by Alaric 412, and been forced into marriage with Athaulf, who was by this time dead), and to wage war against the Vandals and other barbarians who the Romans were still in conflict with, in exchange for food supplies. 
This development enabled Constantius to put an end to the Bagaudae revolt in northwestern Gaul in 417. He then continued his campaign against various tribal groups and regained control of much of Hispania and Gaul by 420.

===Reign===
During this time period, generals played a critical role in ensuring the continued reign of Roman Emperors, especially Western Roman Emperors. Constantius&#x27;s position of &quot;magister militum&quot; and his skill as a commander allowed him to gain huge influence over the Western Roman Empire, comparable to the earlier Stilicho. For this reason, Honorius bestowed many honors upon Constantius, such as appointing him consul three times: in 414, alongside Constans; in 417, alongside Honorius; and in 420, alongside Theodosius II. In order to further ensure Constantius&#x27;s loyalty, Honorius arranged the betrothal of his sister, Galla Placidia, to Constantius in 417. Later, on 8 February 421, Honorius made Constantius co-Western Emperor under himself. However, his cousin Theodosius II, emperor of the Eastern Empire, did not recognize him as such. Reportedly, Constantius was angry about this and considered starting a campaign against Theodosius.

===Death===

In the end, none of that came to fruition, because Constantius&#x27; health deteriorated rapidly and he died after less than 7 months as emperor on 2 September 421. According to Syvänne, Constantius was killed by poisoning. As source, he cites Theophanes (AM 5913) who states that Constantius was murdered. Castinus, a confidant of Emperor Honorius, who after Constantius&#x27; death obtained the rank of commander-in-chief, is said to have had the hand in this. After his death, his wife fled with her children to Constantinople. Honorius only continued to reign until his death in 423, when Valentinian III, the minor son of Constantius, succeeded him, with Galla Placidia as regent.

<doc id="141882" wikidata="Q6781940" url="?curid=141882" title="María Celeste Arrarás">
<text>María Celeste Arrarás Mangual (born September 27, 1960), better known as María Celeste, is a Puerto Rican broadcast journalist, author, and television personality, who has won three national Emmy Awards for journalism. In 2005, she became the first female recipient of the Legacy Award by Broadcast and Multi Channel for outstanding achievement in Hispanic Television. In 2006, Arrarás was included on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, as one of the 20 most powerful women of the next generation of leaders.” In August 2018, María Celeste was awarded with a Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Universidad Central de Bayamon in Puerto Rico, in recognition for her philanthropic work. Until August 2020, Arrarás spent two decades as the host and managing editor of &quot;Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste&quot;. Her program aired daily in the U.S. and in 15 Latin American countries, for a total daily audience of 35 million viewers. Her popularity has made her one of the most influential Hispanic figures in social platforms, with millions of followers around the world and in 2019 she made her debut in the Hollywood Reporter&#x27;s Social Climber Chart at #5 of all TV Personalities.

Maria Celeste is also Executive Producer and screenplay writer for &quot;Selena’s Secret&quot;, a miniseries based on the bestselling book of the same title that she wrote about the murder of singer Selena Quintanilla, known as the Queen of Tejano Music. The mini series aired on Amazon Prime video, TNT Latin America and on Telemundo. In 2019, Maria Celeste received the St Jude Hospital Lifetime Achievement Award.

As of the Summer of 2021 Maria Celeste has joined CNN en Español as the host of their new Sunday Prime Time show called &quot;DocuFilms con María Celeste Arrarás&quot;. In her capacity as a writer, she also became the first Hispanic opinion maker contributor for Facebook’s new platform “Bulletin”. She also launched her YouTube channel and premiered &quot;MC Live&quot;, a weekly one-on-one interview program that quickly surpassed 1 million views.

==Early life and education==
María Celeste Arrarás was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, the first child of José Enrique Arrarás, a politician, lawyer, and educator, and Astrid Mangual, a homemaker and chemist.

In 1971, she won three medals (one gold, one silver, and one bronze) at the Central American and Caribbean Swimming Championships. She qualified to compete at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, but was unable to compete after she contracted mononucleosis, one week before the games began.

In 1978, Arrarás left her native Puerto Rico to attend Loyola University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she majored in communications at Loyola University. In 2016, Arrarás returned to Loyola University, where she was inducted into the School of Mass Communication&#x27;s Den of Distinction and was honored by Loyola University for her career in television.

==Television career==

===Early career===
Arrarás began her broadcasting career in 1986 when she was employed by a local Puerto Rican television station, Channel 24, as a news anchor and reporter. There, Arrarás traveled covering major news events, such as the fall of the Soviet Union in Moscow and Leningrad, and she received several journalistic awards for her reports. In 1987 the Univision affiliate in New York City WXTV hired her as the co-anchor of its local news show.

===Univision (1987–2002)===
Shortly after being hired by Univision, Arrarás became Los Angeles Bureau Chief. In January 1990, when the network moved to Miami, she was named the national news anchor for Noticiero Univision weekend edition.

In 1992, Arrarás was named co-anchor of a new television news program, &quot;Noticias y Mas&quot;, alongside Myrka Dellanos, which would become &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; in 1994. The show&#x27;s popularity resulted in a large franchise for Univision including &quot;Primer Impacto Extra&quot;, &quot;Primer Impacto Edicion Nocturna&quot;, and the weekly show &quot;Ver Para Creer&quot;, all of which were hosted by Arrarás and Dellanos. Arrarás would continue to hold her positions until 2002, when she left the show and joined rival network Telemundo.

===Telemundo (2002–2020)===
The defection of María Celeste Arrarás from Univision, North America&#x27;s largest Spanish-language network, to the rival Telemundo broadcasting group in 2002 sent shockwaves in the industry and was heralded as the start of a new era for Hispanic media. Arrarás&#x27;s arrival coincided with news that the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)&#x27;s $2.7 billion acquisition of the Spanish-language news and entertainment provider had just won U.S. government approval. Arrarás was to host her own Telemundo show, but would also file English-language reports for &quot;Dateline&quot;, NBC&#x27;s top-rated prime-time newsmagazine, and work as a guest co-host in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. Arrarás&#x27;s hire—and the Telemundo/NBC venture—was seen as a sign of an increased Hispanic presence in mainstream media news organizations, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Mirta Ojito called the new, lucrative contract for this popular journalist &quot;NBC&#x27;s first coup in the Latino media&quot;. In 2002, the same day that NBC Universal acquired Telemundo as part of their larger network, Arrarás took her former position at Telemundo, becoming the host and Managing Editor of the show &quot;Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste&quot;

In 2004, Arrarás co-hosted the Brown-Black Democratic Presidential Debate in Iowa for MSNBC.

Arrarás has crossed-over to the English market. Since 2002 Arrarás has been invited as a guest co-host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show, and according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Arrarás&#x27;s high-profile sally into national network television, in the spot previously occupied by Ms. Couric no less, was groundbreaking for a Spanish-accented broadcaster.&quot; She has also contributed to different NBC programs including &quot;Dateline&quot; and &quot;Nightly News&quot;. On the night of María Celeste&#x27;s debut as a contributor for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, the show experienced a dramatic audience increase in both Hispanic and Anglo demographics. NBC president Andrew Lack told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;[María Celeste] was one of the highest segments at &quot;Dateline&quot; that quarter.&quot; He described her as &quot;a serious, smart journalist&quot;.

In 2012, Arrarás became co-anchor of &quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot; alongside Jose Diaz-Balart. In September 2014 Maria Celeste and her team won an Emmy for its coverage of the election of Pope Francis. One news source stated, the addition of María Celeste is the latest development in a strategy that consolidated &quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot; as the national newscast with the fastest growing audience on both Spanish and English-language television. In 2016, Arrarás was awarded her third Emmy Award for &quot;Francisco in America&quot;, Telemundo&#x27;s special coverage of Pope Francis&#x27;s historic visit to Cuba and the USA on September.

After spending four years at the head of &quot;Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste&quot; and &quot;Noticiero Telemundo&quot;, Arraras opted to &quot;dedicate herself fully to &quot;Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste&quot;&quot;. At that time, she received her third Emmy Award and extended her contract with Telemundo for several more years.

In February 2016, Arrarás served as a panelist for the Republican Party presidential debate held in Houston. Arrarás was cited for her performance. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised her unconventional way of framing issues and said categorically that &quot;she played an important fact-checking role&quot; in that debate.

In the summer of 2016, Arrarás celebrated her 30-year career in television, and was reunited with her former co-host of &quot;Primer Impacto&quot;, Myrka Dellanos, for a special edition of &quot;Al Rojo Vivo&quot; commemorating the anniversary. She was recognized by the city of Los Angeles with a resolution commending her work. Puerto Rico, her birthplace, also honored Arrarás by granting her a star on their &quot;Paseo de la Fama de Puerto Rico&quot;, their walk of fame. The government also held a special ceremony for Arrarás at the House of Representatives Capitol Building to commemorate her achievements.

On 5 August 2020, Telemundo laid off Arrarás, as part of NBCUniversal&#x27;s wave of layoffs after poor earnings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== CNN en Español, Facebook&#x27;s Bulletin &amp; &quot;MC Live&quot; (2021) ===

As of the Summer of 2021 Arraras will be part of the staff of CNN en Español, as the host of their Sunday Prime Time show called &quot;DocuFilms con María Celeste Arrarás&quot;. In her capacity as a writer, she also became the first Hispanic opinion maker contributor for Facebook’s new platform “Bulletin”. In 2021, she also launched her YouTube channel and premiered &quot;MC Live&quot;, a weekly one-on-one interview program that quickly surpassed 1 million views.

In 1997, Arrarás wrote &quot;Selena‘s Secret: The Revealing Story Behind Her Tragic Death&quot; (released in Spanish as &quot;El Secreto De Selena: La Reveladora Historia Detrás De Su Trágica Muerte&quot;), published by Simon &amp; Schuster. The book describes her in-depth “investigation” surrounding the events that led to the death of singer Selena Quintanilla.

In 2007, Arrarás wrote &quot;The Magic Cane&quot; (released in Spanish as &quot;El Bastón Mágico&quot;), a children&#x27;s fable published by Scholastic.

In 2009, Arrarás published &quot;Make Your Life Prime Time: How to Have It All Without Losing Your Soul&quot;, (released in Spanish as &quot;Vive Tu Vida Al Rojo Vivo: Secretos Para Triunfar En Todo&quot;), published by Atria.

== Public image ==
Often cited as the “Hispanic TV Queen”, Arrarás has been described by The New York Times as “a household name in Spanish-speaking homes across the country, and a darling of the Spanish-language media, which turned her into a cover girl for magazine articles that ranged from fitness to the supermom syndrome&quot;. She is one of the most popular celebrities today, with over 50 magazine covers under her belt. In 2006, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; after the magazine selected her as one of the “20 Most Powerful Women” of the next generation of leaders. Later that year, &quot;Newsweek&quot; also had her on the cover of its special international edition dedicated to “Women and Leadership”. She has been featured on the cover of &quot;People en Español&quot; magazine more than 15 times.

Arrarás has been the judge of the Miss Universe Pageant on two occasions. The first was the 52nd Miss Universe pageant, held in June 2003, where Amelia Vega became the first Dominican candidate to be crowned. Then again in 2006, when Puerto Rican beauty Zuleyka Rivera was crowned in Los Angeles.

She is a vocal environmental and animal rights activist. She has been noted for speaking out against the exploitation of animals, especially in spectacles such as rodeos, aquariums, cock-fights, and circuses. In December 2001, she even went in front of the Puerto Rican Legislature to advocate for a ban in the Island on circuses that forced wild animals to perform as part of their shows. Currently Arrarás is working with The Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International on a campaign to dramatically improve the welfare of the more than 300,000 stray dogs and one million stray cats in the island.

Maria Celeste is a supporter of Para la Naturaleza, a non-profit organization dedicated to environmental conservation and historic preservation in Puerto Rico.
She is also an avid supporter and advocate of other organizations including, Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization in the United States that sponsors autism research and conducts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families, governments, and the public.

== Personal life ==
Arrarás currently lives in Miami with her three children, Julian Enrique, Lara Giuliana, and Adrian Vadim.

Since 2022 was in a relationship with the businessman, Raúl Quintero, and on May 3, 2024, Arrarás announced the death of her partner, due to a sudden heart attack.

<text>Joshua Ryan Evans (January 10, 1982 – August 5, 2002) was an American actor who became known for his role of Timmy Lenox in the soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. Evans was aged 17 to 20 during his tenure on &quot;Passions&quot;, but had the appearance and voice of a small child due to achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. He was tall.

==Early life and career==
Born in Hayward, California, Evans began his career at age twelve, appearing in various television commercials. He made his film debut as a toddler in &quot;Baby Geniuses&quot; in 1999. The following year he played the role of the young Grinch (Jim Carrey&#x27;s character) in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. He also appeared as General Tom Thumb in the A&amp;E original movie &quot;P.T. Barnum&quot;. Evans also had guest spots on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In 1999, Evans began portraying Timmy on the soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. Evans&#x27; character was a doll that the evil witch Tabitha Lenox brought to life with magic. For his work on the series, he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 2000 and won two Soap Opera Digest Awards in 2000 and 2001.

The character of Timmy was intended to become an angel and remain a presence on the show, but the storyline had to be rewritten after Evans&#x27; death.

==Death==
On August 5, 2002, Evans died while undergoing surgery to correct a congenital heart condition. He was cremated and his ashes interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills. On the day of his death, his character Timmy on &quot;Passions&quot; also died and was aired on the same day.

<doc id="141884" wikidata="Q464282" url="?curid=141884" title="Bill Finger">
<text>Milton &quot;Bill&quot; Finger (February 8, 1914 – ) was an American comic book writer who was the co-creator (with Bob Kane) of the DC Comics character Batman. Despite making major (sometimes, signature) contributions as an innovative writer, visionary mythos/world builder and illustration architect, Finger (like other creators of his era) was often relegated to ghostwriter status on many comics—including those featuring Batman, and the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott.

While Kane privately admitted in a 1980s audio interview with his autobiographer that Finger was responsible for &quot;50–75% of all the creativity in Batman,&quot; he publicly denied Finger had been anything more than a subcontractor executing Kane&#x27;s ideas for decades. As a result, Finger died in obscurity and poverty while the Batman brand, and Kane, amassed international fame and wealth. In the 2000s, Finger biographer Marc Tyler Nobleman&#x27;s research uncovered previously unknown heirs. At the urging of Nobleman, the online comics fan community, and others, Finger&#x27;s granddaughter revived the fight to restore his lost legacy, which continued for years. In 2015, DC Comics&#x27;s parent company conditionally agreed to recognize Finger&#x27;s intellectual property claim as co-creator of the Batman characters and mythos, officially adding his name, going forward, to the &quot;created by&quot; credit line Kane had been contractually guaranteed in 1939.

==Early life==
Bill Finger was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1914 to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His father, Louis Finger, was born in Austria-Hungary in 1890 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1907. Little is known about his biological mother Rosa Rosenblatt. His stepmother Tessie was born in 1892 in New York City. The family also included two daughters (or possibly nieces raised as daughters), Emily and Gilda. The family moved to The Bronx, New York City, where during the Great Depression Louis Finger was forced to close his tailor shop. Finger graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx in 1933.

==Career==
===Comics===
An aspiring writer and a part-time shoe salesman, Finger joined Bob Kane&#x27;s nascent studio in 1938 after having met Kane, a fellow DeWitt Clinton alumnus, at a party. Kane later offered him a job ghost writing the strips &quot;Rusty&quot; and &quot;Clip Carson&quot;.

====Batman====
Early the following year, National Comics&#x27; success with the seminal superhero Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; prompted editors to scramble for similar heroes. In response, Kane conceived the &quot;Bat-Man&quot;. Finger recalled Kane
Finger offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl with pointed bat-ears instead of the domino mask, a cape instead of wings, adding gloves, and changing the red sections of the costume to gray. Finger later said his suggestions to have his eyes covered by white lenses was influenced by Lee Falk&#x27;s popular &quot;The Phantom&quot;, a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was also familiar, and that he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character&#x27;s secret identity. Finger said, &quot;Bruce Wayne&#x27;s first name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.&quot; Kane decades later in his autobiography described Finger as &quot;a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning ... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective.&quot; Nobleman said, &quot;Bob [Kane] showed Bat-Man to [editor] Vin [Sullivan]—without Bill. Vin promptly wanted to run Bat-Man, and Bob negotiated a deal—without including Bill.&quot;

Finger wrote both the initial script for Batman&#x27;s debut in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939) and the character&#x27;s second appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #28 (June 1939), while Kane provided art. Batman proved a breakout hit, and Finger went on to write many of the early Batman stories, including making major contributions to the Joker character. Batman background artist and letterer George Roussos recalled:
Robin was introduced as Batman&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #38 (April 1940). When Kane wanted Robin&#x27;s origin to parallel Batman&#x27;s, Finger made Robin&#x27;s parents circus performers murdered while performing their trapeze act. Finger recalled:
Comics historian Jim Steranko wrote in 1970 that Finger&#x27;s slowness as a writer led Batman editor Whitney Ellsworth to suggest Kane replace him, a claim reflected in Joe Desris&#x27; description of Finger as &quot;notoriously tardy&quot;. During Finger&#x27;s absence, Gardner Fox contributed scripts that introduced Batman&#x27;s early &quot;Bat-&quot; arsenal (the utility belt, the Bat-gyro/-plane and the Batarang). Upon his return, Finger is credited with providing the name &quot;Gotham City&quot;. Finger wrote the debut issue of Batman&#x27;s self-titled comic book series which introduced the Joker and the Catwoman. Among the things that made his stories distinctive were a use of giant-sized props: enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters. Finger seemed to avoid having Batman operate out of a cave in the early stories, to circumvent being too similar to the Phantom and Zorro. Instead Finger indicated that Wayne merely used &quot;underground hangars&quot; on the property to store vehicles. The Batcave first appeared in the 1943 Columbia serial starring Lewis Wilson and the comics followed suit thereafter. Donald Clough Cameron created the concept of Batman having a trophy section in the Batcave. One of the prevalently featured trophies in Batman&#x27;s Batcave, the giant replica of a Lincoln penny, was introduced in a story written by Finger. He was one of the writers of the syndicated &quot;Batman&quot; comic strip from 1943 to 1946. 

Eventually, Finger left Kane&#x27;s studio to work directly for DC Comics, where he supplied scripts for characters including Batman and Superman. A part of the Superman mythos which had originated on the radio program made its way into the comic books when kryptonite was featured in a story by Finger and Al Plastino in &quot;Superman&quot; #61 (Nov. 1949). As writer of the &quot;Superboy&quot; series, Finger created Lana Lang, a love-interest for the teenage superhero. Continuing his Batman work, he and artist Sheldon Moldoff introduced Ace the Bat-Hound in &quot;Batman&quot; #92 (June 1955), Bat-Mite in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #267 (May 1959), Clayface in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #298 (December 1961), and Betty Kane, the original Bat-Girl in &quot;Batman&quot; #139 (April 1961). Finger wrote for other companies, including Fawcett Comics, Quality Comics and Marvel Comics&#x27; 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics. Finger created the All-Winners Squad in &quot;All Winners Comics&quot; #19 (Fall 1946) for Timely.

====Batman villains====
Finger provided an account on the creation of Joker in 1966, though admittedly unsure if it was Robinson or Kane who initiated the initial concept:

Finger also asserted that the creation of Penguin was fully his in the same interview, outright refuting Kane&#x27;s claims:
Finger created the Scarecrow and it is believed that Kane penciled his first appearance. Kane created Two-Face and Finger expanded his characterization in the first script for &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #66 (Aug. 1942). The Riddler was created by Finger and designed by Dick Sprang in issue #140 (Oct. 1948). The Calendar Man was another villain created by Finger without input from Kane.

====Green Lantern====
Finger collaborated with artist and character creator Martin Nodell on the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott, who debuted in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; #16 (July 1940). Both writer and artist received a byline on the strip, with Nodell in the earliest issues using the pseudonym &quot;Mart Dellon&quot;.

According to Nodell, Finger was brought in to write scripts after Nodell had already conceived the character. Nodell recalled in an undated, latter-day interview:
===Screenwriter===
As a screenwriter, Finger wrote or co-wrote the films &quot;Death Comes to Planet Aytin&quot;, &quot;The Green Slime&quot;, and &quot;Track of the Moon Beast&quot;, and contributed scripts to the TV series&#x27; &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. He and Charles Sinclair wrote the two-part episode &quot;The Clock King&#x27;s Crazy Crimes / The Clock King Gets Crowned&quot;, airing October 12–13, 1966, in season two of the live-action &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. It was his first public credit for any Batman story.

==Credit==
Artist Bob Kane negotiated a contract with National Comics (the future DC Comics) that signed away ownership of the character in exchange for, among other compensations, a sole mandatory byline on all Batman comics (and adaptations thereof). Finger&#x27;s name, in contrast, did not appear as an official credit on Batman stories or films until 2015. Finger began receiving limited acknowledgment for his writing work in the 1960s; the letters page of &quot;Batman&quot; #169 (Feb. 1965), for example, features editor Julius Schwartz naming Finger as creator of the Riddler.

Additionally, Finger did receive credit for his work for National&#x27;s sister company, All-American Publications, during that time. For example, the first Wildcat story, in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 (Jan. 1942), has the byline &quot;by Irwin Hasen and Bill Finger&quot;, and the first Green Lantern story (see above) is credited to &quot;Mart Dellon and Bill Finger&quot;. National later absorbed All-American. National&#x27;s practice in the 1950s made formal bylines rare in comics, with DC regularly granting credit only to Kane; William Moulton Marston, creator of Wonder Woman, under his pseudonym of Charles Moulton; and to Sheldon Mayer.

In 1989, Kane acknowledged Finger as &quot;a contributing force&quot; in the character&#x27;s creation, and wrote, &quot;Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. &#x27;I&#x27;ll put your name on it now. You deserve it. Comics historian Ron Goulart referred to Batman as the &quot;creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger&quot;.

Finger&#x27;s contemporary, artist and writer Jerry Robinson, who worked with Kane from the beginning, said, &quot;[Bill] had more to do with the molding of Batman than Bob. He just did so many things at the beginning, ... creating almost all the other characters, ... the whole persona, the whole temper.&quot; Batman inker George Roussos, another contemporary, said, &quot;Bob Kane had rough ideas, but Bill was the man behind Batman.&quot; A DC Comics press release in 2007 said, &quot;Kane, along with writer Bill Finger, had just created Batman for DC predecessor National Comics.&quot; Likewise, DC editor Paul Levitz wrote, &quot;The Darknight [sic] Detective debuted in [&quot;Detective&quot;] #27, the creation of Bob Kane and Bill Finger.&quot;

Writer John Broome and penciler Gil Kane created the comic-book villain William Hand, a.k.a. Black Hand, as a tribute to Finger, on whom the character&#x27;s name and likeness were based.

In September 2015, DC Entertainment announced Finger would receive credit on the 2016 superhero film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; and the second season of &quot;Gotham&quot;, following a deal between the Finger family and DC. Finger received his first formal credit as a creator of Batman in the October 2015 comic books &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot; #3 and &quot;Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis&quot; #3. The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as &quot;Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger&quot;.

==Awards==
Finger was posthumously inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1999. In 1985, DC Comics named Finger as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;. In his honor, Comic-Con International established in 2005 the Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing, which is given annually to &quot;two recipients — one living and one deceased — who have produced a significant body of work in the comics field&quot;. Finger posthumously received an Inkpot Award in 2014.

==Legacy==
On December 8, 2017, the southeast corner of East 192nd Street and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx was named &quot;Bill Finger Way&quot;. The corner was chosen for its proximity to Poe Park, where Finger and Kane used to meet to discuss their Batman character. Finger is the subject of the Hulu original documentary, &quot;Batman &amp; Bill&quot;, which premiered in 2017.

==Personal life==
Finger married twice. He and his first wife, Portia, had a son: Frederick (nicknamed &quot;Fred&quot;). After their divorce, Finger married Edith &quot;Lyn&quot; Simmons in the late 1960s, but they were no longer married when he died in 1974.

Finger was last seen alive on January 16, 1974. His friend and longtime writing partner Charles Sinclair found Finger dead at his home on January 18 at the condominium Allen House at 340 East 51st Street in Manhattan. The cause of death was occlusive coronary atherosclerosis. His death was not widely reported at the time. Finger had suffered three heart attacks, in 1963, 1970, and 1973. Although it was long believed by Sinclair and others that Finger was buried in an unmarked potter&#x27;s field grave, his body was actually claimed by his son, Fred, who honored his wish to be cremated, and spread his ashes in the shape of a bat on a beach in Oregon. The first story of the issue &quot;Batman&quot; #259 in December 1974 would be dedicated to Finger&#x27;s memory.

Fred Finger had a daughter, Athena, born two years after Bill Finger&#x27;s death. Fred died of complications from AIDS on January 13, 1992. Athena and her son are his only known living heirs, and her attempts (at the prompting of Nobleman and comics fans, and aided by her attorney half-sister) to restore Bill&#x27;s legacy resulted in Warner Bros.&#x27;s 2015 decision to officially recognize Finger as co-creator of Batman on film and TV projects going forward.

<doc id="141888" wikidata="Q177342" url="?curid=141888" title="Aluminium oxide">
<text>Aluminium oxide (or aluminium(III) oxide) is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula . It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides, and specifically identified as aluminium oxide. It is commonly called alumina and may also be called aloxide, aloxite, or alundum in various forms and applications. It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase α-Al2O3 as the mineral corundum, varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire. Al2O3 is used as feedstock to produce aluminium metal, as an abrasive owing to its hardness, and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point.

==Natural occurrence==
Corundum is the most common naturally occurring crystalline form of aluminium oxide. Rubies and sapphires are gem-quality forms of corundum, which owe their characteristic colours to trace impurities. Rubies are given their characteristic deep red colour and their laser qualities by traces of chromium. Sapphires come in different colours given by various other impurities, such as iron and titanium. An extremely rare δ form occurs as the mineral deltalumite.

==History==

The field of aluminium oxide ceramics has a long history. Aluminium salts were widely used in ancient and medieval alchemy. Several older textbooks cover the history of the field. A 2019 textbook by Andrew Ruys contains a detailed timeline on the
history of aluminium oxide from ancient times to the 21st century.

==Properties==
Al2O3 is an electrical insulator but has a relatively high thermal conductivity () for a ceramic material. Aluminium oxide is insoluble in water. In its most commonly occurring crystalline form, called corundum or α-aluminium oxide, its hardness makes it suitable for use as an abrasive and as a component in cutting tools.

Aluminium oxide is responsible for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of aluminium oxide (4 nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface in a matter of hundreds of picoseconds. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising. A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge-assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its hardness.

Aluminium oxide was taken off the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s chemicals lists in 1988. Aluminium oxide is on the EPA&#x27;s Toxics Release Inventory list if it is a fibrous form.

===Amphoteric nature===
Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric substance, meaning it can react with both acids and bases, such as hydrofluoric acid and sodium hydroxide, acting as an acid with a base and a base with an acid, neutralising the other and producing a salt.
:Al2O3 + 6 HF → 2 AlF3 + 3 H2O
:Al2O3 + 2 NaOH + 3 H2O → 2 NaAl(OH)4 (sodium aluminate)

==Structure==
The most common form of crystalline aluminium oxide is known as corundum, which is the thermodynamically stable form. The oxygen ions form a nearly hexagonal close-packed structure with the aluminium ions filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstices. Each Al3+ center is octahedral. In terms of its crystallography, corundum adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of Rc (number 167 in the International Tables). The primitive cell contains two formula units of aluminium oxide.

Aluminium oxide also exists in other metastable phases, including the cubic γ and η phases, the monoclinic θ phase, the hexagonal χ phase, the orthorhombic κ phase and the δ phase that can be tetragonal or orthorhombic. Each has a unique crystal structure and properties. Cubic γ-Al2O3 has important technical applications. The so-called β-Al2O3 proved to be NaAl11O17.

Molten aluminium oxide near the melting temperature is roughly 2/3 tetrahedral (i.e. 2/3 of the Al are surrounded by 4 oxygen neighbors), and 1/3 5-coordinated, with very little (&lt;5%) octahedral Al-O present. Around 80% of the oxygen atoms are shared among three or more Al-O polyhedra, and the majority of inter-polyhedral connections are corner-sharing, with the remaining 10–20% being edge-sharing. The breakdown of octahedra upon melting is accompanied by a relatively large volume increase (~33%), the density of the liquid close to its melting point is 2.93 g/cm3. The structure of molten alumina is temperature dependent and the fraction of 5- and 6-fold aluminium increases during cooling (and supercooling), at the expense of tetrahedral AlO4 units, approaching the local structural arrangements found in amorphous alumina.

==Production==

Aluminium hydroxide minerals are the main component of bauxite, the principal ore of aluminium. A mixture of the minerals comprise bauxite ore, including gibbsite (Al(OH)3), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)), and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), along with impurities of iron oxides and hydroxides, quartz and clay minerals. Bauxites are found in laterites. Bauxite is typically purified using the Bayer process:

: Al2O3 + H2O + NaOH → NaAl(OH)4
: Al(OH)3 + NaOH → NaAl(OH)4

Except for SiO2, the other components of bauxite do not dissolve in base. Upon filtering the basic mixture, Fe2O3 is removed. When the Bayer liquor is cooled, Al(OH)3 precipitates, leaving the silicates in solution.

: NaAl(OH)4 → NaOH + Al(OH)3

The solid Al(OH)3 Gibbsite is then calcined (heated to over 1100 °C) to give aluminium oxide:

: 2 Al(OH)3 → Al2O3 + 3 H2O

The product aluminium oxide tends to be multi-phase, i.e., consisting of several phases of aluminium oxide rather than solely corundum. The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product. The type of phases present affects, for example, the solubility and pore structure of the aluminium oxide product which, in turn, affects the cost of aluminium production and pollution control.

=== Sintering Process ===
The Sintering Process is a high-temperature method primarily used when the Bayer Process is not suitable, especially for ores with high silica content or when a more controlled product morphology is required. Firstly, Bauxite is mixed with additives like limestone and soda ash, then heating the mixture at high temperatures (1200 °C to 1500 °C) to form sodium aluminate and calcium silicate. After sintering, the material is leached with water to dissolve the sodium aluminate, leaving behind impurities. Sodium aluminate is then precipitated from the solution and calcined at around 1000 °C to produce alumina. This method is useful for the production of complex shapes and can be used to create porous or dense materials.

==Applications==

Known as &quot;alpha alumina&quot; in materials science, and as &quot;alundum&quot; (in fused form) or &quot;aloxite&quot; in mining and ceramic communities, aluminium oxide finds wide use. Annual global production of aluminium oxide in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes, over 90% of which was used in the manufacture of aluminium metal. The major uses of speciality aluminium oxides are in refractories, ceramics, polishing and abrasive applications. Large tonnages of aluminium hydroxide, from which alumina is derived, are used in the manufacture of zeolites, coating titania pigments, and as a fire retardant/smoke suppressant.

Over 90% of aluminium oxide, termed &quot;smelter grade alumina&quot; (SGA), is consumed for the production of aluminium, usually by the Hall–Héroult process. The remainder, termed &quot;specialty alumina&quot;, is used in a wide variety of applications which take advantage of its inertness, temperature resistance and electrical resistance.

===Fillers===
Being fairly chemically inert and white, aluminium oxide is a favored filler for plastics. Aluminium oxide is a common ingredient in sunscreen and is often also present in cosmetics such as blush, lipstick, and nail polish.

===Glass===
Many formulations of glass have aluminium oxide as an ingredient. Aluminosilicate glass is a commonly used type of glass that often contains 5% to 10% alumina.

===Catalysis===
Aluminium oxide catalyses a variety of reactions that are useful industrially. In its largest scale application, aluminium oxide is the catalyst in the Claus process for converting hydrogen sulfide waste gases into elemental sulfur in refineries. It is also useful for dehydration of alcohols to alkenes.

Aluminium oxide serves as a catalyst support for many industrial catalysts, such as those used in hydrodesulfurization and some Ziegler–Natta polymerizations.

===Gas purification===
Aluminium oxide is widely used to remove water from gas streams.

===Abrasion===
Aluminium oxide is used for its hardness and strength. Its naturally occurring form, corundum, is a 9 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness (just below diamond). It is widely used as an abrasive, including as a much less expensive substitute for industrial diamond. Many types of sandpaper use aluminium oxide crystals. In addition, its low heat retention and low specific heat make it widely used in grinding operations, particularly cutoff tools. As the powdery abrasive mineral aloxite, it is a major component, along with silica, of the cue tip &quot;chalk&quot; used in billiards. Aluminium oxide powder is used in some CD/DVD polishing and scratch-repair kits. Its polishing qualities are also behind its use in toothpaste. It is also used in microdermabrasion, both in the machine process available through dermatologists and estheticians, and as a manual dermal abrasive used according to manufacturer directions.

===Paint===

Aluminium oxide flakes are used in paint for reflective decorative effects, such as in the automotive or cosmetic industries.

===Biomedical applications===
Aluminium oxide is a representative of bioinert ceramics. Due to its excellent biocompatibility, high strength, and wear resistance, alumina ceramics are used in medical applications to manufacture artificial bones and joints. In this case, aluminium oxide is used to coat the surfaces of medical implants to give biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. It is also used for manufacturing dental implants, joint replacements, and other medical devices.

===Composite fiber===
Aluminium oxide has been used in a few experimental and commercial fiber materials for high-performance applications (e.g., Fiber FP, Nextel 610, Nextel 720). Alumina nanofibers in particular have become a research field of interest.

===Armor===
Some body armors utilize alumina ceramic plates, usually in combination with aramid or UHMWPE backing to achieve effectiveness against most rifle threats. Alumina ceramic armor is readily available to most civilians in jurisdictions where it is legal, but is not considered military grade.

===Abrasion protection===
Aluminium oxide can be grown as a coating on aluminium by anodizing or by plasma electrolytic oxidation (see the &quot;Properties&quot; above). Both the hardness and abrasion-resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60–70 Rockwell hardness C range which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum. Instead, with plasma electrolytic oxidation, the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.

Alumina is used to manufacture tiles which are attached inside pulverized fuel lines and flue gas ducting on coal fired power stations to protect high wear areas. They are not suitable for areas with high impact forces as these tiles are brittle and susceptible to breakage.

===Electrical insulation===
Aluminium oxide is an electrical insulator used as a substrate (silicon on sapphire) for integrated circuits, but also as a tunnel barrier for the fabrication of superconducting devices such as single-electron transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and superconducting qubits.

For its application as an electrical insulator in integrated circuits, where the conformal growth of a thin film is a prerequisite and the preferred growth mode is atomic layer deposition, Al2O3 films can be prepared by the chemical exchange between trimethylaluminium (Al(CH3)3) and H2O:

:2 Al(CH3)3 + 3 H2O → Al2O3 + 6 CH4

H2O in the above reaction can be replaced by ozone (O3) as the active oxidant and the following reaction then takes place:

:2 Al(CH3)3 + O3 → Al2O3 + 3 C2H6

The Al2O3 films prepared using O3 show 10–100 times lower leakage current density compared with those prepared by H2O.

Aluminium oxide, being a dielectric with relatively large band gap, is used as an insulating barrier in capacitors.

===Other===
In lighting, translucent aluminium oxide is used in some sodium vapor lamps. Aluminium oxide is also used in preparation of coating suspensions in compact fluorescent lamps.

In chemistry laboratories, aluminium oxide is a medium for chromatography, available in basic (pH 9.5), acidic (pH 4.5 when in water) and neutral formulations. Additionally, small pieces of aluminium oxide are often used as boiling chips.

Health and medical applications include it as a material in hip replacements and birth control pills.

It is used as a scintillator 
and dosimeter for radiation protection and therapy applications for its optically stimulated luminescence properties.

Insulation for high-temperature furnaces is often manufactured from aluminium oxide. Sometimes the insulation has varying percentages of silica depending on the temperature rating of the material. The insulation can be made in blanket, board, brick and loose fiber forms for various application requirements.

It is also used to make spark plug insulators.

Using a plasma spray process and mixed with titania, it is coated onto the braking surface of some bicycle rims to provide abrasion and wear resistance.
Most ceramic eyes on fishing rods are circular rings made from aluminium oxide.

In its finest powdered (white) form, called Diamantine, aluminium oxide is used as a superior polishing abrasive in watchmaking and clockmaking.

Aluminium oxide is also used in the coating of stanchions in the motocross and mountain bike industries. 
This coating is combined with molybdenumdisulfate to provide long term lubrication of the surface.

<text>The president of India (ISO: ) is the head of state of the Republic of India. The president is the nominal head of the executive, the first citizen of the country, as well as the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Droupadi Murmu is the 15th and current president, having taken office on 25 July 2022.

The office of president was created when India became a republic on 26 January 1950 when its constitution came into force. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India&#x27;s states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected by the citizens.

 of the Constitution of India states that the president can exercise their powers directly or by subordinate authority, though all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister heading the Council of Ministers. The president is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the council and to enforce the decrees passed by the Supreme Court under article 142.

== Origin ==
India achieved independence from the British on 15 August 1947, initially as a dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations with George VI as king, represented in the country by a governor-general. Following independence, the Constituent Assembly of India, under the leadership of B. R. Ambedkar, undertook the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country. The Constitution of India was eventually enacted on 26 November 1949 and came into force on 26 January 1950, making India a republic. The offices of monarch and governor-general were replaced by the new office of President of India, with Rajendra Prasad as its first incumbent. India retained its Commonwealth membership per the London Declaration, recognising The King as &quot;the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth.&quot;

The Indian constitution accords to the president the responsibility and authority to defend and protect the Constitution of India and its rule of law. Invariably, any action taken by the executive or legislature entities of the constitution shall become law only after the president&#x27;s assent. The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.

== Powers and duties ==
=== Duty ===
The primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India as made part of their oath (Article 60 of Indian constitution). The president is the common head of all independent constitutional entities. All their actions, recommendations (Article 3, Article 111, Article 274, etc.) and supervisory powers (Article 74(2), Article 78C, Article 108, Article 111, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of India shall be used in accordance to uphold the constitution. There is no bar on the actions of the president to contest in the court of law.

=== Legislative powers ===
Legislative power is constitutionally vested in the Parliament of India of which the president is the head, to facilitate the lawmaking process per the constitution (Article 78, Article 86, etc.). The president summons both the houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them. They can dissolve the Lok Sabha.

The president inaugurates parliament by addressing it after the general elections and also at the beginning of the first session every year per Article 87(1). The presidential address on these occasions is generally meant to outline the new policies of the government.

All bills passed by the parliament can become laws only after receiving the assent of the president per . After a bill is presented to them, the president shall declare either that they assent to the Bill, or that they withhold assent from it. As a third option, they can return a bill to parliament, if it is not a money bill, for reconsideration. President may be of the view that a particular bill passed under the legislative powers of parliament is violating the constitution, they can send back the bill with their recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the procedure. When, after reconsideration, the bill is passed accordingly and presented to the president, with or without amendments, the president cannot withhold their assent from it. The president can also withhold their assent to a bill when it is initially presented to them (rather than return it to parliament) thereby exercising a pocket veto on the advice of the prime minister or council of ministers per if it is inconsistent with the constitution. Article 143 gives the president the power to consult the supreme court about the constitutional validity of an issue. The president shall assent to constitutional amendment bills without power to withhold the bills per .

When either of the two Houses of the Parliament of India is not in session, and if the government feels the need for an immediate procedure, the president can promulgate ordinances that have the same force and effect as an act passed by parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier. Under , the president as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and they are confident that the government commands majority support in the parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of parliament when in force and it is the responsibility of the president to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for the promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and president, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of the law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of an ordinance after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the president. The president should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which violates the constitution or requires an amendment to the constitution. The president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution. Thus, it is believed that the POI is the de jure head of the state, whereas PM is the de facto head.

=== Executive powers ===
As per , the executive power of the country is vested in the president and is exercised by the president either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the constitution. When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president per which may be further delegated by the president to the governors of states per . Union cabinet with prime minister as its head, should aid and advise the president in performing their functions. Per Article 74 (2), the council of ministers or prime minister are not accountable legally to the advice tendered to the president but it is the sole responsibility of the president to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing their duties. President or their subordinate officers is bound by the provisions of the constitution notwithstanding any advice by the union cabinet.

As per , it is the duty of the president to enforce the decrees of the supreme court.

=== Judicial powers ===
The primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India per . The president appoints the chief justice of India and other judges on the advice of the chief justice. The president may dismiss a judge with a two-thirds vote of the two Houses of the parliament.

The Indian government&#x27;s chief legal adviser, the attorney-general for India, is appointed by the president of India under Article 76(1) and holds office during the pleasure of the president. If the president considers a question of law or a matter of public importance has arisen, they can also ask for the advisory opinion of the supreme court per . Per , the president can ask the attorney general to attend the parliamentary proceedings and report to him any unlawful functioning if any.

=== Appointment powers ===
The president appoints as prime minister, the person most likely to command the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha (usually the leader of the majority party or coalition). The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister. The Council of Ministers remains in power at the &#x27;pleasure&#x27; of the president.

The president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per , which was removed in 2019.

Governors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per , the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.

The president is responsible for making a wide variety of appointments. These include:
* The Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court of India and state/union territory high courts.
* The Chief Minister of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Article 239 AA 5 of the constitution).
* The Comptroller and Auditor General Of India.
* The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners.
* The chairman and other members of the Union Public Service Commission.
* The Attorney General Of India.
*Ambassadors and High Commissioners to other countries (only through the list of names given by the prime minister).
* Officers of the All India Services (IAS, IPS and IFoS), and other Central Civil Services in Group &#x27;A&#x27;.

=== Financial powers ===
* A financial bill can be introduced in the parliament only with the president&#x27;s recommendation.
* The president lays the Annual Financial Statement, i.e. the Union budget, before the parliament.
* The president can take advances out of the Contingency Fund of India to meet unforeseen expenses.
* The president constitutes a Finance Commission every five years to recommend the distribution of the taxes between the centre and the States. The most recent was constituted in 2017.

=== Diplomatic powers ===
All international treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the president. However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet (especially the Minister of External Affairs). Also, such treaties are subject to the approval of the parliament. The president represents India in international forums and affairs where such a function is chiefly ceremonial. The president may also send and receive diplomats, i.e. the officers from the Indian Foreign Service. The president is the first citizen of the country.

=== Military powers ===
The president is the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. Only the president can declare war or conclude peace, on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers headed by the prime minister. All important treaties and contracts are made in the president&#x27;s name.

=== Pardoning powers ===
As mentioned in of the Indian constitution, the president is empowered with the powers to grant pardons in the following situations:
* punishment for an offence against Union law
* punishment by a military court
* a death sentence

The decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority. In most cases, however, the president exercises their executive powers on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.

=== Emergency powers ===
The president can declare three types of emergencies: national, state and financial, under articles 352, 356 &amp; 360 in addition to promulgating ordinances under article 123.

==== National emergency ====

A national emergency can be declared in the whole of India or a part of its territory for causes of war or armed rebellion or an external aggression. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 (Indo-China war), 1971 (Indo-Pakistan war), and 1975 to 1977 (declared by Indira Gandhi).[see main]

Under of the India constitution, the president can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the cabinet of ministers headed by the prime minister. Such a proclamation must be approved by the parliament with at least a two-thirds majority within one month. Such an emergency can be imposed for six months. It can be extended by six months by repeated parliamentary approval-there is no maximum duration.

In such an emergency, Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens can be suspended. The six freedoms under Right to Freedom are automatically suspended. However, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty cannot be suspended ().

The president can make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state governments can make laws). Also, all money bills are referred to the president for approval. The term of the Lok Sabha can be extended by a period of up to one year, but not so as to extend the term of parliament beyond six months after the end of the declared emergency.

National Emergency has been proclaimed 3 times in India to date. It was declared first in 1962 by President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, during the Sino-Indian War. This emergency lasted through the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and up to 1968. It was revoked in 1968. The second emergency in India was proclaimed in 1971 by President V. V. Giri on the eve of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The first two emergencies were in the face of external aggression and War. They were hence external emergencies. Even as the second emergency was in progress, another internal emergency was proclaimed by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, with Indira Gandhi as prime minister in 1975. In 1977, the second and the third emergencies were together revoked.

==== State emergency ====

If the president is not fully satisfied, on the basis of the report of the governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the constitution, they can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state. Such an emergency must be approved by the parliament within a period of 2 months.

Under of the Indian constitution, it can be imposed from six months to a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. If the emergency needs to be extended for more than three years, this can be achieved by a constitutional amendment, as has happened in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.

During such an emergency, the president can take over the entire work of the executive, and the governor administers the state in the name of the president. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list (see National emergency for explanation).

A State Emergency can be imposed via the following:
# By Article 356If that state failed to run constitutionally, i.e. constitutional machinery has failed. When a state emergency is imposed under this provision, the state is said to be under &quot;President&#x27;s rule.
# By Article 365If that state is not working according to the direction of the Union government issued per the provisions of the constitution.

This type of emergency needs the approval of the parliament within 2 months. It can last up to a maximum of three years via extensions after each 6-month period. However, after one year it can be extended only if

# A state of National Emergency has been declared in the country or the particular state.
# The Election Commission finds it difficult to organise an election in that state.

The Sarkaria Commission held that presidents have unconstitutionally misused the provision of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was no constitutional break down in the states. During 2005, President&#x27;s rule was imposed in Bihar state, misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.

There is no provision in the constitution to re-promulgate president&#x27;s rule in a state when the earlier promulgation ceased to operate for want of parliaments approval within two months duration. During 2014 in Andhra Pradesh, president&#x27;s rule was first imposed on 1 March 2014 and it ceased to operate on 30 April 2014. President&#x27;s rule was promulgated after being fully aware that the earliest parliament session is feasible at the end of May 2014 after the general elections. It was reimposed again unconstitutionally on 28 April 2014 by the president.

==== Financial emergency ====
Article 282 accords financial autonomy in spending the financial resources available with the states for public purposes. gives liberty to states to borrow without any limit to its ability for its requirements within the territory of India without any consent from the Union government. However, the Union government can insist on compliance with its loan terms when a state has an outstanding loan charged to the consolidated fund of India or an outstanding loan in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the Government of India under the liability of consolidated fund of India.

Under article 360 of the constitution, the president can proclaim a financial emergency when the financial stability or credit of the nation or any part of its territory is threatened. However, until now no guidelines defining the situation of financial emergency in the entire country or a state or union territory or a panchayat or a municipality or a corporation have been framed either by the finance commission or by the central government.

Such an emergency must be approved by the parliament within two months by a simple majority. It has never been declared. A state of financial emergency remains in force indefinitely until revoked by the president.

The president can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the supreme court and high courts, in cases of a financial emergency. All money bills passed by state legislatures are submitted to the president for approval. They can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters.

== Selection process ==

=== Eligibility ===
 of the constitution sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:
* a citizen of India
* of 35 years of age or above
* qualified to become a member of the Lok Sabha

A person shall not be eligible for election as president if they hold any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.

Certain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:
* The current vice president
* The governor of any state
* A Minister of the Union or of any state (including prime minister and chief ministers)

In the event that the vice president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.

A member of parliament or a state legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if they are elected as president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in parliament or a state legislature on the date on which they enter upon their office as president [Article 59(1)].

Article 57 provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.

Under the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952, a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on the ballot.

== Time of election ==
Article 56(1) of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office for a term of five years, from the date on which they enter their office. According to Article 62, an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. An election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of their death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy; and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which they enter their office.

To meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.

=== Conditions for the presidency ===
Certain conditions, per of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections. The conditions are:
* The president shall not be a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state, and if a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state is elected president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in that house on the date on which they enter into office as president.
* The president shall not hold any other office of profit.
* The president shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of their official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule.
* The emoluments and allowances of the president shall not be diminished during their term of office.

=== Election process ===
Whenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both houses of parliament (MPs), the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabha) of all States and the elected members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs) of union territories with legislatures, i.e., National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry. The election process of the president is a more extensive process than of the prime minister who is also elected indirectly (elected by the members of the majority party (or union) in the Lok Sabha). Whereas President being the constitutional head with duties to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and rule of law in a constitutional democracy with constitutional supremacy, is elected in an extensive manner by the members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and state legislative assemblies in a secret ballot procedure.

The nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of in the Reserve Bank of India. The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.

The election is held by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method. The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by of the constitution.

Each elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.

The actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state&#x27;s population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.

Although Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by MPs and MLAs, they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.

=== Oath or affirmation ===
The president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the chief justice of India—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court—an oath or affirmation to protect, preserve and defend the constitution as follows:

== Emoluments ==

The president of India used to receive per month per the Second Schedule of the constitution. This amount was increased to in 1998. On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to . This amount was further increased to in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual budget that the Government allots for their upkeep. Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president&#x27;s official residence, is the largest presidential palace in the world. The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. The official state car of the president is a custom-built heavily armored Mercedes Benz S600 (W221) Pullman Guard.

The former presidents and widows and widowers of presidents are eligible for pension, furnished accommodation, security, various allowances, etc.

== Impeachment ==
The Supreme Court shall inquire and decide regarding all &quot;doubts&quot; and &quot;disputes&quot; arising out of or in connection with the election of a president per of the constitution. The Supreme Court can remove the president for the electoral malpractices or upon being not eligible to be a member of the Lok Sabha under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Subject to Article 71 (3), parliament made applicable rules/procedure to petition the supreme court for resolving the &quot;disputes&quot; only that arise during the election process of the president but not the &quot;doubts&quot; that arise from their unconstitutional actions/deeds or changing Indian citizenship during the tenure of the president which may violate the requisite election qualifications.

The president may also be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment for violating the Constitution of India by the Parliament of India. The process may start in either of the two houses of the parliament. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.

A resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the president has the right to defend himself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by the special majority again, the president stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.

Under of the constitution, though the president cannot be summoned for questioning except on their voluntary willingness to testify in the court in support of their controversial deeds, the unconstitutional decisions taken by the president would be declared invalid by the courts. The case would be decided by the courts based on the facts furnished by the Union government for the president&#x27;s role. As clarified by the supreme court in the case &quot;Rameshwar Prasad &amp; Others vs Union of India &amp; An Other&quot; on 24 January 2006; though the president cannot be prosecuted and imprisoned during their term of office, they can be prosecuted after he/she steps down from the post for any guilt committed during the term of the presidency as declared earlier by the courts. No president has resigned on impropriety to continue in office for declaring and nullifying their unconstitutional decisions by the courts till now. No criminal case at least on the grounds of disrespecting constitution is lodged till now against former presidents to punish them for their unconstitutional acts; though many decisions taken during the term of a president have been declared by the supreme court as unconstitutional, &quot;mala fides&quot;, void, &quot;ultra vires&quot;, etc.

== Succession ==
The Office of the president falls vacant in the following scenarios:
# On the expiry of their term.
# By reason of death.
# By reason of resignation.
# Removal by impeachment.
 of the Indian constitution says that the vice-president of India will have to discharge the duties, if the office falls vacant due to any reason other than the expiry of the term. The vice president reverts to their office when a new president is elected and enters office. When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice president discharges the president&#x27;s functions until the president resumes the duties.

A vice president who acts as or discharges the functions of the president has all the powers and immunities of the president and is entitled to the same emoluments as the president. When a vice president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.

The Indian parliament has enacted the law—&quot;The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969&quot; — for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and the vice president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the chief justice—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of India available—discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their office or a newly elected vice president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier. For example, in 1969, when President Zakir Husain died in office, Vice-President V. V. Giri served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. In this event, the then chief justice of India, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah served as the acting president of India until the next president was elected.

== President vs Chief Justice ==

== President vs Prime minister ==

== Important presidential interventions in the past ==
The president&#x27;s role as defender of the constitution and the powers as Head of State, especially in relation to those exercised by the prime minister as leader of the government, have changed over time. In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.

=== Proving majority in the parliament ===
In 1979, Prime Minister Charan Singh, did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament. Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.

=== Proof of Majority to form a Government ===
Since the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed prime ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.

=== Vetoing of a Bill ===
Since the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare their assent or refusal, the president could exercise a &quot;pocket veto&quot; by not taking any action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by President Zail Singh over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government arbitrary powers to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.

=== Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués ===
In the late 1990s, President K. R. Narayanan introduced a modicum of transparency and openness in the functioning of the President. This was by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués explaining, to the nation, the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising their discretionary powers.

=== Return of a Bill ===
The constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of &#x27;offices of profit&#x27;, the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament. The combined opposition, the NDA, hailed the move. The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006.

=== Sacking state governors ===

Arunachal Pradesh governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, who was earlier appointed by the ruling party at the centre, was sacked by President Pranab Mukherjee after the Supreme Court struck down his unconstitutional acts.

<text>Material requirements planning (MRP) is a production planning, scheduling, and inventory control system used to manage manufacturing processes. Most MRP systems are software-based, but it is possible to conduct MRP by hand as well.

An MRP system is intended to simultaneously meet three objectives:

* Ensure raw materials are available for production and products are available for delivery to customers.
* Maintain the lowest possible material and product levels in store
* Plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules and purchasing activities.

== History ==
Prior to MRP, and before computers dominated industry, reorder point (ROP)/reorder-quantity (ROQ) type methods like EOQ (economic order quantity) had been used in manufacturing and inventory management.

MRP was computerized by the aero engine makers Rolls-Royce and General Electric in the early 1950s but not commercialized by them. It was then &#x27;reinvented&#x27; to supply the Polaris program and then, in 1964, as a response to the Toyota Manufacturing Program, Joseph Orlicky developed material requirements planning (MRP). The first company to use MRP was Black &amp; Decker in 1964, with Dick Alban as project leader. Orlicky&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;Material Requirements Planning&quot; has the subtitle &quot;The New Way of Life in Production and Inventory Management&quot;. By 1975, MRP was implemented in 700 companies. This number had grown to about 8,000 by 1981.

In 1983, Oliver Wight developed MRP into manufacturing resource planning (MRP II). In the 1980s, Joe Orlicky&#x27;s MRP evolved into Oliver Wight&#x27;s manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) which brings master scheduling, rough-cut capacity planning, capacity requirements planning, S&amp;OP in 1983 and other concepts to classical MRP. By 1989, about one third of the software industry was MRP II software sold to American industry ($1.2 billion worth of software).

== MRP scope in manufacturing ==

===Dependent demand vs independent demand===
Independent demand is demand originating outside the plant or production system, while dependent demand is demand for components. The bill of materials (BOM) specifies the relationship between the end product (independent demand) and the components (dependent demand). MRP takes as input the information contained in the BOM.
The basic functions of an MRP system include: inventory control, bill of material processing, and elementary scheduling. MRP helps organizations to maintain low inventory levels. It is used to plan manufacturing, purchasing and delivering activities.

&quot;Manufacturing organizations, whatever their products, face the same daily practical problem - that customers want products to be available in a shorter time than it takes to make them. This means that some level of planning is required.&quot;

Companies need to control the types and quantities of materials they purchase, plan which products are to be produced and in what quantities and ensure that they are able to meet current and future customer demand, all at the lowest possible cost. Making a bad decision in any of these areas will make the company lose money. A few examples are given below:
* If a company purchases insufficient quantities of an item used in manufacturing (or the wrong item) it may be unable to meet contract obligations to supply products on time.
* If a company purchases excessive quantities of an item, money is wasted - the excess quantity ties up cash while it remains as stock that might never be used at all.
* Beginning production of an order at the wrong time can cause customer deadlines to be missed.

MRP is a tool to deal with these problems. It provides answers for several questions:
* &quot;What&quot; items are required?
* &quot;How many&quot; are required?
* &quot;When&quot; are they required?...

MRP can be applied both to items that are purchased from outside suppliers and to sub-assemblies, produced internally, that are components of more complex items. An important point is that MRP is not cost driven: it does not seek to minimise cost. Instead, it is stockout driven: it will order just enough to avoid stockouts (using the lot size rule for each item) and order as late as possible.

===Data===
The data that must be considered include:
* The &quot;end item&quot; (or items) being created. This is sometimes called independent demand, or Level &quot;0&quot; on BOM (bill of materials).
* How much is required at a time.
* When the quantities are required to meet demand.
* Shelf life of stored materials.
* Inventory status records. Records of &quot;net&quot; materials &quot;available&quot; for use already in stock (on hand) and materials on order from suppliers.
* Bills of materials. Details of the materials, components and sub-assemblies required to make each product.
* Planning data. This includes all the restraints and directions to produce such items as: routing, labor and machine standards, quality and testing standards, pull/work cell and push commands, lot sizing techniques (i.e. fixed lot size, lot-for-lot, economic order quantity), scrap percentages, and other inputs.

===Outputs===
There are two outputs and a variety of messages/reports:
* Output 1 is the &quot;Recommended Production Schedule.&quot; This lays out a detailed schedule of the required minimum start and completion dates, with quantities, for each step of the Routing and Bill Of Material required to satisfy the demand from the master production schedule (MPS).
* Output 2 is the &quot;Recommended Purchasing Schedule.&quot; This lays out both the dates on which the purchased items should be received into the facility &quot;and&quot; the dates on which the purchase orders or blanket order release should occur in order to match the production schedules.

Messages and reports:
* Purchase orders. An order to a supplier to provide materials.
* Reschedule notices. These &quot;recommend&quot; cancelling, increasing, delaying or speeding up existing orders.

== Problems with MRP systems ==
*Integrity of the data. If there are any errors in the inventory data, the bill of materials (commonly referred to as &#x27;BOM&#x27;) data, or the master production schedule, then the output data will also be incorrect (&quot;GIGO&quot;: garbage in, garbage out). Data integrity is also affected by inaccurate cycle count adjustments, mistakes in receiving input and shipping output, scrap not reported, waste, damage, box count errors, supplier container count errors, production reporting errors, and system issues. Many of these type of errors can be minimized by implementing pull systems and using bar code scanning. Most vendors in this type of system recommend at least 99% data integrity for the system to give useful results.
*Systems require that the user specify how long it will take for a factory to make a product from its component parts (assuming they are all available). Additionally, the system design also assumes that this &quot;lead time&quot; in manufacturing will be the same each time the item is made, without regard to quantity being made, or other items being made simultaneously in the factory, or any &quot;learning curve&quot; reductions in lead time.
*A manufacturer may have factories in different cities or even countries. It is not good for an MRP system to say that we do not need to order some material, because we have plenty of it thousands of miles away although, when properly implemented, this problem is totally avoided. The overall enterprise resource planning (ERP) system needs to be able to organize inventory and needs by individual factory and inter-communicate the needs in order to enable each factory to redistribute components to serve the overall enterprise. This means that other systems in the enterprise need to work to maximum potential, both before implementing an MRP system and in the future. For example, systems like variety reduction and engineering, which makes sure that product comes out right first time (without defects), must be in place.
*Production may be in progress for some part, whose design gets changed, with customer orders in the system for both the old design, and the new one, concurrently. The overall ERP system needs to have a system of coding parts such that the MRP will correctly calculate needs and tracking for both versions. Parts must be booked into and out of stores more regularly than the MRP calculations take place. Note, these other systems can well be manual systems, but must interface to the MRP. For example, a &#x27;walk around&#x27; stock intake done just prior to the MRP calculations can be a practical solution for a small inventory (especially if it is an &quot;open store&quot;). Good MRP system, however, recognize supercessions, driven by date or by stock run-down, to handle this effectively and efficiently.
*The other major drawback of MRP is that it fails to account for capacity in its calculations. This means it will give results that are impossible to implement due to manpower, machine or supplier capacity constraints. However this is largely dealt with by MRP II. Generally, MRP II refers to a system with integrated financials. An MRP II system can include finite or infinite capacity planning. But, to be considered a true MRP II system must also include financials. In the MRP II (or MRP2) concept, fluctuations in forecast data are taken into account by including simulation of the master production schedule, thus creating a long-term control. A more general feature of MRP2 is its extension to purchasing, to marketing and to finance (integration of all the functions of the company), ERP has been the next step.

===Solutions to data integrity issues===
Source:

*Bill of material – The best practice is to physically verify the bill of material either at the production site or by disassembling the product.
*Cycle count – The best practice is to determine why a cycle count that increases or decreases inventory has occurred. Find the root cause and correct the problem from occurring again.
*Scrap reporting – This can be the most difficult area to maintain with any integrity. Start with isolating the scrap by providing scrap bins at the production site and then record the scrap from the bins on a daily basis. One benefit of reviewing the scrap on site is that preventive action can be taken by the engineering group.
*Receiving errors – Manual systems of recording what has been received are error prone. The best practice is to implement the system of receiving by ASN from the supplier. The supplier sends an ASN (advanced shipping notification). When the components are received into the facility, the ASN is processed and then company labels are created for each line item. The labels are affixed to each container and then scanned into the MRP system. Extra labels reveal a shortage from the shipment and too few labels reveal an over shipment. Some companies pay for ASN by reducing the time in processing accounts payable.
*Shipping errors – The container labels are printed from the shipper. The labels are affixed to the containers in a staging area or when they are loaded on the transport.
*Production reporting – The best practice is to use bar code scanning to enter production into inventory. A product that is rejected should be moved to an MRB (material review board) location. Containers that require sorting need to be received in reverse.
*Replenishment – The best replenishment practice is replacement using bar code scanning, or via pull system. Depending upon the complexity of the product, planners can actually order materials using scanning with a min-max system.

== Demand driven MRP ==

In 2011, the third edition of &quot;Orlicky&#x27;s Materials Requirements Planning&quot; introduced a new type of MRP called &quot;demand driven MRP&quot; (DDMRP). The new edition of the book was written, not by Orlicky himself (he died in 1986) but by Carol Ptak and Chad Smith at the invitation of McGraw Hill to update Orlicky&#x27;s work.

Demand driven MRP is a multi-echelon formal planning and execution technique with five distinct components:
# Strategic inventory positioning – The first question of effective inventory management is not, &quot;how much inventory should we have?&quot; Nor is it, &quot;when should we make or buy something?&quot; The most fundamental question to ask in today&#x27;s manufacturing environments is, &quot;given our system and environment, where should we place inventory to have the best protection from surprises?&quot; Inventory is like a break wall to protect boats in a marina from the roughness of incoming waves. Out on the open ocean the break walls have to be 50–100 feet tall, but in a small lake the break walls are only a couple feet tall. In a glassy smooth pond no break wall is necessary.
# Buffer profiles and level – Once the strategically replenished positions are determined, the actual levels of those buffers have to be initially set. Based on several factors, different materials and parts behave differently (but many also behave nearly the same). DDMRP calls for the grouping of parts and materials chosen for strategic replenishment and that behave similarly into &quot;buffer profiles.&quot; Buffer profiles take into account important factors including lead time (relative to the environment), variability (demand or supply), whether the part is made or bought or distributed and whether there are significant order multiples involved. These buffer profiles are made up of &quot;zones&quot; that produce a unique buffer picture for each part as their respective individual part traits are applied to the group traits.
# Dynamic adjustments – Over the course of time, group and individual traits can and will change as new suppliers and materials are used, new markets are opened and/or old markets deteriorate and manufacturing capacities and methods change. Dynamic buffer levels allow the company to adapt buffers to group and individual part trait changes over time through the use of several types of adjustments. Thus, as more or less variability is encountered or as a company&#x27;s strategy changes these buffers adapt and change to fit the environment.
# Demand-driven planning – takes advantage of the sheer computational power of today&#x27;s hardware and software. It also takes advantage of the new demand-driven or pull-based approaches. When these two elements are combined then there is the best of both worlds; relevant approaches and tools for the way the world works today &quot;and&quot; a system of routine that promotes better and quicker decisions and actions at the planning and execution level.
# Highly visible and collaborative execution – Simply launching purchase orders (POs), manufacturing orders (MOs) and transfer orders (TOs) from any planning system does not end the materials and order management challenge. These POs, MOs and TOs have to be effectively managed to synchronize with the changes that often occur within the &quot;execution horizon.&quot; The execution horizon is the time from which a PO, MO or TO is opened until the time it is closed in the system of record. DDMRP defines a modern, integrated and greatly needed system of execution for all part categories in order to speed the proliferation of relevant information and priorities throughout an organization and supply chain.

These five components work together to attempt to dampen, if not eliminate, the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the bullwhip effect in complex and challenging environments. The Demand Driven Institute claims the following: In utilizing these approaches, planners will no longer have to try to respond to every single message for every single part that is off by even one day. This approach provides real information about those parts that are truly at risk of negatively impacting the planned availability of inventory. DDMRP sorts the significant few items that require attention from the many parts that are being managed. Under the DDMRP approach, consultants selling it claim that fewer planners can make better decisions more quickly. That means companies will be better able to leverage their working and human capital as well as the huge investments they have made in information technology. One down-side, however, is that DDMRP cannot run on the majority of MRPII/ERP systems in use today.

It is claimed by the companies selling it that DDMRP has been successfully applied to a variety of environments including CTO (configure to order), MTS (make to stock), MTO (make to order) and ETO (engineer to order) although detailed studies are rare. The methodology is applied differently in each environments but the five step process remains the same. DDMRP leverages knowledge from theory of constraints (TOC), traditional MRP &amp; DRP, Six Sigma and lean. It is effectively an amalgam of MRP for planning, and kanban techniques for execution (across multi-echelon supply chains) which means that it has the strengths of both but also the weaknesses of both, so it remains a niche solution. The problems with MRP (as listed above) also apply to DDMRP.

<text>Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic piperidine opioid primarily used as an analgesic (pain medication). It is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Its primary clinical utility is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from painful surgeries. Fentanyl is also used as a sedative. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a relatively small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating μ-opioid receptors. Fentanyl is sold under the brand names Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze, among others.
Pharmaceutical fentanyl&#x27;s adverse effects are identical to those of other opioids and narcotics, including addiction, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to respiratory arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium, a subset of the latter known as &quot;narcotic delirium&quot;, narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and death. Alcohol and other drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl&#x27;s side effects. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, but because fentanyl is so potent, multiple doses might be necessary.
Fentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1959 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, were used in healthcare globally. , fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine; in 2019, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.
Fentanyl continues to fuel an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, deaths from prescription opioid (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) per year remained stable, while synthetic opioid (primarily fentanyl) deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601. Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021. Fentanyl constitutes the majority of all drug overdose deaths in the United States since it overtook heroin in 2018. The United States National Forensic Laboratory estimates fentanyl reports by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories increased from 4,697 reports in 2014 to 117,045 reports in 2020. Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Fentanyl has been reported in pill form, including pills mimicking pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone. Mixing with other drugs or disguising as a pharmaceutical makes it difficult to determine the correct treatment in the case of an overdose, resulting in more deaths. In an attempt to reduce the number of overdoses from taking other drugs mixed with fentanyl, drug testing kits, strips, and labs are available. Fentanyl&#x27;s ease of manufacture and high potency makes it easier to produce and smuggle, resulting in fentanyl replacing other abused narcotics and becoming more widely used.

== Medical uses ==

=== Anesthesia ===
Intravenous fentanyl is often used for anesthesia and as an analgesic. To induce anesthesia, it is given with a sedative-hypnotic, like propofol or thiopental, and a euphoriant. To maintain anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics and additional fentanyl may be used. These are often given in 15–30minute intervals throughout procedures such as endoscopy and surgeries and in emergency rooms.

For pain relief after surgery, use can decrease the amount of inhalational anesthetic needed for emergence from anesthesia. Balancing this medication and titrating the drug based on expected stimuli and the person&#x27;s responses can result in stable blood pressure and heart rate throughout a procedure and a faster emergence from anesthesia with minimal pain.

=== Regional anesthesia ===
Fentanyl is the most commonly used intrathecal opioid because its lipophilic profile allows a quick onset of action (5–10 min) and intermediate duration of action (60–120 min). Spinal administration of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl may be the optimal combination. The almost immediate onset of fentanyl reduces visceral discomfort and even nausea during the procedure.

=== Obstetrics ===
Fentanyl is sometimes given intrathecally as part of spinal anesthesia or epidurally for epidural anaesthesia and analgesia. Because of fentanyl&#x27;s high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia. It is widely used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its short time to action peak (about 5 minutes), the rapid termination of its effect after a single dose, and the occurrence of relative cardiovascular stability. In obstetrics, the dose must be closely regulated to prevent large amounts of transfer from mother to fetus. At high doses, the drug may act on the fetus to cause postnatal Stimulant. For this reason, shorter-acting agents such as alfentanyl or remifentanil may be more suitable in the context of inducing general anaesthesia.

=== Pain management ===

The bioavailability of intranasal fentanyl is about 70–90% but with some imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow, and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, 200, 400(PecFent)μg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain-reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900out-of-hospital patients.

In children, intranasal fentanyl is useful for the treatment of moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated. Furthermore, a 2017 study suggested the efficacy of fentanyl lozenges in children as young as five, weighing as little as 13kg. Lozenges are more inclined to be used as the child is in control of sufficient dosage, in contrast to buccal tablets.

==== Chronic pain ====
It is also used in the management of chronic pain. Often, transdermal patches are used. The patches work by slowly releasing fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage is based on the size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Each patch should be changed every 72hours. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption, and route of administration. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opioid (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain. It is unclear if fentanyl gives long-term pain relief to people with neuropathic pain.

==== Breakthrough pain ====
Sublingual fentanyl dissolves quickly and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound, which is well absorbed sublingually and generally well tolerated. Such forms are particularly useful for breakthrough cancer pain episodes, which are often rapid in onset, short in duration, and severe in intensity.

==== Palliative care ====

In palliative care, transdermal fentanyl patches have a definitive, but limited role for:
* people already stabilized on other opioids who have persistent swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parenteral routes such as subcutaneous administration.
* people with moderate to severe kidney failure.
* troublesome side effects of oral morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone.

When using the transdermal patch, patients must be careful to minimize or avoid external heat sources (direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.), which can trigger the release and absorption of too much medication and cause potentially deadly complications.

==== Combat medicine ====
USAF Pararescue combat medics in Afghanistan used fentanyl lozenges in the form of lollipops on combat casualties from IED blasts and other trauma. The stick is taped to a finger and the lozenge put in the cheek of the person. When enough fentanyl has been absorbed, the (sedated) person generally lets the lollipop fall from the mouth, indicating sufficient analgesia and somewhat reducing the likelihood of overdose and associated risks.

==== Breathing difficulties ====
Fentanyl is used to help relieve shortness of breath (dyspnea) when patients cannot tolerate morphine, or whose breathlessness is refractory to morphine. Fentanyl is useful for such treatment in palliative care settings where pain and shortness of breath are severe and need to be treated with strong opioids. Nebulized fentanyl citrate is used to relieve end-of-life dyspnea in hospice settings.

=== Other ===
Some routes of administration such as nasal sprays and inhalers generally result in a faster onset of high blood levels, which can provide more immediate analgesia but also more severe side effects, especially in overdose. The much higher cost of some of these appliances may not be justified by marginal benefit compared with buccal or oral options. Intranasal fentanyl appears to be equally effective as IV morphine and superior to intramuscular morphine for the management of acute hospital pain.

A fentanyl patient-controlled transdermal system (PCTS) is under development, which aims to allow patients to control the administration of fentanyl through the skin to treat postoperative pain. The technology consists of a &quot;preprogrammed, self-contained drug-delivery system&quot; that uses electrotransport technology to administer on-demand doses of 40μg of fentanyl hydrochloride over ten minutes. In a 2004 experiment including 189 patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain up to 24hours after major surgery, 25% of patients withdrew due to inadequate analgesia. However, the PCTS method proved superior to the placebo, showing lower mean VAS pain scores and having no significant respiratory depression effects.

== Adverse effects ==
Fentanyl&#x27;s most common side effects, which affect more than 10% of people, include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, and asthenia (weakness). Less frequently, in 3–10% of people, fentanyl can cause abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), shortness of breath, hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with aphasia. Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less histamine-mediated itching, than morphine. In rare cases, serotonin syndrome is associated with fentanyl use. Existing studies advise medical practitioners to exercise caution when combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs with fentanyl.

The duration of action of fentanyl has sometimes been underestimated, leading to harm in a medical context. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but doctors in the United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more had become seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.

=== Respiratory depression ===
The most dangerous adverse effect of fentanyl is respiratory depression, that is, decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide leading to reduced rate of breathing, which can cause anoxic brain injury or death. This risk is decreased when the airway is secured with an endotracheal tube (as during anesthesia). This risk is higher in specific groups, like those with obstructive sleep apnea.

Other factors that increase the risk of respiratory depression are:
* High fentanyl doses
* Simultaneous use of methadone
* Sleep
* Older age
* Simultaneous use of CNS depressants like benzodiazepines (i.e. alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam), barbiturates, alcohol, and inhaled anesthetics
* Hyperventilation
* Decreased CO2 levels in the serum
* Respiratory acidosis
* Decreased fentanyl clearance from the body
* Decreased blood flow to the liver
* Renal insufficiency

Sustained release fentanyl preparations, such as patches, may also produce unexpected delayed respiratory depression. The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:
* Saturation of the body fat compartment in people with rapid and profound body fat loss (people with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced cachexia can lose 80% of their body fat).
* Early carbon dioxide retention causes cutaneous vasodilation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces the protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.
* Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.

Another related complication of fentanyl overdoses includes the so-called wooden chest syndrome, which quickly induces complete respiratory failure by paralyzing the thoracic muscles, explained in more detail in the Muscle rigidity section below.

===Heart and blood vessels===
* &quot;Bradycardia:&quot; Fentanyl decreases the heart rate by increasing vagal nerve tone in the brainstem, which increases the parasympathetic drive.
* &quot;Vasodilation:&quot; It also vasodilates arterial and venous blood vessels through a central mechanism, by primarily slowing down vasomotor centers in the brainstem. To a lesser extent, it does this by directly affecting blood vessels. This is much more profound in patients who have an already increased sympathetic drive, like patients who have high blood pressure or congestive heart failure. It does not affect the contractility of the heart when regular doses are administered.

=== Muscle rigidity ===
If high boluses of fentanyl are administered quickly, muscle rigidity of the vocal cords can make bag-mask ventilation very difficult. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it can be prevented and treated using neuromuscular blockers.

==== Wooden chest syndrome ====
A prominent idiosyncratic adverse effect of fentanyl also includes a sudden onset of rigidity of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, which induces respiratory failure; this is seen with high doses and is known as wooden chest syndrome. The syndrome is believed to be the main cause of death as a result of fentanyl overdoses.

Wooden chest syndrome is reversed by naloxone and is believed to be caused by a release of noradrenaline, which activates α-adrenergic receptors and also possibly via activation of cholinergic receptors.

Wooden chest syndrome is unique to the most powerful opioidswhich today comprise fentanyl and its analogswhile other less-powerful opioids like heroin produce mild rigidity of the respiratory muscles to a much lesser degree.

=== &quot;Fentanyl fold&quot; posture ===
There are many reports of fentanyl users adopting a &quot;folded&quot; posture.

Daniel Ciccarone of UCSF said what he calls the “nod” is a common side effect of opioid use, and later notes that &quot;nods have always happened to varying degrees with other opioids, particularly heroin. The nods with fentanyl, however, seem to be more extreme. And it&#x27;s often a sign that a person has taken too strong a dose&quot;. 
He also said &quot;the fentanyl fold falls into the umbrella of a severe spinal deformity that can cause functional disability and can drive mental anguish&quot; which is a factor given the socioeconomic status and more fragile mental health of drug users typically when compared to non-users.

Adulteration of fentanyl with xylazine, also known as &#x27;tranq&#x27;, can exacerbate postural problems.

== Overdose ==
Fentanyl poses an exceptionally high overdose risk in humans since the amount required to cause toxicity is unpredictable. In its pharmaceutical form, most overdose deaths attributed solely to fentanyl occur at serum concentrations at a mean of 0.025μg/mL, with a range 0.005–0.027μg/mL. In contexts of poly-substance use, blood fentanyl concentrations of approximately 7ng/mL or greater have been associated with fatalities. Over 85% of overdoses involved at least one other drug, and there was no clear correlation showing at which level the mixtures were fatal. The dosages of fatal mixtures varied by over three magnitudes in some cases. This extremely unpredictable volatility with other drugs makes it especially difficult to avoid fatalities.

Naloxone (sold under the brand name Narcan) can completely or partially reverse an opioid overdose. In July2014, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK issued a warning about the potential for life-threatening harm from accidental exposure to transdermal fentanyl patches, particularly in children, and advised that they should be folded, with the adhesive side in, before being discarded. The patches should be kept away from children, who are most at risk from fentanyl overdose. In the US, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs caused over 29,000deaths in 2017, a large increase over the previous four years.

Some increases in fentanyl deaths do not involve prescription fentanyl but are related to illicitly made fentanyl that is being mixed with or sold as heroin. Death from fentanyl overdose continues to be a public health issue of national concern in Canada since September 2015. In 2016, deaths from fentanyl overdoses in the province of British Columbia averaged two persons per day. In 2017 the death rate increased by more than 100% with 368 overdose-related deaths in British Columbia between January and April 2017.

Fentanyl has started to make its way into heroin as well as illicitly manufactured opioids and benzodiazepines. Fentanyl contamination in cocaine, methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and other drugs is common. A kilogram of heroin laced with fentanyl may sell for more than US$100,000, but the fentanyl itself may be produced far more cheaply, for about US$6,000 per kilogram. While Mexico and China are the primary source countries for fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the United States, India is emerging as a source for finished fentanyl powder and fentanyl precursor chemicals. The United Kingdom illicit drug market is no longer reliant on China, as domestic fentanyl production is replacing imports.

The intravenous dose causing 50% of opioid-naive experimental subjects to die () is &quot;3mg/kg in rats, 1mg/kg in cats, 14mg/kg in dogs, and 0.03mg/kg in monkeys.&quot; The LD50 in mice has been given as 6.9mg/kg by intravenous administration, 17.5mg/kg intraperitoneally, 27.8mg/kg by oral administration. The LD50 in humans is unknown.

In 2023, overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada again reached record numbers. While overdoses involving fentanyl in the United States have decreased in 2024, the overall percentage of overdoses involving fentanyl has remained stable between 70% and 80% from 2021-2024. According to a 2023 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the increased numbers of deaths are not related to an increased number of users but to the lethal effects of fentanyl itself. Fentanyl would require a special status as it is considerably more toxic than other widely abused opioids and opiates. Overdose deaths in pediatric cases are also concerning. In a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, 37.5% of all fatal pediatric cases between 1999 and 2021 were related to fentanyl; most of the deaths were among adolescents (89.6%) and children aged 0 to 4 years (6.6%). According to the UNODC, &quot;the opioid crisis in North America is unabated, fueled by an unprecedented number of overdose deaths.&quot;

=== False reports by police of poisonings through secondary exposure ===
In the late 2010s, some media outlets began to report stories of police officers being hospitalized after touching powdered fentanyl, or after brushing it from their clothing. Topical (or transdermal; via the skin) and inhalative exposure to fentanyl is extremely unlikely to cause intoxication or overdose (except in cases of prolonged exposure with very large quantities of fentanyl), and first responders such as paramedics and police officers are at minimal risk of fentanyl poisoning through accidental contact with intact skin. A 2020 article from the Journal of Medical Toxicology stated that &quot;the consensus of the scientific community remains that illness from unintentional exposures is extremely unlikely, because opioids are not efficiently absorbed through the skin and are unlikely to be carried in the air.&quot; The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology issued a joint report in 2017 asserting the risk of fentanyl overdose via incidental transdermal exposure is very low, and it would take 200 minutes of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, but not a potentially fatal one. The effects being reported in these cases, including rapid heartbeat, hyperventilation and chills, were not symptoms of a fentanyl overdose, and were more commonly associated with a panic attack.

A 2021 paper expressed concern that these physical fears over fentanyl may inhibit effective emergency response to overdoses by causing responding officers to spend additional time on unnecessary precautions and that the media coverage could also perpetuate a wider social stigma that people who use drugs are dangerous to be around. A 2020 survey of first responders in New York found that 80% believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”

Many experts in toxicology are skeptical of police truly overdosing through mere touch. &quot;This has never happened,&quot; said Dr. Ryan Marino, an emergency and addiction medicine physician at Case Western Reserve University. &quot;There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl.&quot;

=== Prevention ===
Public health advisories to prevent fentanyl misuse and fatal overdose have been issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). An initial HAN Advisory, also known as a Health Alert Network Advisory (&quot;provides vital, time-sensitive information for a specific incident or situation; warrants immediate action or attention by health officials, laboratorians, clinicians, and members of the public; and conveys the highest level of importance&quot;) was issued during October 2015. A subsequent HAN Alert was issued in July 2018, warning of rising numbers of deaths due to fentanyl abuse and mixing with non-opioids. A December 2020 HAN Advisory warned of:

substantial increases in drug overdose deaths across the United States, primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving ... illicitly manufactured fentanyl; a concerning acceleration of the increase in drug overdose deaths, with the largest increase recorded from March 2020 to May 2020, coinciding with the implementation of widespread mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic; significant increases in overdose deaths involving methamphetamine.

81,230 drug overdose deaths occurred during the 12 months from May 2019 to May 2020, the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month interval ever recorded for the U.S. The CDC recommended the following four actions to counter this rise:
# Local need to expand the distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education,
# Expand awareness, access, and availability of treatment for substance use disorders,
# Intervene early with individuals at the highest risk for overdose, and
# improve detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.

Another initiative is a social media campaign from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) called &quot;One Pill Can Kill&quot;. This social media campaign&#x27;s goal is to spread awareness of the prevalence of counterfeit pills that are being sold in America that is leading to the large overdose epidemic in America. This campaign also shows the difference between counterfeit pills and real pills.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Classification ===
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid in the phenylpiperidine family, which includes sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil. Some fentanyl analogues, such as carfentanil, are up to 10,000 times stronger than morphine.

=== Structure-activity ===
The structures of opioids share many similarities. Whereas opioids like codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are synthesized by simple modifications of morphine, fentanyl, and its relatives are synthesized by modifications of meperidine. Meperidine is a fully synthetic opioid, and other members of the phenylpiperidine family like alfentanil and sufentanil are complex versions of this structure.

Like other opioids, fentanyl is a weak base that is highly lipid-soluble, protein-bound, and protonated at physiological pH. All of these factors allow it to rapidly cross cellular membranes, contributing to its quick effect in the body and the central nervous system.

=== Fentanyl analogs ===
Fentanyl analogs are types of fentanyl with various chemical modifications on any number of positions of the molecule, but still maintain, or even exceed, its pharmacological effects. Many fentanyl analogs are termed &quot;designer drugs&quot; because they are synthesized solely to be used illicitly. Carfentanil, a fentanyl analog, has an additional carboxylic acid group attached to the 4 position. Carfentanil is 20–30 times as potent as fentanyl and is common in the illicit drug chain. The drug is commonly used to tranquilize elephants and other large animals.

=== Mechanism of action ===

Fentanyl, like other opioids, acts on opioid receptors. These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which contain seven transmembrane portions, intracellular loops, extracellular loops, intracellular C-terminus, and extracellular N-terminus. The extracellular N-terminus is important in differentiating different types of binding substrates. When fentanyl binds, downstream signaling leads to inhibitory effects, such as decreased cAMP production, decreased calcium ion influx, and increased potassium efflux. This inhibits the ascending pathways in the central nervous system to increase pain threshold by changing the perception of pain; this is mediated by decreasing propagation of nociceptive signals, resulting in analgesic effects.

As a μ-receptor agonist, fentanyl binds 50 to 100 times more potently than morphine. It can also bind to the delta and kappa opioid receptors but with a lower affinity. It has high lipid solubility, allowing it to more easily penetrate the central nervous system. It attenuates &quot;second pain&quot; with primary effects on slow-conducting, unmyelinated C-fibers and is less effective on neuropathic pain and &quot;first pain&quot; signals through small, myelinated A-fibers.

Fentanyl can produce the following clinical effects strongly, through μ-receptor agonism:
* Supraspinal analgesia (μ1)
* Respiratory depression (μ2)
* Physical dependence
* Muscle rigidity

It also produces sedation and spinal analgesia through Κ-receptor agonism.

=== Therapeutic effects ===
* Pain relief: Primarily, fentanyl provides the relief of pain by acting on the brain and spinal μ-receptors.
* Sedation: Fentanyl produces sleep and drowsiness, as the dosage is increased, and can produce the δ-waves often seen in natural sleep on electroencephalogram.
* Suppression of the cough reflex: Fentanyl can decrease the struggle against an endotracheal tube and excessive coughing by decreasing the cough reflex, becoming useful when intubating people who are awake and have compromised airways. After receiving a bolus dose of fentanyl, people can also experience paradoxical coughing, which is a phenomenon that is not well understood.

=== Detection in biological fluids ===
Fentanyl may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. The Marquis Color test may also be used to detect the presence of fentanyl. Using formaldehyde and sulfuric acid, the solution will turn purple when introduced to opium drugs. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 μg/L in persons using the medication therapeutically, 1–10 μg/L in intoxicated people, and 3–300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Paper spray-mass spectrometry (PS-MS) may be useful for initial testing of samples.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detection for harm reduction purposes ===

Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues can be qualitatively detected in drug samples using commercially available fentanyl testing strips or spot reagents. Following the principles of harm reduction, this test is to be used directly on drug samples as opposed to urine. To prepare a sample for testing, approximately 10 mg of the drug, about the size of hair on Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s head on a penny, should be diluted into 1 teaspoon, or 5 mL, of water. Research in Dr. Lieberman&#x27;s lab at the University of Notre Dame has reported false positive results on BTNX fentanyl testing strips with methamphetamine, MDMA, and diphenhydramine. The sensitivity and specificity of fentanyl test strips vary depending on the concentration of fentanyl tested, particularly from 10 to 250 ng/mL.

== Synthesis ==
Fentanyl is a 4-anilopiperidine class synthetic opioid. The synthesis of Fentanyl is accomplished by one of four main methods as reported in the scientific literature: the Janssen, Siegfried, Gupta, or Suh method.

=== Janssen ===

The original synthesis as patented in 1964 by Paul Janssen involves the synthesis of benzylfentanyl from N-Benzyl-4-Piperidone. The resulting benzylfentanyl is used as feedstock to norfentanyl. It is norfentanyl that forms fentanyl upon reaction with phenethyl chloride.

=== Siegfried ===

The Siegfried method involves the initial synthesis of &quot;N&quot;-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP). This intermediate is reductively aminated to 4-anilino-&quot;N&quot;-phenethylpiperidine (4-ANPP). Fentanyl is produced following the reaction of 4-ANPP with an acyl chloride. The Siegfried method has been used in the early 2000s to manufacture fentanyl in both domestic and foreign clandestine laboratories.

=== Gupta ===

The Gupta (or &#x27;one-pot&#x27;) method starts from 4-Piperidone and skips the direct use of 4-ANPP/NPP; rather, the compounds are formed only as impurities or temporary intermediates. For the first half of 2021, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the Gupta method was the predominant synthesis route in their samples of seized fentanyl. In 2022, Braga and coworkers described a synthesis of fentanyl involving continuous flow that uses reagents similar to the ones described for the Gupta procedure.

=== Suh ===
The Suh (or &#x27;total synthesis&#x27;) method skips the direct use of piperidine precursors in favor of creating the ring system in-situ.

== History ==
Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul Janssen under the label of his relatively newly formed Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959. It was developed by screening chemicals similar to pethidine (Demerol) for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio). Fentanyl citrate entered medical use as a general anaesthetic in 1968, manufactured by McNeil Laboratories under the brand name Sublimaze.

In the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formulation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid over 48 to 72hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic fentanyl patches were introduced into medical practice.

Following the patch, a flavored lollipop of fentanyl citrate mixed with inert fillers was introduced in 1998 under the brand name Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain.

In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film), a fentanyl drug in a new dosage form for cancer pain management in opioid-tolerant subjects. It uses a medication delivery technology called BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive), a small dissolvable polymer film containing various fentanyl doses applied to the inner lining of the cheek.

Fentanyl has a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number (ACSCN) of 9801. Its annual aggregate manufacturing quota has significantly reduced in recent years from 2,300,000kg in 2015 and 2016 to only 731,452kg in 2021, a nearly 68.2% decrease.

== Society and culture ==

=== Legal status ===
In the UK, fentanyl is classified as a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

In the Netherlands, fentanyl is a List I substance of the Opium Law.

In the U.S., fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance per the Controlled Substance Act. Distributors of Abstral are required to implement an FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program. In order to curb misuse, many health insurers have begun to require precertification and/or quantity limits for Actiq prescriptions.

In Canada, fentanyl is considered a scheduleI drug as listed in Canada&#x27;s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

Estonia is known to have been home to the world&#x27;s longest documented fentanyl epidemic, especially following the Taliban ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.

A 2018 report by &quot;The Guardian&quot; indicated that many major drug suppliers on the dark web have voluntarily banned the trafficking of fentanyl.

The fentanyl epidemic has erupted in a highly acrimonious dispute between the U.S. and Mexican governments. While U.S. officials blame the flood of fentanyl crossing the border primarily on Mexican crime groups, then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador insisted that the main source of this synthetic drug is Asia. He stated that the crisis of a lack of family values in the United States drives people to use the drug.

=== Recreational use ===
Illicit use of pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues first appeared in the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. More than 12 different analogues of fentanyl, all unapproved and clandestinely produced, have been identified in the U.S. drug traffic. In February 2018, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration indicated that illicit fentanyl analogs have no medically valid use, and thus applied a &quot;Schedule I&quot; classification to them.

Fentanyl analogues may be hundreds of times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, which can lead to overdose. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Recreational use is not particularly widespread in the EU except for Tallinn, Estonia, where it has largely replaced heroin. Estonia has the highest rate of 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.

Fentanyl is sometimes sold on the black market in the form of transdermal fentanyl patches such as Duragesic, diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches is sometimes ingested or injected.

Another form of fentanyl that has appeared on the streets is the Actiq lollipop formulation. The pharmacy retail price ranges from US$15 to US$50 per unit based on the strength of the lozenge, with the black market cost ranging from US$5 to US$25, depending on the dose. The attorneys general of Connecticut and Pennsylvania have launched investigations into its diversion from the legitimate pharmaceutical market, including Cephalon&#x27;s &quot;sales and promotional practices for Provigil, Actiq and Gabitril.&quot;

Non-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opioid tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Like all opioids, the effects of fentanyl can be reversed with naloxone, or other opiate antagonists. Naloxone is increasingly available to the public. Long-acting or sustained-release opioids may require repeat dosage. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.

Some heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl often mixed with cocaine or heroin caused an outbreak of overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

=== Enforcement ===

Several large quantities of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In November2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a tablet press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China. A seizure of a record amount of fentanyl occurred on 2 February 2019, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Nogales, Arizona. The of fentanyl, which was estimated to be worth US$3.5M, was concealed in a compartment under a false floor of a truck transporting cucumbers. The &quot;China White&quot; form of fentanyl refers to any of a number of clandestinely produced analogues, especially α-methylfentanyl (AMF). One US Department of Justice publication lists &quot;China White&quot; as a synonym for a number of fentanyl analogues, including 3-methylfentanyl and α-methylfentanyl, which today are classified as Schedule I drugs in the United States. Part of the motivation for AMF is that, despite the extra difficulty from a synthetic standpoint, the resultant drug is more resistant to metabolic degradation. This results in a drug with an increased duration.

In June 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory to emergency departments alerting to 14 overdose deaths among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island associated with acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid analog of fentanyl that has never been licensed for medical use. In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of fentanyl overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.

Beginning in 2015, Canada has seen several fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspected that the drug was being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets. Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in the deaths of people from all walks of life—from homeless individuals to professionals—including teens and young parents. Because of the rising deaths across the country, especially in British Columbia where 1,716deaths were reported in 2020 and 1,782 from January to October2021, Health Canada is putting a rush on a review of the prescription-only status of naloxone in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug. In 2018, Global News reported allegations that diplomatic tensions between Canada and China hindered cooperation to seize imports, with Beijing being accused of inaction.

Fentanyl has been discovered for sale in illicit markets in Australia in 2017 and in New Zealand in 2018. In response, New Zealand experts called for wider availability of naloxone.

In May 2019, China regulated the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs and two fentanyl precursors. Nevertheless, it remains the principal origin of fentanyl in the United States: Mexican cartels source fentanyl precursors from Chinese suppliers such as Yuancheng Group, which are finished in Mexico and smuggled to the United States. Following the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, China halted cooperation with the United States on combatting drug trafficking.

India has also emerged as a source of fentanyl and fentanyl precursors, where Mexican cartels have already developed networks for the import of synthetic drugs. It is possible that fentanyl and precursor production may disperse to other countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Netherlands.

In 2020, the Myanmar military and police confiscated 990 gallons of &quot;methyl fentanyl&quot;, as well as precursors for the illicit synthesis of the drug. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Shan State of Myanmar has been identified as a major source for fentanyl derivatives. In 2021, the agency reported a further drop in opium poppy cultivation in Burma, as the region&#x27;s synthetic drug market continues to expand and diversify.

In 2023, a California police union director was charged with importing synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and tapentadol disguised as chocolate. U.S. law enforcement had been slow in their response to the fentanyl crisis, according to the Washington Post. The response by the federal government to the fentanyl crisis had also faltered, according to the press release. Overdose deaths by fentanyl and other illegally imported opioids were surging since 2019 and are presently a major cause of death in all U.S. states.

According to the national archives and the DEA, direct fentanyl shipments from China have stopped since 2022. The majority of illicit fentanyl and analogues now entering the U.S. from Mexico are final products in form of &quot;tablets&quot; and adulterated heroin from previously synthesized fentanyl. From the sophistication of full fentanyl synthesis and acute toxicity in laboratory environments, &#x27;clandestine&#x27; labs in Mexico relate to making an illicit dosage form from available fentanyl rather than the synthesis itself. Based on further research by investigators, fentanyl and analogues are likely synthesized in labs that have the appearance of a legal entity, or are diverted from pharmaceutical laboratories.

Recent investigations and convictions of members of the Sinaloa drug cartel by federal agencies made a clear connection between illegal arms trafficking from the U.S. to Mexico and the smuggling of fentanyl into the U.S. Mexico had repeatedly made official complaints since illegal guns are easily purchased for example in Arizona and as far north as Wisconsin and even Alaska, according to U.S. intelligence sources, and transported onto Mexican territory through a chain of American brokers and couriers often financed by those drug cartels that also engage in money laundering. Therefore, the lack of arms controls in the U.S. has directly contributed to the U.S. opioid overdose crisis.

=== Brand names ===
Brand names include Sublimaze, Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl, Abstral, Lazanda and others.

=== Economics ===
In the United States, the 800 mcg tablet was 6.75 times more expensive as of 2020 than the lozenge. As of 2023, the average cost for an injectable fentanyl solution (50 mcg/mL) is around US$17 for a supply of 20 milliliters, depending on the pharmacy. In a 2020 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology, a 100-microgram transdermal patch was valued from between AU$75 and AU$450 on illicit markets. Furthermore, in another 2020 study, the average price per gram of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl on various cryptomarkets was US$1,470.40 for offerings of less than five grams; the average for offers over five grams was US$139.50. In addition, on DreamMarket furanfentanyl (Fu-F), the most common analog on said market, the average price per gram was US$243.10 for retail listings and US$26.50 per gram for wholesale listings.

=== Storage and disposal ===
The fentanyl patch is one of a few medications that may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if misused by a child. Experts have advised that any unused fentanyl patches be kept in a secure location out of children&#x27;s sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.

In British Columbia, Canada, where there are environmental concerns about toilet flushing or garbage disposal, pharmacists recommend that unused patches be sealed in a child-proof container that is then returned to a pharmacy. In the United States where patches cannot always be returned through a medication take-back program, flushing is recommended for fentanyl patches, because it is the fastest and surest way to remove them from the home to prevent ingestion by children, pets or others not intended to use them.

=== Governmental usage ===
In August 2018, Nebraska became the first American state to use fentanyl to execute a prisoner. Carey Dean Moore, at the time one of the longest-serving death row inmates in the United States, was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Moore received a lethal injection, administered as an intravenous series of four drugs that included fentanyl citrate, to inhibit breathing and render the subject unconscious. The other drugs included diazepam as a tranquilizer, cisatracurium besylate as a muscle relaxant, and potassium chloride to stop the heart. The use of fentanyl in execution caused concern among death penalty experts because it was part of a previously untested drug cocktail. The execution was also protested by anti-death penalty advocates at the prison during the execution and later at the Nebraska State Capitol.

Russian Spetsnaz security forces are suspected to have used a fentanyl analogue, or derivative (suspected to be carfentanil and remifentanil), to rapidly incapacitate people in the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002. The siege was ended, but many hostages died from the gas after their health was severely taxed during the days long siege. The Russian Health Minister later stated that the gas was based on fentanyl, but the exact chemical agent has not been clearly identified.

=== Recalls ===
In February2004, a leading fentanyl supplier, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products recalled one lot, and later, additional lots of fentanyl (brand name: Duragesic) patches because of seal breaches that might have allowed the medication to leak from the patch. A series of classII recalls was initiated in March2004, and in February2008, the ALZA Corporation recalled their 25μg/h Duragesic patches due to a concern that small cuts in the gel reservoir could result in accidental exposure of patients or health care providers to the fentanyl gel. In April 2023, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA recalled 13 lots of their Fentanyl Buccal Tablets CII due to missing safety information sheets on how to properly administer their product. The corporation issued a consumer recall report and stressed the importance of safety in the use and administration of opioid therapeutics.

== Veterinary use ==
Fentanyl is commonly used for analgesia and as a component of balanced sedation and general anesthesia in small animal patients. In addition, its efficacy is higher than many other pure-opiate and synthetic pure-opioid agonists regarding vomiting, depth of sedation, and cardiovascular effects when given as a continuous infusion as well as a transdermal patch. As with other pure-opioid agonists, fentanyl has been associated with dysphoria in dogs.

Furthermore, transdermal fentanyl&#x27;s potency and short duration of action make it popular as an intra-operative and post-operative analgesic in cats and dogs. This is usually done with off-label fentanyl patches manufactured for humans with chronic pain. In 2012, a highly concentrated (50mg/mL) transdermal solution, brand name Recuvyra, has become commercially available for dogs only. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to provide four days of analgesia after a single application before surgery. It is not approved for multiple doses or other species. The drug is also approved in Europe.

<text>In abstract algebra, a magma, binar, or, rarely, groupoid is a basic kind of algebraic structure. Specifically, a magma consists of a set equipped with a single binary operation that must be closed by definition. No other properties are imposed.

== History and terminology ==
The term &quot;groupoid&quot; was introduced in 1927 by Heinrich Brandt describing his Brandt groupoid. The term was then appropriated by B. A. Hausmann and Øystein Ore (1937) in the sense (of a set with a binary operation) used in this article. In a couple of reviews of subsequent papers in Zentralblatt, Brandt strongly disagreed with this overloading of terminology. The Brandt groupoid is a groupoid in the sense used in category theory, but not in the sense used by Hausmann and Ore. Nevertheless, influential books in semigroup theory, including Clifford and Preston (1961) and Howie (1995) use groupoid in the sense of Hausmann and Ore. Hollings (2014) writes that the term &quot;groupoid&quot; is &quot;perhaps most often used in modern mathematics&quot; in the sense given to it in category theory.

According to Bergman and Hausknecht (1996): &quot;There is no generally accepted word for a set with a not necessarily associative binary operation. The word &quot;groupoid&quot; is used by many universal algebraists, but workers in category theory and related areas object strongly to this usage because they use the same word to mean &#x27;category in which all morphisms are invertible&#x27;. The term &quot;magma&quot; was used by Serre [Lie Algebras and Lie Groups, 1965].&quot; It also appears in Bourbaki&#x27;s .

== Definition ==

A magma is a set &quot;M&quot; matched with an operation • that sends any two elements to another element, . The symbol • is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation must satisfy the following requirement (known as the &quot;magma&quot; or closure property):
: For all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, the result of the operation is also in &quot;M&quot;.

And in mathematical notation:
: formula_1

If • is instead a partial operation, then is called a partial magma or, more often, a partial groupoid.

== Morphism of magmas ==

A morphism of magmas is a function that maps magma to magma that preserves the binary operation:
: &quot;f&quot; (&quot;x&quot; • &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;).

For example, with &quot;M&quot; equal to the positive real numbers and • as the geometric mean, &quot;N&quot; equal to the real number line, and ∗ as the arithmetic mean, a logarithm &quot;f&quot; is a morphism of the magma (&quot;M&quot;, •) to (&quot;N&quot;, ∗).
:proof: formula_2
Note that these commutative magmas are not associative; nor do they have an identity element. This morphism of magmas has been used in economics since 1863 when W. Stanley Jevons calculated the rate of inflation in 39 commodities in England in his &quot;A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold Ascertained&quot;, page 7.

== Notation and combinatorics ==

The magma operation may be applied repeatedly, and in the general, non-associative case, the order matters, which is notated with parentheses. Also, the operation • is often omitted and notated by juxtaposition:

A shorthand is often used to reduce the number of parentheses, in which the innermost operations and pairs of parentheses are omitted, being replaced just with juxtaposition: . For example, the above is abbreviated to the following expression, still containing parentheses:
A way to avoid completely the use of parentheses is prefix notation, in which the same expression would be written . Another way, familiar to programmers, is postfix notation (reverse Polish notation), in which the same expression would be written , in which the order of execution is simply left-to-right (no currying).

The set of all possible strings consisting of symbols denoting elements of the magma, and sets of balanced parentheses is called the Dyck language. The total number of different ways of writing applications of the magma operator is given by the Catalan number . Thus, for example, , which is just the statement that and are the only two ways of pairing three elements of a magma with two operations. Less trivially, : , , , , and .

There are magmas with elements, so there are 1, 1, 16, 19683, , ... magmas with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... elements. The corresponding numbers of non-isomorphic magmas are 1, 1, 10, 3330, , ... and the numbers of simultaneously non-isomorphic and non-antiisomorphic magmas are 1, 1, 7, 1734, , ... .

== Free magma ==

A free magma &quot;MX&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is the &quot;most general possible&quot; magma generated by &quot;X&quot; (i.e., there are no relations or axioms imposed on the generators; see free object). The binary operation on &quot;MX&quot; is formed by wrapping each of the two operands in parentheses and juxtaposing them in the same order. For example:
: 

&quot;MX&quot; can be described as the set of non-associative words on &quot;X&quot; with parentheses retained.

It can also be viewed, in terms familiar in computer science, as the magma of full binary trees with leaves labelled by elements of &quot;X&quot;. The operation is that of joining trees at the root.

A free magma has the universal property such that if is a function from &quot;X&quot; to any magma &quot;N&quot;, then there is a unique extension of &quot;f&quot; to a morphism of magmas 
: : &quot;MX&quot; → &quot;N&quot;.

== Types of magma ==

Magmas are not often studied as such; instead there are several different kinds of magma, depending on what axioms the operation is required to satisfy. Commonly studied types of magma include:
* Quasigroup: A magma where division is always possible.
** Loop: A quasigroup with an identity element.
* Semigroup: A magma where the operation is associative.
** Monoid: A semigroup with an identity element.
* Group: A magma with inverse, associativity, and an identity element.

Note that each of divisibility and invertibility imply the cancellation property.

; Magmas with commutativity:
* Commutative magma: A magma with commutativity.
* Commutative monoid: A monoid with commutativity.
* Abelian group: A group with commutativity.

== Classification by properties ==

A magma , with ∈ , is called

;Medial: If it satisfies the identity 
;Left semimedial: If it satisfies the identity 
;Right semimedial: If it satisfies the identity 
;Semimedial: If it is both left and right semimedial
;Left distributive: If it satisfies the identity 
;Right distributive: If it satisfies the identity 
;Autodistributive: If it is both left and right distributive
;Commutative: If it satisfies the identity 
;Idempotent: If it satisfies the identity 
;Unipotent: If it satisfies the identity 
;Zeropotent: If it satisfies the identities 
;Alternative: If it satisfies the identities and 
;Power-associative: If the submagma generated by any element is associative
;Flexible: if 
;Associative: If it satisfies the identity , called a semigroup
;A left unar: If it satisfies the identity 
;A right unar: If it satisfies the identity 
;Semigroup with zero multiplication, or null semigroup: If it satisfies the identity 
;Unital: If it has an identity element
;Left-cancellative: If, for all , relation implies 
;Right-cancellative: If, for all , relation implies 
;Cancellative: If it is both right-cancellative and left-cancellative
;A semigroup with left zeros: If it is a semigroup and it satisfies the identity 
;A semigroup with right zeros: If it is a semigroup and it satisfies the identity 
;Trimedial: If any triple of (not necessarily distinct) elements generates a medial submagma
;Entropic: If it is a homomorphic image of a medial cancellation magma.
;Central: If it satisfies the identity 

== Number of magmas satisfying given properties ==

== Category of magmas ==
The category of magmas, denoted Mag, is the category whose objects are magmas and whose morphisms are magma homomorphisms. The category Mag has direct products, and there is an inclusion functor: as trivial magmas, with operations given by projection .

An important property is that an injective endomorphism can be extended to an automorphism of a magma extension, just the colimit of the (constant sequence of the) endomorphism.

Because the singleton is the terminal object of Mag, and because Mag is algebraic, Mag is pointed and complete.
