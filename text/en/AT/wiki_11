<text>Black Diamond is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 4,697 at the 2020 census. In 2023, with a 40.6% growth rate, Black Diamond was the fastest growing small city in King County.

==History==
===Founding===
Black Diamond was originally inhabited by the Bəqəlšuł, which is Lushootseed for &quot;from a high point from which you can see&quot;, part of Coast Salish people. The area was home to a grill trap and smokehouse, and the tribe fished from Lake Sawyer.

Black Diamond was officially incorporated on February 19, 1959. The town&#x27;s late 20th century population growth has been mostly as a commuter community for people with jobs in Seattle, Bellevue, and suburban centers within the Seattle Metropolitan Area.

===Coal mining===
Beginning in the 1880s Black Diamond was a rural coal mining area, developed by the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company of California, which owned and operated the mine. The original residents were largely composed of former workers, from the company&#x27;s previous coal mining operation in Nortonville, California, which primarily sold coal to the thriving new metropolis of San Francisco. A combination of low quality coal from the Nortonville mines, water intrusion into the workings there, and the discovery and economical transport of higher-quality Washington coal to San Francisco spelled the demise of Nortonville in the early 1880s. The town was home to around 3,500 people by the early 1900s, many of them European immigrants; most of the working men were involved in producing coal. This coal was transported to Seattle via the Pacific Coast Coal train. Before 1911, the miners were affiliated with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), but by March 1911 had left en masse to join the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

After World War I, the town shut down the mine as it was no longer viable. A second mining boom spurred growth in the town in the early 1930s on the strength of multiple mining operations promoted by the Morris brothers through the Palmer Coking Coal Company. Mining has continued until recently through the Pacific Coast Coal Company, formerly of San Francisco.

The main building of the Black Diamond Historical Museum is the former train station, which served the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad 1884–1916 and the Pacific Coast Railway 1916–1951. Regular passenger service ended in 1925, but a train still brought men to the mine until 1931, and trains continued to haul coal and freight into the 1940s.

===Planned growth via master planned developments (MPDs)===
In the 1990&#x27;s, the first Black Diamond city planner (Jason Paulsen), seized an opportunity to create a comprehensive development plan for the City of Black Diamond that when completed, would fundamentally change what and how the City of Black Diamond would evolve into — the first set of plans being the Growth Management Act (GMA) Comprehensive Plan, which included the concept of Master Planned Developments (MPDs).

In 2008 were purchased for the first MPD. In 2010 the first MPDs applications were filed with the City of Black Diamond.

====Legal action against first MPDs====
From 2010 through 2018 legal battles were fought delaying development of the first MPDs:

* In 2010 Toward Responsible Development filed a land use petition (LUPA) against the first two MPDs. 
* In 2012 King County Superior Court denied the LUPA Toward Responsible Development filed with the Court of Appeals. 
* In 2014 appeals Court Commissioner Masako Kanazawa ordered Toward Responsible Development to pay a total of $162,798, for attorney fees and costs, to YarrowBay and the City of Black Diamond. 
* In 2016 Oakpointe (formerly YarrowBay) sued three City of Black Diamond Council members who opposed the MPDs. 
* In 2017 Black Diamond council files suit against the mayor. 
* In 2018 Black Diamond / Oakpointe settle lawsuit.

====First MPDs====
The first two MPDs comprised 6,050 single and multi-family residences, 1.1 million square feet of commercial/office/retail space and were estimated to 15,000 new residents to the City of Black Diamond; which would increase the population of the city by 3.6 times its size at the time (2010 population estimate of 4,151).

In December 2013 development started on the first MPD; known as Ten Trails. In 2019 the first family moves into Ten Trails.

In 2021, with a 21% growth rate, Black Diamond was the fastest growing small city in King County.

In March 2022, 845 households were occupied in Ten Trails (722 residential homes, 76 apartment units, and 47 rental homes).

Using King County&#x27;s 2020 Person&#x27;s per household rate of 2.43, 845 households being occupied in Ten Trails in March 2022, the estimated population of Black Diamond in 2022 being 6,336, concludes the estimated population living in Ten Trails in March 2022 being 2,053 (845 * 2.43); which roughly equates to 79% ( 2,053 / 6,336) of the population of Black Diamond living in the first MPD (Ten Trails) during March 2022.

<text>Bryn Mawr-Skyway (pronounced from Welsh for &quot;big hill&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 17,397 at the 2020 census.

Bryn Mawr-Skyway was the only CDP in the Seattle metropolitan area to have reported a majority-minority population in the 2000 census. Since that time, the area has grown even more diverse. As of the 2010 census, the demographic composition of the Skyway area is almost evenly distributed between White, Black or African American, and Asian community members.

==Geography==
Skyway lies in an &quot;unincorporated island&quot; bordered to the north by the city of Seattle, to the west by Tukwila, and to the south and east by Renton. The neighborhood was mostly developed just after World War II as affordable housing for returning veterans. The area remains an affordable area close to the high employment areas of Renton and Seattle. The name &quot;Skyway&quot; may be derived from the area&#x27;s siting on a high ridge in western Washington&#x27;s hilly terrain, a name that echoes the Welsh &quot;Bryn Mawr&quot; (also the name used for a village and several other places), which means &quot;big hill&quot;.

Skyway&#x27;s main business districts lie along Renton Avenue South, with one center between 68th Avenue South and 74th Avenue South, including a small casino, bowling alley, and a grocery outlet, and another district between 75th Avenue South and 78th Avenue South, including a bank branch, the fire station, multiple churches, a 7-11, some auto shops, and the public library (a branch of the King County Library System). There is also a small business district centered at Martin Luther King Way South (State Route 900) around South 129th Street. Skyway Park, with baseball fields, a creek and wetlands, and picnic areas, is located near the center of Skyway.

The Bryn Mawr-Skyway CDP is made up of many neighborhoods, including Lakeridge, Campbell Hill and Earlington, in addition to the neighborhoods of Skyway and Bryn Mawr. The community is sometimes called &quot;West Hill&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.73%, are water.

<doc id="137982" wikidata="Q984825" url="?curid=137982" title="Burien, Washington">
<text>Burien ( ) is a suburban city in King County, Washington, United States, located south of Seattle on Puget Sound. As of the 2020 census, Burien&#x27;s population was 52,066, which is a 56.3% increase since incorporation in 1993, making it the 25th most populous city in Washington. An annexation in 2010 increased the city&#x27;s population significantly.

==History==
European settlement in the Burien area dates to 1864, when George Ouellet (1831–1899), a French-Canadian born in Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce, Quebec, purchased his first of several land patents for homestead sites directly from a federal land office. Ouellet had first arrived in the Washington Territory at Port Madison on Bainbridge Island, off the Kitsap Peninsula, in 1858. Three years after purchasing his homestead in the Burien area, he married 14-year-old Elizabeth Cushner, who was born in the Washington Territory, and started a family. Several years later, the Ouellet family moved to the White River Valley, near Auburn.

A popular local tale recounts that an early settler named Mike Kelly gave the community its first name after he emerged from the trees and said, &quot;This is truly a sunny dale.&quot; Today, a few long-time residents still refer to the Burien area as Sunnydale.

In 1884, Gottlieb Burian (1837–1902) and his wife Emma (Wurm) Burian (1840–1905), German immigrants from Hussinetz, Lower Silesia, who owned two taverns in downtown Seattle, arrived in Sunnydale. The tiny community was without improved roads or commercial buildings and was reached primarily by trails. Burian built a cabin on the southeast corner of Lake Burien and reportedly formed the community into a town bearing his name (misspelled over the years). A real estate office was built and soon attracted large numbers of new residents to Burien.

In the early 1900s, visitors from Seattle came by the Mosquito Fleet to Three Tree Point, just west of town, to sunbathe and swim.

In 1915, the Lake Burien Railway was completed. It ran on what is today Ambaum Boulevard from Burien to White Center to Seattle. A small passenger train ran the tracks and was affectionately named by the residents the Toonerville Trolley.

===Incorporation===

Several proposals to incorporate the greater Burien area, an unincorporated portion of King County, were attempted but failed. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, citizens felt they needed a more responsive government to help address the looming threat of the Port of Seattle&#x27;s airport runway expansion (known as the &quot;Third Runway&quot;) at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to the east, so an effort was again made to incorporate as a city. Citizens also felt that multi-family apartments and dwellings had proliferated out of control in Burien and other unincorporated areas of King County, and that they had no local voice in government, other than the King County Council, that would hear their concerns.

The city of Burien was incorporated on February 28, 1993, after voter approval.

===North Highline annexation===

Late in 2004, the city assessed the possibility of annexing North Highline (which includes White Center and Boulevard Park), &quot;one of the largest urban unincorporated areas of King County,&quot; which would double the size of Burien. Many citizens spoke against the annexation and created picket signs and petitions to protest against it. Other citizens welcomed the expansion, as they felt parts of the so-called North Highline area should have been part of the original Burien incorporation, and the area in question is part of the larger Highline area. (The Highline area includes the cities of Burien, Seatac, Des Moines, Federal Way and an unincorporated area called North Highline.)

In May 2008, the Burien City Council proposed an annexation of the southern portion of North Highline, comprising 14,000 residents. In late summer of 2008, the city of Burien prepared to submit their annexation proposal to King County&#x27;s Boundary Review Board. However, after the city of Seattle protested Burien&#x27;s proposal, Burien opted to withdraw their annexation plan and resubmit it after new countywide planning policies went into effect.

In October 2008, the Burien City Council voted to resubmit their annexation plan to the county Boundary Review Board. However, the cities of Burien and Seattle, along with King County and other stakeholders, first participated and completed mediation to ensure the interests of all parties involved were met. Affected stakeholders would have agreed to a preliminary annexation framework that stipulated how annexation would play out between the cities of Burien and Seattle and with King County. However, the Seattle City Council voted against the agreement that February. It is not known if Seattle has any future plans for annexation of any part of the North Highline area.

On April 16, 2009, the Boundary Review Board of King County approved Burien&#x27;s proposal for annexation of the southern portion of the North Highline area: parts of the Riverton-Boulevard Park CDP.

In early May 2009, both King County and the city of Burien passed resolutions to place an annexation proposition on the August 18 primary ballot. The annexation area voted on consisted of southern North Highline and had an area of about and approximately 14,000 citizens. The ballot issue was approved by a majority of southern North Highline residents, and on April 1, 2010, southern North Highline became part of Burien.

After the annexation vote, a special census was conducted, and it was determined that the newly annexed area had 14,292 residents. This resulted in a new population total of 52,066, making Burien the 25th largest city in Washington State.

The Boundary Review Board approved a second proposal for Burien to annex northern North Highline (also known as Area Y) in February 2012, but this was rejected by Area Y residents in November 2012.

===Downtown development===
In 2017, the Town Square development in downtown Burien was completed. It includes retail space, condominiums, rental apartments, a senior living center, and a King County Library branch with underground parking. City Hall is located on the top floor of the library building. Town Square Park is at the center of the square and features a spray park for children and a rain garden.

<text>Carnation () is a city in King County, Washington, United States. It was historically known as Tolt and lies at the confluence of the Snoqualmie and Tolt rivers.

The city is located east of Redmond and south of Duvall on State Route 203. The population was 2,158 at the 2020 census. Prior to American settlement, the area was occupied by a large village of the Snoqualmie. It was the center of Snoqualmie society in the 19th century. After the removal of the Snoqualmie to reservations, the city was resettled by Americans, who founded the city of Tolt in 1865. It became a thriving dairy town in the 20th century, eventually being renamed to Carnation in honor of the Carnation Evaporated Milk Company. After being renamed again back and forth twice, the name Carnation stuck. In the 1990s, the city became a bedroom community for the Eastside of Seattle.

==History==

=== Snoqualmie settlement ===
The Snoqualmie people have inhabited the Carnation area for more than 10,000 years. Prior to American settlement, the Snoqualmie had a large village spanning the Tolt River () at its confluence with the Snoqualmie. This village was highly important as it was the second-largest village in the Snoqualmie river valley. The village also had the best natural defenses in the Snoqualmie river valley.

The most important building in the village was the (lit. &quot;marked house&quot;). The was a giant longhouse which served as a sort of capitol building, where council was held by both local elders and visiting leaders. It also was an education center for all the people living in the Snoqualmie valley. Elders taught valuable skills and knowledge, such as Snoqualmie language, customs, and laws.

In the 19th century, the prominent Snoqualmie leader Patkanim () was born in this village. At this time, Snoqualmie society began to centralize into a chiefdom. During the colonial period, the village served as the de facto capital of the Snoqualmie chiefdom under Patkanim.

=== American settlement ===
The Snoqualmie Valley was resettled by Americans in the 1850s and 1860s following the signing of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot and the relocation of many of the Snoqualmie people to reservations like Tulalip. The community of Tolt was founded in 1865 and platted in 1902. The name of the community was derived from an Anglicization of the Lushootseed name for the Tolt River and the Snoqualmie village (variously spelled as , , or in Lushootseed). Tolt was incorporated as a town on December 30, 1912, shortly after the arrival of the Milwaukee Road, which provided train connections to Monroe in the north.

The valley was home to several dairy farms established in the 1900s, including a research farm for the Carnation Evaporated Milk Company. Following lobbying from the company and the approval of the state legislature, Tolt was renamed to &quot;Carnation&quot; in 1917. The renaming of the town was opposed by local residents and members of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, and later changed back to Tolt on May 3, 1928. The &quot;Carnation&quot; name remained on the post office and train depot, and continued to be used by outsiders. Tolt was then renamed back to &quot;Carnation&quot; on October 29, 1951. During the late 20th century, Carnation moved away from dairy farming and became a community for job centers in the Eastside, growing to a population of 2,158 by 2020.

A significant number of Fairwood workers are in professional, management and sales jobs (70%).

== Politics ==
On the national level, Cascade-Fairwood leans towards candidates of the Democratic Party. Democrat John Kerry received about 56 percent of the vote in 2004 to Republican George W. Bush&#x27;s 43 percent. Despite this, there are a number of pockets where the Republican Party often wins marginal majorities.

The Cascade area (approximately a population of 17,000), which included much of unincorporated Benson Hill north of SE 200 Street and west of 128th Avenue SE, voted to be annexed by the city of Renton in 2007, effective March 1, 2008. The remaining unincorporated area of King County, which is primarily the Fairwood community, has the option of annexing to the city of Renton or incorporating as a city.

In February 2005, the Fairwood Task Force filed a Notice of Intent to Incorporation with King County, to establish a new City of Fairwood. This attempt to incorporate was narrowly defeated in the election held on September 19, 2006. In that election, 48.22% of the votes were for incorporation; a swing of only 136 votes in the election would have changed the result.

The process to form a City of Fairwood was restarted by the Fairwood Municipal Initiative when it filed another Notice of Proposed Incorporation with King County, Washington on April 16, 2007. As of October 2008, the incorporation effort is now under the jurisdiction of the King County Boundary Review Board (BRB) and a consulting firm hired by the BRB is conducting an economic feasibility study for the proposed city of Fairwood.

On November 3, 2009, Proposition 1 to incorporate a city of Fairwood failed again, as it did in 2006.

Efforts are also ongoing to annex the Fairwood area into the city of Renton. Additionally, the Red Mill area of the Fairwood PAA is presently undertaking a separate petition-method annexation.

On November 2, 2010, 57.6% of voters voted against a proposition to annex Fairwood to Renton.

<text>Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (born Rudolph George Prpić; June 27, 1928 September 21, 1995) was an American politician who served as the governor of Minnesota from 1976 to 1979 and again from 1983 to 1991. A member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he is labeled as Minnesota&#x27;s 34th and 36th governor. As of 2025, he is the only governor elected to serve non-consecutive terms in the history of Minnesota.

== Early life and education ==
Rudolph George Prpić was born in Carson Lake, Minnesota, which is now part of Hibbing. His father, Anton Prpić, was a miner who had immigrated to Minnesota&#x27;s Mesabi Iron Range from Croatia, and his mother, Mary (Vukelich), was an American of Croatian descent. Perpich did not learn to speak English until at least the first grade of elementary school. At 14, he began working for the Great Northern Railway. He graduated from Hibbing High School in 1946 and served two years in the United States Army. He then attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and graduated from Marquette University Dental School in 1954, and returned to Hibbing to practice dentistry.

== Entry into politics ==
Perpich first entered politics by serving on the Hibbing school board in 1955–1956. The board gained notability for instituting equal pay for male and female workers. In 1962, he was elected to the Minnesota Senate, representing the old 63rd District, which included portions of Saint Louis County in the northeastern part of the state. He was reelected in 1966.

In 1970, Perpich was elected the 39th lieutenant governor of Minnesota. He was reelected in 1974 on a ticket with Governor Wendell R. Anderson. (Before 1974, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately in Minnesota.) He became governor when Anderson resigned in 1976 to accept appointment to the United States Senate seat vacated by Walter Mondale, who had been elected Vice President of the United States. Perpich was the first Iron Range resident to hold the office.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
Most of the statewide DFL Party ticket was defeated in 1978; the defeated candidates included Perpich, the candidates for both U.S. Senate seats, and Auditor Robert Mattson. Anderson&#x27;s arrangement to have himself appointed to the Senate and Perpich&#x27;s role in that appointment were deemed major factors in those defeats.

Perpich worked at Control Data Corporation in New York and Austria for several years. In 1982, he challenged the DFL Party&#x27;s endorsed candidate for governor, Warren Spannaus, in the primary election, and won. He then defeated Independent-Republican nominee Wheelock Whitney in the general election. Upon his victory, he became the state&#x27;s first Roman Catholic governor. As of 2025, he remains the only Catholic elected governor of Minnesota. Perpich served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association in 1984.

Perpich was reelected in 1986, but lost to Arne Carlson in 1990, a bizarre campaign in which Carlson replaced the Independent-Republican Party&#x27;s candidate Jon Grunseth, who had beaten Carlson in the primary. (After Carlson&#x27;s surprise primary defeat, a bipartisan, grassroots group, Minnesotans for the WRITE Choice, launched a noisy, media-intensive campaign urging Carlson to re-challenge Grunseth.) Grunseth was forced to withdraw amid allegations of a sex scandal just two weeks before the election. Perpich was Minnesota&#x27;s last DFL governor until Mark Dayton took office in 2011.

==Colorful behavior and international goals==
Perpich had a reputation for colorful behavior. At one point while governor, he donated his $25,000 pay raise to help promote bocce. He also pitched an idea for a chopstick factory to be built in northern Minnesota, and proposed selling the governor&#x27;s mansion in Saint Paul as a cost-saving measure.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; brought Perpich national attention by bestowing on him the nickname &quot;Governor Goofy&quot;, crystallizing the combination of affection and resentment his habits elicited. During his last years in office, commentators wondered whether he would shoot to stardom as a presidential hopeful or, as governor, sour Minnesota voters on the DFL party with questionable public relations. But Perpich&#x27;s activist vision of the governor&#x27;s role was later cited as an important contribution to the Minnesota economy, even by such unlikely admirers as his 1990 rival and successor Arne Carlson, who said in 2005 that Perpich &quot;was the first person that I was aware of to focus on the international role that states are going to have to play.&quot;

Perpich&#x27;s legacy of projects in Minnesota include the Minnesota World Trade Center in Saint Paul, the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley, the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota Duluth Natural Resources Research Institute, and the Mall of America in Bloomington. Additionally, he worked to promote Minnesota on the international stage by traveling to 17 countries in 1984, and bringing the foreign leaders Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Dr. Franjo Tuđman of Croatia to the state in 1990.

Perpich opposed the Reagan proxy war against Nicaragua in the 1980s and was one of several governors who objected to sending their National Guard units to train in U.S. bases in Honduras, where the U.S.-backed Contras were based. The Contras carried out atrocities in Nicaragua to topple the leftist government there. Perpich was the plaintiff in the 1990 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Perpich v. Department of Defense,&quot; which established that the U.S. Department of Defense could send state National Guard units overseas over the governor&#x27;s objection.

== Post-political life ==
After leaving office in 1991, Perpich went to Zagreb, Croatia, to assist its post-communist government. In 1992 he moved to Paris, France, for a business consulting position. He returned to Minnesota in 1993. In 1995, at the age of 67, Perpich died of colon cancer in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

<text>Harm reduction, or harm minimization, refers to a range of intentional practices and public health policies designed to lessen the negative social and/or physical consequences associated with various human behaviors, both legal and illegal. Harm reduction is used to decrease negative consequences of recreational drug use and sexual activity without requiring abstinence, recognizing that those unable or unwilling to stop can still make positive change to protect themselves and others.

Harm reduction is most commonly applied to approaches that reduce adverse consequences from drug use, and harm reduction programs now operate across a range of services and in different regions of the world. As of 2020, some 86 countries had one or more programs using a harm reduction approach to substance use, primarily aimed at reducing blood-borne infections resulting from use of contaminated injecting equipment.

Needle-exchange programmes reduce the likelihood of people who use heroin and other substances sharing the syringes and using them more than once. Syringe-sharing often leads to the spread of infections such as HIV or hepatitis C, which can easily spread from person to person through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. Needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. Supervised injection sites are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to provide a safe, hygienic, and stress-free environment for people who use substances. The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about substances and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff.

Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is the medical procedure of using a harm-reducing opioid that produces significantly less euphoria, such as methadone or buprenorphine to reduce opioid cravings in people who use illegal opioids, such as heroin; buprenorphine and methadone are taken under medical supervision. Another approach is heroin assisted treatment, in which medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) are provided to people who are dependent on heroin.

Media campaigns inform drivers of the dangers of driving drunk. Most people who recreationally consume alcohol are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like &#x27;designated drivers&#x27; and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving crashes. Many schools now provide safer sex education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like condoms and dental dams to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of STIs. Since 1999, some countries have legalized or decriminalized prostitution, such as Germany (2002) and New Zealand (2003).

Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in people who inject substances and sex-workers. HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus.
==Substance use==

In the case of recreational substance use, harm reduction is put forward as a useful perspective alongside the more conventional approaches of demand and supply reduction. Many advocates argue that prohibitionist laws criminalise people for suffering from a disease and cause harm for example, by obliging people who use substances to obtain substances of unknown purity from unreliable criminal sources at high prices, thereby increasing the risk of overdose and death. The web forum Bluelight allows users to share information and first-hand experience reports about various psychoactive substances and harm reduction practices. The website Erowid collects and publishes information and first-hand experience reports about all kinds of substances to educate people who use or may use substances.

While the vast majority of harm reduction initiatives are educational campaigns or facilities that aim to reduce substance-related harm, a unique social enterprise was launched in Denmark in September 2013 to reduce the financial burden of illicit substance use for people with a drug dependence. Michael Lodberg Olsen, who was previously involved with the establishment of a substance consumption facility in Denmark, announced the founding of the &quot;Illegal&quot; magazine that will be sold by people who use substances in Copenhagen and the district of Vesterbro, who will be able to direct the profits from sales towards drug procurement. Olsen explained: &quot;No one has solved the problem of drug addiction, so is it not better that people find the money to buy their drugs this way than through crime and prostitution?&quot;

===Substances===

====Depressants====

=====Alcohol=====

Traditionally, homeless shelters ban alcohol. In 1997, as the result of an inquest into the deaths of two people experiencing homelessness who recreationally used alcohol two years earlier, Toronto&#x27;s Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a &quot;wet shelter&quot; on a &quot;managed alcohol&quot; principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, people experiencing homelessness who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities, and a study of Ottawa&#x27;s &quot;wet shelter&quot; found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half. The study, published in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; in 2006, found that serving people experiencing long-term homelessness and who consume excessive amounts of alcohol controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to emergency rooms dropped from 13.5 to an average of 8 per month, while encounters with the police fall from 18.1 to an average of 8.8.

Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC), in Seattle, Washington, operates several Housing First programmes which utilize the harm reduction model. University of Washington researchers, partnering with DESC, found that providing housing and support services for homeless alcoholics costs taxpayers less than leaving them on the street, where taxpayer money goes towards police and emergency health care. Results of the study funded by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program (SAPRP) of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation appeared in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in April 2009. This first controlled assessment in the U.S. of the effectiveness of Housing First, specifically targeting chronically homeless alcoholics, showed that the programme saved taxpayers more than $4 million over the first year of operation. During the first six months, the study reported an average cost-savings of 53 percent (even after considering the cost of administering the housing&#x27;s 95 residents)—nearly $2,500 per month per person in health and social services, compared to the per month costs of a wait-list control group of 39 homeless people. Further, despite the fact residents are not required to be abstinent or in treatment for alcohol use, stable housing also results in reduced drinking among people experiencing homelessness who recreationally use alcohol.

======Alcohol-related programmes======
A high amount of media coverage exists informing people of the dangers of driving drunk. Most people who recreationally consume alcohol are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like &#x27;designated drivers&#x27; and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving crashes. Many cities have free-ride-home programmes during holidays involving high amounts of alcohol use, and some bars and clubs will provide a visibly drunk patron with a free cab ride.

In New South Wales groups of licensees have formed local liquor accords and collectively developed, implemented and promoted a range of harm minimisation programmes including the aforementioned &#x27;designated driver&#x27; and &#x27;late night patron transport&#x27; schemes. Many of the transport schemes are free of charge to patrons, to encourage them to avoid drink-driving and at the same time reduce the impact of noisy patrons loitering around late night venues.

Moderation Management is a programme which helps drinkers to cut back on their consumption of alcohol by encouraging safe drinking behaviour.

Harm reduction in alcohol dependency could be instituted by use of naltrexone.

=====Opioids=====

======Heroin maintenance programmes (HAT)======

Providing medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) to heroin-dependent people has been employed in some countries to address problems associated with the illicit use of the drug, as potential benefits exist for the individual and broader society. Evidence has indicated that this form of treatment can greatly improve the health and social circumstances of participants, while also reducing costs incurred by criminalisation, incarceration and health interventions.

In Switzerland, heroin assisted treatment is an established programme of the national health system. Several dozen centres exist throughout the country and heroin-dependent people can administer heroin in a controlled environment at these locations. The Swiss heroin maintenance programme is generally regarded as a successful and valuable component of the country&#x27;s overall approach to minimising the harms caused by illicit drug use. In a 2008 national referendum, a majority of 68 per cent voted in favour of continuing the Swiss programme.

The Netherlands has studied medically supervised heroin maintenance. A German study of long-term heroin addicts demonstrated that diamorphine was significantly more effective than methadone in keeping patients in treatment and in improving their health and social situation. Many participants were able to find employment, some even started a family after years of homelessness and delinquency. Since then, treatment had continued in the cities that participated in the pilot study, until heroin maintenance was permanently included into the national health system in May 2009. As of 2021, the country offers heroin-assisted treatment by prescribing medical-grade heroin is typically prescribed in combination with methadone and psychosocial counseling.

A heroin maintenance programme has existed in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1920s, as drug addiction was seen as an individual health problem. Addiction to opiates was rare in the 1920s and was mostly limited to either middle-class people who had easy access due to their profession, or people who had become addicted as a side effect of medical treatment. In the 1950s and 1960s a small number of doctors contributed to an alarming increase in the number of people who are experiencing addiction in the U.K. through excessive prescribing—the U.K. switched to more restrictive drug legislation as a result. However, the British government is again moving towards a consideration of heroin prescription as a legitimate component of the National Health Service (NHS). Evidence has shown that methadone maintenance is not appropriate for all people who are dependent on opioids and that heroin is a viable maintenance drug that has shown equal or better rates of success.

A committee appointed by the Norwegian government completed an evaluation of research reports on heroin maintenance treatment that were available internationally. In 2011 the committee concluded that the presence of numerous uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the effects of heroin treatment meant that it could not recommend the introduction of heroin maintenance treatment in Norway.

Critics of heroin maintenance programmes object to the high costs of providing heroin to people who use it. The British heroin study cost the British government £15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average person who uses heroin&#x27;s expense of £15,600 per year. Drug Free Australia contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden&#x27;s investment in, and commitment to, a drug-free society where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of people who are experiencing drug addiction is integral, which has yielded to one of the lowest reported illicit drug use levels in the developed world, a model in which successfully rehabilitated people who use substances present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs.

King&#x27;s Health Partners notes that the cost of providing free heroin for a year is about one-third of the cost of placing the person in prison for a year.

======Naloxone distribution======
Naloxone is a drug used to counter an overdose from the effect of opioids; for example, a heroin or morphine overdose. Naloxone displaces the opioid molecules from the brain&#x27;s receptors and reverses the respiratory depression caused by an overdose within two to eight minutes. The World Health Organization (WHO) includes naloxone on their &quot;List of Essential Medicines&quot;, and recommends its availability and utilization for the reversal of opioid overdoses.

Formal programs in which the opioid inverse agonist drug naloxone is distributed have been trialled and implemented. Established programs distribute naloxone, as per WHO&#x27;s minimum standards, to people who use substances and their peers, family members, police, prisons, and others. These treatment programs and harm reduction centres operate in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, Spain, Tajikistan, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Vietnam, India, Thailand, Kyrgyzstan, Denmark and Estonia. Many reviews of the literature support the effectiveness of naloxone based interventions in reducing overdose deaths where it is available at the time of the overdose event. This effectiveness has been explained in a Realist Evaluation which explained the effectiveness through bystander effect, social identity theory, and skills training such that universal access to training supports social identity and in-group norms (of people who use drugs), which supports the conditions for the success of a peer-to-peer distribution model of naloxone-based interventions. Stigma and stigmatising attitudes reduced the effectiveness of naloxone based interventions.

====== Medication assisted treatment (MAT): Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and Opioid substitution therapy (OST) ======
Medication assisted treatment (MAT) is the prescription of legal, prescribed opioids or other drugs, often long-acting, to diminish the use of illegal opioids. Many types of MAT exist, including opioid agonist therapy (OAT) where a safer opioid agonist is employed or opioid substitution therapy (OST) which employs partial opioid agonists. However, MAT, OAT, OST are often used synonymously.

Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) involves the use of a full opioid agonist treatment like methadone and is generally taken daily at a clinic. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) involves the use of the partial agonist buprenorphine or a combination of buprenorphine/naloxone (brand name Suboxone). Oral/sublingual formulations of buprenorphine incorporate the opioid antagonist naloxone to prevent people from crushing the tablets and injecting them. Unlike methadone treatment, buprenorphine therapy can be prescribed month-to-month and obtained at a traditional pharmacy rather than a clinic.

The driving principle behind OAT/OST is the program&#x27;s capacity to facilitate a resumption of stability in the person&#x27;s life, while they experience reduced symptoms of withdrawal symptoms and less intense drug cravings; however, a strong euphoric effect is not experienced as a result of the treatment drug.

In some countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, patients are treated with slow-release morphine when methadone is deemed inappropriate due to the individual&#x27;s circumstances. In Germany, dihydrocodeine has been used off-label in OAT for many years, however it is no longer frequently prescribed for this purpose. Extended-release dihydrocodeine is again in current use in Austria for this reason. Research into the usefulness of piritramide, extended-release hydromorphone (including polymer implants lasting up to 90 days), dihydroetorphine and other substances for OAT is at various stages in a number of countries. In 2020 in Vancouver, Canada, health authorities began vending machine dispensing of hydromorphone tablets as a response to elevated rates of fatal overdose from street drugs contaminated with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.

In some countries (not the US, UK, Canada, or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time period for people on OAT/OST programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (Patients with HIV/AIDS or hepatitis C are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40–65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid agonist therapy, and 70–95% are able to reduce their use significantly, while experiencing a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illicit opioids.

OAT/OST outlets in some settings also offer basic primary health care. These are known as &#x27;targeted primary health care outlet&#x27;—as these outlets primarily target people who inject drugs and/or &#x27;low-threshold health care outlet&#x27;—as these reduce common barriers clients often face when they try to access health care from the conventional health care outlets. For accessing sterile injecting equipment clients frequently visit NSP outlets, and for receiving pharmacotherapy (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) they visit OST clinics; these frequent visits are used opportunistically to offer much needed health care. These targeted outlets have the potential to mitigate clients&#x27; perceived barriers to access to healthcare delivered in traditional settings. The provision of accessible, acceptable and opportunistic services which are responsive to the needs of this population is valuable, facilitating a reduced reliance on inappropriate and cost-ineffective emergency department care.

=====Cannabis=====
Specific harms associated with cannabis include increased crash-rate while driving under intoxication, dependence, psychosis, detrimental psychosocial outcomes for adolescents who use substances, and respiratory disease. Some safer cannabis usage campaigns including the UKCIA (United Kingdom Cannabis Internet Activists) encourage methods of consumption shown to cause less physical damage to a person&#x27;s body, including oral (eating) consumption, vaporization, the usage of bongs which cool and to some extent filters the smoke, and smoking the cannabis without mixing it with tobacco.

The fact that cannabis possession carries prison sentences in most developed countries is also pointed out as a problem by European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), as the consequences of a conviction for otherwise law-abiding people who use substances arguably is more harmful than any harm from the substance itself. For example, by adversely affecting employment opportunities, impacting civil rights, and straining personal relationships. Some people like Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance have suggested that organized marijuana legalization would encourage safe use and reveal the factual adverse effects from exposure to this herb&#x27;s individual chemicals.

The way the laws concerning cannabis are enforced is also very selective, even discriminatory. Statistics show that the socially disadvantaged, immigrants and ethnic minorities have significantly higher arrest rates. Drug decriminalisation, such as allowing the possession of small amounts of cannabis and possibly its cultivation for personal use, would alleviate these harms. Where decriminalisation has been implemented, such as in several states in Australia and United States, as well as in Portugal and the Netherlands no, or only very small adverse effects have been shown on population cannabis usage rate. The lack of evidence of increased use indicates that such a policy shift does not have adverse effects on cannabis-related harm while, at the same time, decreasing enforcement costs.

In the last few years certain strains of the cannabis plant with higher concentrations of THC and drug tourism have challenged the former policy in the Netherlands and led to a more restrictive approach; for example, a ban on selling cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops suggested to start late 2011. Sale and possession of cannabis is still illegal in Portugal and possession of cannabis is a federal crime in the United States.

==== Psychedelics ====
The Zendo Project conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies uses principles from psychedelic therapy to provide safe places and emotional support for people having difficult experiences on psychedelic drugs at select festivals such as Burning Man, Boom Festival, and Lightning in a Bottle without medical or law enforcement intervention.

====Stimulants====
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime states, &quot;While medical models of treatment for individuals with alcohol or opioid use disorders are well accepted and implemented worldwide, in most countries there is no parallel, long-term medical model of treatment for individuals with stimulant use disorders.&quot; The neglect of stimulant-users has been widely considered to be related to the popularity of stimulants among systemically-oppressed groups, such as methamphetamine use among gay men and transgender people, and crack cocaine use among Black people. The crack epidemic in the United States demonstrates a discrepancy between sentencing lengths of crack cocaine and heroin users, with crack users imprisoned for longer periods of time than heroin users. In 2012, 88% of imprisonments from crack cocaine were of African American people.

Stimulant users have increasingly been at risk for opioid overdose since 2006, due to the nonconsensual presence of fentanyl in their substances.

=====Tobacco=====

Tobacco harm reduction describes actions taken to lower the health risks associated with using tobacco, especially combustible forms, without abstaining completely from tobacco and nicotine. Some of these measures include switching to safer (lower tar) cigarettes, switching to snus or dipping tobacco, or using a non-tobacco nicotine delivery systems. In recent years, the growing use of electronic cigarettes (or vaping) for smoking cessation, whose long-term safety remains uncertain, has sparked an ongoing controversy among medical and public health between those who seek to restrict and discourage all use until more is known and those who see them as a useful approach for harm reduction, whose risks are most unlikely to equal those of smoking tobacco. &quot;Their usefulness in tobacco harm reduction as a substitute for tobacco products is unclear&quot;, but in an effort to decrease tobacco related death and disease, they have a potential to be part of the strategy.

===Routes of administration===

====Needle exchange programmes (NEP)====
The use of some illicit drugs can involve hypodermic needles. In some areas (notably in many parts of the US), these are available solely by prescription. Where availability is limited, people who use heroin and other substances frequently share the syringes and use them more than once or participate in unsafe practices such as blood flashing. As a result, infections such as HIV or hepatitis C can spread from person to person through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. The principles of harm reduction propose that syringes should be easily available or at least available through a needle and syringe programmes (NSP). Where syringes are provided in sufficient quantities, rates of HIV are much lower than in places where supply is restricted. In many countries people who use substances are supplied equipment free of charge, others require payment or an exchange of dirty needles for clean ones, hence the name.

A 2010 review found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported injecting risk behaviour. It has been shown in the many evaluations of needle-exchange programmes that in areas where clean syringes are more available, illegal drug use is no higher than in other areas. Needle exchange programmes have reduced HIV incidence by 33% in New Haven and 70% in New York City.

The Melbourne, Australia inner-city suburbs of Richmond and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated for a protracted time period. Research organisation the Burnet Institute completed the 2013 &#x27;North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study&#x27; in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum, City of Yarra and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing &quot;widespread, frequent and highly visible&quot; nature of illicit drug use in the areas. During the period between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the local government area the City of Yarra, of which Richmond and Abbotsford are parts of, 1550 syringes were collected each month from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Furthermore, ambulance callouts for heroin overdoses were 1.5 times higher than for other Melbourne areas in the period between 2011 and 2012 (a total of 336 overdoses), and drug-related arrests in North Richmond were also three times higher than the state average. The Burnet Institute&#x27;s researchers interviewed health workers, residents and local traders, in addition to observing the drug scene in the most frequented North Richmond public injecting locations.

On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated in the media that it recommends 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area&#x27;s drug culture continues to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The institute&#x27;s research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and inappropriately discarding injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken open syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded injecting equipment.

The British public body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), introduced a new recommendation in early April 2014 due to an increase in the presentation of the number of young people who inject steroids at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services are not advised for people under the age of 18 years, but the organisation&#x27;s director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a &quot;completely different group&quot; of people were presenting at programs. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for &quot;rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users&quot;, and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18—a first for NICE—following reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles.

=====Supervised injection sites (SIS)=====

&quot;Supervised injection sites&quot; (SIS), or &quot;Drug consumption rooms&quot; (DCR), are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers.

The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. Some offer counseling, hygienic and other services of use to itinerant and impoverished individuals. Most programmes prohibit the sale or purchase of illegal drugs. Many require identification cards. Some restrict access to local residents and apply other admission criteria, such as they have to be people who inject substances, but generally in Europe they do not exclude people with substance use disorders who consume their substances through other means.

The Netherlands had the first staffed injection room, although they did not operate under explicit legal support until 1996. Instead, the first center where it was legal to inject drugs was in Berne, Switzerland, opened 1986. In 1994, Germany opened its first site. Although, as in the Netherlands they operated in a &quot;gray area&quot;, supported by the local authorities and with consent from the police until the Bundestag provided a legal exemption in 2000.

In Europe, Luxembourg, Spain and Norway have opened facilities after year 2000. Sydney&#x27;s Medically Supervised Injecting Center (MSIC) was established in May 2001 as a trial and Vancouver&#x27;s Insite opened in September 2003. In 2010, after a nine-year trial, the Sydney site was confirmed as a permanent public health facility. As of late 2009 there were a total of 92 professionally supervised injection facilities in 61 cities. In North American, as of 2023 there are supervised injection sites operating in a number of Canadian cities, and two in United States. The sites in United States opened in 2021.

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction&#x27;s latest systematic review from April 2010 did not find any evidence to support concerns that DCR might &quot;encourage drug use, delay treatment entry or aggravate problems of local drug markets.&quot; Jürgen Rehm and Benedikt Fischer explained that while evidence show that DCR are successful, that &quot;interpretation is limited by the weak designs applied in many evaluations, often represented by the lack of adequate control groups.&quot; Concluding that this &quot;leaves the door open for alternative interpretations of data produced and subsequent ideological debate.&quot;

The EMCDDA review noted that research into the effects of the facilities &quot;faces methodological challenges in taking account of the effects of broader local policy or ecological changes&quot;, still they concluded &quot;that the facilities reach their target population and provide immediate improvements through better hygiene and safety conditions for injectors.&quot; Further that &quot;the availability of safer injecting facilities does not increase levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption, nor does it result in higher rates of local drug acquisition crime.&quot; While its usage is &quot;associated with self-reported reductions in injecting risk behaviour such as syringe sharing, and in public drug use&quot; and &quot;with increased uptake of detoxification and treatment services.&quot; However, &quot;a lack of studies, as well as methodological problems such as isolating the effect from other interventions or low coverage of the risk population, evidence regarding DCRs—while encouraging—is insufficient for drawing conclusions with regard to their effectiveness in reducing HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence.&quot; Concluding with that &quot;there is suggestive evidence from modelling studies that they may contribute to reducing drug-related deaths at a city level where coverage is adequate, the review-level evidence of this effect is still insufficient.&quot;

Critics of this intervention, such as drug prevention advocacy organisations, Drug Free Australia and Real Women of Canada point to the most rigorous evaluations, those of Sydney and Vancouver. Two of the centers, in Sydney, Australia and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada cost $2.7 million and $3 million per annum to operate respectively, yet Canadian mathematical modeling, where there was caution about validity, indicated just one life saved from fatal overdose per annum for Vancouver, while the Drug Free Australia analysis demonstrates the Sydney facility statistically takes more than a year to save one life. The Expert Advisory Committee of the Canadian Government studied claims by journal studies for reduced HIV transmission by Insite but &quot;were not convinced that these assumptions were entirely valid.&quot; The Sydney facility showed no improvement in public injecting and discarded needles beyond improvements caused by a coinciding heroin drought, while the Vancouver facility had an observable impact. Drug dealing and loitering around the facilities were evident in the Sydney evaluation, but not evident for the Vancouver facility.

===Safer supply===
Safer supply programs prescribe medications (including stimulants, opioids, and benzodiazepines) to people at high risk of overdose. This is meant to provide a safer alternative to an illegal drug supply that contains high levels of fentanyl and other dangerous chemicals. The structure of such programs is more flexible than opioid agonist therapy. The drugs dispensed by these programs can result in intoxication, unlike methadone or buprenorphine. Safer supply projects exist in a number of Canadian cities. Critics of these programs point to the risk of drug diversion and argue that patients should be encouraged to enter drug rehabilitation programs instead of being given drugs.

==Sex==

===Safer sex programmes===
Many schools now provide safer sex education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like condoms and dental dams to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of STIs. This runs contrary to abstinence-only sex education, which teaches that educating children about sex can encourage them to engage in it.

These programmes have been found to decrease risky sexual behaviour and prevent sexually transmitted infections. They also reduce rates of unwanted pregnancies. Abstinence-only programmes do not appear to affect HIV risks in developed countries with no evidence available for other areas.

===Legalized prostitution===
Since 1999, some countries have legalized prostitution, such as Germany (2002) and New Zealand (2003). However, in most countries the practice is prohibited. Gathering accurate statistics on prostitution and human trafficking is extremely difficult. This has resulted in proponents of legalization claiming that it reduces organized crime rates while opponents claim exactly the converse. The Dutch prostitution policy, which is one of the most liberal in the world, has gone back and forth on the issue several times. In the period leading up to 2015 up to a third of officially sanctioned work places had been closed down again after reports of human trafficking. Prostitutes themselves are generally opposed to what they see as &quot;theft of their livelihood&quot;.

Legal prostitution means prostitutes can contact police in instances of abuse or violence without fear of arrest or prosecution because of what they are doing being illegal. A legal and regulated system can also provide licensed brothels as opposed to prostitutes working on the streets, in which the owners or staff of the premises can call the police in instances of violence against sex workers without fear of workers or the business facing criminal charges or being shut down. Legal and regulated prostitution can require prostitutes to undergo regular health checks for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by law. Sex workers in Nevada for instance have to get monthly tests for syphilis and HIV and weekly tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia.

===Sex-work and HIV===

Despite the depth of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, rapid transmission has occurred globally in sex workers. The relationship between these two variables greatly increases the risk of transmission among these populations, and also to anyone associated with them, such as their sexual partners, their children, and eventually the population at large.

Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in injecting drug users and sex-workers. HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease. Peer education as a harm reduction strategy has especially reduced the risk of HIV infection, such as in Chad, where this method was the most cost-effective per infection prevented.

Decriminalisation as a harm-reduction strategy gives the ability to treat substance use disorder solely as a public health issue rather than a criminal activity. This enables other harm-reduction strategies to be employed, which results in a lower incidence of HIV infection.

One of the first harm reduction models was called the &quot;Mersey Harm Reduction Model&quot; in 1980s Liverpool, and the success of utilizing outreach workers, distribution of education, and providing clean equipment to drug users was shown in the fact that an HIV epidemic did not happen in Mersey.

The AIDS epidemic, which began in the 80s and peaked in 1995, further complicated the politicization of drug users and drug use in the US. The implementation of harm reduction faced much resistance within the US due to the demonization of particular drugs associated with stigmatized groups, such as sex workers and drug-injecting users.

==Drug liberalization==
Drug liberalization as a harm-reduction strategy gives the ability to treat substance use disorder solely as a public health issue rather than a criminal activity. This enables other harm-reduction strategies to be employed, which results in a lower incidence of HIV infection.

==Criticism==
Critics, such as Drug Free America Foundation and other members of network &quot;International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy&quot;, state that a risk posed by harm reduction is by creating the perception that certain behaviours can be partaken of safely, such as illicit drug use, that it may lead to an increase in that behaviour by people who would otherwise be deterred. The signatories of the drug prohibitionist network International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy stated that they oppose drug use harm reduction &quot;...strategies as endpoints that promote the false notion that there are safe or responsible ways to use drugs. That is, strategies in which the primary goal is to enable drug users to maintain addictive, destructive, and compulsive behavior by misleading users about some drug risks while ignoring others.&quot;

In 2008, the World Federation Against Drugs stated that while &quot;...some organizations and local governments actively advocate the legalization of drugs and promote policies such as &quot;harm reduction&quot; that accept drug use and do not help people who use substances to become free from substance use. This undermines the international efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs.&quot; The Federation states that harm reduction efforts often end up being &quot;drug legalization or other inappropriate relaxation efforts, a policy approach that violates the UN Conventions.&quot;

Critics furthermore reject harm reduction measures for allegedly trying to establish certain forms of drug use as acceptable in society. The Drug Prevention Network of Canada states that harm reduction has &quot;...come to represent a philosophy in which illicit substance use is seen as largely unpreventable, and increasingly, as a feasible and acceptable lifestyle as long as use is not &#x27;problematic, an approach which can increase &quot;acceptance of drug use into the mainstream of society&quot;. They say harm reduction &quot;...sends the wrong message to ... children and youth&quot; about drug use. In 2008, the Declaration of World Forum Against Drugs criticized harm reduction policies that &quot;...accept drug use and do not help drug users to become free from drug abuse&quot;, which the group say undermines &quot;...efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs.&quot; They state that harm reduction should not lead to less efforts to reduce drug demand.

Pope Benedict XVI criticised harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that it was &quot;a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems&quot;. This position was in turn widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections.

<text>Wendell Richard &quot;Wendy&quot; Anderson (February 1, 1933 – July 17, 2016) was an American politician and hockey player who served from 1971 to 1976 as the 33rd governor of Minnesota. In late 1976, he resigned as governor in order to be appointed to the U.S. Senate, after Senator Walter Mondale was elected Vice President of the United States. Anderson served in the Senate for almost two years, but after losing the 1978 Senate election to Rudy Boschwitz, he resigned a few days before the end of his term to give Boschwitz seniority.

==Background==
Anderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1933. He attended Saint Paul&#x27;s Johnson High School and the University of Minnesota, where he received a B.A. in 1954. He earned a law degree from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1960.

Anderson served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant. He later served with an intelligence unit in the Army Reserve.

==Hockey career==
From 1951 to 1954, Anderson played defense for the University of Minnesota, where he made two NCAA Frozen Four runs in his final two seasons (the Gophers were defeated in back-to-back championship finals by the Michigan Wolverines and the RPI Bachelors). He was a member of the U.S. hockey team that won a silver medal at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Long after his on-ice career ended, he was drafted in 1972 by the Minnesota Fighting Saints in the inaugural World Hockey Association draft, in what was seen as a publicity stunt. (Not to be outdone, another WHA team selected Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin.) Anderson chose to remain governor.

==Political career==
Anderson served in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963 and in the Minnesota State Senate from 1963 to 1971. He was elected governor of Minnesota in 1970. His signature accomplishment as governor was helping to create the &quot;Minnesota Miracle of 1971&quot;, an innovative reform in financing of Minnesota public schools and local governments that created a fairer distribution in taxation and education. For his efforts, Anderson was featured on a 1973 cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

After U.S. Senator Walter Mondale was elected vice president in 1976, the governor had to appoint Mondale&#x27;s successor. Anderson agreed with his lieutenant governor, Rudy Perpich, that Anderson would resign as governor, and Perpich, as the new governor, would appoint Anderson to the Senate.

In what became known as the &quot;Minnesota Massacre&quot;, nearly the entire DFL Party ticket was defeated in 1978, including Perpich and the candidates for both U.S. Senate seats, Anderson and Bob Short. Anderson&#x27;s arrangement to have himself appointed to the Senate—and Perpich&#x27;s role in that appointment—were deemed central factors in the defeats; Anderson said the move to appoint himself senator was his big mistake.

From 1989 to 2002, Anderson served as honorary consul general of Sweden in Minneapolis. From 1995 to 2001, he served as a director for and head of the legal committee of Turbodyne Technologies Inc. (TRBD) in Carpinteria, California. In his later years, he was regularly called upon to act as a commentator on Minnesota politics for local stations such as KSTP-TV.

<doc id="137988" wikidata="Q1505600" url="?curid=137988" title="Clyde Hill, Washington">
<text>Clyde Hill is a city located in King County, Washington. It is part of the Eastside region, located to the east of Seattle, and is bordered by the cities and towns of Bellevue, Kirkland, Medina, Yarrow Point and Hunts Point. The population was 3,126 at the 2020 census.

The majority of Clyde Hill is zoned for single-family use with the exception of two commercially zoned areas: a gas station and a coffee shop. In addition to a small government zone, the City is home to four schools: two public schools - Clyde Hill Elementary and Chinook Middle School; and two private schools: Bellevue Christian School and Sacred Heart School. The City&#x27;s minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet, although many smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City.

==Geography==
The top elevation is close to 375 feet. There are approximately 21 miles of public roadways in Clyde Hill.

==History==
Between 1946 and 1948, J. Gordon and Mary Schneidler subdivided and sold more than a dozen lots in a five-acre subdivision in Clyde Hill. Like many US housing projects following World War II, each deed of sale included an exclusionary racial covenant: &quot;This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race.&quot;

In response to the community&#x27;s desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City.

In 1953 area residents voted to become an incorporated Town by a vote of 145 to 117. Ken Day defeated Don Clark for the first Clyde Hill Mayors position, 91 to 58. All initial councilmembers were elected on write-in votes.

The 1975 mayoral election between incumbent Liberino &quot;Lib&quot; Tufarolo and challenger Miles Nelson ended in a tie with 576 votes for each candidate. Per state law, the winner was decided through a coin flip, which brought national media attention. Nelson won the seat as he called heads.

<doc id="137990" wikidata="Q1074503" url="?curid=137990" title="Covington, Washington">
<text>Covington is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 20,777 at the 2020 census. Covington was founded in 1900 at a Northern Pacific Railway stop and grew into a suburban bedroom community in the late 20th century. It was incorporated as a city in 1997.

==History==

The area presently known as Covington was originally known as Jenkins Prairie. Between 1899 and 1900, the Northern Pacific Railway built the Palmer Cutoff between Auburn and Palmer to improve the company&#x27;s primary east–west rail route across Stampede Pass. Richard Covington, a surveyor for the Northern Pacific, worked out of Fort Vancouver establishing the line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Auburn.

In 1900, during the building of the Palmer Cutoff, the Northern Pacific built several facilities in Covington. These included a 2,850-foot passing track, a 700-foot loading track, a second-class section house, a 24-man bunkhouse, a box tank, and a standpipe for watering steam locomotives. By 1908, the settlement was also home to the Covington Lumber Company, which had set up a mill capable of cutting 85,000 board feet of timber a day. NP&#x27;s operations at Covington continued until the Great Depression; the facilities were then removed in 1941.

Dairies replaced lumber as the predominant industry in the Covington area by the 1920s; several irrigation canals were dug from local creeks to provide water during dry periods. A school district for Covington was established in 1937. Over the years, the area grew as an unincorporated area outside of Kent and was designated as a suburban development hub by the county government. A local citizens&#x27; group formed to incorporate Covington as its own city to control development planning; an attempt to also include Lake Meridian in the proposed city failed and it was instead annexed by Kent. The vote to incorporate Covington as a city passed on November 6, 1996, the same day a similar measure created neighboring Maple Valley.

<doc id="137991" wikidata="Q163325" url="?curid=137991" title="Des Moines, Washington">
<text>Des Moines ( ) is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 32,888 as of the 2020 census. The city is located on the east shore of Puget Sound, near the center of the Seattle metropolitan area. It is bordered by the suburbs of Federal Way to the south, Kent to the east, SeaTac to the northeast, Burien to the north, and Normandy Park to the northwest.

Des Moines is one of the few points along this shoreline where the topography facilitates access to the water, and a recreational marina operated by the city, with moorage, boat launching and pier fishing facilities, is located there. Saltwater State Park, located on a steep ravine between the Zenith and Woodmont neighborhoods, is the most used state park on Puget Sound. Near the border of Federal Way, the Redondo neighborhood has a boardwalk and aquarium.

==History==
What was to become Des Moines was first explored by Europeans on May 26, 1792, during the exploration of British naval Captain George Vancouver on his flagship HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;. The first Americans to visit the area were part of Charles Wilkes&#x27; Expedition.

The first known settler was John Moore, who probably arrived &quot;circa&quot; 1867. His homestead claim certificate (#285) was granted on July 2, 1872.

In 1887, F.A. Blasher persuaded some friends in his home city of Des Moines, Iowa, to help finance the development of a town on Puget Sound. The work was done by the Des Moines Improvement Company. In 1889 the area was platted into lots and sold by the Des Moines Improvement Company, which had been incorporated by F. A. Blasher, Orin Watts Barlow, Charles M. Johnson, and John W. Kleeb. Lumber mills provided the community with its primary employment.

Early transportation to Des Moines was by water. The mosquito fleet provided access to Seattle, Tacoma, and Vashon. The first road, the Brick Highway, was completed in May 1916. The first cross-Puget Sound automobile ferry started service from Des Moines to Portage on November 13, 1916. This ferry service continued until September 1921. Before World War II farming fueled the local economy.

Following the war, suburbanization of the community took place. With increased population, the county government was unable to supply the level of service and local control desired by Des Moines residents. In response to these needs, Des Moines was officially incorporated on June 17, 1959.

On December 12, 1969, an F3 tornado injured one person near Saltwater State Park. The city&#x27;s most visible asset is its 838-berth small boat marina, that was opened on May 10, 1970. In 1980, a concrete and aluminum fishing pier was built at the northern end of the marina.

Property within the city has been the subject of land buyouts because of noise from aircraft landing or taking off from the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, which is located north of Des Moines.

On November 22, 1982, Des Moines annexed the nearby community of Zenith, a farming community founded in 1906 that later became a bedroom community for Boeing workers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Most of the city rolls gently down to the waters of Puget Sound from an elevation of approximately along the eastern city boundary on Pacific Highway, allowing many homes to enjoy an unobstructed view of the sound and Vashon.

<doc id="137992" wikidata="Q1362720" url="?curid=137992" title="Duvall, Washington">
<text>Duvall is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located on SR 203 halfway between Monroe and Carnation. The population was 8,034 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area that became known as Duvall was historically the home of the Snoqualmie and other ancestral Tulalip Native American tribes. Following their relocation under the Treaty of Point Elliott, the area was homesteaded by veterans of the Civil War. The center of present-day town was located on a hillside homesteaded by Francis and James Duvall, loggers who arrived in 1871.

An early milestone in the settlement of Duvall proper was the relocation of the town of Cherry Valley. Around 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad agreed to move Cherry Valley homes and businesses to Duvall in order to continue the construction of a railroad line along the Snoqualmie River. The newly relocated town, briefly named Cosgrove after Samuel G. Cosgrove, underwent a real estate boom; streets and sidewalks were laid and a train depot was constructed. This was followed by construction of a movie house, a drug store, a new schoolhouse, and several hotels. By 1911, the &quot;Duvall Citizen&quot; began publishing regular editions of news events.

On April 28, 1968, nearly 3,000 fans attended a rock concert at a farm in Duvall where an upright piano was dropped from a helicopter. Performances included Country Joe and the Fish. This concert is well known to locals as the Piano Drop. This event inspired the Sky River Rock Festival which occurred later that year.

From 1990 to 1997, the city&#x27;s population grew by 50 percent as it shifted into a bedroom community for job centers on the Eastside. Duvall experienced a great amount of construction during the period of 2008–2009 with the aim of making the one-road town center more accessible and presentable to tourists.

==Events==

The year&#x27;s largest and most popular event is the &#x27;Duvall Days&#x27;, which is held the first weekend in June in downtown Duvall, with other activities at nearby locations. Saturday events include a parade, street side vendors, live entertainment, and many games and activities for children. There is a car show called &#x27;The Duvall Classic Car Show&#x27; held in the Duvall Safeway parking lot, and the &#x27;Duvall Run&#x27; at McCormick Park with 10-kilometer and 5-kilometer races. 2017 and 2018 also included an evening fireworks display. On Sunday, the staff of Fire District 45 host their annual pancake breakfast at the downtown station.

Other events taking place in Duvall throughout the year include:
* Irwin Community Easter Egg Hunt, McCormick Park (Saturday before Easter)
* Sandblast Festival of the Arts (third weekend in July)
* SummerStage (outdoor music, July)
* Irwin Movies In The Park, McCormick Park (August)
* Tree Lighting (start of Christmas season)
* March of the Vegetables, a parade celebrating the vegetables and Art of Duvall

===Annexation initiative===
Eastgate has tried to get annexed by Bellevue several times in the past. In 1990, the area citizens voted to annex to the city of Bellevue and won by a majority. On the same ballot there was an additional vote for Eastgate accepting a portion of Bellevue&#x27;s bonded indebtedness. The area&#x27;s voters rejected that measure. As a result, Bellevue chose not to incorporate Eastgate at that time. Then in 2002, the state Supreme Court decision threw out the main method cities have used for decades to expand. In addition, budget implications further postponed annexation of Eastgate with hopes of trying again in a year or two. According to the 2004&#x27;s Bellevue&#x27;s Comprehensive plan, it is a policy to annex all land in the Potential Annexation Area expeditiously. Discussions with Bellevue have been aided by the county&#x27;s agreement to give the city Coal Creek Park and the Surrey Downs district court property. The city projected an operating deficit of $300,000. Later in November of the same year, a budget was proposed to develop urban design and development alternatives for the Eastgate area and to conduct the first major update of the Eastgate Subarea Plan in 14 years. The Mayor of Bellevue suggested working toward annexation of the remaining unincorporated portion of the Eastgate area and making an effort to update the subarea plan. He also
asked staff to develop a cost estimate for annexing Eastgate. The neighborhoods of Eastgate, Tamara Hills, and Horizon View were annexed by the City of Bellevue on June 1, 2012, adding &quot;about 5,400 new residents, 1,850 residences and 700 acres&quot; to Bellevue.

<doc id="137996" wikidata="Q16147" url="?curid=137996" title="Güstrow">
<text>Güstrow (; ) is a town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in north-eastern Germany. It is capital of the Rostock district; Rostock itself is a district-free city and regiopolis.

It has a population of 28,999 (2020) and is the seventh largest town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Since 2006 Güstrow has had the official suffix &quot;Barlachstadt&quot;.

The town is known for its renaissance Güstrow Palace, the old town and its brick gothic cathedral with Barlach&#x27;s &quot;Floating Angel&quot; sculpture.

==Geography==
Güstrow is 45 kilometers south of Rostock at the Nebel, an arm of the Warnow. The Bützow-Güstrow-Kanal (channel) is a navigable connection to the Warnow and used by tourists. There are five lakes (&quot;Inselsee, Sumpfsee, Parumer See, Grundloser See and Gliner See&quot;) and several forests around Güstrow.

==History==

The name Güstrow comes from the Polabian Guščerov and means lizard place.

In 1219 the Wendish castle Güstrowe was built where the renaissance palace stands now. Güstrow is said to be founded by Heinrich Borwin II, a grandson of Henry the Lion, between 1219 and 1226 and was first mentioned in 1228 in the deed of city rights of Schwerin, confirmed by the sons of Heinrich Borwin II, who donated the cathedral as collegiate church in 1226. Güstrow was a residence of the lords of Werle from 1229 until 1436. In 1441 the first privileged shooting society of Güstrow was founded.

The host desecration-trial of 1330 ended with the burning of 23 Jews and the destruction of the synagogue. The &quot;Kapelle des heiligen Bluts&quot; (Chapel of the Holy Blood) was built on the site of the synagogue. In 1503, 1508 and in 1512 fires destroyed the town and in 1556 the palace burned down.

After the division of Mecklenburg (1621) it became the capital of the small Duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. (Albrecht von Wallenstein, the imperial general in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, was a duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.)

In 1695 the last duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow died, and the duchy ceased to exist. Güstrow became a part of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

The famous sculptor Ernst Barlach lived in Güstrow from 1910 to his death in 1938.

During World War II, Güstrow was the location of a labour camp of the Reich Labour Service, a Gestapo-operated prison and a forced labour subcamp of the prison in Dreibergen. After the war, it formed part of East Germany.

==Sights==

There are several notable sights in Güstrow:
* The Güstrow Palace (or &quot;Schloss Güstrow&quot; in German), built in 1589 in Renaissance style, as a residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg. One of the most important works of this era in the Baltic Sea region. Between 1963 and 1981 major restoration work was carried out, and a Renaissance garden was added, modelled after descriptions appearing in old engravings.
* Güstrow Cathedral, a Brick Gothic cathedral built between 1226 and 1335. Noteworthy are a late Gothic high altar (c. 1500), the tombs of Duke Ulrich III and his two wives (16th century), and the celebrated &quot;Schwebende Engel&quot; (&quot;Hovering Angel&quot;), the most famous work of the expressionist sculptor Ernst Barlach, created in 1926 as a tribute to the victims of World War I.
* St. Mary&#x27;s church, a Brick Gothic parish church, partly remodelled in the 19th century
* Ernst Barlach&#x27;s &quot;Atelierhaus&quot; (studio), that exhibits a large collection of his works.
* The town hall, originally built in the 13th century and rebuilt c. 1800 at the central market square.

<text>Fall City is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States, east of Seattle. The community lies along the Snoqualmie River and Raging River. The population was 2,032 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlements in the area were two forts built in 1856 during the Puget Sound War to protect future settlers against possible uprisings by the native population. Fort Patterson, a few miles downstream, and Fort Tilton, a few miles upstream, were built with the help of Indians led by Chief Patkanim, and both were abandoned within two years after interactions with the local tribes remained peaceful. A historical marker can be found north of Fall City on the Fish Hatchery Road where Fort Tilton once stood.

A trading post was established near the present-day location of the Last Frontier Saloon in 1869 and became a hub of the local economy. Fall City was known at the time as &quot;The Landing&quot;, as shallow water and rapids upstream on the Snoqualmie were impassable to the large dugout canoes used to transport goods. In the early 1870s, the first local mill in the Snoqualmie Valley was opened at the mouth of Tokul Creek, just downstream from Snoqualmie Falls and just upstream from where Fall City would be. The Fall City post office opened June 10, 1872.

Small steamboats started ferrying supplies up the river in 1875. In the late 1880s, a group of Puget Sound businessmen founded and started building the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, including a line up into the upper Snoqualmie Valley, in an attempt to build a line over the Cascade Range. The land claim holder at the time, Jeremiah &quot;Jerry&quot; Borst, had Fall City surveyed and platted in anticipation of the people the railroad would bring, but was disappointed in 1889 when the railroad line was built a mile (1.6 km) away from the community.

But even a mile away, the railroad, combined with the first bridge over the Snoqualmie River, greatly improved the local lumber mills&#x27; and farmers&#x27; business, and made the area and its scenic features (such as Snoqualmie Falls) accessible to tourists. Hundreds moved to the area over the next two decades.

When the Sunset Highway connecting Seattle with eastern Washington through Fall City was improved in the early 1910s, it further accelerated the area&#x27;s economic and residential development. By the late 1920s, most of the population either worked in the burgeoning tourist trade or commuted to work west toward Issaquah and Seattle.

The Great Depression, followed by gasoline rationing during World War II, hurt Fall City&#x27;s tourist trade. Tourism was further hampered after the war as U.S. Highway 10 (now Interstate 90) was rerouted south directly from Preston to North Bend, bypassing Fall City and Snoqualmie. The local economy suffered further as local logging mills started closing.

Fall City is a bedroom community to the high-tech industry of the Seattle metropolitan area, with large suburban estates just outside the community juxtaposed with the historical homes and farmsteads built in its heyday.

==Geography==
Fall City is in central King County at the confluence of the Snoqualmie River and the Raging River. The rivers are sometimes flooded during the autumn and winter. More typical is a strong east wind as pressure gradients carry higher pressure air across Snoqualmie Pass and down the Snoqualmie Valley.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and or 1.52%, are water.

<text>Federal Way is a city in King County, Washington, United States and part of the Seattle metropolitan area. One of the most recently incorporated cities in the county, its population was 101,030 at the 2020 census. Federal Way is the 10th most populous city in Washington and the 5th most populous in King County.

==History==
Originally a logging settlement, the area was first called &quot;Federal Way&quot; in 1929 to refer to a school district. The name derived from U.S. Route 99 (now State Route 99 or Pacific Highway South), a federally-designated highway which ran through the state and connected Seattle to Tacoma. Five existing schools consolidated operations into School District No. 210 in 1929 and planned construction of Federal Way High School, which opened in 1930 and gave its name to the school district. The local chamber of commerce adopted the name in the early 1950s.

Attempts to incorporate the city were voted down in 1971, 1981 and 1985. The voters eventually approved incorporation as a city on February 28, 1990; the official act of incorporation was held at the Sportsworld Lanes bowling complex.

===Growth since incorporation===
As part of the Washington State Growth Management Act of 1990 (GMA), Federal Way has identified areas of unincorporated King County as Potential Annexation Areas (PAAs) to be annexed to the city. Federal Way&#x27;s current PAAs include the Star Lake and Camelot neighborhoods in Lakeland North and the neighborhoods of Parkland, Lakeland, and Jovita in Lakeland South. All of these neighborhoods are located east of the city proper. In 2004, the city annexed the Northlake, East Redondo, and Parkway neighborhoods, adding over 2,700 people and nearly of area. While Federal Way had previously considered Auburn&#x27;s West Hill, Auburn annexed that along with Lea Hill in 2007.

In February 2007, the city announced formal plans to annex the majority of unincorporated land on its east border as one PAA named East Federal Way, comprising the Star Lake, Camelot, Lakeland, and Jovita neighborhoods, and a strip of Peasley Canyon Road connecting the two areas. Annexation of the area would add 20,000 people and nearly to the city, creating the sixth largest city in Washington by population, at over 106,000 residents and nearly .

On August 21, 2007, residents of the proposed East Federal Way annexation area rejected annexation to Federal Way by a 66% to 34% margin. Opponents of the plan, favoring remaining under direct King County government, asserted fears that increased density and higher taxes would result from annexation despite proponents showing studies that taxes and fees would be unchanged.

In 2011, opponents of annexation petitioned King County to designate this same area as a township, an undefined municipal structure that does not currently exist anywhere else in the state but which the state constitution provides for. Under the plan, township status would prevent the annexation of the area, which would be named Peasley Canyon Township. The King County Council declined to act on the proposal, and the county elections board denied the group a ballot item.

==Geography==
Federal Way is located in the southwest corner of King County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is home to several lakes, including Steel Lake and Lake Killarney.

===Major city and state parks===

* Celebration Park – on 11th Avenue S just south of S 324th Street; with sports fields and wooded trails, and Independence Day fireworks.
* Dash Point State Park – 53rd Avenue SW &amp; SW Dash Point Road; the only developed waterfront park located within the city, including hiking trails and campground.
* West Hylebos Wetlands Park – at S 348th Street and 4th Avenue S, with hiking trails through wetlands. The park also features two iconic buildings: the nearby Barker Cabin built in 1883, which is the city&#x27;s oldest known building, and the Denny Cabin, which was once located west of present-day Seattle Center. The Denny Cabin was built by David Denny in 1889 as a real-estate office and was made from trees cut down on Queen Anne Hill.
* Dumas Bay Centre Park – on SW Dash Point Road; includes a beach, picnic area and walking trail
* Lakota Park – on SW Dash Point Road; includes baseball field, softball field, football field and 440 yard running track

==Economy and attractions==
Until 2014, Federal Way was home to Weyerhaeuser, the largest private owner of softwood timberland in the world. Weyerhaeuser had opened much of its land in Federal Way to the public, including two botanical gardens: the Rhododendron Species Foundation and Botanical Garden, and the Pacific Bonsai Museum. In 2014, the company announced it would vacate its Federal Way headquarters. City leaders suggested promoting the location for a potential community college campus. Federal Way is also home to the US headquarters of World Vision International.

Other attractions in the city include the Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center, which features an Olympic-size swimming pool which has been used for the 1990 Goodwill Games and 2012 US Olympic Swim &amp; Dive Trials. Celebration Park includes sports fields, a playground, and wooded trails. The city has also developed many lakefront and neighborhood parks, playgrounds, and trails.

The PowellsWood Garden, known for its outstanding structural plantings and perennial borders, is located off South Dash Point Road. This land, on a portion of the Cold Creek ravine, was purchased by Monte and Diane Powell in 1993 in order to preserve green space in an increasingly urbanized area.

Wild Waves Theme &amp; Water Park, the largest amusement park in the region, opened in 1977 on the south side of the city. It is the Seattle area&#x27;s only permanent amusement park. Six Flags purchased Wild Waves in December 2000. However, after low sales, Six Flags sold the park in April 2007 to Parc Management LLC of Jacksonville, Florida, for $31.75 million.

Federal Way is locally identified by its 1990s semi-urban development, characterized by landscaped off-street multi-structure apartment complexes and shopping centers. The Commons at Federal Way, the city&#x27;s only indoor shopping mall, is located on South 320th Street and Pacific Highway South (State Route 99) near the city&#x27;s main Interstate 5 exit.

===Largest employers===
According to Federal Way&#x27;s 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in Federal Way are:

===Downtown tower projects===
In 2007, the city of Federal Way purchased a downtown lot formerly used by a defunct AMC Theatres cinema, and invited proposals from two developers, United Properties and Alpert Capital, to develop a multi-use tower project in the downtown core, adjacent to the recently built transit center. Such a project follows in the steps of similar multi-use developments such as Kent Station in nearby Kent. The city awarded the contract to United Properties&#x27; &quot;Symphony&quot; project, comprising four 15–22 story towers, including of retail and office space, 900 housing units, and a large downtown park which would be relinquished to the city. Transfer of the land to United Properties followed by construction of the first tower was scheduled to start in mid-2008. However, in July 2008, United Properties requested a one-year extension on the terms of the purchase agreement, citing difficulties in the credit and housing markets to acquire the necessary funds. In August 2009, United suggested scrapping the Symphony plan and instead building a performing arts center on the property, a proposal the city rejected.

In September 2009 the South Korean development firm Lander Korus joined onto the project with United. Korus proposed adding Asian elements to the building in order to attract investment and interest from the city&#x27;s influential Korean population and foreign investment. However, by July 2010, after having granted United and Korus five extensions to close on the project, the city transferred the deal to another Korean developer, Twin Development, which had planned a similar project on another lot. The new developer brought a new design, with two 45-story and one 35-story mixed-use towers. As of 2011 the new developers had yet to close on the property, citing financing difficulties, and had received the seventh extension on the land from the city, which expired in March 2011. The developers were banking on the city&#x27;s recently granted EB-5 visa qualification to encourage foreign investment in exchange for permanent resident status. As of February 1, 2011, this deal was also dead, as the developer had failed to make a required escrow deposit by the end of January.

In 2011 the city renewed its Request for Quotes for the undeveloped site, and received three proposals. The city ultimately chose a proposal by Arcadd known as the &quot;Crystal Palace&quot;, a densely packed glass multi-tower structure where some of the towers bend outward near the top under 20 stories with a larger retail and public space pavilion at the base. The developers, however, were unable to obtain the funds by the initial deadline. After extending the deadline eight months to allow Arcadd to obtain the necessary earnest money, and still seeing no progress, the city decided to move on with a different plan. As of May 2013, plans for a downtown park and plaza complex were underway. In 2014, the lot was repaved, leaving the AMC Theatres building foundation in place, but filling inside its perimeter with sod. The lot was rechristened Town Square Park and opened in early 2014. A plan for a more permanent park design on the site is being considered.

To the north of the downtown park, an elevated lot which was formerly the location of a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store has been purchased by the city, which is slated to host a planned performing arts and civic center (PACC). The PACC proposal has been controversial, largely over funding and self-sustaining concerns (a similar city project, the Federal Way Community Center, opened in 2007 and ran for most of its operational history in the red), but has the support of most city leaders. It opened as the Performing Arts &amp; Event Center (PAEC) in August 2017.

Also in 2014, ahead of Veterans Day, the city introduced a flagpole on South 320th Street between Pacific Highway South and Pete von Reichbauer Way South. The pole holds a flag. While intended to be officially raised on Veterans Day, a smaller flag was raised to half mast on the pole in late October, in memory of State Representative Roger Freeman who died October 29 of that year. The portion of South 320th Street from Pacific Highway to Interstate 5 was dual-named &quot;Veterans Way&quot; in honor of veterans.

<doc id="138000" wikidata="Q384969" url="?curid=138000" title="Hunts Point, Washington">
<text>Hunts Point is a town in the Eastside, a region of King County, Washington, United States, and part of the Seattle metropolitan area. The town is on a small peninsula surrounded by Lake Washington, and is near the suburbs of Medina (to the southwest), Clyde Hill (to the south), Yarrow Point (on another peninsula to the east), and Kirkland (to the northeast), as well as the city of Bellevue (to the east). As of the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 457.

==History==
Leigh S. J. Hunt, a resident of nearby Yarrow Point, purchased the yet-to-be-named property of Hunts Point on March 13, 1890. He wanted the property so that he could cut down the tall evergreen trees that grew out at the end, obstructing his view of Lake Washington. Around 1900, the property was taken over by Puget Sound National Bank and sold to a group of Seattle men who used it as a family retreat for Sunday picnics and summer camping.

Before the creation of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Interstate 90 floating bridges across Lake Washington, residents commuted to Seattle via the &quot;Gazelle&quot;, one of several ferries on Lake Washington. The &quot;Gazelle&quot; arrived at Cozy Cove (between Hunts Point and Yarrow Points) each morning at 7:15 a.m.

A clubhouse was built in 1913 at what is now 3655 Hunts Point Road. It became the center of Hunts Point&#x27;s social activity through the 1920s. That same year, the women of Hunts Point formed the charitable organization The Eastside Circle of the Seattle Fruit and Flower Mission (later called The Overlake Service League), which continues to this day.

Hunts Point was incorporated as a city on August 22, 1955. The Fairweather Basin was developed from marshland into residential property in 1957. The city&#x27;s first sewers were installed in 1960. The original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, connecting Hunts Point to Seattle, was opened on August 28, 1963. The Wetherill Nature Preserve was created by a donation of land in 1988.

In the 1950s, Stan Sayres, owner of the famous Slo Mo unlimited hydroplane, housed the boat at the end of Hunts Point Road.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

==Government and politics==

Hunts Point is part of the 48th Legislative District of Washington. The district&#x27;s legislators are:

* Senator Patty Kuderer, Democrat
* Representative Vandana Slatter, Democrat
* Representative Joan McBride, Democrat

Hunts Point is part of Washington&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Suzan DelBene, Democrat.

George W. Bush made a fund-raising stop in the town during each of his presidential campaigns. The August 22, 2003, visit cost the town $23,634.25 for police security.

The town of Hunts Point, along with neighboring Yarrow Point, has no agreement to participate in the King County Library System, which precludes residents from holding library cards or using library services.

In the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump 161 votes to 116 in Hunts Point.

<doc id="138003" wikidata="Q40251" url="?curid=138003" title="Issaquah, Washington">
<text>Issaquah ( ) is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 40,051 at the 2020 census. Located in a valley and bisected by Interstate 90, the city is bordered by the Sammamish Plateau to the north and the &quot;Issaquah Alps&quot; to the south. It is home to the headquarters of the multinational retail company Costco Wholesale Corporation. Issaquah is included in the Seattle metropolitan area.

==History==

&quot;Issaquah&quot; is an anglicization of the Southern Lushootseed placename /sqʷáxʷ/, meaning either &quot;the sound of birds&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, or &quot;little stream&quot;. &quot;Squak Valley&quot;, an older name for the area, also derives from this same Native American name.

In September 1885, the then-unincorporated area was the scene of an attack on Chinese laborers who had come to pick hops from local fields. Three of the laborers died from gunshot wounds; seven attackers were indicted, but they were later acquitted or charges were dropped.

Shortly after becoming known as Squak, the town was briefly renamed to Gilman, an homage to Daniel Hunt Gilman, who brought railways to the town.

The city was officially incorporated by the Washington State legislature on April 29, 1892. Initially a small mining town, the city has changed noticeably both in its appearance and economic focus. Issaquah was originally developed to service the mining industry (on the two nearby mountains that now lend their names to the Cougar/Squak Corridor Park), and began as the town of &quot;Gilman&quot;. As the mining deposits neared depletion in the late 1890s, other companies started to realize Issaquah&#x27;s potential to support a lucrative lumber business. These companies exported timber from Issaquah and other small, local towns to Seattle and larger, rapidly growing communities throughout western Washington. These early boom industries, however, faded into a period of relative quiet by the time of the Great Depression.

The town&#x27;s industries remained similar through most of the century, with Boeing providing the majority of employment in the area. Microsoft and other technological industries moved into Redmond and other cities in the area, and later established operations in Issaquah itself. In June 1996, Costco moved its global headquarters to Issaquah from nearby Kirkland.

==Geography==
Issaquah is located east-southeast of Seattle at the south end of Lake Sammamish. Its neighboring cities are Bellevue to the west and Sammamish to the north. Issaquah resides within the Mountains to Sound Greenway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

Issaquah is surrounded on three sides by what are known locally as the Issaquah Alps: Cougar Mountain on the west, Squak Mountain to the south, and Tiger Mountain to the southeast. To the north of Issaquah is Lake Sammamish. Cougar and Squak Mountains are home to sizable neighborhoods on their lower slopes, though the bulk of all three mountains are preserved in public ownership as Squak Mountain State Park, Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park, West Tiger Mountain NRCA, and Tiger Mountain State Forest. Geologists have noted the chemical and geological content of these three mountains to be much different from that of the Cascade Range, because they are not volcanic in origin, while the entire Cascade Range is postulated to have formed from volcanic action. They believe that these three mountains are the remains of a much older mountain range long since eroded by earthquakes, volcanic action, and shifting plates.

===Climate===
Issaquah has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) with chilly, extremely wet winters and warm, moderately humid summers. Although there is no dry season in Issaquah, winters are many times wetter than the summers. Rainfall amounts are extremely similar to the neighboring city of Sammamish, which is 0.06 inches wetter overall, with the same summer rain amounts.

==Economy==
Warehouse retailer Costco has been headquartered in Issaquah since 1996. Other major Issaquah employers include Microsoft, Siemens Medical Solutions&#x27; Ultrasound Group, Overtime Technologies, Boehm&#x27;s Candies, and Darigold. Apparel wholesaler SanMar is also headquartered in the city.

==Demographics==
According to a 2021 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $132,984, and the median income for a family was $115,814. The per capita income for the city was $78,581.

According to the Washington State Office of Financial Management, Issaquah ranked 6th of 279 eligible incorporated communities in population growth between 2000 and 2005. Forbes.com ranked Issaquah the 2nd fastest-growing suburb in the state and the 89th in the nation.

==Transportation==

===Highways and roads===
Issaquah is bisected by Interstate 90, which runs from Seattle to Boston, and Washington State Route 900, which connects the city to neighboring Renton. There is a chronic traffic congestion problem on Front Street, which traverses the historic downtown. Proposals have been made to create a bypass, but opponents have argued that this will only result in more sprawl in the area beyond downtown and thus bring in more traffic and pollution. In 2008, the Issaquah City Council voted to cancel the 15-year-running SE Bypass project. In addition, King County has no funding in its seven-year capital plan to improve Issaquah-Hobart Road, the southern terminus of the proposed bypass.

===Public transportation===
Bus service in Issaquah is provided by King County Metro as well as regional Sound Transit routes to Seattle and Bellevue. There are two primary park-and-rides in the city, at Issaquah Transit Center and Issaquah Highlands Park &amp; Ride, which have a total of 1,999 parking spaces.

Since August 1995, the city and King County Metro provided a free circulator bus (route 200) between business districts and community centers in Issaquah as a form of traffic congestion relief.

As part of the expansion of Sound Transit services, a Link light rail line to Issaquah from Bellevue is proposed to begin service by 2041.

==Local attractions==
===Issaquah Alps===

The Issaquah Alps are a range of highlands situated around the city of Issaquah that include hiking trails and other outdoor activities. It is primarily composed of three distinct peaks: Tiger Mountain, Cougar Mountain, and Squak Mountain. Paragliders and hang gliders launch from Poo Poo Point on Tiger Mountain in the Issaquah Alps. Several popular trailheads in the area are served by Trailhead Direct, a shuttle bus service managed by King County Metro.

===Issaquah Valley Trolley===

The Issaquah Valley Trolley is a heritage trolley operated by the Issaquah Historical Society on a section of the city&#x27;s remaining railroad tracks from the Issaquah Depot to Gilman Village. A pilot was organized from 2001 to 2002 with cars borrowed from Yakima Valley Trolleys and followed by the Issaquah Historical Society&#x27;s acquisition of their own three cars in 2010. Regular public rides started in October 2012 and operated seasonally on weekends until November 2020.

===Village Theatre===

The Village Theatre has presented live stage plays on its main stage in downtown Issaquah since 1979. It was originally located in a converted movie theater and later built its main stage at the Francis J. Gaudette Theatre in 1993. Village Theatre is an Equity theater and has an affiliated theater in Everett.

===Salmon hatchery and festival===

The Issaquah Salmon Hatchery on Issaquah Creek is a state-owned fish hatchery that was built in 1936 by the federal Works Project Administration. It annually raises about Chinook and Coho salmon and is the most visited hatchery in Washington with an estimated 350,000 visitors annually.

Issaquah Salmon Days is an annual two-day festival held in Issaquah during early October to celebrate the return of spawning salmon to the area. It includes a parade, arts and crafts conventions, live entertainment and music, and sporting events. In 2005, the register revealed over 400,000 people attended the Salmon Days Festival.

===Cougar Mountain Zoo===
The Cougar Mountain Zoo is located on west of Issaquah on the north slope of Cougar Mountain. The zoo was founded in 1972 and is home to many endangered birds and animals, as well as cougars, lemurs, reindeer, and wallabies. In 2007, the zoo added two Bengal tiger cubs who had been raised in a Florida preserve.

===Gilman Village===

Gilman Village is a shopping center created in 1972 from historic residential and commercial buildings that were moved and renovated for use as independent shops and restaurants. The complex has 27 buildings with various businesses, including specialty shops. The shopping center was designed by Baylis Architects, Richard Haag Associates, and landscape architect Stephen G. Ray.

===High Alpine Chapel===

The High Alpine Chapel opened in 1981 on the grounds of the Boehm&#x27;s candy shop near downtown Issaquah. It was designed to resemble a 12th-century Swiss church and can hold 57 people. The chapel includes a memorial to deceased mountaineers.

==Government==

The City of Issaquah uses the mayor-council form of government. The City Council acts as the legislative body. The City Council consists of seven councilmembers, who each have four-year terms in staggered tranches.

Mary Lou Pauly was elected mayor of Issaquah in 2017 with 64.19% of the vote. She was re-elected in 2021 to another term.

In 2023, Issaquah became the first Washington city to be awarded LEED Gold certification for its environmental conservation and sustainability initiatives.

==Education==
Public education for 21,358 students within the city and surrounding area is provided by the Issaquah School District, which operates 28 schools in and around Issaquah. This school district includes the southern part of Sammamish with the zip code 98075. This area also includes the northern part of Renton.

==Healthcare==
Swedish Medical Center opened a full-service hospital and healthcare facility in the Issaquah Highlands with a capacity of 175 inpatient beds and a 24-hour emergency room in November 2011. The campus also includes medical offices and specialty care facilities. Bellevue-based Overlake Hospital Medical Center also petitioned the state government to open a hospital in Issaquah, but lost to Swedish&#x27;s bid.

Kenmore is connected to nearby areas by State Route 522 and the Burke-Gilman Trail, which both run east–west along the lakeshore. The city limits stretch north to the Snohomish County line and south to a border with Kirkland south of Saint Edward State Park and Bastyr University. Kenmore&#x27;s official flower is the dahlia, bird the great blue heron, and evergreen the rhododendron.

==History==
The Sammamish River valley from Lake Washington to Issaquah Creek was historically inhabited by the indigenous Sammamish people (also known as the &quot;s-tah-PAHBSH&quot;, or &quot;willow people&quot;), a Coast Salish group with an estimated population of 80 to 200 by 1850. Among them were the &quot;ssts&#x27;p-abc&quot; (&quot;meander dwellers&quot;), who settled near the river&#x27;s mouth at two villages—the larger of which was &quot;tlah-WAH-dees&quot; between modern-day Kenmore and Bothell. The Sammamish were removed from their lands in 1856 following the Puget Sound War and moved to the Port Madison and Tulalip Indian reservations. The forested land that would become Kenmore was then owned by Philo Remington of E. Remington and Sons, who subsequently sold it to son-in-law Watson C. Squire, a former governor of the Washington Territory.

===Early 20th century===
Scotsman John McMasters and his wife Annie arrived in Puget Sound in May 1889 from Kenmore, Ontario, intending to establish themselves in the shingle-making trade. McMasters and his business partner, Chris Kruse, leased land from Squire and opened a shingle mill on the northeastern shore of Lake Washington on January 1, 1901. Establishing a company town alongside the mill for his employees, McMasters named it after his earlier hometown in Canada, which in turn was named after the village in Scotland, registering the name with the state on January 10. By 1903, Kenmore had established a school system and post office, with McMasters named the first postmaster for the latter.

Despite cargo railway service passing through the area as early as 1887 via the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, most access to the city in its early days was by boat, with regular ferry service to Seattle, Bothell, and Woodinville starting in 1906. The city later gained a passenger railroad stop. The first improved road connection to Seattle and Bothell—the Red Brick Road—opened between 1913 and 1914, with bus service following the laying of the bricks. As a result, Kenmore became a country retreat for weekend gardeners with local landowners selling off clear-cut &quot;garden plots&quot; to Seattlites with automobiles and green thumbs. It attracted at least two short-lived nudist camps during the 1920s.

Far more striking, however, was the impact of Prohibition. Kenmore quickly became famous in Seattle for its fine country dining and, more importantly, its fine country drinking, as a substantial illegal alcohol industry developed to meet the demands of Jazz Age Seattle nightlife. Although relatively close to Seattle proper thanks to Bothell Way&#x27;s status as one of the few improved roads then heading north from downtown it was nonetheless far enough out that Department of Revenue officers could, for the most part, ignore it.

The Blind Pig, a roadhouse on Shuter&#x27;s Landing at Lake Washington, was probably the most famous of the Kenmore speakeasys. At the lakeside, its illegal hooch could be dumped into the lake quickly and easily should it become necessary. Few people were fooled; the name itself was, in fact, a well-known slang term meaning &quot;speakeasy&quot;. But despite its notoriety, the Pig was not even the city&#x27;s most infamous saloon. Routine violence and fist-fights at the Inglewood Tavern earned that establishment an alternative name: the Bucket of Blood.

This archipelago of dining and entertainment - over 30 different restaurants, dance halls, bars, and clubs in a three-block area - remained a major part of Kenmore&#x27;s identity through the 1940s.

===Post-war redevelopment===
Once the Great Depression hit, Kenmore became home for a small settlement of workers under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Back to the Land program. Paid by the Works Progress Administration, a small number of workers settled in an area of northwestern Kenmore which became known as &quot;Voucherville&quot;, after the vouchers the WPA paid in lieu of a cash salary.

After the end of World War II, Kenmore became home to US Army Nike Hercules missile batteries as part of cold-war era defense plans. These nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles were intended to protect Seattle and environs from Soviet bombers, should war break out. They were removed in 1974.

The post-war era largely transformed downtown. Kenmore Air Harbor, which today is one of the world&#x27;s largest seaplane-only airports, opened not far from the old location of the Blind Pig; Kenmore Air itself today runs a fleet of seaplanes serving waterside destinations throughout Cascadia. At the same time, Kenmore&#x27;s immediate proximity to Seattle—just two miles (3 km) north of modern Seattle city limits— made it an early target of post-war housing development. The first plats in the new Uplake neighborhood were sold in 1954. Housing development continued throughout the Kenmore area for the next several decades, mostly following the postwar suburban model; industrial and commercial growth followed quickly behind, and within a few decades, most of the old Kenmore dining and drinking had vanished, replaced by shopping centers, industrial development, and housing. However, one part of this new development brought its own history along with it: the Jewel Box Building in downtown Kenmore is a Seattle World&#x27;s Fair artifact, moved from Seattle Center to Kenmore after the end of the fair in October, 1962.

The city gained its first college in 1996, with the relocation of Bastyr University from Seattle onto the grounds of the former St. Edward Seminary.

===Incorporation and downtown revitalization===
Kenmore residents considered incorporation many times since the town&#x27;s founding; one such incorporation vote failed in 1954. The idea gained popular support through the 1990s, however, partly in response to the passage of the Washington State Growth Management Act of 1990. Formation of an exploration committee in 1995 led to a successful public vote shortly thereafter, and the city formally incorporated on August 31, 1998, 97 years after its original founding.

Following incorporation, the new government set about devising a local set of zoning codes and a downtown development plan with the intent of reviving and rebuilding the traditional core areas of the city. A significant component of this plan involved extensive use of land now owned by the city, in the area known within the plan as the Northwest Quadrant. An open invitation was extended to all architects and developers to submit development plans for this newly available area in December, 2005. The City Council chose to negotiate primarily with Kenmore Partners LLC in April 2006. Design plans were submitted to the city the following summer, with a conceptual overview made available to the public at the same time. In 2012, the City of Kenmore and Kenmore Partners LLC broke off their development agreement. After the split, Kenmore sold off 4.75 acres of former park and ride property in 2013 and sold two parcels north of Town Square in 2016 to MainStreet Property Group LLC to develop into mixed-use buildings. In 2017, Kenmore opened a community center called the Hangar at Town Square, a community gathering space which is available to the public to reserve for free.

Kenmore&#x27;s oldest roads, now known most often by their county-assigned number systems, originally had more traditional names such as Cat&#x27;s Whiskers Road (61st Avenue NE), Squire Boulevard (later Red Brick Road, now Bothell Way/SR 522), and Remington Drive (NE 181st Street). These traditional names were reinstated in 2007 as secondary names in the downtown area.

In 2009, Kenmore started building a new city hall on the corner of 68th Avenue Northeast and 181st Avenue Northeast. The building received a LEED gold rating and features solar panels, energy efficient lighting, and a rain garden among other energy-saving features. On May 22, 2010, Kenmore formally opened the new city hall building.

==Geography==
Kenmore has borders encompassing all of the north shore and a significant portion of the northeastern shore of Lake Washington. The local terrain is typical of the Puget Sound lowlands, consisting largely of rolling hills formed from glacial till, occasionally interrupted by flatlands typically found near substantial bodies of water. The largest river is the Sammamish, which connects Lake Sammamish to Lake Washington, and divides the city into northern and southern halves. Additionally, the northeastern corner of the city includes a narrow set of swamps and marshlands running north to south along Swamp Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate of Kenmore is substantially similar to that of nearby Seattle, being defined principally by its latitude, proximity to the Pacific Ocean and Puget Sound, and inclusion in the Puget Sound Convergence Zone. As such, it is usually considered Marine west coast in nature, with damp, cool winters, and mild, dry summers, despite being further north than cities such as Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.

===Neighborhoods===
Kenmore has several distinct neighborhoods. These include:

* Arrowhead, in southern Kenmore, on the west (or lake) side, saw its first house built in 1888. This was a small summer cabin; the oldest house still standing dates from 1929.
* Inglewood, in southern Kenmore, was first platted in 1953, with large-scale suburban development appearing by 1962.
* Lower Moorlands, in eastern Kenmore, saw its first house in 1904. The significant development occurring in this area after World War I included the 1927 landmark Charles and Elvera Thomsen House.
* Upper Moorlands, also in eastern Kenmore, saw initial building in 1938-1939 but stayed quite rural due to the lack of a good water system until suburban development arrived in the mid-1950s.
* Central (or downtown) Kenmore hugs Bothell Way and formed the original core of the city. Today it is Kenmore&#x27;s commercial and industrial core.

* Northlake Terrace, an early residential neighborhood just north of town, is now a mix of commercial and residential development. Much of the eastern portion of this area is to be redeveloped as part of the new Downtown Plan.
* Linwood Heights, in northwest Kenmore, was first founded as part of the &quot;Back to the Land&quot; movement during the Great Depression. Then derisively referred to as Voucherville, it has long since been redeveloped and is now largely suburban housing. Portions were annexed by Lake Forest Park in 1995, predating Kenmore&#x27;s formal incorporation.
* Kenlake Vista, in northern Kenmore, is post-war residential suburban housing.
* Uplake Terrace, a suburban neighborhood developed started in 1953.
* Kenmore Terrace
* Northshore Summit

==Economy==


While in large part now a bedroom community for workers commuting to nearby Seattle, Bothell, and Redmond, Kenmore retains a significant independent economic core centered around durable goods (construction materials, concrete, asphalt) and special trade contracting (construction, heavy construction, and highways).

Kenmore also hosts one of the last industrial ports on Lake Washington, at the mouth of the Sammamish River. Larger local businesses near the port include Rinker Materials&#x27;s Kenmore plant, Kenmore Ready-Mix (cements and asphalts, a division of Glacier Northwest), Pacific Topsoils (topsoils and landscape construction materials), Michael Homchick Stoneworks (stone fabrication and installation), Plywood Supply (lumber, plywood, and millwork, wholesale, retail, and company headquarters), and several others. As home to the James G. Murphy Company, one of the ten largest commercial/industrial auction houses in the United States, the city is also an auction center. Significant non-durable-goods businesses include the headquarters of Kenmore Air, a large private seaplane-based airline; Alaska General Seafoods&#x27;s company headquarters and processing plant; Bastyr University, a school of naturopathic medicine.

==Education==
Kenmore is part of the Northshore School District, and the local high school is Inglemoor High School. Inglemoor High School is known for its IB program. Kenmore originally had its own school district, Kenmore School District 141, which was established in 1903; it was consolidated into its Bothell counterpart in 1916, which in turn was consolidated with the Woodinville district to form Northshore in 1959.

The nonprofit group Saint Edward Environmental Learning Center provides quarterly environmental education classes to the public in conjunction with Washington State Parks and Saint Edward State Park. They also operate the ALEAFA Model Public High School. The Kenmore Library Association, a volunteer group affiliated with the local library, plans and sponsors library programming.

There is a portion of Kenmore extending into the Lake Washington School District, but it consists of portions of the Saint Edward State Park.

Kenmore is home to Bastyr University, a leading private school of naturopathic medicine founded in 1978 and accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). The city is also situated between the University of Washington&#x27;s main Seattle campus and UW Bothell and Cascadia College, both in nearby Bothell, Washington. Paved bike trails and bus service connect the city to all three schools. The city also has a bus connection directly to Shoreline Community College.

==Government and politics==

Kenmore has a Council–manager government, being governed by a city council consisting of seven council members, each of whom is elected to a four-year term. Council elections are held every two years, with either three or four positions standing, depending upon year. All positions are nonpartisan and at-large, elected by the entire city voting population. The Council passes ordinances, sets policies, and elects from its own membership a Mayor and Deputy Mayor for two-year terms. The Council holds regular meetings on the second, third, and fourth Mondays of each month, with special meetings added as needed.

Day-to-day operations of the city are administered by a City Manager, hired by the City Council. City code also stipulates the hiring of a full-time City Clerk. Major committees included in Kenmore Municipal Code are the Landmarks and Heritage Commission, the Planning Commission, and the Library Advisory Board.

City of Kenmore police duties are subcontracted through the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office; the original City of Kenmore Fire Department&#x27;s duties were expanded via agreement with nearby Lake Forest Park, becoming the Northshore Fire Department.

Shortly after its incorporation in 1998, the city passed a moratorium on cardrooms and other gambling establishments; at the time, Kenmore had a single cardroom, which was later grandfathered into an expanded ban in 2003. After the ban was struck down and reinstated, the issue was decided in a public referendum in September 2004 that did not pass a ban on cardrooms, but the city council kept its ban in place. The moratorium was overturned by the King County Superior Court following a lawsuit from the cardroom&#x27;s owner, but a new ban was passed in 2005 and appealed to the federal Ninth Circuit, where the ban was upheld. Following negotiations between the city, the state gambling commission, and the owner, the cardroom closed in 2009.

===Police===
Kenmore contracts with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for police services. Deputies assigned to Kenmore wear city uniforms and drive patrol cars marked with the city logo. There are currently 9 patrol officers, one traffic officer, one storefront officer, and one chief assigned full-time to the city.

==Culture==

===Civic events and festivals===
Major annual civic events include:
* The Kenmore Summer Concert Series, hosted at Saint Edward State Park
* The annual Kenmore Art Show, a juried art exhibition sponsored by the Arts of Kenmore.
* Fourth of July Fireworks, a fireworks display at Log Boom Park, a tradition which started in 2006.
* Farmers Market at Town Square held every Wednesday from June to August; debuted in 2022 as a pilot program

===Media===
Kenmore is served by Seattle-area media, but town and neighborhood events are covered primarily by the &quot;Bothell/Kenmore Reporter&quot;, a weekly and online newspaper published by Sound Publishing. Once a month, a Kenmore city government update is printed within the newspaper as a two- to four-page supplement. For its part, the city also sends out a quarterly eight-page newsletter to all residents discussing government activities, development project status reports, budgetary summaries, and a community events calendar.

Family Circle Magazine selected Kenmore, Washington as one of the &quot;10 Best Towns for families&quot; in their August 2009 edition. &quot;Seattle Magazine&quot; also ranked Kenmore as the best Seattle-area neighborhood or surrounding city for 2008–2009.

===Parks===
Not all parks within city limits are operated by city government; the Burke-Gilman Trail is a King County park, and St. Edward State Park is operated by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. Extant parks within city limits include:
* Burke-Gilman Trail, a King County park which, combined with the Sammamish River Trail, connects Marymoor Park just outside downtown Redmond through the downtowns of Woodinville, Bothell, Kenmore, and Lake Forest Park to Gas Works Park in Seattle and points west. Several other trails and bike routes branch off of this trail backbone.
* ƛ̕ax̌ʷadis Park (formerly known as Squire&#x27;s Landing), a park along the Sammamish River named for a former Lushootseed village located near downtown Kenmore

<text>Kent is a city in King County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan area and had a population of 136,588 as of the 2020 census, making it the 4th most populous municipality in greater Seattle and the 6th most populous in Washington state. The city is connected to Seattle, Bellevue and Tacoma via State Route 167 and Interstate 5, Sounder commuter rail, and commuter buses.

Incorporated in 1890, Kent is the second-oldest incorporated city in the county, after the county seat of Seattle. It is generally divided into three areas: West Hill (mixed residential and commercial along Interstate 5), Valley (primarily industrial and commercial with some medium-density residential; significant parkland along Green River), and East Hill (primarily residential with retail).

==History==
The Kent area was first permanently settled by European Americans in the 1850s along the banks of what was then the White River. The first settler was Samuel Russell, who sailed the White and Duwamish rivers until he claimed a plot of land southeast of modern-day downtown Kent in the spring of 1853. Russell was followed by several other settlers who quickly staked claims around the area. The settlements were originally known as &quot;White River&quot; and later the town was called &quot;Titusville&quot; after an early settler by the name of James Henry Titus. (There is still a &quot;Titusville Station&quot; sign on Gowe Street near First Avenue). In 1861 a post office was established under the name White River and was located at the farm of David and Irena Neely who settled in modern-day Kent in 1854. In 1855 their farm was attacked by Native Americans when David Neely served as a lieutenant in the Territorial Army. Another settler was Henry L. Yesler, who was the first sawmill operator in Seattle. By 1870 the population was 277 and all of the quality bottom-land had been claimed.

Throughout the 1860s and 70&#x27;s, grain and forage crops such as wheat, barley, oats, hay, and timothy accounted for much of the annual return of farmers in the valley. During the late 1870s the town discovered hops production as a major source of income. Due to an aphid invasion which affected hops crops in Europe, hops from the Puget Sound area began to command high prices. Hops were shipped from Titusville either by the river or via rail. In 1889 the town was renamed for the County of Kent, the major hops-producing region in England. Ezra Meeker was asked by the Northern Pacific Railroad to name its station. Meeker suggested that it be known as Kent as it was &quot;Hop Capitol of the West&quot;. Hops production in the White River valley came to an end soon after its own invasion of aphids in 1891.

Kent was officially incorporated on May 28, 1890, with a population of 793, the second city incorporated in King County (after Seattle).

After the turn of the 20th century the area turned to dairy farming and was home to a Carnation condensed milk plant. Flooding from both the Green and the White Rivers was a constant problem. In 1906, flooding changed the course of the White River, which reduced the flood hazard by half. The Green River continued to present problems until the creation of the Howard A. Hanson Dam at Eagle Gorge in 1962.

During and after the Great Depression, Kent was known as the &quot;Lettuce Capital of the World&quot;. After WWII, Kent began to grow more rapidly. From 1953 to 1960 the city&#x27;s size grew twelve-fold. In 1965 Boeing began building in Kent, followed a few years later by other aerospace and high-tech companies.

In 1992, the Greater Kent Historical Society was formed to promote the discovery, preservation and dissemination of knowledge about the history of the greater Kent area. In 1996, the City of Kent purchased the historic Bereiter house, the home of one of Kent&#x27;s early mayors, for use as the Kent Historical Museum. The museum is operated by the Greater Kent Historical Society.

==Geography==
Kent is located in southern King County and is part of Seattle&#x27;s metropolitan area. The city is divided into three geographic sections: West Hill, the Kent Valley, and East Hill. Downtown Kent is located on the east side of the valley, about 16 miles from downtown Seattle and downtown Bellevue. Adjoining cities are Renton to the north, Covington to the east, Auburn to the south, Federal Way to the southwest, Des Moines to the west, SeaTac to the northwest, and Tukwila to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Major waterways include the Green River, which flows north through Kent on its way to Puget Sound. The largest lake is Lake Meridian on the city&#x27;s East Hill. Clark Lake and Lake Fenwick are both surrounded by city parks. Mount Rainier is a prominent geographical landmark to the southeast.

===Transportation===
There are several major freeways and highways in or near Kent, including Interstate 5, State Route 167, and State Route 516. Kent is also served by King County Metro transit, with the Kent Station providing service to many destinations, including downtown Seattle by multiple commuter buses, the Sounder commuter rail system, and local buses. Heavy rail service includes two major north–south lines through the Kent Valley, with freight traffic operations by the BNSF and Union Pacific railroads. The Link light rail system is scheduled to be extended to Federal Way in 2026, with intermediate stops at Kent Des Moines station near Highline College and Star Lake station at South 272nd Street.

===Parks===
Kent&#x27;s park system includes 55 parks, miniparks, playfields, skateparks, greenbelts, and other related facilities. These parks range in size from as little as to over .

Each is elected at-large (that is, by the entire voting population, rather than by districts) to four-year terms. The current mayor is Dana Ralph. The city maintains its own municipal police department, unlike some neighboring municipalities who contract police service out to King County.

===Public education===
Public primary and secondary education in the vast majority of Kent and a number of neighboring cities and unincorporated areas is governed by the Kent School District. The district includes four high schools, seven middle schools, twenty-eight elementary schools and two academies. The Kent School District also has an individualized graduation and degree program named iGrad that is aimed at dropouts aged 16–21 who are willing to get back to school.

Federal Way Public Schools, which includes a portion of Kent, also has several schools within the city limits. Residents of far east Kent are zoned in the Tahoma School district. A branch of Green River Community College opened in Kent Station in 2007.

Other portions are in the Highline Public Schools and the Renton School District.

===Fire protection===
The city is served by the Puget Sound Regional Fire Authority with 7 of the departments 13 stations located within municipal boundaries.

===Annexation===
In keeping with the King County Annexation Initiative, which seeks to annex large urban unincorporated areas into city limits or incorporate new cities out of those areas, the Panther Lake area (known officially as the Kent Northeast Potential Annexation Area) was proposed for annexation to the city of Kent. The annexation was voted on by residents of the potential annexation area on November 3, 2009; the area was officially annexed July 1, 2010. The city grew in area by approximately and 24,000 residents.

==Economy==
The economy of Kent consists of commuters traveling to the main urban centers of the Seattle metropolitan area (particularly downtown Seattle), extensive manufacturing and warehousing within the city, and retail/personal services catering to residents. The manufacturing and distribution industry in Kent and the surrounding area ranks 4th among markets in the United States.

Corporate headquarters in Kent include Oberto Sausage Company, Seattle Bicycle Supply, Omax Corporation and aerospace manufacturer Blue Origin. Amazon, Boeing, Whirlpool and General Electric operate sizable facilities in the city. Due to its central location within the metropolitan area, Kent is home to a large and growing warehouse district. To honor the 100th anniversary of Oberto Sausage Company&#x27;s presence in the city, the city designated a section of South 238th Street as Oberto Drive in May 2018.

===Boeing===

Boeing Kent Space Center was opened with a public dedication ceremony on October 24, 1964. Keynote speakers at the event were William &quot;Bill&quot; Allen, Chairman and CEO of The Boeing Company; future Washington Governor Dan Evans; and Alex Thorton, Mayor of the City of Kent. The event featured public tours of the labs and facilities that were used to build the Lunar Roving Vehicles used in the Apollo program.

===Steel===
Kent is home to a large steel industry dating back to the early 20th century. Steel and metal manufacturers include:

*Salmon Bay Steel Company: Operated in Kent for 50 years before closing down. Birmingham Steel purchased Salmon bay in 1991. Salmon bay went on to buy Bethlehem Steel (Seattle Steel) in West Seattle. Years after the purchase, complaints were made of pollution in the Green River valley about pollution from the Salmon Bay melting facility, and the facility was shut down.
*Puget Sound Steel: Puget Sound Steel is an independently owned and operated-unique specialty fabricator of reinforcing steel and a supplier of related reinforcement products, since 1961. Puget Sound Steel has been the Northwest&#x27;s select supplier of fabricated rebar and steel reinforcement to commercial, highway, industrial, and residential building contractors. Works include large scale projects including bridges and skyscrapers.
*Pacific Metal Company: In 1947, started in Seattle and opened a 19,000 square foot plant. The business and facilities continued to grow for 30 years to meet local needs as well as the emerging markets of Alaska. Even the expanded 40,000 square foot warehouse and sales office was deemed insufficient, and in 1979, an 80,000 square foot facility was built south of the city of Seattle in the Kent Valley at Tukwila. In September 2010 PMC moved to a new location just 3 miles SE in the city of Kent, Washington. Pacific Metal Company is a stocking distributor of non-ferrous metals specializing in stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and brass products as well as ferrous products specializing in Cold Rolled, Coated (Zinc and Aluminum) and pre-painted coils and sheets.

<text>Kirkland is a city in King County, Washington, United States. A suburb east of Seattle, its population was 92,175 in the 2020 U.S. census which made it the sixth largest city in King County and the twelfth largest city in the state of Washington.

The city&#x27;s downtown waterfront has restaurants, art galleries, a performing arts center, public parks, beaches, and a collection of public art that includes bronze sculptures.

Kirkland was the original home of the Seattle Seahawks; the NFL team&#x27;s headquarters and training facility were located at the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point) along Lake Washington for their first ten seasons then at nearby Northwest University through 2007. Warehouse chain Costco previously had its headquarters in Kirkland. While Costco is now headquartered in Issaquah, the city is the namesake of its &quot;Kirkland Signature&quot; store brand. American video game company Valve was also founded in Kirkland.

==History==

The land around Lake Washington to the east of Seattle was first settled by bands of the indigenous Duwamish people, including the &quot;Xačua’bš&quot; (&quot;lake people&quot;) and &quot;Tahb-tah-byook&quot;. Several Duwamish village sites lie within the modern-day boundaries of Kirkland, including &quot;staɬaɬ&quot; (&quot;a fathom measure&quot;) in the modern-day downtown and &quot;Təb’tubiu&quot; (&quot;loamy place&quot;) at Juanita Bay. The indigenous settlements were close to natural resources, including salmon, venison, and wapato plants harvested for their bulbs. Disease such as smallpox eliminated a majority of the local indigenous population with the development around Lake Washington, including lowering the water level for the Ship Canal in 1916 left the remaining population to decline further.

English settlers arrived in the late 1860s, when the McGregor and Popham families built homesteads in what is now the Houghton neighborhood. to the north people also settled near what is now called Juanita Bay, a favored campsite of the Duwamish because of the abundance of wapato there. The Curtis family arrived in the area in the 1870s, followed by the French family in 1872. The Forbes family homesteaded what is now Juanita Beach Park in 1876, and settled on Rose Hill in 1877. Gradually, additional people settled in the area, and by the end of the 1880s a small number of logging, farming and boatbuilding communities were established.

In 1886, Peter Kirk, a British-born enterprising businessman seeking to expand the family&#x27;s Moss Bay steel production company, moved to Washington after hearing that iron deposits had been discovered in the Cascade Range. Other necessary components such as limestone, needed in steel smelting, were readily available in the area. Further yet, a small number of coal mines (a required fuel source for steel mills) had recently been established nearby in Newcastle and train lines were already under construction. Plans were also underway to build the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

Kirk realized that if a town were built near the water it would be a virtual freshwater port to the sea, as well as help support any prospective mill. At the time, however, Kirk was not a U.S. citizen and could not purchase any land. Leigh S. J. Hunt, then owner of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, offered to partner with Kirk and buy the necessary real estate.

Under their new venture, the Kirkland Land and Development Company, Kirk and Hunt purchased thousands of acres of land in what is now Kirkland&#x27;s downtown in July 1888. Kirk and his associates started the construction of a new steel mill soon after, named the Moss Bay Iron and Steel Company of America. After founding the city of Kirkland in 1888, officially one of the earliest on the Eastside at the time, Kirk&#x27;s vision of a &quot;Pittsburgh of the West&quot; was beginning to take form. Construction soon commenced on several substantial brick homes and business blocks that would house and serve the steel mill employees.

However, the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which had recently been purchased by Tacoma-based Northern Pacific, had now refused to construct a rail line to the lake. This would, after all, have a negative impact on Tacoma, which was furiously competing with Seattle as the dominant Puget Sound seaport. The ensuing financial issues and numerous obstacles took a toll on Kirk, who was running out of investors. Hunt was also in debt from the purchase of land.

Nevertheless, the plans continued and the steel mill was eventually completed in late 1892 on Rose Hill (a full from the lake&#x27;s shore). Financial issues arose and due to the Panic of 1893 the mill subsequently closed without ever producing any steel. In spite of everything, Kirk was determined not to give up on his namesake town, and Kirkland was finally incorporated in 1905 with a population of approximately 532. A final attempt at a steel mill in Kirkland was planned by James A. Moore in 1906. His Northwestern Iron &amp; Steel Company paid $250,000 in cash for a site, but the mill never materialized. This came at the heels of the Pacific Steel Company, incorporated earlier in 1906 by J.F. Duthie, William Calvert and L.S. Cragin. This company soon amounted to nothing.

In 1900, the Curtis family made a living operating a ferry-construction business on Lake Washington. Along with Captain John Anderson, the Curtises were among the first to run ferries in the area. &quot;Leschi&quot;, first operated on December 27, 1913, was the original wooden ferry to transport automobiles and people between the Eastside and Madison Park until her retirement in 1950. The ferry operations ran nearly continuously for 18 hours each day. The construction of the first Lake Washington floating bridge in 1940, however, made ferry service unprofitable and eventually led to its cancellation. Subsequent years saw wool milling and warship building become the major industries.

The first woolen mill in the state of Washington was built in Kirkland in 1892. The mill was the primary supplier of wool products for the Alaska Gold Rush prospectors and for the U.S. military during World War I. By 1917, after the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the construction of ocean-going vessels had become a major business. By 1940, the thriving Lake Washington Shipyard had constructed more than 25 warships during World War II for the U.S. Navy, on what is now Carillon Point.

===Annexations===

Since the incorporation of Kirkland in 1905, the city has grown to approximately 12 times its original geographic boundaries, nearly doubling in size during the 1940s and 1960s.

Kirkland consolidated with the neighboring town of Houghton on July 31, 1968, to form one city of 13,500. It annexed the neighborhood of Totem Lake in 1974, and the neighborhoods of South Juanita, North Rose Hill, and South Rose Hill in 1988, which were the largest annexations undertaken in Washington in nearly two decades. This added a further 16,119 people to Kirkland&#x27;s population and was responsible for 76 percent of Kirkland&#x27;s population increase between 1980 and 1990.

On November 3, 2009, responding to a county initiative to encourage cities to annex or incorporate many of the unincorporated areas within the county, as well as a state sales tax incentive intended to ease the process, three previously unincorporated districts north of the city—Finn Hill, North Juanita, and Kingsgate—voted on whether to annex to Kirkland. The measure failed by seven votes to reach the 60% margin, which was required because the measure included accepting a share of the city&#x27;s voter-approved debt. However, since the affirmative vote was over 50%, the city council could and did vote to accept the annexation, without the assumption of debt.

The annexation added 33,000 residents (combined total population of around 80,000) and nearly to Kirkland on June 1, 2011. For a 10-year period from 2011 to 2021, the city was eligible and filed annually for a special Annexation State Sales Tax Credit (ASTC) from the State of Washington to bridge the millions of dollars deficit in providing municipal services in the annexation area. The ASTC expired in 2021.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
In 2006, Kirkland was the first city in Washington to adopt a Complete Streets ordinance, whereby pedestrian and bicycle facilities are addressed as a part of all road construction and improvement planning projects. Kirkland passed an Active Transportation Plan in 2009 specifically targeting improvements to pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian facilities.

Kirkland is served by King County Metro and Sound Transit Express buses that converge in Downtown Kirkland, the Totem Lake neighborhood, and South Kirkland. The city also has several park and ride facilities along Interstate 405. Buses connect Kirkland to Bellevue, Seattle, Redmond, Bothell, Kenmore, and Woodinville.

As part of Sound Transit 3, Kirkland is slated to receive a short Link light rail line from Issaquah and Downtown Bellevue that will terminate at South Kirkland Park and Ride. Originally scheduled to open in 2041, due to projected revenue declines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sound Transit Board issued a Sound Transit 3 &quot;realignment&quot; plan on August 5, 2021, which delays the Issaquah to South Kirkland light rail line to 2044. The Sound Transit 3 program also includes a bus rapid transit line on Interstate 405, with stops at NE 85th Street and the existing Totem Lake Freeway Station. The NE 85th Street station is projected to cost $235–300 million, making it one of the most expensive bus projects under consideration by Sound Transit, due to the need to completely rebuild the cloverleaf interchange. The city&#x27;s existing transit center is about a mile away and about lower in elevation. For a time the first aerial tramway in the Seattle area was discussed to connect the two. The station was originally planned to open in 2024 after three years of construction, but Sound Transit is delaying opening to 2026 due to revenue declines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="138008" wikidata="Q1514977" url="?curid=138008" title="Lake Forest Park, Washington">
<text>Lake Forest Park is a suburban city in King County, Washington, United States, located northeast of Seattle. It was developed in the 20th century as a bedroom community with single-family housing on medium to large-sized lots. Less than 4% of the city&#x27;s land is zoned commercial, largely concentrated in one location, and there are no industrial areas.

The city is situated at the northwest end of Lake Washington along State Route 522, which provides connections to Seattle and Bothell. Lake Forest Park includes several parks and nature reserves, access to the Burke–Gilman Trail, and organized summer events. The population of the city was 13,630 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lake Forest Park was founded in 1912 by Ole Hanson as one of the Seattle area&#x27;s first planned communities. Envisioned as a picturesque retreat for professionals, the developers planned roads and lots in strict consideration for natural landmarks. The original prospectus for lot sales declared:
…the strict fiat has gone forth that all the natural beauty must be preserved; that no tree must unwittingly be cut down; that the natural wild flowers must remain; that the streams, the springs, the lake front, the nodding willows, the stately cedar, the majestic fir, the quivering cypress and the homelike maple and all the flora and fauna with which Nature has blessed this lakeshore, must not be defiled by the hand of man.
Until 1914 and completion of the Red Brick Road (now Bothell Way, part of State Route 522) to nearby Kenmore and Bothell, it also marked the literal end of improved roads heading north from Seattle, with the best access to points further north and east being by boat across Lake Washington or the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway.

Lake Forest Park officially incorporated on June 20, 1961, in large part to help maintain its specific identity. The town remained small - under 5,000 in population - until the 1990s, when a series of annexations expanded city borders significantly and more than doubled the official population.

The 3/4 acre Lyon Creek Park was created in the late 1990s on land purchased by the city in 1998. For the prior fifty years, the lot had belonged to Marcia and Robert Morris, who had built a modernist home and a horse stable on the property. Both buildings were torn down as part of the park conversion, which also included replanting the park with 5,000 native shrubs and plants. The replanting portion of the project involved the labor of hundreds of citizen volunteers.

Lake Forest Park Town Center, the city&#x27;s commercial core, was built in 1964 and hugs Bothell Way, not far from the lakeshore. In late 2005, city government began holding public meetings to discuss the future of the town center. The decision was made to renovate Lake Forest Park Town Center and it now spans 18 acres and offers many shopping and dining options along with entertainment. Lake Forest Park Town Center is also home to a branch of the King County Library System, Third Place Books, and Third Place Commons community center.

==Geography==

Lake Forest Park is situated at the north end of Lake Washington. The city&#x27;s southern boundary begins at the city limit of Seattle. To the north, Lake Forest Park ends at the Snohomish county line, where the adjacent towns of Mountlake Terrace and Brier border it. To the east, the city is bounded by Lake Washington and at 55th Avenue NE where the city of Kenmore begins; the Burke-Gilman Trail runs in parallel to the lake shore, following the shoreline into Kenmore to the north, and Seattle to the south. The city&#x27;s western boundary is at the City of Shoreline&#x27;s city limit, mostly following 25th Avenue NE.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The two largest streams are Lyon Creek and McAleer Creek, both of which provide habitat for salmon. The shoreline includes two private beach clubs but no public boat access to Lake Washington; however, Lyon Creek Waterfront Preserve offers 100 feet of Lake Washington shoreline and a viewing dock that extends out into the lake.

===Parks===
* Horizon View Park is located at the highest point in Lake Forest Park and offers fields, a children&#x27;s playground with swings and a play train, a basketball half-court, tennis court, play field, picnic tables, and paved pathways through a natural, wooded area. Horizon View covers 8.4 acres and is located at 19800 47th Ave NE (198th St at 47th Ave NE).
* Pfingst Animal Acres Park is located at NE 178th St and Brookside Blvd and features picnic tables, a 0.25 mile walking loop, a salmon viewing platform, and a beautiful dogwood flower-shaped drinking fountain for people and dogs. The park is also home to a bust of Admiral Miguel Grau Seminario that was presented to the City of Lake Forest Park by the Consulate General of Peru and the Peruvian Navy in 2011.
* Grace Cole Nature Park is a 15.2 acre wetland named after distinguished State Representative Grace Cole and is located at 30th Ave NE at NE 166th St. The Lake Forest Park Stewardship Foundation hosts regular &quot;ivy out&quot; work parties in the summer to restore and preserve the wildlife habitat.
* Lyon Creek Waterfront Preserve is located across the street from the Lake Forest Park Town Center at 17337 Beach Drive NE, next to the Lake Forest Park Civic Club. A short trail and boardwalk are perfect for viewing where Lyon Creek meets Lake Washington. This park includes 100 feet of Lake Washington shoreline.
* Whispering Willow Park is found at 17038 44th Ave NE. The park features a short boardwalk, seating, and a natural children&#x27;s play area. It connects 44th Ave NE with the Lake Forest Park Town Center.


==Government==
Lake Forest Park has a mayor–council government with an elected city council composed of seven members. The mayor is a separate elected position with four-year terms.

The City of Lake Forest Park uses strategic partnerships with neighboring cities to provide shared services, including recreational opportunities. A partnership with City of Shoreline&#x27;s Recreation Department offers residents discounted access to their programs.

The Lake Forest Park Municipal Court was established in 1961 and processes approximately 10,000 filings annually. The presiding judge is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council for a four-year term. The Shoreline/Lake Forest Park Youth Court (SLFPYC) operated under the supervision of the Shoreline District Court and the Lake Forest Park Municipal Court. Lake Forest Park operates its own municipal police agency.

==Neighborhoods==
Lake Forest Park Town Center forms the city&#x27;s commercial core. This one complex includes the public library, police department, city hall, and approximately 40 shops, small businesses, and medical/professional offices. Third Place Commons is a large public space that occupies much of the central building&#x27;s upper level. In the summer, this same complex hosts a large outdoor farmer&#x27;s market. Until late 2007, the city was also served by a finance unit post office in the same complex, the functions of which have since been moved to nearby Shoreline. The Town Center was also home to Shoreline Community College&#x27;s Lake Forest Park satellite campus but it is now closed.

Residential neighborhoods include:
* Horizon View, in the northeast corner of the city, is characterized by its proximity to Horizon View Park, the highest point in Lake Forest Park. The park sits atop a small plateau, approached by several steep hills. Half of the &quot;train park&quot;, as some local youth refer to it, is the park, which was improved between 2001 and 2003, also in early 2013 with a trail extension, field upgrades and a new playset. The other half is a reservoir. They hold recreational sports in the park.
* Sheridan Beach/Heights, in the southeast corner of the city, is characterized by its proximity to the Sheridan Beach Club, to which its residents have access for a fee.

<text>Telewest (previously Telewest Broadband and Telewest Communications) was a cable internet, broadband internet, telephone supplier and cable television provider in the United Kingdom. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was also once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

In March 2006, Telewest merged with fellow cable telecom company NTL, and created &quot;NTL:Telewest&quot;, which then also merged with Virgin Mobile and Virgin.net in June 2006, creating the United Kingdom&#x27;s first &quot;quadruple play&quot; telecom provider, offering television, internet, landline phone and mobile phone services. In February 2007, NTL:Telewest was rebranded as Virgin Media.

== History ==
Telewest originated in Croydon in 1984 under the name &quot;Croydon Cable&quot;. United Cable, of Denver, acquired Croydon Cable in 1988. Franchises extended the company scope into Edinburgh and the southwest and southeast of England. In 1989, United Cable merged with United Artists Cable International.

In May 1991, United Artists announced a merged deal with its largest shareholder Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), to form the largest cable operator in the United States; the deal was valued at $142.5m, and by June the deal was improved. The deal was finalised a week later on 8 June 1991, with TCI acquiring the remaining 46% of United Artists, to allow full control.

TCI and US West announced a joint venture, and in 1992, the joint venture company became Telewest Communications, a combination of the names of both founding companies. In June 1995, Telewest merged with SBC Communications, adding franchises in the Midlands and North West serving 1.3 million homes. During this time Telewest founded a consortium called Cable Internet. This consisted of the major cable companies in the United Kingdom working together to provide a national Internet access service.

In March 1998, Telewest announced a merger with General Cable, and acquired the outstanding interest in Birmingham Cable, adding a further 1.7 million franchise homes in Yorkshire, west London and Birmingham. Telewest purchased the remaining 50% stake in Cable London from NTL in August 1999, adding 0.4 million franchise homes in North London.

Telewest merged with Flextech in April 2000, and in November, extended its cable network with the acquisition of Eurobell, taking the total number of homes passed to 4.9 million. The company later became known as &quot;Telewest Broadband&quot; in a rebrand during 2001. Telewest experienced financial difficulties in subsequent years, owing to the debts incurred as a result of constructing its cable network and acquiring other cable companies and assets. Notably, the Eurobell acquisition had been funded by an equity based deal, with a cash option; the poor performance of the company&#x27;s stock meant that the cash option was favourable, and the company was not able to cover the call.

In September 2003, Telewest restructured itself, by swapping its unsecured debt for 98.5% of its shares. The London Stock Exchange then delisted the consolidated shares. Major Telewest shareholders included Huff and Liberty Media (run by cable tycoon John Malone).

=== Takeover by NTL ===
The takeover of Telewest by NTL – a company of similar size, operating in different parts of the UK – was announced in October 2005, at a reported cost of $6bn. At that time, Telewest had 8,400 staff in the UK. The combined company at first used the name NTL:Telewest, then changed its name to Virgin Media in 2007, following the acquisition of Virgin Mobile the previous year.

===Nickelodeon dispute===
In late 2004, negotiations for renewed carriage of the Nickelodeon channels (Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Nicktoons) broke down; Telewest was unwilling to pay extra to keep the channels and preferred to drop them. Other Viacom-owned channels remained, such as MTV and, the now former, Paramount Comedy 1. 
The reaction to this by customers was fairly large and many left the provider to rival Sky, with Nickelodeon even encouraging the move. Other customers were retained by Telewest offering them a free upgrade to the Disney Channel for periods of between one and three months, while others were reportedly offered upgrades to Sky Movies packages in an attempt to keep them from leaving. The Nickelodeon channels returned to the Telewest platform on 12 February 2005 following successful renegotiation in Nickelodeon&#x27;s favour.

==Marketing strategies==
Telewest used a number of marketing strategies over the years, with a solid corporate identity not coming out until the end of 2005, to coincide with a &quot;three for £30&quot; offer. Until 2007, the company used the mascot Ellie West to promote its services. In November 2004, when &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was released, Telewest promoted Blueyonder internet services with branding from the film, including television adverts starring characters from the film.

== Operations ==

Telewest provided several residential services on its cable network, including:

=== Television ===
The majority of Telewest&#x27;s television was digital. There were, however, areas that received an analogue service (Slough, Windsor and some areas in west London). Late in its independent existence, Telewest was in the process of converting the remaining analogue areas to digital, and it was expected that the analogue service would cease in 2007.

The digital television service offered a number of different products including true video on demand, a PVR, and HDTV.
* On Demand (formerly known as Teleport) was the brand name for Telewest&#x27;s video on demand (VOD) service. The on Demand service launched in 2005. In contrast to Sky Digital which, due to technical limitations, is only able to provide near VOD services, Teleport is a true VOD system. Users could search through a large library of programmes and watch them when they want to as part of their subscription.

This library included a free seven day watch again feature for television programmes produced by the BBC, Channel 4 and Virgin Media Television (formerly known as Flextech). On Demand also offered movies that could be purchased and watched as many times as desired within a twenty four hour period. On Demand also offered HD content that worked in conjunction with the Telewest PVR (now renamed the V+).
* HDTV Telewest was the first United Kingdom broadcaster to offer HDTV. Telewest&#x27;s HDTV service launched several months earlier than that of their chief competitor, Sky Digital.

Telewest&#x27;s HD service initially comprised around 10–30 hours per week of video on demand content, with no linear high definition television channels available, although the early trial services of BBC HD and ITV HD were carried for a brief time. In January 2006, Telewest started to broadcast HD documentaries such as &quot;The Blue Planet&quot;, &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot; through their Teleport service, and later broadcast some movies in HD.

Telewest had an agreement with both ITV and the BBC, and claimed to be the only provider in the United Kingdom to offer all the 2006 FIFA World Cup matches in HD. In reality, however, half of the final group stage matches were not available in HD. Telewest&#x27;s HD service was provided exclusively through their TV Drive box. Sky launched their HD service in May 2006, initially charging a £300 setup fee and an additional £10/month for several subscription HD channels, including HD versions of Sky One, Sky Movies and Sky Sports. Telewest charged a £75 setup fee and £10/month, although no subscription HD channels were offered. Telewest&#x27;s fees however included the TV Drive recording service, equivalent to the recording features of the Sky+ service.
* TV Drive was the name of Telewest&#x27;s Digital video recorder (PVR) service. The product incorporated a 160 gigabyte hard drive as standard, meaning it was able to store around 80 hours of recorded programmes. This was in contrast to BSkyB&#x27;s Sky+ service which offered only 80 gigabytes (40 hours). Similarly, Telewest&#x27;s product incorporated three tuners while Sky&#x27;s incorporated only two, meaning that Telewest&#x27;s service could record two channels at the same time while watching a third. A few days ahead of the rebranding to Virgin Media, TV Drive was renamed &quot;V+&quot;.

=== Internet ===
Telewest&#x27;s internet service called Blueyonder, formerly branded as Cable Internet, used the cable infrastructure and offered speeds of 2 Mbit/s, 4 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s downstream. The broadband service was &#x27;uncapped&#x27;, meaning that its use was unlimited and no extra charges were payable related to the amount of data downloaded. The offering included free webspace where customers could create their own websites, which was discontinued for new customers after the rebranding to Virgin Media.

In November 2006, after the merger with NTL, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that subscriber traffic management was being trialled in areas of northern England, and would be rolled out nationwide. Blueyonder also provided dial-up internet services on a pay-as-you-go tariff, or a fixed monthly fee of £14.99 for unlimited use.

=== Telephone ===
* Talk Unlimited
* Talk Evenings and Weekends
* Talk Weekends
Provided landline calls for up to an hour for a fixed fee monthly inclusive of line rental. Telewest were the first landline company in the United Kingdom to offer &#x27;unlimited&#x27; calls to landlines for a fixed monthly fee.
* Talk Mobile
Mobile calls with 25% reduction from standard rates.
* Talk International
Similar principle to Talk Mobile, with different reductions to different countries.
* Talk Anywhere
Packages including 200, 400, or 800 minutes of usage per month. Telewest were the first landline company to offer a package of this kind which included bundled minutes every month that could be carried over to the next. It included calls to mobiles, landlines (01 and 02; latterly also 03), businesses with 0845 and 0870 numbers, and specified international mobiles and landlines. It was available nationally, varying in price depending on the number of minutes.

== Broadcasting ==

Telewest owned Flextech, a content-provider with a number of wholly owned channels (including Bravo and LIVINGtv). Additionally, Flextech had a 50% share in UKTV (with BBC Worldwide), and owned Sit-Up Ltd, who operated Screenshop, bid TV, price-drop TV and Speed Auction TV.

<text>Maple Valley is a city in King County, Washington United States. The population was 28,013 at the 2020 census. The city functions as a commuter town for residents, though there is an increasing amount of commercial activity in the area.

==History==
The area was settled in 1879 by three men who were improving a trail and brought their families in. When a name for a future community was proposed, the names Vine Maple Valley and Maple Ridge were suggested. A vote was taken by writing the names on slips of paper and placing them in a hat. Vine Maple Valley won by 2/3, but the word &quot;Vine&quot; was later cut by the post office because it made the name too long.

The town&#x27;s early history mainly had to do with coal, lumber milling to build homes, and a railroad that ran through town. Coal was brought in from Black Diamond to the south, but the town itself also mined coal from Cedar Mountain. The mine was used as late as 1947.
Rail workers for lines like the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Cedar River Watershed, closed off by the City of Seattle, meant more workers for those things. More residents meant more lumber milling. More lumber milling meant more workers. Suquamish tribe chairperson Martha George was born near Maple Valley in Sheridan in 1892, at a logging camp where her mother and grandmother worked as cooks.

The town grew inward. Blacksmith shops, hotels, saloons and stores took up the town in the 1910s and 1920s. Schools went up as well. Early schools were shacks at best. A two-room school went up in 1910, and a larger high school was built in 1929 as the first school in the Tahoma School District. The school, after extensive renovations, still stands today as an elementary school. Much of this early development actually did not take place in the modern-day city, but rather in Hobart, northeast of incorporated Maple Valley.

More residents meant farming and fishing became staples in the area, with milk, poultry and berry farming becoming the main grown food staples in the area. Fishing out of the Cedar River also became popular. Maple Valley also saw resorts beginning in the 1920s. Lake Wilderness, once the site of a county lumber mill, quickly became a resort lake with the opening of Gaffney&#x27;s Grove, which opened with a ballroom, restaurant and roller rink. Later, the resort grew to include an airstrip, lodge, rental cabins, a nine-hole golf course and a bowling alley. It remained in operation until 1964.

Increasing automobile use in the area gave rise to new roads being built. In the early 1960s, the construction of State Route 18 between Auburn and North Bend ran through the city, requiring many landmarks to be either demolished or moved. The Maple Valley Historical Society keeps records on the city&#x27;s past, with two historical museums holding artifacts such as the city&#x27;s first fire engine and photographs of old places in and around the city like Gaffney&#x27;s Grove.

===Incorporation and recent development===
The city of Maple Valley was officially incorporated on August 31, 1997. The Green to Cedar River trail runs through the city, along SR 169 and Witte Road while passing through the former Gaffney&#x27;s Grove site, now the Lake Wilderness City Park. The park includes a swimming beach and sprawling grass fields, and sees the annual Maple Valley Days Parade each year in June. The Lake Wilderness Arboretum is also located here.

Due to the urban growth boundaries of King County, the city is uniquely split into different sectors along Maple Valley Black Diamond Road (SR 169), the main thoroughfare through the city. At the northern and southern boundaries of the city lie two large commercial areas, while central Maple Valley is predominantly residential.

The south side&#x27;s Four Corners district is the main commercial area of the city. It is located along Maple Valley Black Diamond Road and is bisected by Kent Kangley Road (SR 516) to create four distinct areas of development. The northwestern corner underwent massive reconstruction in the early 2010s and now features several large retailers, apartments, and a strip mall. The northeastern corner was completely constructed in the 2010s; it formerly was a large lumberyard and is now home to several retailers. The southern corners feature strip malls, retailers, an apartment complex, and a housing development.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The main bodies of water in the city limits are Lake Wilderness, Lake Lucerne, Rock Creek, and part of Pipe Lake. The Cedar River passes through unincorporated King County very near the northeastern border of the city. The city is bordered by Hobart, Fairwood, and Ravensdale, two unincorporated King County census-designated places, along with the cities of Covington, Renton, Kent, and Black Diamond.

<doc id="138017" wikidata="Q1506847" url="?curid=138017" title="Medina, Washington">
<text>Medina () is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States. The mostly residential city is on a peninsula in Lake Washington, on the opposite shore from Seattle, bordered by Clyde Hill and Hunts Point to the east and water on all other sides. The city&#x27;s population was 2,915 at the 2020 census. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, along with a number of billionaires and executives for tech companies, have homes in Medina.

==History==

The eastern shore of Lake Washington between Meydenbauer Bay and Evergreen Point was a sparsely-populated area that was cleared for its timber in the 1870s. Seattle businessman Thomas Dabney established a claim on the south side of modern-day Medina in 1886, becoming the area&#x27;s first permanent white settler. Dabney built a ferry dock in 1890, naming it Dabney&#x27;s Landing, while the surrounding area was turned into berry farms and fruit orchards. Other settlers arrived at Dabney&#x27;s Landing, which was briefly named Flordeline by its founder until objections were raised by a group of women who proposed the Arabic name &quot;Medina&quot; in 1891. After a series of debates and sign-switching incidents, Medina won and was adopted as the name of the town.

Medina was platted in 1914 and officially incorporated on August 19, 1955. The town&#x27;s first mansions were built in the 1920s by wealthy Seattle businessmen, encouraged by the arrival of direct ferry service, and led to the nickname of Washington&#x27;s &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. The area&#x27;s farmers, mostly of Japanese descent, were evicted during the 1940s internment and their farms were turned over for redevelopment.

==Surveillance==

In 2009, Medina, with the &quot;wide support of residents&quot;, installed cameras at intersections along roads entering the city. The cameras are used to capture the license plate number of every car, and a security system automatically notifies local police if the captured number is recorded in a database. Travelers are notified of the presence of the system with signs that read &quot;You Are Entering a 24 Hour Video Surveillance Area&quot;; according to Medina&#x27;s police chief, all captured information is stored for 60 days even if nothing negative is found in the database, allowing police to mine data if a crime occurs later. One of the city&#x27;s council members said the system was motivated by the belief that the need for crime prevention &quot;outweighs concern over privacy&quot;. The system was inspired by that used in adjacent Hunts Point, a town of about 500 residents which has not had a break-in for more than three years after installing their system.

==Tree Code==
Designated as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation since 2006, Medina has always been a leader in urban tree codes. Since 1972, the City of Medina has codified the value that trees bring to a community, and the Tree Code ordinances have consistently been modified throughout the years. Major revisions in 2000, 2003 and 2006 have improved the code such that it is one of the most extensive in the region. The current code (2006 edition) protects large trees and requires significant mitigation if they are removed.

In 2011, the City Council directed the Planning Commission to update the existing tree code. Dividing the task into two phases, the Planning Commission brought Phase I, which were largely administrative changes, to Council in 2014, where it was passed into law. Phase II changes have been underway since then, with much work and input from the community, an ad hoc tree committee, the Planning Commission and City Council. It is anticipated that the new code will be adopted in mid-2015.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Medina is connected to Seattle, on the western shore of Lake Washington, by State Route 520 on the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, the longest floating bridge in the world.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Medina has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Government and politics==

The City of Medina is a non-charter code city with a council–manager government. The city council is composed of seven members elected in non-partisan, at-large elections to four-year terms. The council elects a ceremonial mayor and deputy mayor from its members, serving a two-year term, and appoint a city manager to execute its legislative policies and oversee the government. The current city manager is Steve Burns. Despite its wealthy residents, the city government had a budget shortfall of 8 percent forecast for 2020. A property tax increase was approved by a narrow margin in the November 2019 elections.

Medina has traditionally been a Republican stronghold at the local and national levels. However, like neighboring communities, it has become more competitive between the two major parties in recent elections.

<text>Mercer Island is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located on an island of the same name in the southern portion of Lake Washington. Mercer Island is in the Seattle metropolitan area, with Seattle to its west and Bellevue to its east.

The island is connected to the mainland on both sides by bridges carrying Interstate 90, with the city of Seattle to the west and the city of Bellevue to the east. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the parallel Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge are floating bridges that span Lake Washington and carry, respectively, eastbound and westbound lanes of Interstate 90 and connect Mercer Island to the northern portion of Seattle&#x27;s South End. I-90 traverses the northern portion of Mercer Island and is then carried from the island to Bellevue over the East Channel of Lake Washington by the East Channel Bridge. Mercer Island is located closer to Bellevue than it is to Seattle, and is therefore often considered to be part of King County&#x27;s Eastside.

The population was 25,748 at the 2020 census. Mercer Island is one of the 100 richest ZIP codes in the US according to the IRS figures for Adjusted Gross Income.

==History==

The western side of the island was home to two Snoqualmie villages prior to white settlement in the Puget Sound region. Mercer Island, named for the Mercer family of Seattle, was first settled by non-indigenous people between 1870 and 1880. The Mercer brothers often rowed between the island and Seattle to pick berries, hunt, and fish. Those brothers, Thomas Mercer and Asa Mercer, were members of the Mercer family of Virginia. The first large settlement, East Seattle, was toward the northwest side of the island—near the McGilvara neighborhood. During 1889, a C.C. Calkins built a large and gilded resort, the Calkins Hotel. The hotel was reached via steamboat between Madison Park, Leschi Park, and the Eastside. Guests included President Benjamin Harrison, of 1901, amongst other well-to-do dignitaries from Seattle to the East Coast of the United States. Burned by a mysterious fire, the hotel was razed during 1908.

The Calkins Landing continued service and presumably aided the establishment of a more permanent population. A denser urban community with business district developed toward the central northern island between the McGilvra neighborhood and Luther Burbank Park. This community now composes the majority of the island&#x27;s crest through the Middle Island neighborhood.

In 1923, the East Channel Bridge was built to connect the island with Bellevue. In 1930, George W. Lightfoot requested a bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, currently the second longest floating bridge in the world, was built and opened in 1940. In 1989, a second bridge, the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, was built parallel to the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. The East Channel Bridge, Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, and Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, carry Interstate 90 from Seattle, across Mercer Island, and into Bellevue.

The City of Mercer Island was incorporated from East Seattle on July 5, 1960, and comprised all the island minus the business district. Just over one month later, August 9, the Town of Mercer Island was incorporated from that business district. The two aforementioned municipalities merged as the City of Mercer Island on May 19, 1970.

==Transportation==
Mercer Island is bisected by Interstate 90, which connects the city to Seattle in the west and Bellevue in the east. The freeway travels over the Lacey V. Murrow and Homer M. Hadley floating bridges over Lake Washington to Seattle and the East Channel Bridge towards Bellevue. The bridges also carry the Mountains to Sound Greenway, which includes a multi-purpose pedestrian and bicycle path. A significant section of the freeway is recessed below street level and covered by the Mercer Island Lid, which includes several parks.

The city&#x27;s public transportation is provided by King County Metro and Sound Transit, mainly consisting of express bus routes to Seattle and the Eastside. Several routes connect to a park and ride on the north side of the island with 447 stalls. It was expanded into a two-story parking garage in 2008. All-day service for most of the island is provided by Metro Route 204, which is supplemented by Route 630 and several school bus routes during peak periods.

In early 2025, a light rail station at the park and ride facility will be opened by Sound Transit, providing service on the 2 Line to Seattle and the Eastside. The light rail line will replace several express routes on Interstate 90 and Mercer Island is expected to function as a major bus–rail interchange.

<text>Newcastle is an Eastside city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 13,017 at the 2020 census.

Although Newcastle was not incorporated until 1994, it has been an important settlement and town since the late 19th century and played a major role in the development of Seattle and the surrounding region. Newcastle was one of the region&#x27;s first coal mining areas and its railroad link to Seattle was the first in King County. Timber also played a role in the early history of Newcastle. Coal delivered by rail from Newcastle&#x27;s mines to Seattle fueled the growth of the Port of Seattle and attracted railroads, most notably the Great Northern Railway.

The Newcastle coal mine began producing coal by the 1870s. More than 13 million tons of coal had been extracted by the time the mine closed in 1963. The history of Newcastle&#x27;s coal mining industry and the legacy of the mines&#x27; many Chinese laborers are memorialized in place names such as Coal Creek, Coal Creek Parkway, and the Coal Creek and China Creek golf courses.

Based on per capita income, Newcastle ranks 11th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. In CNN Money&#x27;s 2011 rankings of best places to live in the United States, Newcastle was in the top 20, along with nearby Sammamish. It ranked 17th in &quot;Newsweek&#x27;s&quot; 2009 rankings of best places to live in the United States.

==History==
Coal was discovered along Coal Creek in 1863 by surveyors Philip H. Lewis and Edwin Richardson, who had been working in the area for the United States General Land Office. Newcastle was named for the idiom &quot;Coals to Newcastle&quot; by a party of coal surveyors in 1869 according to F. H. Whitworth, who was part of the party. One of them suggested the name &quot;New Castle&quot; which was subsequently adopted by all parties of interest. The idiom itself refers to the English city of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Newcastle (originally spelled &quot;New Castle&quot;) as a village was properly established by the 1870s, though the official date given for the founding of the town is 1869, as seen on the seal for the City of Newcastle. By 1872, 75–100 tons of coal per day were being produced at Newcastle. About 60 men worked at the mines. The Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad, the first railroad in King County, reached Newcastle from Seattle in 1878. Coal mining ended in 1963.

The area was an unincorporated area within King County until it incorporated as a city on September 30, 1994. Currently the city is a suburban community. Based on Newcastle&#x27;s location north of Renton, south of Bellevue, and across Lake Washington from Seattle, these are the communities in which most of the residents of Newcastle work. East of southeast Lake Washington is a large quantity of hilly terrain, which creates opportunities for view properties. This created the impetus for the location of the Newcastle Golf Course, along with many high-value homes at higher elevations with views of downtown Bellevue, Seattle, and Mercer Island, as well as the Olympic Mountains. Notable attractions of the area include the Golf Club at Newcastle, a brand new Family YMCA, Lake Boren Park, a well developed trail system, and nearby Cougar Mountain in the east of Newcastle.

===Newcastle and Newport Hills===
The community was not always known as Newcastle. When suburban development came in the 1960s, the old mining town of Newcastle was long gone and all but forgotten. The area then became known as Newport Hills.

In the early 1990s there was a movement to incorporate as a new city. But some members of the community objected—some believed that the new city would be too small to be viable, while others feared that the city council would be in the pocket of the hilltop golf course. In 1993, five parcels of Newport Hills each voted to annex themselves into Bellevue. Those 5 parcels comprised nearly half the population of the community. They became the Newport Hills neighborhood of Bellevue. When Newport Hills incorporated as a new city the following year, their first order of business was to choose a new name, since it would now be confusing to have a city of Newport Hills adjacent to the Newport Hills neighborhood of Bellevue. Residents voted on Cougar Mountain and Newcastle and chose the latter.

==Newcastle trails==

The city has an active trail-building community, creating a system of trails that are being integrated into new housing developments and parks. Most of the trail-work has been completed by volunteers and the Washington Conservation Corps, sponsored by the city of Newcastle. The trail system will eventually lead all the way to Lake Washington to the west, in conjunction with Renton, and is already connected to Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park to the east, which is in unincorporated King County.

==Zip codes==
The city has not obtained its own ZIP code even though, based on the ZIP code designation, some sales taxes paid by Newcastle residents go to Renton instead of Newcastle as tax revenues (among other perceived detrimental impacts related to mail service, insurance rates, property values, and credit ratings). This is all the more troubling considering the small size of Newcastle with a small commercial district which does not create as much property tax or sales tax revenue for the city compared to neighboring cities like Renton to the south, Bellevue to the north, or Issaquah to the east.

==Geography==
Coal Creek flows through the city from the Issaquah Alps to Lake Washington. Lake Boren is located near downtown.

Newcastle is bordered to the north by Bellevue, to the south by Renton, to the east by unincorporated land on Cougar Mountain, and to the west by Lake Washington.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>North Bend is a city in King County, Washington, United States, on the outskirts of the Seattle metropolitan area. The population was 7,461 at the 2020 census. The city is east of Seattle on Interstate 90 and lies in the foothills of the Cascade Range near Snoqualmie Pass.

Since the closure of Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s Snoqualmie sawmill, North Bend has become a prosperous bedroom community for Seattle and Bellevue. The city was made famous by David Lynch&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which was partially filmed in North Bend. The community is also home to Nintendo North Bend, the main North American production facility and distribution center for the video game console manufacturer Nintendo.

==History==


The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe has resided in the Snoqualmie Prairie, including the area now known as North Bend, for thousands of years. This prairie southeast of Snoqualmie Falls was the ancestral home, hunting and forage grounds for the Snoqualmie people and was located in the upper Snoqualmie Valley near the Snoqualmie River fork confluence, Mount Si, and the western foothills of the Cascade Range.

One of the first American explorers to the upper Snoqualmie Valley was Samuel Hancock, who arrived in 1851. Hancock traveled upriver with his Snoqualmie guides, fording canoes around the falls to reach Snoqualmie Prairie, searching for coal deposits. He was taken to a &quot;very extensive and fertile prairie&quot; about two miles above Snoqualmie Falls. The beautiful open grassland came to be known as the Snoqualmie Prairie, the heart of which is now known as Tollgate and Meadowbrook farms. The Snoqualmies, led by Chief Patkanim, later sided with early settlers in the 1850s Indian Wars and were one of the signatory tribes of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, which failed to designate an Indian reservation for the Snoqualmies. Some of the soldiers in those wars, such as the Kellogg brothers, established cabins near remaining Snoqualmie blockhouses; however, the most well known American resident in the valley was Jeremiah Borst, who arrived in 1858.

After the Homestead Act of 1862, more settlers ventured to the Snoqualmie Valley, with the first families settling near Borst on the easterly end of Snoqualmie Prairie. In 1865, Matts Peterson homesteaded the site that ultimately became North Bend. In 1879, Peterson sold the property to Borst and moved east of the Cascades. Borst wrote to Will Taylor, who had left the Pacific Northwest to pursue mining in California, and offered him the Peterson homestead in exchange for labor. Taylor returned and became the driving force in developing the city while expanding his property to include a thriving trading post and boarding house for travelers over Snoqualmie Pass. On February 16, 1889, with the upcoming railroad boom, Taylor formally platted a city including his farm, upcoming street plans and building lots, giving it the name &quot;Snoqualmie Prairie&quot;. Later that summer, competing Seattle land speculators subsequently platted nearby &quot;Snoqualmie Falls&quot;, choosing a similar name. Pressured by demands of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway to avoid confusion, Taylor reluctantly renamed his city &quot;Mountain View&quot;. However, the U.S. Post Office Department objected to &quot;Mountain View&quot;, as a city with that name already existed in northern Whatcom County. To conclude the matter Taylor agreed to permanently rename the community &quot;North Bend&quot;, after its prime location near the large northward bend of the South and Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River. Taylor was proud of his new, thriving city, but by historical accounts, &quot;He never got over having his city name taken away.&quot; North Bend was officially incorporated on March 12, 1909, and grew throughout the 20th century, with an early economic focus on logging, sawmill production, agricultural and dairy farming.

The city government issued a moratorium on new construction in April 1999 after it exceeded the limits on its existing water rights to pump groundwater. It was lifted in 2009 after North Bend secured an agreement with Seattle Public Utilities to provide water and construction of a new pipeline from the Cedar River watershed. North Bend, which had transitioned into a bedroom community by the late 20th century, began attracting recreation and outdoors businesses in the 2010s. The city also developed tourist activities centered around the 1990s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which was partially filmed in North Bend, Snoqualmie, and Fall City.

==Culture==

===Historic McGrath Hotel===
The McGrath Hotel is located on the site of the cabin of William Henry Taylor, who platted North Bend in 1889. In October 1921, Jack McGrath and his wife Caroline purchased the site of their future venture, McGrath&#x27;s Café; construction was completed as a one-story restaurant in 1922. In early 1926 the building was expanded two window bays westward, creating the hotel lobby (now the restaurant bar), and a second story was added to the entire structure to accommodate the hotel rooms of the new McGrath Hotel. After several years of deferred maintenance, the McGrath was purchased in 2000 by a local couple who spent two years rehabilitating the building. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first floor currently houses a popular restaurant, the Iron Duck Public House.

===Historic North Bend Theatre===
On April 9, 1941, the North Bend Theatre opened its doors. Built at a cost of $12,000 with 400 seats, the 4,000 square foot theater&#x27;s occupancy is now 265 and it has continued operating as an independent movie theater since its opening day through seven family ownerships. In 1999, the theatre underwent a major renovation. In 2013, the theater was once more saved from extinction by a successful $100,000+ fundraiser to convert the projection system from 35mm cellulose to 4K digital video. During this series of renovations every part of the building was improved without sacrificing the distinctive character of this 1941 Art Deco theater. The renovation was awarded a Spellman Award, a King County honor, for the efforts.

The movie house hosted the opening premier of the David Lynch movie, &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me&quot;.

<doc id="138023" wikidata="Q1503082" url="?curid=138023" title="Ravensdale, Washington">
<text>Ravensdale is a census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 555 at the 2020 census.

Based on per capita income, Ravensdale ranks 50th out of 522 areas in the state of Washington.

==History==

Ravensdale was originally called &quot;Leary&quot;, after the Leary Coal Company, in turn, named for John Leary, a Seattle pioneer. The latter name came from the flocks of ravens that fed on grain spilled from the boxcars on the Northern Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the town. Underground coal mining commenced around 1899 by the Seattle and San Francisco Railway and Navigation Company, although coal had been mined in nearby Danville and Landsburg a few years earlier. The coal mines were later acquired by the Northwest Improvement Company (NWI), a subsidiary of Northern Pacific. In 1907, Ravensdale was a coal mining town with a population of about 1,000 residents, most of whom worked for the mining company. Ravensdale was officially incorporated on August 15, 1913. On November 16, 1915, at 1:25 p.m. an explosion occurred at the mine, killing 31 men, one of the worst coal mining accidents in Washington state history. The NWI mine was closed permanently and many of the immigrant miners left town seeking work elsewhere. A number of coal miners from Ravensdale moved to Ray, Arizona, to mine copper. The town was disincorporated in the 1920s.

Over the decades, coal mining continued to fuel Ravensdale&#x27;s economy as new mines were developed operating on the Danville, Landsburg, and McKay coal seams. The Dale Coal Company became one of the more successful from about 1924–1941, followed by the Continental Coal Company from 1942 to 1944, the Anderson Coal Company from 1943 to 1948; and Palmer Coking Coal Company from 1937 to 1975. On January 29, 1955, four miners were lost in the Landsburg mine when a cave-in filled the mine with water, mud and debris. On December 17, 1975, at 2:30 p.m., the Rogers No. 3 mine was dynamited shut by Palmer Coking Coal Company. This was the last underground coal mine in the state of Washington.

<doc id="138024" wikidata="Q679952" url="?curid=138024" title="Renton, Washington">
<text>Renton is a city in King County, Washington, United States, and an inner-ring suburb of Seattle. Situated southeast of downtown Seattle, Renton straddles the southeast shore of Lake Washington, at the mouth of the Cedar River. As of the 2020 census, the population of Renton was 106,785, up from 90,927 at the 2010 census. The city is currently the 6th most populous municipality in greater Seattle and the 8th most populous city in Washington.

After a long history as an important salmon fishing area for Native Americans, Renton was first settled by people of European descent in the 1860s. Its early economy was based on coal mining, clay production, and timber export. Today, Renton is best known as the final assembly point for the Boeing 737 family of commercial airplanes, but it is also home to a growing number of well-known manufacturing, technology, and healthcare organizations, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes Division, Paccar, Kaiser Permanente, Providence Health &amp; Services, UW Medicine, and Wizards of the Coast.

==History==
Long a cultural center for the Duwamish, European settlers arrived in the area of present-day Renton in the 1870s. First among them were Henry Tobin and his wife Diana. The town of Renton was accessed via the Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad, the first railroad to be built to Seattle, and was in the vicinity of several coal mines that attracted entrepreneurs like Erasmus M. Smithers, who is credited with the founding and establishment of the town in 1875. Smithers named Renton in honor of Captain William Renton, a local lumber and shipping merchant who invested heavily in the coal trade. Smithers discovered coal there and brought in Charles D. Shattuck as the coal mine operator.

Renton was incorporated as a city on September 6, 1901, when coal mining and timber processing were the most important economic industries in the area. The town was prone to flooding from the Cedar River and Black River. In 1916 the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal lowered the surface of Lake Washington by several feet which consequently eliminated drainage of Lake Washington through the Black River (in favor of the Ship Canal). The Cedar River was then diverted to drain into Lake Washington instead of into the Black River. As a result, the Black River largely disappeared, leaving only a few remnants. The culmination of these actions reduced the threat of annual flooding.

The population sharply increased during World War II when Boeing built their Renton Factory to produce the B-29 Superfortress. Renton grew from a population of 4,488 in 1940 to 16,039 in 1950.

The game company Wizards of the Coast also is headquartered in Renton. Providence Health System has centralized its administrative offices in Renton, along with Group Health Cooperative.

Owing to its location at the confluence of three major freeways (I-5, I-405, and SR 167), Renton&#x27;s economic development team has lured a number of specialty retailers that draw consumers from around the region, including IKEA. Some retail establishments were unwanted though, and the city successfully defended zoning restrictions on pornographic theaters before the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.&quot;

The Renton Public Library was built directly over the Cedar River and opened in 1966. It stretches across the river, next to Liberty Park, and was the main branch of the city&#x27;s independent library system until its 2010 annexation into the King County Library system.

===21st-century redevelopment===

The city government has encouraged redevelopment of industrial areas around Downtown Renton and near Southcenter since the 1980s. The first IKEA in the Pacific Northwest opened in Renton in 1994 at a former Boeing building; the original building was replaced by a new store on the same site in 2017. The former Longacres horse-racing track was redeveloped in the 1990s to support offices for Boeing and the Federal Reserve Bank, which moved from its Seattle building. Port Quendall, a land parcel in north Renton, is home to the Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC), housing the Seattle Seahawks Headquarters and training facility that opened in August 2008; before then, the Seahawks trained in Kirkland.

In the mid-1990s, Renton undertook a major redevelopment effort to revitalize its downtown core, which had declined in commercial prominence since the opening of the Southcenter Mall in Tukwila in 1968. The many car dealerships that had previously occupied the center of downtown Renton were encouraged through economic incentives to relocate to a newly created auto sales zone close to the I-405/SR-167 interchange. In place of the old dealerships downtown, a new transit center and parking garage were built in partnership with King County Metro. The transit center is surrounded by several multi-family residential buildings and a small town square named Piazza Park, which hosts a weekly farmers&#x27; market.
Centered on former Boeing Co. property near the south shore of Lake Washington is a residential and commercial development named The Landing. To the north of the Landing, a hotel and office development on the lakefront called Southport has been developed at the site of the former Shuffleton power plant, which was demolished in 2001. A 347-room hotel operated under the Hyatt Regency brand opened in June 2017.

In 2017, Bosa Development announced plans to build five residential towers between 16 and 23 stories at Quendall Terminals, a Superfund site in Renton on the shore of Lake Washington. The proposal was never formally approved by the city government, which had permitted six-story buildings on the site, and was dropped in 2024.

==Geography==

Renton is located on the southeast shore of Lake Washington at the mouth of the Cedar River. The city is bordered to the north by Newcastle. Along the east side of Renton is the urban growth boundary established by King County, as such there is no incorporated city directly east of Renton. The southern border is shared with Kent, while the western border consists of the city of Tukwila and the unincorporated community of West Hill.

The geographical characteristics of Renton&#x27;s eastern border are varied and include (from north to south) the south flank of Cougar Mountain descending southward merging with the community of May Valley. The terrain then elevates south of May Valley to the communities of the East Renton Plateau before descending to the north bank of the Cedar River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, most of which is the Cedar River.

Potential Annexation Areas (PAAs) include the communities of Fairwood southeast of Renton, the East Renton Plateau on the eastern edge of Renton, and West Hill northwest of Renton. These communities are large unincorporated urban areas that are encouraged by the King County Annexation Initiative to incorporate as cities or annex into neighboring cities. As of 2012 these three PAAs are not part of the City of Renton, and not included in its demographics or statistics.

Renton is one of the cities in the Puget Sound region with an independent street grid system. Roads names beginning with sectional divisions (N 32nd Street) generally follow a latitudinal direction, while roads names ending in a sectional direction (Duvall Ave NE) generally follow a longitudinal direction. Many of the avenues in the city are named in honor of other cities in Washington.

==Economy==

Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Boeing Capital, Providence Health &amp; Services, and Wizards of the Coast have their headquarters in Renton.

The Boeing Renton Factory has operated since World War II, when it manufactured the B-29 Superfortress; currently, it produces the 737 airliner. The Renton plant produced the Jetfoil and Pegasus class hydrofoils in the 1970s. As of 2001, 40% of all commercial aircraft in the air were assembled in Renton. Boeing remains the largest employer in Renton, which is home to over 10,000 employees and three of the aerospace giant&#x27;s six major business divisions: Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Boeing Capital Corporation and the Shared Services Group. The local newspaper in the 1970s, the Record-Chronicle, proclaimed the city the jet capital of the world.

Paccar has traditionally been a large employer in the city as well with its Kenworth Truck plant located in Renton&#x27;s industrial area on the south end of Lake Washington. In 1907 the Seattle Car Mfg Company also known as the Car Company moved to a large manufacturing plant in Renton after demand for the company&#x27;s railroad equipment exceeded the capacity of its Seattle plant. The Car Company was the only manufacturer of train cars on the west coast.

The Renton plant expanded to foundry capabilities in 1911, and Seattle Car and Foundry Co merged with the Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1917 and became the Pacific Car and Foundry Company or Paccar. During the great depression, the Renton Paccar plant developed power winches for use in the logging industry. When World War II arrived the Renton manufacturing switched its production towards the war effort, and by the war&#x27;s end in 1945 had built 1,500 Sherman Tanks. In the second half of the 20th century there was not enough repeat business for Paccar-built train cars as rail equipment in 1965 came to only 1/3 of the company&#x27;s sales. Thus the Paccar Renton plant began manufacturing structural steel until the 1970s recession. In the early 1980s the Paccar Railcar Division; the last remnants of the original Pacific Car and Foundry Co closed down. In 1993, a new Kenworth assembly plant opened on the former site of Pacific Car and Foundry.

===Top employers===
As of 2022 the top employers in the city are:

==Education==
Renton Technical College, originally opened in 1942 as a war production school, offers associate degrees and certificates of completion in professional-technical fields.

The Renton School District provides K–12 public schooling. Additionally, the Issaquah School District serves a small portion of unincorporated Renton neighborhoods. The Tahoma School District serves a small portion of Renton along Maple Valley Highway. The Kent School District serves the majority of Fairwood, a census-designated place between Renton and Maple Valley.

The Renton School District includes the four high schools: Hazen High School, Lindbergh High School, Renton High School, and Albert Talley Senior High School. The school district also has four middle schools and fifteen elementary schools.

Parts of the city are also served by the Issaquah School District, Kent School District, and the Tahoma School District, all of which predominantly serve neighboring cities.

==Government==
Renton has a mayor–council government that oversees municipal services and contracts with other entities for utilities. The mayor and seven councilmembers are elected to four-year terms in staggered, at-large elections. Councilmembers are divided into working committees that recommend legislation to the whole council in meetings.

==Sister cities==
Renton has two sister cities:
* Nishiwaki, Hyogo, Japan (since 1969) 
* Cuautla, Jalisco, Mexico (since 2001)

==Transportation==

Renton is served by King County Metro and Sound Transit Express buses. Metro operates the RapidRide F Line through the city and plans to expand bus rapid transit service in the 2020s; Sound Transit is scheduled to open its own bus rapid transit service, Stride along the Interstate 405 corridor through Renton in 2026.

The city government owns and operates Renton Municipal Airport (KRNT), officially Clayton Scott Field, a public airport at the foot of Lake Washington. It is used by the Boeing Renton Factory as well as for charter services and flight training.

The BNSF Railway operates a freight railroad through Renton that includes a brief street-running portion on Houser Way in downtown. The railroad carries Boeing 737 fuselages bound for the Boeing assembly plant north of downtown. A second line with street-running portions, along Burnett Avenue to serve the Paccar plant, was removed in 1972 to eliminate 18 grade crossings. BNSF also owned the Woodinville Subdivision, a branch line on the east side of Lake Washington, which was used by the Spirit of Washington dinner train. The excursion service ran from Renton to Woodinville from 1992 to 2007. The Woodinville Subdivision was converted to a multi-use trail, known as Eastrail, by the King County government in 2018.

<doc id="138027" wikidata="Q988209" url="?curid=138027" title="Sammamish, Washington">
<text>Sammamish ( ) is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 67,455 at the 2020 census. Located on a plateau, the city is bordered by Lake Sammamish to the west and the Snoqualmie Valley to the east. Sammamish is situated 20 miles east of Seattle, is a member of the Eastside, and is a part of the Seattle metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
Sammamish is a Snoqualmie name formed from the words &quot;squax&quot; (Sammamish Lake) and &quot;abs&quot;, a suffix used to describe people of a specific area. The name is roughly translated to &quot;people of Lake Sammamish&quot; in the Snoqualmie language.

==History==
Lake Sammamish and the adjacent plateau has been Duwamish, Suquamish, Snoqualmie, Sammamish, and Snohomish territory since the last Pleistocene glaciation, before contact with European people. They lived in longhouse villages in seven places on and near the coast of Sammamish Lake. Two of them were in present-day Sammamish.

The Sammamish Plateau was part of unincorporated King County for most of its recorded history. The first settlers arrived in the 1870s and established a trio of resorts by the 1930s. The plateau remained a mostly rural area until suburban homes, shopping centers, and schools were built in the 1970s and 1980s. However, from approximately 1900 through the Great Depression, there was a tiny hamlet in Inglewood community (at today&#x27;s Weber Point) of approximately 50 people who called the area &quot;Sammamish&quot;, and later, in the 1960s, there was a suburban community and school at what is now Sunny Hills. A vote in 1991 to join neighboring Issaquah failed, as did a vote on incorporation the following year. A renewed movement to become a city, born of frustration with development policies set by the county government, met with voter approval in 1998. Sammamish was officially incorporated on August 31, 1999. The city annexed Klahanie on January 1, 2016.

The city government approved plans in 2008 to develop a denser town center with mixed use zoning and taller buildings. The first two residential buildings and several commercial developments were completed over the following decade, but plans for the largest phase stalled into the 2020s. Construction began in 2024 on 38 townhomes in the phase, which is planned to be followed by more townhomes, 600 market rate apartments, and commercial space.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

The city is situated on the shores and hilly terrain east of Lake Sammamish. It is bordered to the south by Issaquah, to the northwest by Redmond, and to the west across Lake Sammamish by Bellevue. Beaver Lake and Pine Lake are the two biggest lakes in Sammamish. Yellow Lake is a major lake in Klahanie.

Sammamish is in and near the Issaquah Alps, a westward extension of the Cascade foothills.
===Climate===
The city has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), or oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) if the isohyet is used. Due to the rain shadow effect of the Olympic Mountains to the west, summers are much drier here than on the immediate west coast of Washington.

Winters are cool and wet; the wettest months are November, December, and January, when the area is directly affected by the Aleutian Low, and summers are warm and dry; the driest months are July and August. Snowfall is rare; subfreezing temperatures usually occur with a high-pressure system, which brings clear skies. Extremes range from in February 1950, to in June 2021.

Sammamish is in hardiness zone 8b, with small southwestern pockets as well as the immediate Lake Sammamish coast falling into type 9a.

===Climate change===
Sammamish is predicted to warm by 3-12 F (2-7 C) before 2100 regardless of future emissions, and around 2.5 F during the next few decades due to climate change. Warming by any significant amount will cause Sammamish to have reduced snowfall, hotter and drier summers, and more warm-season extreme weather events.

Sammamish&#x27;s climate change action plan includes, but is not limited to, tree replacement, voluntary planting, protecting threatened species, protecting native fish such as Chinook salmon and the streams, lakes and ponds they live in, floodplain management, wetland protection, emission reduction, light/noise pollution reduction, toxin (pesticide) control, and many other measures.

<text>Shoreline is a city in King County, Washington, United States. It is located between the city limits of Seattle and the Snohomish County border, approximately north of Downtown Seattle. As of the 2020 census, the population of Shoreline was 58,608, making it the 22nd largest city in the state. Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Shoreline ranks 91st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.

==History==

===Coast Salish===

The modern-day Shoreline area is within the historic territory of local Coast Salish peoples, now considered subgroups of the Duwamish. A trail stretched from Salmon Bay (šilšul), where Shilshole (šilšulabš) villages were, to Green Lake, and then traveled north through bogs that housed Licton Springs and the headwaters of the south fork of Thornton Creek, and continued up to Haller Lake. From there it wound through the peat bogs where Twin Ponds and Ronald Bog Parks are now. Large quantities of cranberries were once gathered at these bogs, as well as salmonberries and skunk cabbage along the banks of Thornton Creek. The x̌ax̌čuʔabš from Lake Union (x̌ax̌čuʔ) traveled to this area to gather cranberries.

From there the trail continued north to Echo Lake. There was a large burned area from Echo Lake, through the Richmond Highlands, and south to Bitter Lake, likely a clearing intentionally burned to maintain the harvest of roots like bracken fern and camas, berries, and hunting grounds. The trail forked at Echo Lake, one trail heading west to Richmond Beach and one trail continued north to Lake Ballinger. The šilšulabš had seasonal camps at Richmond Beach and Boeing Creek, which were notable sources of kinnikinnick and is commemorated in a local park name, Kayu Kayu Ac. At Lake Ballinger, the trail forked into three trails: northeast to Hall Lake and Scriber Lake and the surrounding marshes, southeast along McAleer Creek to the current Town Center at Lake Forest Park, and northwest to a large marsh that is now downtown Edmonds. The people who lived in Lake Forest Park and other winter villages along Lake Washington (x̌ačuʔ) were called x̌ačuʔabš.

===Modern settlement===

Shoreline as is now known began in 1890 with the platting of the neighborhood of Richmond Beach, on Puget Sound, in anticipation of the arrival of the Great Northern Railway the next year. Over the next two decades, Shoreline was connected to Seattle via the Seattle–Everett Interurban streetcar line (1906) and North Trunk Road (now Aurora Avenue N., State Route 99) (1913), helping to increase its population.

The name &quot;Shoreline&quot; was applied to this stretch of unincorporated King County in 1944 when it was given to the school district, since the school district boundaries stretched from &quot;Shore to Shore&quot; (Puget Sound to Lake Washington) and &quot;Line to Line&quot; (the old Seattle city limit of 85th St to the Snohomish County Line). Though the modern borders of the city do not stretch to Lake Washington, the area has kept the &quot;Shoreline&quot; name. From 1950 to 1957, it was the fastest-growing area in the Seattle metropolitan area, with a 64 percent population increase.

After the incorporation of Lake Forest Park in 1961, the remainder of the Shoreline School District remained an unincorporated portion of King County. The school district remained the main identifier for the area for several decades; a set of welcome signs were installed in 1983 by the Shoreline Chamber of Commerce bearing the name. The City of Seattle began studying an annexation of the area in 1988, causing local residents to organize an incorporation measure to retain their separate school system. A half-century after it had been named, on August 31, 1995, Shoreline was officially incorporated as a code city, and it adopted the council–manager form of government.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city of Shoreline also contains a gated community, The Highlands, which manages its utilities separately from Shoreline. The Richmond Beach neighborhood occupies the northwest corner of the city.

===Neighborhoods===

Shoreline is divided into 14 neighborhoods, according to the city government&#x27;s designation. The neighborhood boundaries have been laid out more-or-less rectangularly according to street maps, rather than following socioeconomic or natural boundaries.

The city maintains a council of neighborhoods, with the intent of bringing together community leaders from each of the neighborhoods for discussions and coordination of city programs that affect the neighborhoods.

If its offer to annex Point Wells is accepted by the developer, Shoreline will extend into south Snohomish County. As of 2020, The Shoreline city government and Woodway government have discussed plans for subarea policies and development regulations in the event of annexation of Point Wells by either Shoreline or Woodway. The governments of both of the urban areas have taken steps to update their plans in accordance to their joint committee.

==Economy==
Companies and organizations based in Shoreline include Crista Ministries.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Shoreline is bisected by two major north–south highways: Interstate 5, the main inter-city freeway in Western Washington; and State Route 99 (Aurora Avenue), which travels south to Seattle and north to Everett. State Route 523 (145th Street) forms the southern boundary of the city and connects Interstate 5, State Route 99, and State Route 522 (Lake City Way). The Interurban Trail runs along State Route 99 and follows the route of the former Seattle–Everett interurban railway. It was constructed in the 2000s to connect Seattle with Everett and was completed within Shoreline in September 2007.

The city has two Link light rail stations near Interstate 5 that are served by Sound Transit&#x27;s 1 Line: Shoreline South/148th station near the State Route 523 interchange; and Shoreline North/185th station near North City. Both stations have park-and-ride garages with a combined 1,000 stalls and will become termini for bus rapid transit lines. The county&#x27;s King County Metro provides local and commuter bus service within Shoreline, which includes the RapidRide E Line on Aurora Avenue. It debuted one of its first paratransit vans in the then-unincorporated area in 1979 to address a need for east–west connections. The agency has a bus base, named North Base, along I-5 in Shoreline that opened in 1991.

Shoreline began a bicycle-sharing and scooter-sharing pilot in August 2024 with Lime.

===Healthcare===

The city is home to the Fircrest School, a facility for people with developmental disabilities that is run by the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. Its campus was previously used as a naval hospital during World War II and sanitarium before being repurposed in 1951. The Washington State Department of Health also operates a public health laboratory on a portion of the campus that was opened in 1985 and designated as a COVID-19 quarantine site in early 2020.

<text>Skykomish is a town in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 161 as of the 2020 census, down from an estimated peak of &quot;several thousand&quot; in the 1920s.

Located in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 49 miles east of Everett, Washington, on the South Fork of the Skykomish River, Skykomish was founded as a railroad town. Today, it is mainly a stopping point for recreational access to the surrounding mountains, including skiing at nearby Stevens Pass.

Being located in the far northeastern corner of King County, mountains deny Skykomish any road access to the rest of the county. Instead, U.S. Highway 2 (known in the area as the Cascade Highway) connects it with Snohomish County to the north and through Stevens Pass (17 miles east of town) to Chelan County.

==History==
The name &quot;Skykomish&quot; derives from the Skykomish or Skai-whamish tribe (originally considered a subdivision of the Snoqualmies) who inhabited the area before European settlement.

John Maloney, a guide for the surveying team on the Great Northern Railway, settled a flat spot in 1892, which got the name &quot;Maloney&#x27;s Siding&quot;. The following year the railroad was completed, and when a post office was established, the place became known as Skykomish. The townsite was platted in 1889 and was officially incorporated as the town of Skykomish on June 5, 1909. Maloney opened Maloney&#x27;s General Store in 1893. A hotel, the Skykomish Hotel, soon followed. In 1902 this hotel burned to the ground and was replaced by Schneider&#x27;s Hotel. In 1904, a fire burned down every commercial building except the store. Maloney&#x27;s General Store was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1997. In 2000, the entire commercial district, with the historic Skykomish Hotel (erected to replace the burned-down Schneider&#x27;s Hotel in 1904) as its cornerstone, was also placed on the NRHP.

From the 1890s to 1974, Skykomish was a maintenance and fueling station for the Great Northern Railway, which eventually became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad, and presently the BNSF Railway. At its peak, eight passenger trains serviced Skykomish daily, and it saw stops by several named passenger trains including the Great Northern Flyer, the Oriental Limited, the Cascadian, the Western Star and the Empire Builder. It was also once the western terminus for electric operations (1928–56) on the Cascade Tunnel route all the way to Wenatchee. Here, steam or diesel locomotives were changed or coupled to electric locomotives. The Great Northern Depot, the former Skykomish station, was moved to a new city park in 2012 and today serves as a visitors center and history museum.

The town gained a public library service operated by the King County Rural Library District in 1944, its library opening the following year in the city hall. It moved to a new building in 1993, which was expanded in 2006.

Skykomish&#x27;s population peaked at around 8,000 in the 1920s and shrank to under 300 by 1990 due to the loss of businesses and jobs.

Legal but ill-advised waste disposal practices, common during that era, resulted in the contamination of its soil, its groundwater, and the Skykomish River by oil and heavy metals. The video class of the local school chose to document the oil
under the town, winning the 2002 President’s Environmental Youth Award. BNSF (then BN) and the Washington State Department of Ecology began remediation discussions in the mid-1980s, and in 2006, agreed to a plan whereby the railroad would pay up to $50 million to clean up the area over a three-year period (completed in 2009). This effort involved massive excavations—essentially removing the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil—and the rebuilding of a levee. (The eventual total cost of the cleanup exceeded $100 million.)

Twenty two of Skykomish&#x27;s buildings — both homes and business — were temporarily moved during the cleanup process. After the contaminated soil under them was removed, the buildings were moved back to their original locations on new foundations and utilities connections. The town was restored with modern conveniences such as sidewalks and street lights, but the historic character of Skykomish was maintained. The greatest benefit of the cleanup to every resident and business in town was the installation of the new Waste Water Treatment system connected to every building.

Led by point guard John Best, the Skykomish Basketball team won the 1954 State B championship beating the highly favored 3A Bainbridge. In 1954, Skykomish had a total of 51 students, Bainbridge had an enrollment of 266.

==Geography==
Skykomish has no direct road connection to the rest of King County, with access on U.S. Route 2 through Snohomish County. The relative isolation of Skykomish from the rest of the county and its services has led to calls for secession or joining Snohomish County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

==Climate==
Skykomish has a &quot;Cfb&quot; (bordering on &quot;Dsb&quot;, &quot;Dfb&quot;, and &quot;Csb&quot;) climate, with warm, sunny summers and cold, snowy winters.

An existing fiber-optic cable runs underground through parts of the town but did not serve its residents.

<text>Snoqualmie ( ) is a city next to Snoqualmie Falls in King County, Washington, United States. It is east of Seattle. Snoqualmie is home to the Northwest Railway Museum. The population was 14,121 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Snoqualmie&quot; comes from the name of the indigenous people of the same name. It is an Anglicization of the Lushootseed name &quot;sdukʷalbixʷ&quot;, which means &quot;people of the moon&quot;.

==History==

The second written record of the exploration of the Snoqualmie Valley comes from the notes of Samuel Hancock, who ventured up-river with the Snoqualmie tribe in 1851 in search of coal. Near the current location of Meadowbrook Bridge, Hancock was told by his guides that the land was known as &quot;Hyas Kloshe Illahee&quot;, or &quot;good/productive land&quot;. Hancock took this useful information back with him to the area now known as Tacoma. The area that is now Snoqualmie had been continuously occupied by members of the Snoqualmie Tribe and their ancestors for at least 13,000 years.

During the 1850s, tensions were very high between the native populations and the new settlers claiming the land as their own. In 1856, in response to these tensions, Fort Alden was built near a Snoqualmie village, in the area that would become Snoqualmie. After the Treaty War ended, Fort Alden was abandoned (along with other forts built around this time).

The most successful early pioneer in the Valley was Jeremiah Borst, who arrived in the spring of 1858 over the Cedar River trail from the eastern side of the mountains. He settled in the area that formerly held Fort Alden, and used his sales of pigs and apples in Seattle to buy out much of the surrounding land from other settlers.

As successful as farming was, other settlers had different methods of working the land. The first lumber mill in the Snoqualmie Valley was established at the mouth of Tokul Creek around 1872 by Watson Allen. Within five years, there were 12 logging operations on the Snoqualmie River, providing lumber to the entire Seattle region. Within 15 years, logging and mill work was employing 140 men and sending millions of board feet of logs down the river.

In 1882, the Hop Growers Association was founded by three Puget Sound partners, who used land purchased on Snoqualmie Prairie from Jeremiah Borst to create a farm that would eventually cover , of which was devoted solely to hops. This extremely successful venture (billed as &quot;The Largest Hop Ranch in the World&quot;) would fall prey to a combination of market and pest factors, and fell into relative obscurity by the end of the 1890s.

By the late 19th century, the Puget Sound region was growing, but bypassed by the major railways. In response, a group of Seattle entrepreneurs funded and built their own railway in an attempt to cross the Cascade Range. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway opened up the natural resources of the Snoqualmie Valley to the markets of the world, and brought in tourists to enjoy the natural beauty of the area and to marvel at the Falls.

The increased interest in the area led to a marked increase in speculation. Originally, the area that would become North Bend was platted as &quot;Snoqualmie Prairie&quot; in February 1889 by Will Taylor. The area that is currently Snoqualmie was platted in August of that same year as &quot;Snoqualmie Falls&quot; by investors from Seattle. The oral history of the area places the first residents of Snoqualmie as Edmund and Louisa Kinsey, who established the first hotel, livery, general store, dance hall, post office, and meat market – in addition to helping build the first church in the town. Two of their sons (out of six children) are most famous for their photography documenting the early timber works in the region.

The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant, the first power plant at the Falls, was built in the late 1890s by Charles Baker, an investor from Seattle who had assisted in the platting of the city. This development provided both power and jobs to the region, and a small company town grew up near the falls to house the workers. More than 100 years later, Baker&#x27;s original generators are still in use by Puget Sound Energy.

The official vote for incorporation of &quot;Snoqualmie Falls&quot; as the city of Snoqualmie occurred in 1903. At the time, land prices had not decreased since initially set in 1889 — prices that did not reflect the financial reality of the region. In response to these high prices, people had created a large &quot;squatting&quot; community, building where they wanted regardless of land ownership or interests. The first challenge that the city council faced was lowering lot prices and migrating these buildings off the public right-of way, establishing the basic layout of the town that exists to this day.

In 1917, a new all-electric lumber mill (the second in the U.S.) opened across the river from Snoqualmie, along with the company town associated with it, Snoqualmie Falls. For the first half of the century, the timber industry provided the city and valley with a stable source of income and employment, even as World War I drew away workers and the Great Depression took its toll across the nation.

This prosperity was moderated during the Depression, and with the changes in culture and mobility in the latter half of the century, Snoqualmie and the majority of the valley stagnated. The city was bypassed when US-10 was built across the Cascades (now Interstate 90), and this led to a shift in commerce to the east (into North Bend) and west (into the Bellevue/Issaquah areas).
By the 1960s, the homes that had made up the company town of Snoqualmie Falls had been moved to other locations within the valley, and the city&#x27;s population had stabilized to a growth rate of roughly 11 people per year over the next 30 years (from 1,216 in 1960 to 1,546 in 1990).

This slow growth cycle continued until the mid-1990s, when the city annexed of undeveloped land that became the site of the current &quot;master-planned&quot; community of Snoqualmie Ridge, now referred to as Snoqualmie Ridge I. Snoqualmie Ridge I includes 2,250 dwelling units, a business park, a neighborhood center retail area and The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge, a private, PGA Tour-sanctioned golf course. Snoqualmie Ridge II, annexed in 2004, contains an additional 1,850 dwelling units, a hospital and a limited amount of additional retail.

The city council has continued to balance the desire to retain the rural and historical feel of Snoqualmie with the needs of a growing population. The city&#x27;s historic downtown underwent a major renovation to improve its infrastructure and make the area more attractive to visitors to the valley&#x27;s many natural attractions. As of 2023, Snoqualmie has continued to experience growth and development, with new residential and commercial projects being completed, including the Snoqualmie Hospital in 2015, the Snoqualmie Inn, new restaurants, and more townhomes. In addition, the city has continued to provide many parks and recreation facilities, including a network of trails and public spaces such as the Snoqualmie Community Park, built in 2009.

In 2012, the city of Snoqualmie annexed of the former Weyerhaeuser mill site and mill pond (Borst Lake). The former mill office now hosts Dirtfish, an advanced rally car driver training school. The site is one of the largest undeveloped industrial zoned sites in King County, although significant planning and environmental review for potential future use remains to be done. The facility hosted a round of the 2014 Global RallyCross Championship.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

===Surrounding cities and communities===
===Climate===
Snoqualmie has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), or an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) when the threshold is used.
==Economy==
Until recently, logging and Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s milling operations were the mainstays of the local economy. Since 1989, the company has run a much smaller mill operation, and ceased all operations at the Weyerhaeuser Mill Site in 2003. While dairies were a significant local industry into the early 1950s, agriculture is no longer a major economic force in the community. With the completion of Interstate 90 in the 1970s, Snoqualmie became more accessible to Seattle and the Eastside region, resulting in more residents working in the communities to the west.

The Snoqualmie Ridge Business Park was developed in the 1990s on of land that was divided into parcels for over a dozen facilities. It employs over a thousand people, of which a majority live within the city. The business park&#x27;s major employers include Space Labs, Motion Water Sports, Technical Glass, T-Mobile, Zetec, and the King County Department of Permitting and Environmental Review. Philips Oral Healthcare has hundreds of employees in Snoqualmie that manufacture the Sonicare electric toothbrush.

The city is also home to a tourism industry that developed due to the scenic and recreational attractions in the area. The Snoqualmie Falls and adjacent Salish Lodge are a major attraction adjacent to Puget Sound Energy&#x27;s Snoqualmie Fall Park that draw 1.5 million annual visitors. The Northwest Railway Museum in downtown Snoqualmie owns a historic depot and operates heritage railway rides. The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe owns the Snoqualmie Casino, which opened in 2008 a few miles outside city center.

==Demographics==
===2013 study===
In April 2013, the city of Snoqualmie retained the Economic Development Council of Seattle and King County (EDC) to conduct research and make recommendations that would guide and support a marketing effort aimed at increasing occupancy in the Snoqualmie Ridge Business Park. The city was also interested in recommendations for the use of the Snoqualmie Mill site, and in an estimate of the potential for additional land absorption at Snoqualmie Ridge. EDC issued its final report in September 2013, with updated demographic information about Snoqualmie. The highlights are summarized here.

The average household income in this area is estimated to be $135,386 for the current year (2013), while the average household income is estimated to be $90,874 for King County, $108,160 for Bellevue, $111,460 for Issaquah, $74,847 for Washington, and $70,968 for the United States, for the same time frame. The average household income in this area is projected to increase 5.6% over the next five years, from $135,386 to $142,906. The United States is projected to have a 4.8% increase in average household income.

Education levels are also high. Currently, it is estimated that 9.0% of the population age 25 and over in this area had earned a Master&#x27;s, Professional, or Doctorate Degree and 24.3% had earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In comparison, for the United States, it is estimated that for the population over age 25, 8.9% had earned a Master&#x27;s, Professional, or Doctorate Degree, while 15.5% had earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The age distribution of the population shows that approximately 35% of the residents are children (age 0–19), 51% are age 20–54, and 14% are 55 and older. Thus the community is primarily a home for working families. Average household size is approximately 3.07; a &quot;typical&quot; household is two adults and one child. The current year median age for this population is 34.2, while the average age is 31.2. Five years from now, the median age is projected to be 35.1.

<doc id="138032" wikidata="Q1510339" url="?curid=138032" title="Tukwila, Washington">
<text>Tukwila ( ) is a suburban city in King County, Washington, United States, located immediately to the south of Seattle. The population was 21,798 at the 2020 census.

A large commercial center draws workers and consumers to the city daily; industry thrives with the confluence of rivers, freeways, railroads, and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

==History==
The earliest people in Tukwila were the Duwamish, who made their homes along the Black and Duwamish rivers. The name &quot;Tukwila&quot; is the Chinook Jargon word for &quot;nut&quot; or &quot;hazelnut&quot;, referring to the hazelnut trees that grew in the area. The Duwamish lived in cedar longhouses, hunted and fished, picked wild berries, and used the river for trade with neighboring peoples.

In 1853, the first white settler was Joseph Foster, a Canadian pioneer who had traveled to the Pacific Northwest from Wisconsin. Foster would become known as the &quot;Father of Tukwila&quot; and represented King County in the Washington Territorial Assembly for 22 years. Today, the site of Foster&#x27;s home on the banks of the Duwamish River is part of Fort Dent Park, which also served as a military base during the Indian Wars of the 1850s. Foster&#x27;s name is memorialized in the Foster neighborhood of Tukwila, where Foster High School is located.

In the early years, the small village grew into an agricultural center and remained a trading point in the upper Duwamish River Valley. Population began to grow and industry followed, largely farm-oriented commerce. Early electric trains traveled along Interurban Avenue in Tukwila, connecting to Renton and a line to Tacoma. The Interurban Railroad operated a commuter line from 1902 to 1928, making it possible to travel from Seattle to Tacoma in less than an hour. A post office was established in 1904 at Riverton, uphill from the interurban line and directly west of Foster. Centered around Marginal Way and South 130th Street, it is Tukwila&#x27;s most historically intact neighborhood. The original Tukwila was also settled in 1904, further south along the interurban line where a station was established. The first macadam paved road in Washington state was in Tukwila and bears the name of this new method of street paving. One of the earliest paved military roads in the state passes through the city.

With the main goal of establishing better fire protection and water service, better access to schools and safer roads, Tukwila was incorporated as a fourth-class city on June 14, 1908, with a population of around 450. The original city limits consisted of a single square mile centered around the local interurban depot; Riverton and Foster would be annexed later. The city&#x27;s first mayor was Joel Shomaker, a newspaperman who gave Tukwila its name soon after his arrival in 1904. Among the city&#x27;s first council members was Del Adelphia, a famous magician.

==Geography==

===Origins===
By 1992, a number of people from Mandan, North Dakota had moved to White Center.

==Education==

White Center is part of the Highline School District, which covers much of southwestern King County. Elementary schools include Beverly Park Elementary, Mount View Elementary, Southern Heights Elementary, and White Center Heights Elementary. Secondary schools include Rainier Prep Public Charter School, Cascade Middle School, New Start High School, and Evergreen High School.

==History==
===Origin of the name===
In 1918 George White and Hiram Green resolved the question of what to call the booming community. White won a coin toss with Green, and thereafter the community was called White Center. 

===Incorporation===
White Center is an urbanized area of King County that is not incorporated as part of a city. Seattle has been working towards incorporating the area since the mid-2000s. An area south of White Center, known as North Highline, was annexed by neighboring Burien on April 1, 2010. The Seattle city council rejected annexation of White Center in 2009, and a measure to annex White Center to Burien was rejected by voters in 2012. Plans to annex White Center got a boost in March 2016 when the state legislature directed that $7 million go to the city of Seattle if it annexes the area. Completing annexation would require approval by the voters in the area as well as by the Seattle City Council, and would not be completed before 2017.

<doc id="138037" wikidata="Q986378" url="?curid=138037" title="Woodinville, Washington">
<text>Woodinville is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 13,069 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the Seattle metropolitan area and is east of Bothell. Woodinville has waterfront parks on the Sammamish River, a winery district, and industrial areas along State Route 522.

==History==
The area along the Sammamish River, including modern-day Woodinville, is the historic territory of the indigenous Sammamish people. Other Coast Salish peoples also occupied and used the lands in the area, including a Duwamish subgroup known as the &quot;willow people&quot;.

In 1871, Ira Woodin and his wife Susan moved from Seattle and traveled up the Sammamish River where they built a cabin. They planned to log timber and farm cattle. A town gradually developed around them. Their cabin served as its first school and post office, with Susan Woodin appointed as postmaster. Woodin and his son-in-law Thomas Sanders set up the first general store.

Like other nearby towns, Woodinville began as a logging community and became a farming center in the early decades of the 20th century. After World War II, it developed as a suburb of Seattle. In 1969, rock bands including Led Zeppelin and The Guess Who performed at the Seattle Pop Festival at Woodinville&#x27;s Gold Creek Park.

The community sought either incorporation as a city or annexation by neighboring Bothell in the 1970s to improve services. A later attempt by Bothell to annex portions of Woodinville in 1985 was halted but inspired an incorporation campaign. The residents of Woodinville voted for incorporation on May 19, 1992, the third attempt at becoming a city; a previous attempt had been rejected by a margin of 14 votes. Woodinville was officially incorporated on March 27, 1993.

In the late 1990s, Woodinville attempted to annex the adjacent community of Grace in Snohomish County. The county&#x27;s government and the State Boundary Review Board rejected the proposal, citing the loss of tax revenue and legal issues with providing policing due to Woodinville&#x27;s contracts with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The area was also considered for a branch campus of the University of Washington that was ultimately built in Bothell.

<text>Bainbridge Island is a city and island in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is located in Puget Sound. The population was 24,825 at the 2020 census, making Bainbridge Island the second largest city in Kitsap County.

The island is separated from the Kitsap Peninsula by Port Orchard, with Bremerton lying to the southwest. Bainbridge Island is a suburb of Seattle, connected via the Washington State Ferries system and to Poulsbo and the Suquamish Indian Reservation by State Route 305, which uses the Agate Pass Bridge.

== History ==
For thousands of years, members of the Suquamish people and their ancestors lived on the land now called Bainbridge Island. There were nine villages on the island; these included winter villages at Port Madison, Battle Point, Point White, Lynwood Center, Port Blakely, and Eagle Harbor, as well as summer villages at Manzanita, Fletcher Bay, and Rolling Bay.

In 1792, English explorer Captain George Vancouver spent several days with his ship HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; anchored off Restoration Point at the southern end of Bainbridge Island while boat parties surveyed other parts of Puget Sound. Vancouver spent a day exploring Rich Passage, Port Orchard, and Sinclair Inlet. He failed to find Agate Passage, and so his maps show Bainbridge Island as a peninsula. Vancouver named Restoration Point on May 29, the anniversary of the English Restoration, in honor of King Charles II.

In 1841, US Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes visited the island while surveying the Pacific Northwest. Lt. Wilkes named the island after Commodore William Bainbridge, commander of the frigate USS &quot;Constitution&quot; in the War of 1812. Settlers originally used Bainbridge Island as a center for the logging and shipbuilding industries with the island being clearcut at least two times in its history. The island was known for huge and accessible cedars, which were especially in demand for ships&#x27; masts. The original county seat of Kitsap County was at Port Madison on the island&#x27;s north end.

In 1855, the Suquamish tribe relinquished their claim to Bainbridge Island by signing the Point Elliott Treaty. The Suquamish agreed to cede all of their territory (which included Bainbridge Island) to the United States in exchange for a reservation at Port Madison and fishing rights to Puget Sound.

The first generation of Japanese immigrants, the Issei, came in 1883. During World War II, Japanese-American residents of Bainbridge Island were the first to be sent to internment camps, an event commemorated by the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial, which opened in 2011. They were held by the US government through the duration of the war for fear of espionage. A High-frequency direction finding (HFDF) station was established here by the Navy during the war. These radio intercept sites along the West Coast were used to track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific. The other West Coast stations were in California at Point Arguello, Point Saint George, Farallon Islands and San Diego.

Since the 1960s, Bainbridge Island has become an increasingly affluent bedroom community of Seattle, a 35-minute ride away on the Washington State Ferries.

The city has occupied the entire space of Bainbridge Island since February 28, 1991, when the city of Winslow (incorporated on August 9, 1947), annexed the rest of the island after a narrowly passed November 1990 referendum. It officially remained the city of Winslow for several months, until November 7, 1991, at which time the city of Winslow was renamed the city of Bainbridge Island.

== Geography ==

Bainbridge Island was formed during the last ice age—13,000 to 15,000 years ago—when the Vashon Glacier scraped out the Puget Sound and Hood Canal basins.

Bainbridge Island is in the Puget Sound Basin, east of the Kitsap Peninsula, directly east of the Manette Peninsula and west of Seattle. The island is about wide and long, encompassing nearly , and is one of Puget Sound&#x27;s larger islands.

Bainbridge Island shorelines border the main body of Puget Sound, as well as Port Orchard Bay, a large protected embayment, and two high-current tidal passages, Rich Passage and Agate Pass. The island has an irregular coastline of approximately , with numerous bays and inlets and a significant diversity of other coastal land forms, including spits, bluffs, dunes, lagoons, cuspate forelands, tombolos, tide flats, streams and tidal deltas, islands, and rocky outcrops. The high point is Toe Jam Hill.

On the Kitsap Peninsula, Bremerton and Poulsbo lie across the Port Orchard channel to the west, and the city of Port Orchard lies across Rich Passage to the south. Despite the short distance over water and significant commuting population between Bremerton and Bainbridge Island, proposals to construct a bridge have been resisted on the Bainbridge side for various reasons.

The island is quite hilly and hosts the Chilly Hilly bicycle ride every February.Bainbridge Island can be accessed by motor vehicle, bicycle, or foot through two access points, both on Washington State Route 305. Bainbridge Island is connected to the Kitsap Peninsula by the Agate Pass Bridge, carrying SR 305 over Agate Passage at the island&#x27;s northwest corner. The only other way off the island is by the Seattle–Bainbridge Island ferry, the Washington State Ferries service from the dock at Winslow in Eagle Harbor to Colman Dock (Pier 52) in Seattle. Numerous public right of way access points to water around the island also exist, officially called Road Ends.

=== Communities ===
When the city of Winslow annexed the entirety of Bainbridge Island in 1991, it absorbed numerous named unincorporated communities. Most of these are still referred to by name.

== Demographics ==
According to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was $88,243, and the median income for a family was $108,605.

About 3.0% of families and 4.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.8% of those under age 18 and 3.3% of those age 65 or over.

The socioeconomic profile varies significantly between the rural parts of the island and Winslow, its urban center. In contrast to Bainbridge Island as a whole, Winslow is home to households with a wide range of incomes. In 2010, the census block group in which Winslow is located had a median household income of $42,000, less than half of the island&#x27;s median household income and one-third of several of the island&#x27;s wealthiest block groups, and also $10,000 less than national and statewide averages. More than half of Winslow households live in rental units, compared to 20% of households across the island.

<text>Bremerton is a city in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. The population was 43,505 at the 2020 census and an estimated 44,122 in 2021, making it the largest city on the Kitsap Peninsula. Bremerton is home to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and the Bremerton Annex of Naval Base Kitsap.

The city lies west of Seattle and is connected by an automobile ferry operated by Washington State Ferries and a passenger-only ferry operated by Kitsap Transit. Bremerton spans the Port Washington Narrows and extends inland along Sinclair Inlet opposite from Port Orchard.

==History==

Bremerton is within the historical territory of the Suquamish people. The land was made available for non-Native settlement by the Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855. Bremerton was planned by Seattle entrepreneur William Bremer in 1891. In that year, Navy Lieutenant Ambrose Barkley Wyckoff purchased approximately of waterfront land on Sinclair Inlet. This land was owned by the Bremer family. Three years earlier, a U.S. Navy commission determined that Point Turner, between the protected waters of the Sinclair and Dyes inlets, would be the best site in the Pacific Northwest on which to establish a shipyard. Recognizing the large number of workers such a facility would employ, Bremer and his business partner and brother-in-law, Henry Hensel, purchased the undeveloped land near Point Turner at the inflated price of $200 per acre. In April 1891, Bremer arranged for the sale of to the Navy at $50 per acre. This land became part of the initial footprint of the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

===1900–1930===

Bremerton was incorporated on October 15, 1901, with Alvyn Croxton serving as the city&#x27;s first mayor. Progress in the new city soon faced a major crisis, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Darling moved all repair work to the Mare Island Navy Yard in California in November 1902. Darling cited reports from commanders that the Bremerton waterfront was rife with prostitution, opium houses and frequent strongarmed robberies of sailors. Politics were probably also at play, as local newspapers reported that the city&#x27;s incorporation left the shipyard essentially landlocked without room to expand. A dispute ensued between Mayor Croxton, who wanted to shutter all saloons in Bremerton, and three members of the city council, who attempted to block his efforts. Croxton eventually won out, and the council voted to revoke all liquor licenses in June 1904. With the ban, Darling reestablished the navy yard as a port of call. Saloons had begun to return to business within two years, however.

In 1908, the city library and Union High School were established to serve the educational needs of the 2,993 residents recorded in the 1910 U.S. Census. During World War I, submarine construction and the addition of a third drydock caused the shipyard&#x27;s workforce to balloon to over 4,000 employees. Growth due to the war effort and the 1918 annexation of the city of Manette, east of Bremerton on the Port Washington Narrows, can be seen in the 1920 census, which reported a population of 8,918. Bremerton absorbed Charleston, its neighboring city to the south in 1927. The population reached 10,170 in 1930.

===1930s and 1940s===

Manette was linked to Bremerton by the Manette Bridge, a bridge constructed in June 1930. Prior to this time, the trip could only be made by ferry or a long trip around Dyes Inlet through Chico, Silverdale, and Tracyton on mostly unimproved roads. This wooden bridge was replaced with a concrete and steel structure in October 1949. It was replaced by the new Manette Bridge in 2011. At the shipyard, the Hammerhead Crane No. 28 was completed in April 1933. One of the nation&#x27;s largest, it is capable of lifting 250 tons and continues to dominate the Bremerton skyline.

At the peak of World War II, the Bremerton area was home to an estimated 80,000 residents due to the heavy workload of shipbuilding, repair and maintenance required for the Pacific war effort. Most of the relocation was temporary, though, and only 27,678 citizens were left in the city by 1950. During the 1940s, presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman both visited Bremerton. Roosevelt made a campaign stop at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on August 12, 1944, giving a national radio address in front of a backdrop of civilian workers. During the course of his 35-minute speech, it is believed the president suffered an angina attack, experiencing severe chest and shoulder pain. An electrocardiogram was immediately administered once he left the podium, but it showed nothing abnormal.

President Truman took a two-day tour of Washington state in 1948, speaking from the balcony of the Elks Club on the morning of June 10. Local legend has it that a man in the large Pacific Avenue crowd yelled the infamous &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, Harry!&quot; line for the first time. This is a matter of dispute, however, as local newspapers quoted the man as having shouted &quot;Lay it on, Harry!&quot; Despite this, there is a bronze plaque attached to the corner of the building declaring that spot to be the place where the phrase &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, Harry&quot; was first uttered.

With the return of World War II soldiers, the need for post-secondary education became evident to officials of the Bremerton School District. Olympic Junior College (now Olympic College), a two-year institution, opened its doors to 575 students in the fall of 1946. Initially, it operated in the former Lincoln School building, gradually moving operations to World War II–surplus Quonset buildings at its current 16th &amp; Chester site. About 100 students received associate degrees at the first commencement exercises held June 10, 1948. President Truman was in attendance and received the college&#x27;s first honorary degree. Operation of the college transferred from the school district to the state of Washington in 1967.

===1950–1970===

A second high school opened in 1956, and two comprehensive high schools operated in the city until 1978. Growth in East Bremerton necessitated the construction of another span across the Port Washington Narrows in 1958. The $5.3 million, four-lane Warren Avenue Bridge allowed for increased traffic on State Highway 21-B (now State Route 303).

The battleship USS &quot;Missouri&quot;, site of the Japanese surrender treaty signing that ended World War II, was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at PSNS in 1955. For 30 years, she served as the city&#x27;s primary tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of visitors walked the &quot;surrender deck&quot; before the ship was recommissioned in 1985. She was decommissioned on March 31, 1992 (final), and her name was struck off the register on January 12, 1995. In 1998 &quot;Mighty Mo&quot; was donated to the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

Population growth was flat, with 26,681 enumerated in the 1960 census, leading Bremerton leaders to annex the shipyard the following year in an effort to include stationed sailors in those figures. While the Vietnam War spawned protests and sit-ins on the Olympic College campus, the city was relatively free of civil disorder during the 1960s.

===1970s===

With the 1973 selection of the Bangor Ammunition Depot northwest of Bremerton as the Pacific home of the new Trident submarine fleet, residential and commercial development began to move north, closer to Silverdale, and farther from the Bremerton downtown core. Numerous failed proposals were made at redevelopment beginning in the early 1970s, including discussions of a waterfront hotel and the erection of a large canopy over the central business district. Meanwhile, most of the city&#x27;s office and retail space remained in the control of Edward Bremer, son of William Bremer and the sole remaining heir to his wealth. Bremer began to neglect his properties, never increasing decades-old lease rates and failing to make necessary maintenance upgrades. In 1978, the Bremerton City Council passed an ordinance declaring the entire downtown a &quot;blighted area&quot;.

===1980s===

In 1985, Safeco subsidiary Winmar Corporation developed the Kitsap Mall in Silverdale. With lower taxes and minimal planning regulations in the unincorporated town, Silverdale achieved virtually unfettered growth. Sears, J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, Nordstrom Place Two, Woolworth and Rite Aid all closed their downtown Bremerton stores in the 1980s and 1990s. Upon the death of Edward Bremer in 1987, the Bremer properties were placed under the complete control of a trust held by Olympic College. Not being in the real-estate business, the college did not actively market its holdings, and the downtown was composed almost entirely of very large empty storefronts. , many buildings remained vacant.

===1990–present===
Despite a hard-fought battle throughout the mid-1990s by local politicians to have the decommissioned and mothballed USS &quot;Missouri&quot;, already in the Bremerton Navy Yard, stay in Bremerton as a museum ship and tourist attraction, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton awarded the ship to the Pearl Harbor Naval Base, Hawaii, in 1998. It now sits near the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial to demonstrate where U.S. involvement in World War II started on December 7, 1941, and where it ended by the signing of the instrument of surrender by the Japanese on board the USS &quot;Missouri,&quot; on September 2, 1945.

Beginning with the building of a waterfront boardwalk and marina in 1992, Bremerton had begun the process of revitalizing its downtown community. That same year, the Bremerton Historic Ships Association opened the destroyer to public tours at the end of the boardwalk; the ship was built in the Puget Sound area in 1958, commissioned in 1959, and had played a back-up role in the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident that further escalated U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War with the Congressional passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, allowing President Lyndon B. Johnson to send fighting troops in addition to the &quot;advisors&quot; already on the ground in Vietnam.

In 2000, Bremerton saw the opening of the waterfront multimodal bus/ferry terminal and a hotel/conference center complex in 2004. The high-rise Norm Dicks Government Center also opened that year, housing City Hall and other government offices. The Waterfront Fountain Park and Naval History Museum adjacent to the Bremerton Bus/Ferry Terminal opened in 2007, and a newly expanded marina with more boat capacity was completed in 2008. Plans to build an extension to the current boardwalk from the USS &quot;Turner Joy&quot; to Evergreen Park is in the litigation stage. Even though the boardwalk extension project is fully funded, opposition to the extension by the Suquamish Tribe concerning the impact to treaty fishing rights threatens the project. Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott, a 132-room hotel, opened in March 2010 on the site of the old City Hall building made obsolete by the new Norm Dicks Government Building.

Condominiums were built on the waterfront to lure more people to live and shop in the downtown area as part of the revitalization effort. However, construction delays and economic downturn forced the builder of the publicly funded Harborside Condominium complex, the Kitsap County Consolidated Housing Authority, to fall $40.5 million in debt. That debt later was taken on by Kitsap County, which hired a marketing firm to sell the remaining units at a lower-than-anticipated price. The privately built 400-condominium complex north of the Harborside complex opened shortly before the Harborside complex and also did not sell as well as projected. The remaining empty condos were eventually sold at auction for a lower cost.

The Harborside Fountain Park opened on May 5, 2007. Located on the waterfront just steps away from the Kitsap Conference Center, the park features five large copper-ringed fountains, wading pools, and lush landscaping. The park will also be home to the Harborside Heritage Naval Museum.

A tunnel underneath downtown, traversing from the ferry terminal to Highway 304 (Burwell Street), was opened to funnel traffic from the car ferry away from downtown streets. A new fountain park above the tunnel blends water and art, along with the bow of a ship and the conning tower of a submarine as a tribute to the workers at the Bremerton Naval Shipyard over the years. The stations along the walk include pictures of the shipyard, workers, and shipbuilding and repair statistics.

The popular Blackberry Festival is held annually during Labor Day weekend on the waterfront boardwalk to celebrate everything blackberry. Local residents, shopkeepers and growers bring their blackberry ice creams, pastries, pies, jams, jellies, candies, and even ciders and wines to this annual event. Free entertainment includes music by local musicians and entertainers performing throughout the three-day festival, the Berry Fun Run, and the Blackberry Criterium Bike Race. Bremerton National Airport sponsors the annual Blackberry Festival Fly-In, with shuttle service provided by Kitsap Transit to the festival. As the festival&#x27;s background story goes, the downtown waterfront of Bremerton where the festival takes place was a massive overgrowth of wild blackberry bushes that were removed to build the waterfront Fountain Park, Boardwalk, Marina and Bus/Ferry Terminal.

==Geography==
Bremerton, the largest city in Kitsap County, is located directly west of Seattle across Puget Sound on the Kitsap Peninsula. It is bounded on the southeast and east by Sinclair Inlet and the strait of Port Orchard respectively. The city is divided by the Port Washington Narrows, a strait spanned by two bridges that connect the eastern and western sides of the city. The part of the city northeast of the narrows is referred to as East Bremerton. The city limits extend to the southwest as far as the Mason County line and include Bremerton National Airport. Bremerton is bordered to the south, across Sinclair Inlet, by the city of Port Orchard.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bremerton has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

===Neighborhoods===
====Downtown====
The ferry terminal and waterfront are the heart of downtown. As Bremerton&#x27;s historic center, downtown has seen the most dramatic change over the last decade, with blighted blocks being replaced by new apartments, and older buildings being restored. Attractions include Harborside Fountain Park, a boardwalk, and multiple naval history museums. The Admiral Theatre, a restored 1942 Art Deco theater, is Bremerton&#x27;s most prominent venue for live music and entertainment. The district is known for breweries, coffeeshops, art galleries, and restaurants showcasing diverse cuisines. The city is in the beginning stages of creating a public square on Fourth Street to honor local music icon Quincy Jones.

====Manette====
Across the water from Downtown is Manette, a neighborhood on a separate peninsula that functioned as its own town from 1891 to 1930. It was annexed by Bremerton in 1918, and the first Manette Bridge was completed in 1930. Today, Manette is connected to Bremerton via the new Manette Bridge, completed in 2011.

====Charleston====

Charleston was formerly an independent town built to house and entertain sailors, and was annexed by the city in 1927. The neighborhood&#x27;s center is Callow Avenue, a retail corridor anchored by The Charleston music venue. Charleston is a designated center in Bremerton&#x27;s comprehensive plan, and has seen recent improvements to its streetscape. Charleston is casually defined by 11th Street to the north, Naval Avenue to the east, 1st Street to the south, and Cambrian Avenue to the west.

====Union Hill====
Between Charleston and Downtown is the Union Hill neighborhood. Its borders are Naval Avenue to the west, 11th Street to the north, Warren Avenue to the east, and the Naval Shipyard to the south. Union Hill is a predominantly residential neighborhood, showcasing Bremerton&#x27;s most historic churches and a synagogue along Veneta Avenue. Near Veneta and 6th is Bremerton&#x27;s most architecturally notable place of worship, Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church; non-native towering sequoias; and a large park.

====Evergreen====
North of downtown&#x27;s 11th Street boundary is the Evergreen neighborhood, anchored by Evergreen Park and bordered to the west by Warren Avenue. Evergreen Park offers beach access and a boat ramp, and hosts a weekly farmer&#x27;s market in the summer. Evergreen is characterized by residential neighborhoods and water views.

====Haddon====
West of Evergreen and north of Union Hill and Charleston is Haddon. Haddon&#x27;s center is Lulu Haddon Park, but Bremerton High School and Olympic College&#x27;s campus are main focal points as well. Though it is an older, sleepier neighborhood traditionally more connected with the shipyard and local business, the Haddon neighborhood has recently gained notice for a few quirky businesses.

==Climate==
Bremerton has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), with warm dry summers and wet semi-mild winters. Average annual precipitation is , with annual snowfall averaging . The wettest year has been 1999 with and the driest 1943 with . The city falls in USDA climate zone 8.

==Demographics==
Based on per capita income, Bremerton ranks 341st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 census, there were 37,729 people, 14,932 households, and 7,853 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 17,273 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 74.0% White, 6.7% African American, 2.0% Native American, 5.5% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, 2.8% from other races, and 7.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.6% of the population.

==Government and politics==
Bremerton is divided among three state legislative districts in Kitsap County, the 23rd legislative district to the north, 35th legislative district in the center and 26th legislative district to the south.

Before redistricting in 2012, the line separating the first and sixth Congressional districts ran through East Bremerton. As a result of the 2012 redistricting, all of Bremerton now lies within the sixth Congressional district. The district is represented by Derek Kilmer, who was first elected to that position in 2012. Prior to Kilmer, Norm Dicks served as sixth district Representative from 1977 to 2013.

Greg Wheeler was elected mayor in 2017 and re-elected in 2021. Incorporated as a first-class city, Bremerton has been governed by a nonpartisan strong mayor and seven-member city council since 1985. Each member is elected from one of seven districts who in turn elect one member as President. The current form of government was established by a 1983 charter that eliminated a decades-old city commission composed of a mayor, public works commissioner and finance commissioner.

Each member of the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners represents a portion of the city of Bremerton. This arrangement was an attempt to balance Bremerton&#x27;s commercial influence with the remainder of the county, though most of its sales tax base has since relocated to unincorporated areas.

Bremerton politics can vary in intensity, with some city council positions regularly unopposed and others having as many as four candidates in the 2005 primary election, and seven candidates in the 2021 election. As with most cities in the region, Bremerton precincts have historically been more favorable for Democratic candidates in state and federal elections, contrasting with more conservative-leaning voters in rural areas of the county.

==Education==
Public schools are operated by the Bremerton School District, Central Kitsap School District, and South Kitsap School District. College level education is offered by Olympic College.

Christ the King Lutheran School is a Pre-K-8 grade school of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Bremerton.

==Sports and recreation==
Bremerton was home to the Kitsap BlueJackets baseball team of the summer collegiate West Coast League until 2017. It is also the home of the dissolved Kitsap Pumas soccer team in the USL Premier Development League (PDL). Its basketball team is the Kitsap Admirals in the American Basketball Association (ABA). The Western States Hockey League had a presence in Bremerton as well with the addition of the (now defunct) West Sound Warriors.

<doc id="138044" wikidata="Q1503701" url="?curid=138044" title="Indianola, Washington">
<text>Indianola is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kitsap County, Washington, United States, located on the north shore of Port Madison on the Port Madison Indian Reservation, home of the Suquamish Indian Tribe. The population was 3,664 at the 2020 census. It was originally established as a summer community and was a stop for Mosquito Fleet ferries until the 1950s.

==Geography==
Indianola is located on the north shore of Port Madison, just east of Miller Bay. It is south of Kingston and northeast of Suquamish.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.3 square miles (13.8 km2), of which, 4.8 square miles (12.6 km2) of it is land and 0.5 square miles (1.2 km2) of it (8.82%) is water.

== History ==

Indianola was formed on the portion of the Port Madison Indian Reservation which had been allotted to KaKue aka &quot;Beedee&quot; in 1886. KaKue died in December 1886 leaving no will and his wife Tu Tue Tue was sole heir. Tu Tue Tue died four years later in 1890 leaving a brother and a sister Tar-de-blu &amp; a daughter Katie. After the death of Tar-de-blu the estate was settled in 1909 leaving Chief Jacob the son of Tar-de-blu as sole heir. When Katie died childless in 1896 her husband Alpheus Loughrey was sole heir. Alpheus had four sons from a previous marriage and the allotment eventually passed to his sons, Alpheus was a white man who had married Katie, the daughter of KaKue aka Beedee and Tu-Tue-Tue. KaKue aka &quot;Beedee&quot; was not related to Cyrus Beede Pickrell who was an Indian agent in Suquamish from 1906 to 1916 or to Cyrus Beede who was at the time the US Indian Inspector.

Development began in 1916 with the formation of the Indianola Beach Land Company by W. L. Gazzam to promote real estate sales on the land owned by the Loughreys. A dock and a store were built as amenities to attract buyers; a second store, the Beachcomber, was built the next year. From the beginning, Indianola has been a vacation community, with its population inflating considerably in the summertime.

In the early 20th century, most transportation on Puget Sound was by steamer, and a community&#x27;s dock was often its only lifeline to the outside world. Such was the case for the young community of Indianola Beach, and by 1918 a steamer was docking there every weekend. Daily ferry service was initiated in 1919 when Carl Hendrix organized twelve passengers to pay in advance for one year&#x27;s daily service between Indianola Beach and Seattle. Hendrix and his wife established a school the same year.

Cyrus Beede Pickrell, who had been Indian Agent for the Port Madison Reservation, moved to Indianola Beach from Suquamish with his family in 1920. Postal service had been discontinued, so when the Pickrells opened a new store, they housed the postal operation at Indianola Beach with Cyrus as Postmaster. Around this time, the Postmaster General took issue with the double name of Indianola Beach and the post office was renamed Kitsap in honor of Chief Kitsap of the Suquamish tribe.

Plans to establish a library and community hall were cause for much activity and development in the 1920s. Lots were auctioned off and a carnival was held in 1927 to raise funds. The Indianola Beach Improvement Club was incorporated in 1928 to raise more building money. The club acquired some lots from W. L. Gazzam, which were raffled off with the proceeds going toward the purchase of property on which to build the structure. The Indianola Clubhouse was finally built in 1930.

By 1929, three passenger boats left the Indianola dock for Seattle every day, and the 1930s brought more connections to the outside world. A power line was strung in 1930, and phone service was established in 1934. The Port of Indianola was established in 1933 after a special election. The dock, which had previously only accommodated passengers, was widened and reinforced to allow auto access. In 1935, Kitsap County began taking surveys to build a road to connect Indianola and Suquamish; when the road was completed in 1939, it was the first time Indianola was accessible by other means of transportation than boat.

Road access to Indianola changed the character of the community somewhat, as the community now had access to more amenities in Kitsap and was no longer self-contained. The school closed in 1941 after more than twenty years of classes. Kitsap County&#x27;s naval bases and facilities brought a population boom during World War II, and many families settled in Indianola. Ferry service was discontinued in Fall of 1951 after the Agate Pass Bridge opened and the Washington State Ferries took over ferry service on Puget Sound.

It was not until after 1957 that the name of the post office was changed from Kitsap to Indianola, due to the confusion caused by its sharing a name with the county.

<text>Kingston (formerly Appletree Cove) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,515 at the 2020 census. Kingston is along the shores of Appletree Cove and Puget Sound, and is home to a major Washington State Ferry terminal linking it to Edmonds.

==Geography==
Kingston is located in northeastern Kitsap County at (47.798764, −122.499071), on the east side of the Kitsap Peninsula. Washington State Route 104 runs through the community from the Washington State Ferry terminal, leading northwest to Port Gamble. Bremerton is to the southwest by highway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Kingston CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 10.31%, are water.

===Climate===
==History==

Founded in 1853 by Benjamin Bannister, the community was originally known as &quot;Appletree Cove&quot;. By 1880 it was a lumber town until the mill closed down in the early 20th century. Known as the &quot;little city by the sea&quot;, Kingston is a northern gateway to the Olympic Peninsula and is the social and economic center of the north end of the Kitsap Peninsula.

===King&#x27;s Town===
In 1869, W.S. Ladd and his wife Caroline built a cabin on Appletree Cove. Michael King then bought the cabin nine years later. He moved in along with ten oxen and ten men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, he was done and moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as &quot;King&#x27;s Town&quot;, probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved into &quot;Kingston&quot; and stuck.

===Resort town===
The Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890, by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it &quot;the Monterey of Washington&quot;. Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, and a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,611 people, 685 households, and 452 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 977.2 people per square mile (377.0/km2). There were 773 housing units at an average density of 468.9/sq mi (180.9/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 91.1% White, 0.3% African American, 1.2% Native American, 2.3% Asian, 1.0% Pacific Islander, 1.6% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.7% of the population.

There were 685 households, out of which 30.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.9% were married couples living together, 7.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.0% were non-families. 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.86.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.8% under the age of 18, 4.4% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $40,347, and the median income for a family was $54,583. Males had a median income of $43,839 versus $25,781 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $24,212. About 9.2% of families and 11.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.9% of those under age 18 and 13.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Transportation==
Kingston has a Washington State Ferries terminal for auto/passenger service to Edmonds.

In September 2012, due to financial losses, the Port of Kingston discontinued its SoundRunner Kingston–Seattle passenger-only system. One of the former vessels, the &quot;Spirit of Kingston&quot;, was transferred to the King County Ferry District on March 18, 2013, for service as part of the King County Water Taxi fleet.

In January 2016 Kingston accepted delivery of a new modern fireboat. The new vessel is long, can travel at , and can pump 2,700 gallons per minute. The Department of Homeland Security has provided small ports with grants to equip themselves with modern fireboats, with sealed cabins, that can also help counter other threats, like oil spills, or attacks by chemical or biological weapons. Two thirds of the cost of this fireboat, $409,813, were paid by a federal grant. The vessel also has modern infrared sensors, which can help in search and rescue missions, and search for the hot spot at the center of a fire. Kingston had a smaller, slower, less capable older fireboat. Both vessels can project fire suppressant foam, less likely to sink flaming vessels, but experience with the older vessel suggests most of the fires the new vessel will fight will be on the shore, near the water.

Kitsap Fast Ferries began service from Kingston to Seattle in November 2018.

==Education==
Public education is provided by the North Kitsap School District. Kingston&#x27;s schools include Kingston Co-op Preschool, Gordon Elementary, Kingston Middle School, Spectrum Community School, Wolfle Elementary and Kingston High School.

==In popular culture==
Taree is a popular American Rock song by the band Soundgarden named after the Taree neighborhood in Kingston.
