<text>Narcissus is a genus of predominantly spring flowering perennial plants of the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae. Various common names including daffodil, narcissus (plural narcissi), and jonquil, are used to describe some or all members of the genus. &quot;Narcissus&quot; has conspicuous flowers with six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona. The flowers are generally white and yellow (also orange or pink in garden varieties), with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona.

&quot;Narcissi&quot; were well known in ancient civilisation, both medicinally and botanically, but were formally described by Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753). The genus is generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately 36 species. The number of species has varied, depending on how they are classified, due to similarity between species and hybridisation. The genus arose some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene epochs, in the Iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest Europe. The exact origin of the name &quot;Narcissus&quot; is unknown, but it is often linked to a Greek word (ancient Greek ναρκῶ narkō, &quot;to make numb&quot;) and the myth of the youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection. In some versions of the story, Narcissus is turned into a flower by the Gods after his death. The English word &quot;daffodil&quot; appears to be derived from &quot;asphodel&quot;, with which it was commonly compared.

The species are native to meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a centre of diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some &quot;Narcissus&quot; species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.

Historical accounts suggest narcissi have been cultivated from the earliest times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily in the Netherlands. Today, narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering a wide range of shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring.

The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.
==Description==


===General===
&quot;Narcissus&quot; is a genus of perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, which die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow in the following year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of depending on the species. Dwarf species such as &quot;N. asturiensis&quot; have a maximum height of , while &quot;Narcissus tazetta&quot; may grow as tall as .

The plants are scapose, having a single central leafless hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves arise from the bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendant), or be erect. There are six pollen-bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.

The bulb lies dormant after the leaves and flower stem die back and has contractile roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the following season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.

===Specific===
====Vegetative====
; Bulbs :
The pale brown-skinned ovoid tunicate bulbs have a membranous tunic and a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a ring around the edge, which grow up to 40 mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular, only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed). (see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.

Once the leaves die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten, pulling the bulbs deeper into the ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers outwards which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk, which will start to grow in the following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.

; Stems :
The single leafless plant stem or scape, appearing from early to late spring depending on the species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species; some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at the centre of the leaves. In a few species such as &quot;N. hedraeanthus&quot; the stem is oblique. The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.

; Leaves :
&quot;Narcissus&quot; plants have one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap-shaped (long and narrow), sometimes channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) or may not (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin-containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant, the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species, the leaves are low-hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colorless sheath. After flowering, the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.

Jonquils usually have dark green, round, rush-like leaves.

====Reproductive====
; Inflorescence :
The inflorescence is scapose, the single stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel with up to 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section &quot;Bulbocodium&quot; and most of section &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot;. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as &quot;N. papyraceus&quot; (see illustration, left) and &quot;N. tazetta&quot; (see Table I). The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.

Prior to opening, the flower buds are enveloped and protected in a thin, dry, papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped around the base of the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.

; Flowers :
The flowers of &quot;Narcissus&quot; are hermaphroditic (bisexual), have three parts (tripartite), and are sometimes fragrant (see Fragrances). The flower symmetry is actinomorphic (radial) to slightly zygomorphic (bilateral) due to declinate-ascending stamens (curving downwards, then bent up at the tip). &quot;Narcissus&quot; flowers are characterised by their, usually conspicuous, corona (trumpet).

The three major floral parts (in all species except &quot;N. cavanillesii&quot; in which the corona is virtually absent - Table I: Section &quot;Tapeinanthus&quot;) are:
* (i) the proximal floral tube (hypanthium),
* (ii) the surrounding free tepals, and
* (iii) the more distal corona (paraperigon, paraperigonium).

All three parts may be considered to be components of the perianth (perigon, perigonium). The perianth arises above the apex of the inferior ovary, its base forming the hypanthial floral tube.

The floral tube is formed by fusion of the basal segments of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more distal corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow sections &quot;Apodanthi&quot; and &quot;Jonquilla&quot; to rudimentary (&quot;N. cavanillesii&quot;).

Surrounding the floral tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) from the rest of the perianth are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, which is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.

The corona, or paracorolla, is variously described as bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, cup-shaped) or disc-shaped with margins that are often frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely is the corona a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base, the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar at the top of the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of &quot;N. serotinus&quot; (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in &quot;N. cavanillesii&quot; to the elongated trumpets of section &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot; (trumpet daffodils, Table I).

While the perianth may point forwards, in some species such as &quot;N. cyclamineus&quot; it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other species such as &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot; (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.

The colour of the perianth is white, yellow or bicoloured, with the exception of the night flowering &quot;N. viridiflorus&quot;, which is green. In addition, the corona of &quot;N. poeticus&quot; has a red crenulate margin (see Table I). Flower diameter varies from 12 mm (&quot;N. bulbocodium&quot;) to over 125 mm (&quot;N. nobilis&quot;=&quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; subsp. &quot;nobilis&quot;).

Flower orientation varies from pendent or deflexed (hanging down) as in &quot;N. triandrus&quot; (see illustration, left), through declinate-ascendant as in &quot;N. alpestris&quot; = &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; subsp. &quot;moschatus&quot;, horizontal (patent, spreading) such as &quot;N. gaditanus&quot; or &quot;N. poeticus&quot;, erect as in &quot;N. cavanillesii&quot;, &quot;N. serotinus&quot; and &quot;N. rupicola&quot; (Table I), or intermediate between these positions (erecto-patent).

The flowers of &quot;Narcissus&quot; demonstrate exceptional floral diversity and sexual polymorphism, primarily by corona size and floral tube length, associated with pollinator groups (see for instance Figs. 1 and 2 in Graham and Barrett). Barrett and Harder (2005) describe three separate floral patterns:
* &quot;Daffodil&quot; form
* &quot;Paperwhite&quot; form
* &quot;Triandrus&quot; form.

The predominant patterns are the &#x27;daffodil&#x27; and &#x27;paperwhite&#x27; forms, while the &quot;triandrus&quot; form is less common. Each corresponds to a different group of pollinators (See Pollination).

The &quot;daffodil&quot; form, which includes sections &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot; and &quot;Bulbocodium&quot;, has a relatively short, broad or highly funnelform tube (funnel-like), which grades into an elongated corona, which is large and funnelform, forming a broad, cylindrical or trumpet-shaped perianth. Section &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot; consists of relatively large flowers with a corolla length of around 50 mm, generally solitary but rarely in inflorescences of 2–4 flowers. They have wide greenish floral tubes with funnel-shaped bright yellow coronas. The six tepals sometimes differ in colour from the corona and may be cream coloured to pale yellow.

The &quot;paperwhite&quot; form, including sections &quot;Jonquilla&quot;, &quot;Apodanthi&quot; and &quot;Narcissus&quot;, has a relatively long, narrow tube and a short, shallow, flaring corona. The flower is horizontal and fragrant.

The &quot;triandrus&quot; form is seen in only two species, &quot;N. albimarginatus&quot; (a Moroccan endemic) and &quot;N. triandrus&quot;. It combines features of both the &quot;daffodil&quot; and &quot;paperwhite&quot; forms, with a well-developed, long, narrow tube and an extended bell-shaped corona of almost equal length. The flowers are pendent.

; Androecium :
There are six stamens in one to two rows (whorls), with the filaments separate from the corona, attached at the throat or base of the tube (epipetalous), often of two separate lengths, straight or declinate-ascending (curving downwards, then upwards). The anthers are basifixed (attached at their base).

; Gynoecium :
The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) and trilocular (three chambered) and there is a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and filiform (thread like) style, which is often exserted (extending beyond the tube).

; Fruit :
The fruit consists of dehiscent loculicidal capsules (splitting between the locules) that are ellipsoid to subglobose (almost spherical) in shape and are papery to leathery in texture.

; Seeds :
The fruit contains numerous subglobose seeds which are round and swollen with a hard coat, sometimes with an attached elaiosome. The testa is black and the pericarp dry.

Most species have 12 ovules and 36 seeds, although some species such as &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot; have more, up to a maximum of 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections &quot;Jonquilla&quot; and &quot;Bulbocodium&quot; are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.

===Chromosomes===
Chromosome numbers include 2n=14, 22, 26, with numerous aneuploid and polyploid derivatives. The basic chromosome number is 7, with the exception of &quot;N. tazetta&quot;, &quot;N. elegans&quot; and &quot;N. broussonetii&quot; in which it is 10 or 11; this subgenus (&quot;Hermione&quot;) was in fact characterised by this characteristic. Polyploid species include &quot;N. papyraceus&quot; (4x=22) and &quot;N. dubius&quot; (6x=50).

===Phytochemistry===
====Alkaloids====
As with all Amarylidaceae genera, &quot;Narcissus&quot; contains unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid to be identified was lycorine, from &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids have been identified in the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, &quot;Narcissus&quot; species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, tazettine, narciclasine, montanine and galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. &quot;Narcissus&quot; also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.

====Fragrances====
Fragrances are predominantly monoterpene isoprenoids, with a small amount of benzenoids, although &quot;N. jonquilla&quot; has both equally represented. Another exception is &quot;N. cuatrecasasii&quot; which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives. The basic monoterpene precursor is geranyl pyrophosphate, and the commonest monoterpenes are limonene, myrcene, and &quot;trans&quot;-β-ocimene. Most benzenoids are non-methoxylated, while a few species contain methoxylated forms (ethers), &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;N. bujei&quot;. Other ingredient include indole, isopentenoids and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators, and fall into three main groups (see Pollination).

==Taxonomy==
=== History ===
==== Early ====
The genus &quot;Narcissus&quot; was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. In Greek literature Theophrastus and Dioscorides described &quot;νάρκισσος&quot;, probably referring to &quot;N. poeticus&quot;, although the exact species mentioned in classical literature cannot be accurately established. Pliny the Elder later introduced the Latin form &quot;narcissus&quot;. These early writers were as much interested in the plant&#x27;s possible medicinal properties as they were in its botanical features and their accounts remained influential until at least the Renaissance (see also Antiquity). Mediaeval and Renaissance writers include Albert Magnus and William Turner, but it remained to Linnaeus to formally describe and name &quot;Narcissus&quot; as a genus in his Species Plantarum (1753) at which time there were six known species.

==== Modern ====
De Jussieu (1789) grouped &quot;Narcissus&quot; into a &quot;family&quot;, which he called Narcissi. This was renamed Amaryllideae by Jaume Saint-Hilaire in 1805, corresponding to the modern Amaryllidaceae. For a while, &quot;Narcissus&quot; was considered part of Liliaceae (as in the illustration seen here of &quot;Narcissus candidissimus&quot;), but then the Amaryllidaceae were split off from it.
Various authors have adopted either narrow (e.g. Haworth, Salisbury) or wide (e.g.Herbert, Spach ) interpretations of the genus. The narrow view treated many of the species as separate genera. Over time, the wider view prevailed with a major monograph on the genus being published by Baker (1875). One of the more controversial genera was &quot;Tapeinanthus&quot;, but today it is included in &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

The eventual position of &quot;Narcissus&quot; within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in this century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. Within Amaryllidaceae the genus &quot;Narcissus&quot; belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily. It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae, being distinguished from &quot;Sternbergia&quot; by the presence of a paraperigonium, and is monophyletic.

=== Subdivision ===
The infrageneric phylogeny of &quot;Narcissus&quot; still remains relatively unsettled, the taxonomy having proved complex and difficult to resolve, due to the diversity of the wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation. Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.

De Candolle, in the first systematic taxonomy of &quot;Narcissus&quot;, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority. The situation was confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties, and it was not until the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus, &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

A common classification system has been that of Fernandes based on cytology, as modified by Blanchard (1990) and Mathew (2002). Another is that of Meyer (1966). Fernandes proposed two subgenera based on basal chromosome numbers, and then subdivided these into ten sections as did Blanchard.

Other authors (e.g. Webb) prioritised morphology over genetics, abandoning subgenera, although Blanchard&#x27;s system has been one of the most influential. While infrageneric groupings within &quot;Narcissus&quot; have been relatively constant, their status (genera, subgenera, sections, subsections, series, species) has not. The most cited system is that of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) which simply lists ten sections. Three of these are monotypic (contain only one species), while two others contain only two species. Most species are placed in section &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot;. Many of these subdivisions correspond roughly to the popular names for daffodil types, &quot;e.g.&quot; Trumpet Daffodils, Tazettas, Pheasant&#x27;s Eyes, Hoop Petticoats, Jonquils.

The most hierarchical system is that of Mathew, illustrated here -

==== Phylogenetics ====
The phylogenetic analysis of Graham and Barrett (2004) supported the infrageneric division of &quot;Narcissus&quot; into two clades corresponding to Fernandes&#x27; subgenera, but did not support monophyly of all sections. A later extended analysis by Rønsted &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) with additional taxa confirmed this pattern.

A large molecular analysis by Zonneveld (2008) sought to reduce some of the paraphyly identified by Graham and Barrett. This led to a revision of the sectional structure.
While Graham and Barrett (2004) had determined that subgenus &quot;Hermione&quot; was monophyletic, Santos-Gally &quot;et al.&quot; (2011) did not. If two species excluded in the former study are removed from the analysis, the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus &quot;Narcissus&quot;. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural (&#x27;ancient&#x27;) hybrids (nothospecies).

==== Species ====
Estimates of the number of species in &quot;Narcissus&quot; have varied widely, from anywhere between 16 and almost 160, even in the modern era. Linnaeus originally included six species in 1753, by 1784 there were fourteen by 1819 sixteen, and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species.

Much of the variation lies in the definition of species. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb&#x27;s results in few species, while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes results in a larger number. Another factor is the status of hybrids, with a distinction between &quot;ancient hybrids&quot; and &quot;recent hybrids&quot;. The term &quot;ancient hybrid&quot; refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while &quot;recent hybrid&quot; refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.

Fernandes (1951) originally accepted 22 species, Webb (1980) 27. By 1968, Fernandes had 63 species, Blanchard (1990) 65 species, and Erhardt (1993) 66. In 2006 the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s (RHS) &quot;International Daffodil Register and Classified List&quot; listed 87 species, while Zonneveld&#x27;s genetic study (2008) resulted in only 36. , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts 52 species, along with at least 60 hybrids, while the RHS has 81 accepted names in its October 2014 list.

=== Evolution ===
Within the Narcisseae, &quot;Narcissus&quot; (western Mediterranean) diverged from &quot;Sternbergia&quot; (Eurasia) some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 29.3–18.1 Ma. Later, the genus divided into the two subgenera (&quot;Hermione&quot; and &quot;Narcissus&quot;) between 27.4 and 16.1 Ma. The divisions between the sections of &quot;Hermione&quot; then took place during the Miocene period 19.9–7.8 Ma. &quot;Narcissus&quot; appears to have arisen in the area of the Iberian peninsula, southern France and northwestern Italy. Subgenus &quot;Hermione&quot; in turn arose in the southwestern Mediterranean and Northwest Africa.

===Names and etymology===
====Narcissus====

The derivation of the Latin &quot;&quot; is from Greek &quot;narkissos&quot;. According to Plutarch &quot;narkissos&quot; has been connected because of the plant&#x27;s narcotic properties, with &quot;narkē&quot; &quot;numbness&quot;; it may also be connected with hell. On the other hand, its etymology is considered to be clearly Pre-Greek by Beekes.

It is frequently linked to the myth of Narcissus, who became so obsessed with his own reflection in water that he drowned and the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. There is no evidence for the flower being named after Narcissus. &quot;Narcissus poeticus&quot;, which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating. Pliny wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance ( &quot;narkao&quot;, &quot;I grow numb&quot; ), rather than Narcissus. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that narcissi bending over streams represent the youth admiring his reflection. Linnaeus used the Latin name &quot;narcissus&quot; for the plant but was preceded by others such as Matthias de l&#x27;Obel (1591) and Clusius (1576). The name Narcissus was not uncommon for men in Roman times.

The plural form of the common name &quot;narcissus&quot; has been the cause of some confusion. Dictionaries list &quot;narcissi&quot;, &quot;narcissuses&quot; and &quot;narcissus&quot;. However, texts on usage such as Garner and Fowler state that &quot;narcissi&quot; is the preferred form. The common name narcissus should not be capitalised.

====Daffodil====
The name &quot;daffodil&quot; is derived from &quot;affodell&quot;, a variant of &quot;asphodel&quot;. The narcissus was frequently referred to as the asphodel (see Antiquity). Asphodel in turn appears to come from the Greek &quot;asphodelos&quot; (). The reason for the introduction of the initial &quot;d&quot; is not known. From at least the 16th century, &quot;daffadown dilly&quot; and &quot;daffydowndilly&quot; have appeared as alternative names. Other names include &quot;Lent lily&quot;.

==== In other languages ====
The Hokkien name for &quot;Narcissus&quot;, &quot;chúi-sian&quot;, can be literally translated as &quot;water fairy&quot;, where &quot;chúi&quot; () refers to water and &quot;sian&quot; () refers to immortals. It is the official provincial flower of Fujian.

== Distribution and habitat ==
=== Distribution ===

Although the family Amaryllidaceae are predominantly tropical or subtropical as a whole, &quot;Narcissus&quot; occurs primarily in Mediterranean region, with a centre of diversity in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). A few species extend the range into southern France, Italy, the Balkans (&quot;N. poeticus&quot;, &quot;N. serotinus&quot;, &quot;N. tazetta&quot;), and the Eastern Mediterranean (&quot;N. serotinus&quot;) including Israel (&quot;N. tazetta&quot;). The occurrence of &quot;N. tazetta&quot; in western and central Asia as well as East Asia are considered introductions, albeit ancient (see Eastern cultures). While the exact northern limit of the natural range is unknown, the occurrences of wild &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; in Great Britain, middle and northern Europe are similarly considered ancient introductions.

While the Amaryllidaceae are not native to North America, &quot;Narcissus&quot; grows well in USDA hardiness zones 3B through 10, which encompass most of the United States and Canada.

&quot;N. elegans&quot; occurs on the Northwest African Coast (Morocco and Libya), as well as the coastline of Corsica, Sardinia and Italy, and &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot; between Tangier and Algiers and Tangier to Marrakech, but also on the Iberian Peninsula. &quot;N. serotinus&quot; is found along the entire Mediterranean coast. &quot;N. tazetta&quot; occurs as far east as Iran and Kashmir. Since this is one of the oldest species found in cultivation, it is likely to have been introduced into Kashmir. &quot;N. poeticus&quot; and &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; have the largest distribution ranges. &quot;N. poeticus&quot; ranges from the Pyrenees along the Romanian Carpathians to the Black Sea and along the Dalmatian coast to Greece. &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; ranges from the Iberian Peninsula, via the Vosges Mountains to northern France and Belgium, and the United Kingdom where there are still wild stocks in Southern Scotland. The only occurrence in Luxembourg is located near Lellingen, in the municipality of Kiischpelt. In Germany it is found mainly in the nature reserve at Perlenbach-Fuhrtsbachtal and the Eifel National Park, where in the spring at Monschau the meadows are teeming with yellow blooms. One of the most easterly occurrences can be found at Misselberg near Nassau on the Lahn. 

However, unlike the above examples, most species have very restricted endemic ranges which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids. For instance in the vicinity of the Portuguese city of Porto where both &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; and &quot;N. triandrus&quot; occur there are found various intersections of the two species while in a small area along part of the Portuguese Mondego river are found intersectional hybrids between &quot;N. scaberulus&quot; and &quot;N. triandrus&quot;.

The biogeography demonstrates a phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus &quot;Hermione&quot; having a lowland distribution, but subgenus &quot;Narcissus&quot; section &quot;Apodanthi&quot; being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus &quot;Narcissus&quot; include both lowland and mountain habitats. Section &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot;, although widely naturalised, is endemic to the Baetic Ranges of the southeastern Iberian Peninsula.

=== Habitats ===
Their native habitats are very varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates, being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices. Although requirements vary, overall there is a preference for acidic soils, although some species will grow on limestone. &quot;Narcissus scaberulus&quot; will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while &quot;Narcissus dubius&quot; thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.

The &quot;Pseudonarcissus&quot; group in their natural habitat prefers humid situations such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, &quot;Narcissus pseudonarcissus&quot; grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.

== Ecology ==
=== Life cycle ===
&quot;Narcissus&quot; are long-lived perennial geophytes with winter-growing and summer-dormant bulbs that are mainly synanthous (leaves and flowers appearing at the same time). While most species flower in late winter to spring, five species are autumn flowering (&quot;N. broussonetii&quot;, &quot;N. cavanillesii&quot;, &quot;N. elegans&quot;, &quot;N. serotinus&quot;, &quot;N. viridiflorus&quot;). By contrast, these species are hysteranthous (leaves appear after flowering).

Flower longevity varies by species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days. After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, and the plant appears to be &#x27;dormant&#x27; until the next spring, conserving moisture. However, the dormant period is also one of considerable activity within the bulb primordia. It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators . Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is &quot;N. tazetta&quot;.

Plants may spread clonally through the production of daughter bulbs and division, producing clumps. Narcissus species hybridise readily, although the fertility of the offspring will depend on the parental relationship.

=== Pollination ===
The flowers are insect-pollinated, the major pollinators being bees, butterflies, flies, and hawkmoths, while the highly scented night-flowering &quot;N. viridiflorus&quot; is pollinated by crepuscular moths. Pollination mechanisms fall into three groups corresponding to floral morphology (see Description - Flowers).

# &#x27;Daffodil&#x27; form. Pollinated by bees seeking pollen from anthers within the corona. The broad perianth allows bees (&quot;Bombus&quot;, &quot;Anthophora&quot;, &quot;Andrena&quot;) to completely enter the flower in their search for nectar and/or pollen. In this type, the stigma lies in the mouth of the corona, extending beyond the six anthers, whose single whorl lies well within the corona. The bees come into contact with the stigma before their legs, thorax and abdomen contact the anthers, and this approach herkogamy causes cross pollination.
# &#x27;Paperwhite&#x27; form. These are adapted to long-tongued Lepidoptera, particularly sphingid moths such as &quot;Macroglossum&quot;, Pieridae and Nymphalidae, but also some long-tongued bees, and flies, all of which are primarily seeking nectar. The narrow tube admits only the insect&#x27;s proboscis, while the short corona serves as a funnel guiding the tip of the proboscis into the mouth of the perianth tube. The stigma is placed either in the mouth of the tube, just above two whorls of three anthers, or hidden well below the anthers. The pollinators then carry pollen on their probosci or faces. The long-tongued bees cannot reach the nectar at the tube base and so collect just pollen. 
# &#x27;Triandrus&#x27; form. Pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (&quot;Anthophora&quot;, &quot;Bombus&quot;), which forage for both pollen and nectar. The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the perianth but then the narrow tube prevents further progress, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The pendant flowers prevent pollination by Lepidoptera. In &quot;N. albimarginatus&quot; there may be either a long stigma with short and mid-length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers (dimorphism). In &quot;N. triandrus&quot; there are three patterns of sexual organs (trimophism) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position and the length of the lower anthers.

Allogamy (outcrossing) on the whole is enforced through a late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility system, but some species such as &quot;N. dubius&quot; and &quot;N. longispathus&quot; are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.

=== Pests and diseases ===
Diseases of &quot;Narcissus&quot; are of concern because of the economic consequences of losses in commercial cultivation. Pests include viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as arthropods and gastropods. For control of pests, see Commercial uses.

; Viruses :
Aphids such as &quot;Macrosiphum euphorbiae&quot; can transmit viral diseases which affect the colour and shape of the leaves, as can nematodes. Up to twenty-five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the &quot;Narcissus common latent virus&quot; (NCLV, &quot;Narcissus mottling-associated virus&quot;), &quot;Narcissus latent virus&quot; (NLV, &quot;Narcissus mild mottle virus&quot;) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, &quot;Narcissus degeneration virus&quot; (NDV), &quot;Narcissus late season yellows virus&quot; (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, &quot;Narcissus mosaic virus&quot;, &quot;Narcissus yellow stripe virus&quot; (NYSV, &quot;Narcissus yellow streak virus&quot;), &quot;Narcissus tip necrosis virus&quot; (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and &quot;Narcissus white streak virus&quot; (NWSV).

Less host specific viruses include &quot;Raspberry ringspot virus&quot;, &quot;Nerine latent virus&quot; (NeLV) =&quot;Narcissus symptomless virus&quot;, &quot;Arabis mosaic virus&quot; (ArMV), &quot;Broad Bean Wilt Viruses&quot; (BBWV) &quot;Cucumber mosaic virus&quot; (CMV), &quot;Tomato black ring virus&quot; (TBRV), &quot;Tomato ringspot virus&quot; (TomRSV) and &quot;Tobacco rattle virus&quot; (TRV).

Of these viruses the most serious and prevalent are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in &quot;N. tazetta&quot;. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish-green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.

; Bacteria :
Bacterial disease is uncommon in &quot;Narcissus&quot; but includes &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; (bacterial streak) and &quot;Pectobacterium carotovorum&quot; sp. &quot;carotovorum&quot; (bacterial soft rot).

; Fungi :
More problematic for non-commercial plants is the fungus, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;narcissi&quot;, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This is the most serious disease of &quot;Narcissus&quot;. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include &quot;N. triandrus&quot;, &quot;N. tazetta&quot; and &quot;N. jonquilla&quot;.

Another fungus which attacks the bulbs, causing narcissus smoulder, is &quot;Botrytis narcissicola&quot; (&quot;Sclerotinia narcissicola&quot;) and other species of &quot;Botrytis&quot;, including &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, particularly if improperly stored. Copper sulfate is used to combat the disease, and infected bulbs are burned. Blue mould rot of bulbs may be caused by infection with species of &quot;Penicillium&quot;, if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites (see below). Species of Rhizopus (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Rhizopus stolonifer&quot;, &quot;Rhizopus nigricans&quot;) cause bulb soft rot and &quot;Sclerotinia bulborum&quot;, black slime disease. A combination of both &quot;Peyronellaea curtisii&quot; (&quot;Stagonosporopsis curtisii&quot;) and &quot;Botrytis narcissicola&quot; causes neck rot in the bulbs.

Fungi affecting the roots include &quot;Nectria radicicola&quot; (&quot;Cylindrocarpon destructans&quot;), a cause of root rot and &quot;Rosellinia necatrix&quot; causing white root rot, while others affect root and bulb, such as &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; (black mold), and species of &quot;Trichoderma&quot;, including &quot;T. viride&quot; and &quot;T. harzianum&quot; (=&quot;T. narcissi&quot;) responsible for green mold.

Other fungi affect the remainder of the plant. Another &quot;Botrytis&quot; fungus, &quot;Botrytis polyblastis&quot; (&quot;Sclerotinia polyblastis&quot;) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. &quot;Ramularia vallisumbrosae&quot; is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. &quot;Peyronellaea curtisii&quot;, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, &quot;Phoma narcissi&quot; (leaf tip blight). &quot;Aecidium narcissi&quot; causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.

; Animals :
Arthropods that are &quot;Narcissus&quot; pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, the narcissus bulb fly &quot;Merodon equestris&quot;, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies &quot;Eumerus tuberculatus&quot; and &quot;Eumerus strigatus&quot;. The flies lay their eggs at the end of June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as &quot;Korscheltellus lupulina&quot; (the common swift moth) attack &quot;Narcissus&quot; bulbs.

Other arthropods include Mites such as &quot;Steneotarsonemus laticeps&quot; (Bulb scale mite), &quot;Rhizoglyphus&quot; and &quot;Histiostoma&quot; infest mainly stored bulbs and multiply particularly at high ambient temperature, but do not attack planted bulbs.

Planted bulbs are susceptible to nematodes, the most serious of which is &quot;Ditylenchus dipsaci&quot; (Narcissus eelworm), the main cause of basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include &quot;Aphelenchoides subtenuis&quot;, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and &quot;Pratylenchus penetrans&quot; (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.
 Other nematodes such as the longodorids (&quot;Longidorus&quot; spp. or needle nematodes and &quot;Xiphinema&quot; spp. or dagger nematodes) and the stubby-root nematodes or trichodorids (&quot;Paratrichodorus&quot; spp. and &quot;Trichodorus&quot; spp.) can also act as vectors of virus diseases, such as TBRV and TomRSV, in addition to causing stunting of the roots.

Gastropods such as snails and slugs also cause damage to growth.

== Conservation ==
Many of the smallest species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism. &quot;N. cyclamineus&quot; has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as &#x27;Endangered&#x27; (&quot;Narcissus alcaracensis&quot;, &quot;Narcissus bujei&quot;, &quot;Narcissus longispathus&quot;, &quot;Narcissus nevadensis&quot;, &quot;Narcissus radinganorum&quot;). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.

In response, a number of species have been granted protected species status and protected areas (meadows) have been established such as the Negraşi Daffodil Meadow in Romania, or Kempley Daffodil Meadow in the UK. These areas often host daffodil festivals in the spring.

==Cultivation==
=== History ===
Of all the flowering plants, the bulbous have been the most popular for cultivation. Of these, narcissi are one of the most important spring flowering bulb plants in the world. Indigenous in Europe, the wild populations of the parent species had been known since antiquity. Narcissi have been cultivated from at least as early as the sixteenth century in the Netherlands, when large numbers of bulbs where imported from the field, particularly &quot;Narcissus hispanicus&quot;, which soon became nearly extinct in its native habitat of France and Spain, though still found in the southern part of that country. The only large-scale production at that time related to the double narcissus &quot;Van Sion&quot; and cultivars of &quot;N. tazetta&quot; imported in 1557.

Cultivation is also documented in Britain at this time, although contemporary accounts show it was well known as a favourite garden and wild flower long before that and was used in making garlands. This was a period when the development of exotic formal gardens and parks was becoming popular, particularly in what is known as the &quot;Oriental period&quot; (1560–1620). In his &quot;Hortus Medicus&quot; (1588), the first catalogue of a German garden&#x27;s plants, Joachim Camerarius the Younger states that nine different types of daffodils were represented in his garden in Nuremberg. After his death in 1598, his plants were moved by Basilius Besler to the gardens they had designed at Willibaldsburg, the bishop&#x27;s palace at Eichstätt, Upper Bavaria. That garden is described in Besler&#x27;s &quot;Hortus Eystettensis&quot; (1613) by which time there were 43 different types present. Another German source at this time was Peter Lauremberg who gives an account of the species known to him and their cultivation in his &quot;Apparatus plantarius: de plantis bulbosis et de plantis tuberosis&quot; (1632).

While Shakespeare&#x27;s daffodil is the wild or true English daffodil (&quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot;), many other species were introduced, some of which escaped and naturalised, particularly &quot;N. biflorus&quot; (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated (&quot;bastard daffodils&quot;) described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), (&quot;we have them all and every one of them in our London gardens, in great abundance&quot;, p. 114).

In the early seventeenth century, Parkinson helped to ensure the popularity of the daffodil as a cultivated plant by describing a hundred different varieties in his &quot;Paradisus Terrestris&quot; (1629), and introducing the great double yellow Spanish daffodil (&quot;Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno&quot; or Parkinson&#x27;s Daffodil, see illustration) to England.
Although not achieving the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi have been much celebrated in art and literature . The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils, &quot;N. poeticus&quot; and &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot;, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were an important component of the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing &quot;The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; nor do we know one that has been so early, or so honorably mention&#x27;d by all Kinds of Writers&quot; (see illustration). Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) &quot;N. tazetta&quot; (Polyanthus Narcissus). However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England, whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that &quot;N. tazetta&quot; (&quot;Narcisse à bouquet&quot;) is the fifth most important – &quot;Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention&quot;. Similarly Philip Miller, in his &quot;Gardeners Dictionary&quot; (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England, because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time. However, for most species of &quot;Narcissus&quot; Lauremberg&#x27;s dictum &quot;Magna cura non indigent Narcissi&quot; was much cited.

Narcissi became an important horticultural crop in Western Europe in the latter part of the nineteenth century, beginning in England between 1835 and 1855 and the end of the century in the Netherlands. By the beginning of the twentieth century 50 million bulbs of &quot;N. Tazetta&quot; &quot;Paperwhite&quot; were being exported annually from the Netherlands to the United States. With the production of triploids such as &quot;Golden Spur&quot;, in the late nineteenth century, and in the beginning of the twentieth century, tetraploids like &quot;King Alfred&quot; (1899), the industry was well established, with trumpet daffodils dominating the market. The Royal Horticultural Society has been an important factor in promoting narcissi, holding the first Daffodil Conference in 1884, while the Daffodil Society, the first organisation dedicated to the cultivation of narcissi was founded in Birmingham in 1898. Other countries followed and the American Daffodil Society which was founded in 1954 publishes &quot;The Daffodil Journal&quot; quarterly, a leading trade publication.
Narcissi are now popular as ornamental plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour from the end of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They are one of the most popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from &quot;N. poeticus&quot; a very reduced form.

=== In gardens ===
While some wild narcissi are specific in terms of their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.

Bulbs offered for sale are referred to as either &#x27;round&#x27; or &#x27;double nose&#x27;. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower at the end of the winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accept partial shade exposure.

Narcissi are well suited for planting under small thickets of trees, where they can be grouped as 6–12 bulbs. They also grow well in perennial borders, especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading. A number of wild species and hybrids such as &quot;Dutch Master&quot;, &quot;Golden Harvest&quot;, &quot;Carlton&quot;, &quot;Kings Court&quot; and &quot;Yellow Sun&quot; naturalise well in lawns, but it is important not to mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season. Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.

=== Propagation ===
The commonest form of commercial propagation is by twin-scaling, in which the bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with the two scales still connected by a small fragment of the basal plate. The fragments are disinfected and placed in nutrient media. Some 25–35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years. Micropropagation methods are not used for commercial production but are used for establishing commercial stock.

=== Breeding ===
For commercial use, varieties with a minimum stem length of are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, and there is a particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot;, &quot;N. cyclamineus&quot;, &quot;N. jonquilla&quot;, &quot;N. poeticus&quot;, &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot;, &quot;N. serotinus&quot; and &quot;N. tazetta&quot;.

&quot;Narcissus pseudonarcissus&quot; gave rise to trumpet cultivars with coloured tepals and corona, while its subspecies &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; subsp. &quot;bicolor&quot; was used for white tepaled varieties. To produce large cupped varieties, &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; was crossed with &quot;N. poeticus&quot;, and to produce small cupped varieties back crossed with &quot;N. poeticus&quot;. Multiheaded varieties, often called &quot;Poetaz&quot; are mainly hybrids of &quot;N. poeticus&quot; and &quot;N. tazetta&quot;.

=== Classification ===
For horticultural purposes, all &quot;Narcissus&quot; cultivars are split into 13 divisions as first described by Kington (1998), for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), based partly upon flower form (shape and length of corona), number of flowers per stem, flowering period and partly upon genetic background. Division 13, which includes wild daffodils, is the exception to this scheme. The classification is a useful tool for planning planting. Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).

Growers register new daffodil cultivars by name and colour with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus. Their &quot;International Daffodil Register&quot; is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W-W (&quot;Thalia&quot;). In horticultural usage it is common to also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).

====Colour code====

Daffodil breeding has introduced a wide range of colours, in both the outer perianth tepal segment and the inner corona. In the registry, daffodils are coded by the colours of each of these two parts. Thus &quot;Geranium&quot;, Tazetta (Division 8) as illustrated here with a white outer perianth and orange corona is classified as 8 W-O.

== Toxicity ==
=== Pharmacology ===
All &quot;Narcissus&quot; species contain the alkaloid poison lycorine, mostly in the bulb but also in the leaves. Members of the monocot subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids, the norbelladine alkaloids, which are 4-methylcatechol derivatives combined with tyrosine. They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species. Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known, of which 79 or more are known from &quot;Narcissus&quot; alone.

The toxic effects of ingesting &quot;Narcissus&quot; products for both humans and animals (such as cattle, goats, pigs, and cats) have long been recognised and they have been used in suicide attempts. Ingestion of &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; or &quot;N. jonquilla&quot; is followed by salivation, acute abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, then neurological and cardiac events, including trembling, convulsions, and paralysis. Death may result if large quantities are consumed.

The toxicity of &quot;Narcissus&quot; varies with species, &quot;N. poeticus&quot; being more toxic than &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot;, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance, there is a five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of &quot;N. papyraceus&quot; than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and is part of the plant&#x27;s defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.

=== Poisoning ===
Many cases of poisoning or death have occurred when narcissi bulbs have been mistaken for leeks or onions and cooked and eaten. Recovery is usually complete in a few hours without any specific intervention. In more severe cases involving ingestion of large quantities of bulbs, activated carbon, salts and laxatives may be required, and for severe symptoms intravenous atropine and emetics or stomach pumping may be indicated. However, ingestion of large quantities accidentally is unusual because of a strong unpleasant taste. When narcissi were compared with a number of other plants not normally consumed by animals, narcissi were the most repellent, specifically &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot;. Consequently, narcissus alkaloids have been used as repellents and may also discourage fungi, molds, and bacteria.

On 1 May 2009, a number of schoolchildren fell ill at Gorseland Primary School in Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, England, after a daffodil bulb was added to soup during a cookery class.

=== Topical effects ===
One of the most common dermatitis problems for flower pickers, packers, florists, and gardeners, &quot;daffodil itch&quot;, involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied by subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate, chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap, either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction. It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others. &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot; and the cultivars &quot;Actaea&quot;, &quot;Camparelle&quot;, &quot;Gloriosa&quot;, &quot;Grande Monarque&quot;, &quot;Ornatus&quot;, &quot;Princeps&quot; and &quot;Scilly White&quot; are known to do so.

If bulb extracts come into contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result. The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from &quot;N. bulbocodium&quot;.

==Uses==
=== Traditional medicine ===
Despite the lethal potential of &quot;Narcissus&quot; alkaloids, they have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints, including cancer. Plants thought to be &quot;N. poeticus&quot; and &quot;N. tazetta&quot; are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer. In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates (ca. B.C. 460–370) recommended a pessary prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors, a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. A.D. 40–90) and Soranus of Ephesus (A.D. 98–138) in the first and second centuries A.D., while the Roman Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23–79), advocated topical use. The bulbs of &quot;N. poeticus&quot; contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine. This usage is also found in later Arabian, North African, Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages. In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine. These bulbs contain pretazettine, an active antitumor compound.

&quot;Narcissus&quot; products have received a variety of other uses. The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in &quot;De Medicina&quot; among medical herbs, described as emollient, erodent, and &quot;powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body&quot;. N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were antiphlogistic and analgesic. Other uses include the application to wounds, strains, painful joints, and various local ailments as an ointment called &#x27;Narcissimum&#x27;. Powdered flowers have also been used medically, as an emetic, a decongestant and for the relief of dysentery, in the form of a syrup or infusion. The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic, the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac. In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K&#x27;Eogh recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns, bruises, dislocations and freckles, and for drawing out thorns and splinters. &quot;N. tazetta&quot; bulbs have also been used for contraception, while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy. In the traditional Japanese medicine of kampo, wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste; the plant, however, does not appear in the modern kampo herb list.

There is also a long history of the use of &quot;Narcissus&quot; as a stimulant and to induce trance like states and hallucinations. Sophocles referred to the narcissus as the &quot;Chaplet of the infernal Gods&quot;, a statement frequently wrongly attributed to Socrates (see Antiquity).

=== Biological properties ===
Extracts of &quot;Narcissus&quot; have demonstrated a number of potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of &quot;Narcissus&quot; bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannose-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.

It is likely that the traditional use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. &quot;N. poeticus&quot; contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.

Acetylcholine esterase inhibition has attracted the most interest as a possible therapeutic intervention, with activity varying by a thousandfold between species, and the greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or epinorgalanthamine.

The rodent repellant properties of &quot;Narcissus&quot; alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more vulnerable bulbs.

=== Therapeutics ===

Of all the alkaloids, only galantamine has made it to therapeutic use in humans, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system. Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine.

=== Commercial uses ===
Throughout history the scent of narcissi has been an important ingredient of perfumes, a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids. Narcissi are also an important horticultural crop, and source of cut flowers (floriculture).
The Netherlands, which is the most important source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, gladioli, irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third. About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season, 470 cultivars were produced on 1578 ha. By far the largest area cultivated is for the miniature &#x27;Tête-à-Tête&#x27;, followed at some distance by &#x27;Carlton&#x27;. The largest production cultivars are shown in Table II.

&quot;Carlton&quot; and &quot;Ice Follies&quot; (Division 2: Large cup) have a long history of cultivation, together with &quot;Dutch Master&quot; and &quot;Golden Harvest&quot; (1: yellow). &quot;Carlton&quot; and &quot;Golden Harvest&quot; were introduced in 1927, and &quot;Ice Follies&quot; in 1953. &quot;Carlton&quot;, with over 9 billion bulbs (350 000 tons), is among the more numerous individual plants produced in the world. The other major areas of production are the United States, Israel which exported 25 million &quot;N. tazetta&quot; cultivar bulbs in 2003, and the United Kingdom.

In the United Kingdom a total of 4100 ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800 ha were Narcissi, the UK&#x27;s most important bulb crop, much of which is for export, making this the largest global production centre, about half of the total production area. While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.
Production of both bulbs and cut flowers takes place in open fields in beds or ridges, often in the same field, allowing adaptation to changing market conditions. Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates. Compared to the United Kingdom, the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection. Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures are more susceptible to diseases that attack crops. Production is based on a 1 (UK) or 2 (Netherlands) year cycle. Optimal soil pH is 6.0–7.5. Prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place, such as immersion at 44.4 °C for three hours.

Bulbs are harvested for market in the summer, sorted, stored for 2–3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5 °C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5 °C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20 °C followed by cooling to 13 °C.

Traditionally, sales took place in the daffodil fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.

====Forcing====
There is also a market for forced blooms, both as cut flowers and potted flowers through the winter from Christmas to Easter, the long season requiring special preparation by growers.

===== Cut flowers =====
For cut flowers, bulbs larger than 12 cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are harvested in June to July, dried, stored for four days at 34 °C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20 °C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13 °C–15 °C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.

===== Potted flowers =====
For potted flowers a lower temperature is used for precooling (5 °C for 15 weeks), followed by 16 °C–18 °C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20 °C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9 °C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements. &quot;N. tazetta&quot; and its cultivars are an exception to this rule, requiring no cold period. Often harvested in October, bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30 °C for three weeks, then stored at 25 °C for 12 weeks and planted. Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5 °C–10 °C.

== Culture ==
=== Symbols ===
The daffodil is the national flower of Wales, associated with Saint David&#x27;s Day (March 1). The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or &quot;Nowruz&quot; in the Kurdish culture.

In the West the narcissus is perceived as a symbol of vanity, in the East as a symbol of wealth and good fortune , while in Persian literature, the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes.

In western countries the daffodil is also associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter. In Germany the wild narcissus, &quot;N. pseudonarcissus&quot;, is known as the &quot;Osterglocke&quot; or &quot;Easter bell.&quot; In the United Kingdom the daffodil is sometimes referred to as the Lenten lily.

Although prized as an ornamental flower, some people consider narcissi unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune. White narcissi, such as &quot;N triandrus&quot; &quot;Thalia&quot;, are especially associated with death, and have been called grave flowers. In Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs, and Robert Herrick describes them as portents of death, an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld .

=== Art ===
==== Antiquity ====

The decorative use of narcissi dates as far back as ancient Egyptian tombs, and frescoes at Pompeii. They are mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible as the Rose of Sharon and make frequent appearances in classical literature.

==== Greek culture ====
The narcissus appears in two Graeco-Roman myths, that of the youth Narcissus who was turned into the flower of that name, and of the Goddess Persephone snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers. The narcissus is considered sacred to both Hades and Persephone, and grows along the banks of the river Styx in the underworld.

The Greek poet Stasinos mentioned them in the &quot;Cypria&quot; amongst the flowers of Cyprus. The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly in the seventh century BC Homeric Hymn &quot;To Demeter&quot;, where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized.

Other Greek authors making reference to the narcissus include Sophocles and Plutarch. Sophocles, in &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner, implying fertility, allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore (Persephone), and by extension, a symbol of death. Jebb comments that it is &quot;the flower of imminent death&quot; with its fragrance being narcotic, emphasised by its pale white colour. Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom, the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death. Plutarch refers to this in his &quot;Symposiacs&quot; as numbing the nerves causing a heaviness in the limbs. He refers to Sophocles&#x27; &quot;crown of the great Goddesses&quot;, which is the source of the English phrase &quot;Chaplet of the infernal Gods&quot; incorrectly attributed to Socrates.

A passage by Moschus, describes fragrant narcissi. Homer in his &quot;Odyssey&quot; described the underworld as having Elysian meadows carpeted with flowers, thought to be narcissus, as described by Theophrastus. A similar account is provided by Lucian describing the flowers in the underworld. The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias. He believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus, and hence discounted the idea the flower was named after the youth.

==== Roman culture ====
Virgil, the first known Roman writer to refer to the narcissus, does so in several places, for instance twice in the &quot;Georgics&quot;. Virgil refers to the cup shaped corona of the narcissus flower, allegedly containing the tears of the self-loving youth Narcissus. Milton makes a similar analogy &quot;And Daffodillies fill their Cups with Tears&quot;. Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the &quot;Eclogues&quot;.

The poet Ovid also dealt with the mythology of the narcissus. In his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, he recounts the story of the youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower, and it is also mentioned in Book 5 of his poem &quot;Fasti&quot;. This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just &quot;Narcissus&quot;; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.

==== Western culture ====

Although there is no clear evidence that the flower&#x27;s name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of &quot;Narcissus&quot;). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid&#x27;s account. Gower&#x27;s reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or &quot;Narcissus&quot;, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth&#x27;s death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring &quot;Crocus&quot;. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in &quot;Aprill&quot; of his &quot;Shepheardes Calender&quot; (1579).

Shakespeare, who frequently uses flower imagery, refers to daffodils twice in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and also &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;. Robert Herrick alludes to their association with death in a number of poems. Among the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth&#x27;s short 1804 poem &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image. Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems. Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister, Dorothy is just as poetic, if not more so, just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of the first section of the Homeric &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; (see Greek culture, above). Among their contemporaries, Keats refers to daffodils among those things capable of bringing &quot;joy for ever&quot;.

More recently A. E. Housman, using one of the daffodil&#x27;s more symbolic names (see Symbols), wrote &quot;The Lent Lily&quot; in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, describing the traditional Easter death of the daffodil.

In &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, Rumer Godden describes the disorientation of English nuns in the Indian Himalayas, and gives the plant name an unexpected twist, alluding both to narcissism and the effect of the perfume &quot;Narcisse Noir&quot; (Caron) on others. The novel was later adapted into the 1947 British film of the same name. The narcissus also appears in German literature such as that of Paul Gerhardt.

In the visual arts, narcissi are depicted in three different contexts, mythological (Narcissus, Persephone), floral art, or landscapes. The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association. The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his &quot;Narcissus&quot;, the floral motif by van Scorel and the landscape by Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Undergrowth&quot;.

Narcissi first started to appear in western art in the late Middle Ages, in panel paintings, particularly those depicting crucifixion. For instance that of the Westfälischer Meister in Köln in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in the resurrection, because they are perennial and bloom at Easter.

==== Eastern cultures ====
In Chinese culture &quot;Narcissus tazetta&quot; subsp. &quot;chinensis&quot; (Chinese sacred lilies), which can be grown indoors, is widely used as an ornamental plant. It was probably introduced to China by Arab traders travelling the Silk Road prior to the Song dynasty for medicinal use. Spring-flowering, they became associated with Chinese New Year, signifying good fortune, prosperity and good luck and there are many legends in Chinese culture associated with &quot;Narcissus&quot;. In contrast to the West, narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art, however, Zhao Mengjian in the Southern Song dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi. Narcissus bulb carving and cultivation has become an art akin to Japanese bonsai. The Japanese novel &quot;Narcissu&quot; contains many references to the narcissus, where the main characters set out for the famed narcissus fields on Awaji Island.

==== Islamic culture ====
Narcissi are one of the most popular garden plants in Islamic culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I () is said to have not been able to tolerate them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day. The Persian phrase (, literally &quot;a reddish-blue narcissus&quot;) is a well-known metonymy for the &quot;eye(s) of a mistress&quot; in the classical poetries of the Persian, Urdu, Ottoman Turkish, Azerbaijani and Chagatai languages; to this day also the vernacular names of some narcissus cultivars (for example, &quot;Shahla-ye Shiraz&quot; and &quot;Shahla-ye Kazerun&quot;). As described by the poet Ghalib (1797–1869), &quot;God has given the eye of the narcissus the power of seeing&quot;. The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus, though some of the sayings that were cited as proof are considered &quot;weak&quot; records.

=== Popular culture ===
The word &quot;daffodil&quot; has been used widely in popular culture, from Dutch cars (DAF Daffodil) to films (Daffodils) to slurs against homosexuals and cross-dressers (as in the film &quot;J. Edgar&quot;, when Hoover&#x27;s mother explains why real-life cross-dresser Barton Pinkus was called &quot;Daffy&quot; (short for &quot;Daffodil&quot; and the equivalent of a pansy), and admonishes, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son&quot;.

=== Festivals ===
In some areas where narcissi are prevalent, their blooming in spring is celebrated in festivals. For instance, the slopes around Montreux, Switzerland and its associated riviera come alive with blooms each May (&quot;May Snow&quot;) at the annual Narcissi Festival. Festivals are also held in many other countries.

=== Cancer ===
Various cancer charities around the world, such as the American Cancer Society, Cancer Society, Cancer Council, Irish Cancer Society, and Marie Curie in the UK use the daffodil as a fundraising symbol on &quot;Daffodil Days&quot;.

The color takes its name from a species of plant, &quot;Narcissus jonquilla&quot;, which has clusters of small fragrant yellow flowers, and is native to the Mediterranean.

The first known recorded use of jonquil as a color name in English was in 1789.
==Cultural references==
Kurt Vonnegut uses the word jonquil in his novel &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, Titan being the largest moon of Saturn.

Josh Ritter&#x27;s song &quot;The Golden Age of Radio&quot; includes the line &quot;Yeah you look pretty good in that jonquil dress&quot;.

David Foster Wallace uses the expression &quot;jonquil-yellow&quot; in his novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.

<text>Henry Enrique Estrada (born March 16, 1949) is an American actor and police officer. He is known for his co-starring lead role as California Highway Patrol officer Francis (Frank) Llewelyn &quot;Ponch&quot; Poncherello in the police drama television series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, which ran from 1977 to 1983. He later became known for his work in Spanish-language &quot;telenovelas&quot;, his appearances in reality television shows and infomercials and as a regular voice on the Adult Swim series &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;.

== Early life ==
Estrada was born on March 16, 1949, in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York, the son of Carmen Moreno, a seamstress, and Renildo Estrada. He is of Puerto Rican descent. Growing up, he thought about becoming a police officer but turned to acting after joining the drama club at Louis D. Brandeis High School.

== Career ==
===1970–2000===
In 1970, Estrada made his film debut in the role of Nicky Cruz, alongside Pat Boone, in the independent film &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot;. In 1972, he appeared in a small role as a police officer in &quot;The New Centurions&quot;, which was followed by a significant role in a major motion picture, the Jack Smight disaster film, &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, where he played Julio, the womanizing flight engineer on a Boeing 747. The following year, he again worked with Smight in the successful military historical epic &quot;Midway&quot;, as a fictional airman Ens. &quot;Chili Bean&quot; Ramos.

Beginning in 1977, Estrada co-starred as Frank &quot;Ponch&quot; Poncharello in the TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot;. In 1978, he began training in martial arts with SeishinDo Kenpo instructor Frank Argelander (Frank Landers), to prepare for a two-part episode of the series. The two appeared on the cover of &quot;Fighting Stars Magazine&quot; that same year, discussing Estrada&#x27;s training regimen. On August 6, 1979, Estrada was seriously injured while filming a scene on the set of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, fracturing several ribs and breaking both wrists after he was thrown from his motorcycle.

Later in 1979, Estrada was voted one of &quot;The 10 Sexiest Bachelors in the World&quot; by &quot;People&quot; magazine and was featured on the cover of the November issue. Following a salary dispute with NBC in the fall of 1981, Estrada was briefly replaced by Olympic Gold Medalist and actor Bruce Jenner. Following co-star Larry Wilcox&#x27;s 1982 departure from the series amid behind-the-scenes friction, Estrada carried the remaining season of &quot;CHiPs&quot; without most of the supporting cast from the previous four seasons (who were fired due to budget costs), and the show was eventually canceled in 1983. In the 1980s, Estrada appeared in a string of low-budget films. He made a return to series television in a 1987 three-part episode of the police drama &quot;Hunter&quot;.

In the 1990s, Estrada played the role of Johnny, a Tijuana trucker, in the Televisa &quot;telenovela&quot; &quot;Dos mujeres, un camino&quot; (&quot;Two women, one path&quot;). He shared the main credits with Mexican actresses/singers Laura Leon and Bibi Gaytán. Originally slated for 100 episodes, the show went to 200-plus episodes and became the biggest &quot;telenovela&quot; in Latin American history. He was reportedly paid 1 million pesos for that role.

In 1994, Estrada began co-hosting the syndicated outdoor adventure show &quot;American Adventurer&quot;, which ran until 2004. In 1995, he made a special guest appearance as Ponch in punk rock band Bad Religion&#x27;s music video &quot;Infected&quot;, as well as in the video for the Butthole Surfers&#x27;s video for &quot;Pepper&quot;. He has also been seen on a few episodes of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; as himself, seen in a daydream cloud in Hilda&#x27;s mind and driving a car as Hilda zapped herself in his car.

In 1997, Estrada wrote his autobiography, &quot;Erik Estrada: My Road from Harlem to Hollywood&quot;. In 1998, he returned as the character Francis &quot;Ponch&quot; Poncherello in the TNT made-for-TV movie &quot;CHiPs &#x27;99&quot;, along with the rest of the original cast.

===2000–present===
In 2001, Estrada landed a role on the daytime drama &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Eduardo Dominguez. In 2002, he played a game-show host on the Disney Channel series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; with Hilary Duff. He also made a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Spy TV&quot; in 2002. He has also had a regular role doing voiceovers for the Cartoon Network show &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, where he would parody himself. He also appeared in an episode of another Cartoon Network show, &quot;Space Ghost: Coast to Coast&quot;, which features a character named Moltar who has an obsession with Estrada and&quot; CHiPS&quot;, as a guest. Estrada has also guest-starred on the children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Maya &amp; Miguel&quot;.

Estrada has appeared in music videos, such as Eminem&#x27;s music video &quot;Just Lose It&quot;. A band named after him (Estradasphere) is based in Santa Cruz, California. Estrada also made guest appearances on &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, the Nickelodeon comedy &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Scrubs&quot; and &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;According to Jim&quot;.

Estrada has done a long-running series of infomercials as a national spokesman for National Recreational Properties, selling undeveloped real estate property in such locations as Siskiyou County, California; Lake Shastina, California; California City, California; Ocean Shores, Washington; Colorado; and recently, Tellico Village, Tennessee and Bella Vista, Arkansas.

Estrada began appearing in Burger King TV commercials in September 2009. In the ads, he (playing himself) attended a class on endorsing products led by race car driver Tony Stewart. During the spoof, Estrada seeks to understand why American consumers were not interested in purchasing his &quot;Estrada&quot; sunglasses that noticeably had his last name written boldly across the lens.

More recently, Estrada appeared in a number of reality television shows. In 2004, he starred in both the second season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; and in &quot;Discovery Health Body Challenge&quot;. He also starred in the short-lived CBS reality show, &quot;Armed &amp; Famous&quot;. In 2008, Estrada appeared in &quot;Husband for Hire&quot;, a television movie starring Nadine Velazquez and Mario López. After a series of specials, in 2010, Estrada and Laura McKenzie began co-hosting a weekly series, &quot;The World&#x27;s Funniest Moments&quot;, which began as a myNetworkTV series hosted by Arsenio Hall.

In 2011, Estrada was a contestant on the second season of the Spanish Univision reality show &quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot;, a weekly dance competition similar to &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, in which he finished in third place out of ten contestants. In 2013, he starred in &quot;Finding Faith&quot;, a film about a young teenager who is kidnapped from a meeting planned online. The story of sexual predation is based on true incidents investigated by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Estrada toured with the film, aiming to educate parents and young people about the dangers of online grooming.
Eric played a minor role as a paramedic at the end of the movie in the 2017 movie &quot;Chips&quot;

=== Activism ===
In 2000, Estrada was named the international &quot;Face&quot; of D.A.R.E. which is a campaign against drugs. He also speaks out for the American Heart Association, the United Way, and the C.H.P. 11-99 Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides benefits and scholarships to California Highway Patrol family members, as well as funeral expenses for fallen officers. Estrada&#x27;s experience in &quot;CHiPs&quot; led him to become a reserve officer for the Muncie Police Department in Muncie, Indiana. Estrada became spokesperson for the C.H.P.&#x27;s &quot;car seat inspection and installation&quot; program. He has made numerous appearances supporting automobile child-seat safety checks across the country. He appeared in Española, New Mexico, on May 28, 2009, to promote the &quot;100 Days and Nights of Summer&quot; traffic safety and anti-DWI campaign that involves the New Mexico State Police.

=== Law enforcement ===
Estrada became a reserve police officer for the Muncie, Indiana Police Department, depicted on &quot;Armed &amp; Famous&quot;. From there, Estrada moved to Virginia, where he was an I.C.A.C. (Internet Crimes Against Children) investigator for eight years in Bedford County, Virginia. As of July 1, 2016, he was a reserve police officer in St. Anthony, Idaho. In the course of his duties, Estrada has been filmed patrolling on a police motorcycle.

<text>The ferret (Mustela furo) is a small, domesticated species belonging to the family Mustelidae. The ferret is most likely a domesticated form of the wild European polecat (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;), as evidenced by the ferret&#x27;s ability to interbreed with European polecats and produce hybrid offspring. Physically, ferrets resemble other mustelids because of their long, slender bodies. Including their tail, the average length of a ferret is about ; they weigh between ; and their fur can be black, brown, white, or a mixture of those colours. The species is sexually dimorphic, with males being considerably larger than females.

Ferrets may have been domesticated since ancient times, but there is widespread disagreement because of the sparseness of written accounts and the inconsistency of those which survive. Contemporary scholarship agrees that ferrets were bred for sport, hunting rabbits in a practice known as rabbiting. In North America, the ferret has become an increasingly prominent choice of household pet, with over five million in the United States alone. The legality of ferret ownership varies by location. In New Zealand and some other countries, restrictions apply due to the damage done to native fauna by feral colonies of polecat–ferret hybrids. The ferret has also served as a fruitful research animal, contributing to research in neuroscience and infectious disease, especially influenza.

The domestic ferret is often confused with the black-footed ferret (&quot;Mustela nigripes&quot;), a species native to North America.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;ferret&quot; is derived from the Latin , meaning &quot;little thief&quot;, a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items. In Old English (Anglo-Saxon), the animal was called . The word seems to appear in Middle English in the 14th century from the Latin, with the modern spelling of &quot;ferret&quot; by the 16th century.

The Greek word &quot;íktis&quot;, Latinized as &quot;ictis&quot; occurs in a play written by Aristophanes, &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, in 425 BC. Whether this was a reference to ferrets, polecats, or the similar Egyptian mongoose is uncertain.

A male ferret is called a hob; a female ferret is a jill. A spayed female is a sprite, a neutered male is a gib, and a vasectomised male is known as a hoblet. Ferrets under one year old are known as kits. A group of ferrets is known as a &quot;business&quot;, or historically as a &quot;busyness&quot;. Other purported collective nouns, including &quot;besyness&quot;, &quot;fesynes&quot;, &quot;fesnyng&quot; and &quot;feamyng&quot;, appear in some dictionaries, but are almost certainly ghost words.

==Biology==
===Characteristics===

Ferrets have a typical mustelid body-shape, being long and slender. Their average length is about including a tail. Their pelage has various colorations including brown, black, white or mixed. They weigh between and are sexually dimorphic as the males are substantially larger than females. The average gestation period is 42 days and females may have two or three litters each year. The litter size is usually between three and seven kits which are weaned after three to six weeks and become independent at three months. They become sexually mature at approximately 6 months and the average life span is 7 to 10 years. Ferrets are induced ovulators and can copulate for longer than one hour.

===Behavior===

Ferrets spend 14–18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular. If they are caged, they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity; they need at least an hour and a place to play. Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups. They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.

Like many other mustelids, ferrets have scent glands near their anus, the secretions from which are used in scent marking. Ferrets can recognize individuals from these anal gland secretions, as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals. Ferrets may also use urine marking for mating and individual recognition.

As with skunks, ferrets can release their anal gland secretions when startled or scared, but the smell is much less potent and dissipates rapidly. Most pet ferrets in the US are sold descented (with the anal glands removed). In many other parts of the world, including the UK and other European countries, de-scenting is considered an unnecessary mutilation.

If excited, they may perform a behavior called the &quot;weasel war dance&quot;, characterized by frenzied sideways hops, leaps and bumping into nearby objects. Despite its common name, it is not aggressive but is a joyful invitation to play. It is often accompanied by a unique soft clucking noise, commonly referred to as &quot;dooking&quot;. When scared, ferrets will hiss; when upset, they squeak softly.

===Diet===
Ferrets are obligate carnivores. The natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small prey, including meat, organs, bones, skin, feathers and fur. Ferrets have short digestive systems and a quick metabolism, so they need to eat frequently. Prepared dry foods consisting almost entirely of meat (including high-grade cat food, although specialized ferret food is increasingly available and preferable) provide the most nutritional value. Some ferret owners feed pre-killed or live prey (such as mice and rabbits) to their ferrets to more closely mimic their natural diet. Ferret digestive tracts lack a cecum and the animal is largely unable to digest plant matter. Before much was known about ferret physiology, many breeders and pet stores recommended food like fruit in the ferret diet, but it is now known that such foods are inappropriate, and may in fact have negative consequences for ferret health. Ferrets imprint on their food at around six months old. This can make introducing new foods to an older ferret a challenge, and even simply changing brands of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that has never eaten the food as a kit. It is therefore advisable to expose young ferrets to as many different types and flavors of appropriate food as possible.

===Dentition===

Ferrets have four types of teeth (the number includes maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth) with a dental formula of :
* Twelve small incisor teeth (only long) located between the canines in the front of the mouth. These are used for grooming.
* Four canines used for killing prey.
* Twelve premolar teeth that the ferret uses to chew food—located at the sides of the mouth, directly behind the canines. The ferret uses these teeth to cut through flesh, using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunks.
* Six molars (two on top and four on the bottom) at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food.

===Health===

Ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems. Among the most common are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas and lymphatic system.

Adrenal disease, a growth of the adrenal glands that can be either hyperplasia or cancer, is most often diagnosed by signs like unusual hair loss, increased aggression, and difficulty urinating or defecating. Treatment options include surgery to excise the affected glands, melatonin or deslorelin implants, and hormone therapy. The causes of adrenal disease speculated to include unnatural light cycles, diets based around processed ferret foods, and prepubescent neutering. It has also been suggested that there may be a hereditary component to adrenal disease.

Insulinoma, a type of cancer of the islet cells of the pancreas, is the most common form of cancer in ferrets. It is most common in ferrets between the ages of 4 and 5 years old.

Lymphoma is the most common malignancy in ferrets. Ferret lymphosarcoma occurs in two forms—&quot;juvenile lymphosarcoma&quot;, a fast-growing type that affects ferrets younger than two years, and &quot;adult lymphosarcoma&quot;, a slower-growing form that affects ferrets four to seven years old.

Viral diseases include canine distemper, influenza and ferret systemic coronavirus.

A high proportion of ferrets with white markings which form coat patterns known as a blaze, badger, or panda coat, such as a stripe extending from their face down the back of their head to their shoulder blades, or a fully white head, have a congenital deafness (partial or total) which is similar to Waardenburg syndrome in humans. Ferrets without white markings, but with premature graying of the coat, are also more likely to have some deafness than ferrets with solid coat colors which do not show this trait. Most albino ferrets are not deaf; if deafness does occur in an albino ferret, this may be due to an underlying white coat pattern which is obscured by the albinism.

Health problems can occur in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems. Ferrets will also often chew on and swallow foreign objects which can lead to bowel obstruction.

==History of domestication==

In common with most domestic animals, the original reason for ferrets being domesticated by human beings is uncertain, but it may have involved hunting. According to phylogenetic studies, the ferret was domesticated from the European polecat (&quot;Mustela putorius&quot;), and likely descends from a North African lineage of the species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggests that ferrets were domesticated around 2,500 years ago. It has been claimed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate ferrets, but as no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found, nor any hieroglyph of a ferret, and no polecat now occurs wild in the area, that idea seems unlikely. The American Society of Mammalogists classifies &quot;M. furo&quot; as a distinct species.

Ferrets were probably used by the Romans for hunting. Genghis Khan, ruler of the Mongol Empire, is recorded as using ferrets in a gigantic hunt in 1221 that aimed to purge an entire region of wild animals.

Colonies of feral ferrets have established themselves in areas where there is no competition from similarly sized predators, such as in the Shetland Islands and in remote regions in New Zealand. Where ferrets coexist with polecats, hybridization is common. It has been claimed that New Zealand has the world&#x27;s largest feral population of ferret–polecat hybrids. In 1877, farmers in New Zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population, which was also introduced by humans. Five ferrets were imported in 1879, and in 1882–1883, 32 shipments of ferrets were made from London, totaling 1,217 animals. Only 678 landed, and 198 were sent from Melbourne, Australia. On the voyage, the ferrets were mated with the European polecat, creating a number of hybrids that were capable of surviving in the wild. In 1884 and 1886, close to 4,000 ferrets and ferret hybrids, 3,099 weasels and 137 stoats were turned loose. Concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit populations dropped, and this is exactly what happened to New Zealand&#x27;s bird species which previously had had no mammalian predators.

===Ferreting===
For millennia, the main use of ferrets was for hunting, or &quot;ferreting&quot;. With their long, lean build and inquisitive nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. The Roman historians Pliny and Strabo record that Caesar Augustus sent &quot; from Libya to the Balearic Islands to control rabbit plagues there in 6 BC; it is speculated that &quot; could refer to ferrets, mongooses, or polecats. In England, in 1390, a law was enacted restricting the use of ferrets for hunting to the relatively wealthy:
Ferrets were first introduced into the American continents in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents. They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom, where rabbits are considered a pest by farmers. The practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that ferrets could unbalance the ecology. In 2009 in Finland, where ferreting was previously unknown, the city of Helsinki began to use ferrets to restrict the city&#x27;s rabbit population to a manageable level. Ferreting was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits.

==As pets==
In the United States, ferrets were relatively rare pets until the 1980s. A government study by the California State Bird and Mammal Conservation Program estimated that by 1996 about 800,000 domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the United States.

===Regulation===
* Australia: It is illegal to keep ferrets as pets in Queensland and the Northern Territory; in the Australian Capital Territory a licence is required.
* Brazil: Ferrets are allowed only if they are given a microchip identification tag and sterilized.
* New Zealand: It has been illegal to sell, distribute or breed ferrets in New Zealand since 2002 unless certain conditions are met.
* United States: Ferrets were once banned in many US states, but most of these laws were rescinded in the 1980s and 1990s as they became popular pets.
** Illegal: Ferrets are illegal in California under Fish and Game Code Section 2118; and the California Code of Regulations, although it is not illegal for veterinarians in the state to treat ferrets kept as pets. &quot;Ferrets are strictly prohibited as pets under Hawaii law because they are potential carriers of the rabies virus&quot;; the territory of Puerto Rico has a similar law. Ferrets are restricted by some municipalities, such as New York City, which renewed its ban in 2015. They are also prohibited on many military bases. A permit to own a ferret is needed in other areas, including Rhode Island. Illinois and Georgia do not require a permit to merely possess a ferret, but a permit is required to breed ferrets. It was once illegal to own ferrets in Dallas, Texas, but the current Dallas City Code for Animals includes regulations for the vaccination of ferrets. Pet ferrets are legal in Wisconsin, however legality varies by municipality. The city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for example, classifies ferrets as a wild animal and subsequently prohibits them from being kept within the city limits. Also, an import permit from the state department of agriculture is required to bring one into the state. Under common law, ferrets are deemed &quot;wild animals&quot; subject to strict liability for injuries they cause, but in several states statutory law has overruled the common law, deeming ferrets &quot;domestic&quot;.
* Japan: In Hokkaido prefecture, ferrets must be registered with the local government. In other prefectures, no restrictions apply. 
* South Africa: In the Western Cape province, a permit is required to buy, sell, or possess a ferret.
==Other uses==
Because they share many anatomical and physiological features with humans, ferrets are extensively used as experimental subjects in biomedical research. Fields such as virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, endocrinology and neuroscience all rely on ferrets for studies into cardiovascular disease, nutrition, respiratory diseases such as SARS and human influenza, airway physiology, cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal disease. 

Ferrets are a particularly important animal model for human influenza, and have been used to study the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) virus. Ferrets inoculated intra-nasally with human naso-pharyngeal washes develop an influenza transmissible to other cage mates and human investigators. A very small experimental study of ferrets found that a nasal spray effectively blocked the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

In the UK, ferret racing is often a feature of rural fairs or festivals, with people placing small bets on ferrets that run set routes through pipes and wire mesh. Although financial bets are placed, the event is primarily for entertainment purposes as opposed to &#x27;serious&#x27; betting sports such as horse or greyhound racing.

==Terminology and coloring==

Most ferrets are either albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors. In recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns. Color refers to the color of the ferret&#x27;s guard hairs, undercoat, eyes and nose; pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body, mask and nose, as well as white markings on the head or feet when present. Some national organizations, such as the American Ferret Association, have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standards.

There are four basic colors. The sable (including chocolate and dark brown), albino, dark-eyed white (DEW, also known as black-eyed white or BEW) and silver. All the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories.

===Waardenburg-like coloring===
Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to Waardenburg syndrome. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, white face markings, and also partial or total deafness. It is estimated as many as 75 percent of ferrets with these Waardenburg-like colorings are deaf.

White ferrets were favored in the Middle Ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth. Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; is likely mislabelled; the animal is probably a ferret, not a stoat (for which &quot;ermine&quot; is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat). Similarly, the ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth I shows her with her pet ferret, which has been decorated with painted-on heraldic ermine spots.

&quot;The Ferreter&#x27;s Tapestry&quot; is a 15th-century tapestry from Burgundy, France, now part of the Burrell Collection housed in the Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries. It shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets. This image was reproduced in &quot;Renaissance Dress in Italy 1400–1500&quot;, by Jacqueline Herald, Bell &amp; Hyman.

&quot;Gaston Phoebus&#x27; Book of the Hunt&quot; was written in approximately 1389 to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals, including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits. Illustrations show how multicolored ferrets that were fitted with muzzles were used to chase rabbits out of their warrens and into waiting nets.

==Import restrictions==
* Australia – Ferrets cannot be imported into Australia. A report drafted in August 2000 seems to be the only effort made to date to change the situation.
* Canada – Ferrets brought from anywhere except the US require a Permit to Import from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Animal Health Office. Ferrets from the US require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian. Ferrets under three months old are not subject to any import restrictions.
* European Union – , dogs, cats and ferrets can travel freely within the European Union under the pet passport scheme. To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead). Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a distemper vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. Ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country. PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.
* New Zealand – New Zealand has banned the import of ferrets into the country.
* United Kingdom – The UK accepts ferrets under the EU&#x27;s PETS travel scheme. Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies, and documented. They must be treated for ticks and tapeworms 24 to 48 hours before entry. They must also arrive via an authorized route. Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be subject to a six-month quarantine.

<text>The Musar movement (also Mussar movement) is a Jewish ethical, educational and cultural movement that developed in 19th century Lithuania, particularly among Orthodox Lithuanian Jews. The Hebrew term () is adopted from the Book of Proverbs (1:2) describing moral conduct, instruction or discipline, educating oneself on how one should act in an appropriate manner. The term was used by the Musar movement to convey the teachings regarding ethical and spiritual paths. The Musar movement made significant contributions to Musar literature and Jewish ethics. The movement has been revived in the 21st century amongst Jews of all denominations, particularly in the United States.

== Origin ==
The Musar movement arose among non-Hasidic Misnagdim Orthodox Lithuanian Jews as a response to the social changes brought about by the Enlightenment and the corresponding Haskalah movement among many European Jews. In this period of history, anti-Semitism, assimilation, and the impoverished living conditions of many Jews in the Pale of Settlement caused severe tension and disappointment. Many of the institutions of Lithuanian Jewry were beginning to break up. Religious Jews feared that their way of life was slipping away from them, observance of traditional Jewish law and custom was on the decline, and even those who remained loyal to the tradition were losing their emotional connection to its inner meaning and ethical core.

== Early leaders ==
The founding of the Musar movement is attributed to Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter (1810–1883), although the roots of the movements drew on ideas previously expressed in classical rabbinical literature. 

===Rabbi Yisrael Salanter===
Yisrael Lipkin Salanter, a promising young rabbi with exceptional knowledge of Jewish law living in Salantai, Lithuania, was initially inspired to dedicate his life to the cause of spreading Musar by his teacher Rabbi Yosef Zundel Salant (1786–1866). Zundel Salant was a student of rabbis Chaim Volozhin and Akiva Eiger, whose profoundly good-hearted and humble behavior and simple lifestyle attracted Yisrael Salanter&#x27;s interest. Zundel Salant was said to urge Salanter to focus on Musar.

Widely recognized as a rabbi of exceptional talent, Yisrael Salanter became head of a yeshivah in Vilna, where he quickly became well known in the community for his scholarship. He soon resigned this post to open up his own yeshiva, in which he emphasized moral teachings based on the ethics taught in traditional Jewish rabbinic works, especially Musar literature. Salanter referred to his approach as the &quot;Musar&quot; approach, using the Hebrew word for ethical discipline or correction.

In seeking to encourage the study of Musar literature, Salanter had three works of Musar literature republished in Vilna: &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, &quot;Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh&quot; by Solomon ibn Gabirol, and &quot;Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh&quot; by Menachem Mendel Lefin.

He particularly concentrated on teaching Jewish business ethics, saying that just as one checks carefully to make sure his food is kosher, so too should one check to see if his money is earned in a kosher fashion.

Rabbi Salanter set an example for the Lithuanian Jewish community during the cholera epidemic of 1848, ensuring that necessary relief work on Shabbat for Jews was done by Jews (despite the ordinary prohibition against doing work on Shabbat), and ordering Jews whose lives were in danger to eat rather than fast on the fast day of Yom Kippur.

In 1848, the Czarist government created the Vilna Rabbinical School and Teachers&#x27; Seminary. Salanter was identified as a candidate to teach at the school, but he refused the position and left Vilna. Salanter moved to Kovno, where he established a Musar-focused yeshiva at the Nevyozer Kloiz.

In 1857 he moved to Germany. By this time his own students from Kovno had begun to set up their own yeshivot in Kelme, Telz, and elsewhere. Salanter later helped to found another institution, the Kovno Kollel.

In Germany, Salanter founded a periodical entitled &quot;Tevunah&quot;, dedicated in part to Musar. Many of Rabbi Salanter&#x27;s articles from &quot;Tevunah&quot; were collected and published in &quot;Imrei Binah&quot; (1878). His &quot;Iggeret ha-Musar&quot; (&quot;ethical letter&quot;) was first published in 1858 and then repeatedly thereafter. Many of his letters were published in &quot;Or Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The Light of Israel&quot;) in 1890 (edited by Rabbi Yitzchak Blazer). Many of his discourses were published in &quot;Even Yisrael&quot; (1883).

Salanter also wrote &quot;An Essay on the Topic of Reinforcing Those who Learn our Holy Torah,&quot; published by his students in a collection of essays titled &quot;Etz Pri.&quot; This essay is important for its exploration of the concept of the subconscious, well before the concept was popularized by Sigmund Freud. In Salanter&#x27;s essay, the concept of conscious (&quot;outerness&quot; [&quot;chitzoniut&quot;]) and subconscious (&quot;innerness&quot; [&quot;penimiut&quot;]) processes and the role they play in the psychological, emotional and moral functioning of man is developed. Salanter explains that it is critical for a person to recognize what his subconscious motivations [&quot;negiot&quot;] are and to work on understanding them. He also teaches that the time for a person to work on mastering subconscious impulses was during times of emotional quiet, when a person is more in control of his thoughts and feelings. Salanter stresses that when a person is in the middle of an acute emotional response to an event, he is not necessarily in control of his thoughts and faculties and will not have access to the calming perspectives necessary to allow his conscious mind to intercede.

Scholar Hillel Goldberg and others have described Salanter as a &quot;psychologist&quot; as well as a moralist.

=== Second generation ===
After Salanter&#x27;s death, the Musar movement was led by his disciples, who developed the movement in various ways.

Salanter&#x27;s eldest disciple, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv, directed yeshivas in Kelme and Grobin. These yeshivas broke with established models of yeshivot in a number of ways, especially by devoting significant time to the study of musar and by teaching general, non-Jewish studies. Simcha Zissel also wrote discourses that deeply engaged questions of moral virtue and gave particular attention to the importance of love for others.

A second student of Salanter&#x27;s, Rabbi Yitzchak Blazer became the chief rabbi of St. Petersburg in 1861–62, and later led the Kovno kollel. Blazer also published many of Salanter&#x27;s writings. 

A third leading disciple of Salanter, Rabbi Naftali Amsterdam, became the chief rabbi of Helsinki.

=== Third generation ===

In the following generation, leaders of the Musar movement included Zissel&#x27;s student Nosson Tzvi Finkel of Slabodka, and Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz of Novaradok. The schools founded by these two men became the largest and most influential schools of Musar. The Slobodka school founded by Finkel became especially influential, but the Novaradok school also gained a significant following. Louis Jacobs has described the difference between these two schools as follows:

== Controversy ==

In later years, opposition to the Musar movement developed in some segments of the Orthodox community. Many opposed the new educational system that Yisrael Salanter set up, and others charged that deviations from traditional methods would lead to assimilation as expected in classical German Reform Judaism.

In 1897, Eliezer Gordon, of the Telshe yeshiva, hired a new Musar supervisor, Rabbi Leib Chasman, who instituted a very strict Musar regime in the yeshiva. Many of the students opposed this approach, which caused dissent among the student body. At the same time, dissent against Musar also broke out at the Slobodka Yeshiva. A group of Lithuanian rabbis then published a declaration in the Hebrew newspaper &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot; in opposition to the study of Musar. According to the &quot;YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe&quot;,

== After World War II ==

Many of the Jews involved in the Musar movement were killed in the Holocaust. Hillel Goldberg has written that it was only before World War II that Musar was &quot;still a living community.&quot;

Some students of the Musar movement, however, settled in the land of Israel and established Musar yeshivas there.

While many former students of the Musar movement settled in the United States and were involved in a variety of Jewish institutions, they established few formal institutions dedicated to Musar during the 20th century.

Many traditional yeshivas throughout the world, however, continued to allot some time during the week for Musar, and this continues today. This time is often dedicated to the study of Musar literature.

== 21st century revival ==
At the start of the 21st century, a significant revival of interest in the Musar movement has occurred in North America in various sectors of the Jewish world.

The Mussar Institute, founded by Alan Morinis and afterwards led by Avi Fertig, has achieved a very wide reach with over 7,000 members and 400 &quot;chaveirim&quot;, a dedicated group of members committed to frequent musar study. Within the Orthodox community, the AishDas Society, founded by Rabbi Micha Berger, and the Salant Foundation, founded by Rabbi Zvi Miller, are organizations which organize Musar groups, classes and other teaching events. Orthodox rabbis Yechiel Yitzchok Perr, Hillel Goldberg, Elyakim Krumbein, Avi Fertig, David Jaffe and Micha Berger have published English books about various aspects of Musar. The founders of both The Mussar Institute and the AishDas Society found much of their inspiration in Rabbi Hillel Goldberg&#x27;s English work, &quot;The Fire Within: A Living Heritage of the Musar&quot; (1987). Dr. Alan Morinis, founder of &quot;The Mussar Institute,&quot; writes &quot;it was the introduction to my spiritual lineage...it holds a special place (for me).&quot; Micha Berger notes it was the book &quot;which inspired me to explore musar,&quot; a topic which had already been central to his life as founder of the &quot;AishDas Society&quot;. 

Though the Musar movement was a historically Orthodox Jewish movement, its approach has gained significant traction among non-Orthodox Jews, who have spearheaded much of its 21st century revival. The Mussar Institute and the Center for Contemporary Mussar, founded by Rabbi Ira F. Stone, are among the institutions which have sought to spread the practice of Musar in a non-Orthodox framework. Morinis&#x27; book &quot;Everyday Holiness&quot; (2007) and Stone&#x27;s book &quot;A Responsible Life&quot; (2007) were among the popular books that sparked contemporary interest in the Musar movement. Musar has been described as &quot;an emerging and growing phenomenon&quot; within Reform Judaism, and leaders of Conservative Judaism have debated whether Musar should stand at the center of its approach. Geoffrey Claussen of Elon University has argued that the Musar movement&#x27;s conception of Jewish practice may be especially valuable for Conservative Judaism. Greg Marcus of the organization American Mussar has said that Musar can be accessible to many American Jews who don&#x27;t speak any Hebrew, and can be adapted to the spiritual needs of American Jews.

Some Musar groups have no connection with synagogues, but a number of synagogues have started programs for the study of Musar. There are also online communities dedicated to the exploration of Musar and character trait development.

Musar practice has been incorporated into the curriculum at Jewish day schools such as the Gann Academy and at rabbinical schools such as the Academy for Jewish Religion (California) and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.

Some teachers have recommended the practice of Musar not only for Jews but also among non-Jews. The website of the Mussar Institute said:

==Study and practice==
The Musar Institute website says:

Musar practices include text study, meditation, silence and retreat, diary practices, chanting (nigunim), contemplation, visualization, tzedakah, and doing good deeds on behalf of others. 

===Musar literature===

One of the central practices of the Musar movement was studying and meditating on classical musar literature including:

* &quot;Chovot HaLevavot&quot;, by Bahya ibn Paquda (11th century)
* &quot;Ma&#x27;alot HaMiddot&quot;, by Yehiel ben Yekutiel Anav of Rome
* &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot;, by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto
* &quot;Orchot Tzaddikim&quot; (&quot;The Ways of the Righteous&quot;), by an anonymous author
* &quot;Tomer Devorah&quot; (&quot;The Palm Tree of Deborah&quot;) by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero
* &quot;Shaarei Teshuvah&quot; (The Gates of Repentance) by Yonah Gerondi
* &quot;Madreigat Ha&#x27;Adam&quot; by Yosef Yozel Horwitz
* &quot;Cheshbon HaNefesh (Accounting of the Soul)&quot; by Menachem Mendel Lefin of Satanov 
* &quot;The Musar Letter&quot; of the Vilna Gaon

=== Meditation ===
The Musar Movement has encouraged a number of Jewish meditation practices using introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character. Many meditation techniques were described in the writings of Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv. Alan Morinis, the founder of the Mussar Institute, recommends morning meditation practices that can be as short as four minutes. One of the meditations recommended by Morinis is the practice of focusing on a single word: the Hebrew word &quot;Sh&#x27;ma,&quot; meaning &quot;listen&quot;.

=== Nigunim and Chant ===
The Musar movement has also encouraged the chanting of nigunim, based on the realization of how music affects the inner life. In the 19th century, the Musar movement developed its own distinctive nigun chanting traditions. In the 21st century, nigunim may be used at the start and the end of musar study sessions and may help to create an emotional musar experience.

=== Charity ===
Musar writings describe giving charity as a central obligation and a central way to cultivate the character trait of generosity.

===Giving musar===
&quot;Giving musar&quot; (discipline, instruction) refers to a way to use one&#x27;s speech to correct, admonish, or reprove others (Leviticus 19:17), in line with a verse from Proverbs 1:8 also in the daily prayer book: &quot;Hear, my child, the discipline (musar) of your father, and do not forsake the teachings of your mother.&quot; Giving musar through speech is meant to help mold lives. Shimon Schwab taught that although &quot;[at times] you must &quot;give&quot; musar&quot; the command to do so (Lev. 19:17) is followed by &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; and that &quot;if you want ..(someone).. to change, (it must be) &quot;done through love.&quot;&quot;

Giving musar may also happen through a formal lecture known as &quot;a musar shmuz&quot; or &quot;musar shiur,&quot; which are often part of a yeshiva curriculum. Elya Lopian taught the practice as &quot;teaching the heart what the mind already understands.&quot;

<doc id="142870" wikidata="Q4357735" url="?curid=142870" title="Zalman Schachter-Shalomi">
<text>Meshullam Zalman Schachter-Shalomi (28 August 1924 – 3 July 2014), commonly called &quot;Reb Zalman&quot; (full Hebrew name: ), was one of the founders of the Jewish Renewal movement and an innovator in ecumenical dialogue.

Born in Poland, Shachter-Shalomi was raised an Orthodox Jew in a variety of countries as his family repeatedly moved to evade increasing antisemitism in 1930s Europe. While awaiting a visa to the United States in an internment camp in Vichy France, Shachter-Shalomi met Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the later seventh Chabad rebbe. Becoming a Chabad rabbi in 1947, Shacheter-Shalomi took a deep interest in the spiritual practices of other faiths and immersed himself in the counter-culture of the 1960s. Eventually expelled from Chabad, he founded his own organisation, B&#x27;Nai Or (later P&#x27;Nai Or) and his attempts to innovate in Jewish prayer pioneered what became the chavurah and Jewish Renewal movements. 

Employed as an academic in his later years, Schacter-Shalomi continued to work in interfaith dialogue and spreading hasidut, and in the 1990s was part of a group of four rabbis who travelled to Dharamsala, India, to advise the Dalai Lama on how to retain religious traditions in exile and prevent assimilation. A prolific author, Schacter-Shalomi published dozens of books on many topics including hasidut, ecstatic prayer, contemplative spirituality, environmental consciousness, and spiritual direction. Schacter-Shalomi died in 2014 and is buried in Boulder, Colorado. He was married four times and had eleven children.

==Early life==
Born Meshullam Zalman Schachter in 1924 to Shlomo and Hayyah Gittel Schachter in Żółkiew, Poland (now Zhovkva, Ukraine), Schachter spent his early years in Vienna, Austria. His father was a liberal Belzer hasid and had Zalman educated at both a Zionist high school and an Orthodox yeshiva. After the Anschluss, Schacter-Shalomi&#x27;s family moved to Antwerp, Belgium, where he trained briefly as a diamond-cutter. After the Nazi conquest of The Netherlands, the Schacter family sought visas to the United States, and travelled to Marseille, but found themselves on the wrong side of the border of Nazi-occupied France.

Schachter was interned in a detention camp under the Vichy French, where he met Menachem Mendel Shneersohn, later to become the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe. The Schacter family eventually escaped the Nazi advance by obtaining visas to the United States in 1941, via North Africa and the Caribbean. On arriving in New York, Schacter contacted the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, using his meeting with Menachem Mendel Schneersohn as a pretext. Schneersohn provided his family with employment and sent Schacter to Tomchei Temimim, the Chabad yeshiva. He was ordained as an Orthodox rabbi in 1947 within the Chabad Lubavitch community, and served Chabad congregations in Massachusetts and Connecticut.

==Career and work==

=== Chabad rabbi ===
In 1948, along with Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, Schachter was sent out to speak on college campuses by the now Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson as one of the first schluchim. In 1958, Schachter privately published what may have been the first English book on Jewish meditation. It was later reprinted in &quot;The Jewish Catalog&quot;, and was read by a generation of Jews as well as some Christian contemplatives. Schachter left the Lubavitcher movement after experimenting with &quot;the sacramental value of lysergic acid&quot; from 1962. With the subsequent rise of the hippie movement in the 1960s, and exposure to Christian mysticism, he moved away from the Chabad lifestyle.

=== Hillel director and ecumenical work ===

From 1956 to 1975, Reb Zalman was based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, though he travelled extensively. In Winnipeg, he worked as the Hillel director and head of Judaic Studies at the University of Manitoba. These positions allowed him to share his ideas and experiential techniques of spirituality with many Jewish and non-Jewish students, leaving lasting memories. While pursuing a course of study at Boston University (including a class taught by Howard Thurman), he experienced an intellectual and spiritual shift. In 1968, on sabbatical from the religion department of the University of Manitoba, he joined a group of other Jews in founding a havurah (small cooperative congregation) in Somerville, Massachusetts, called &quot;Havurat Shalom&quot;. In 1974, Schachter hosted a month-long Kabbalah workshop in Berkeley, California; his experimental style and the inclusion of mystical and cross-cultural ideas are credited as the inspiration for the formation of the havurah there that eventually became the Aquarian Minyan congregation. He eventually left the Lubavitch movement altogether and founded his own organization known as &quot;B&#x27;nai Or&quot;, meaning &quot;Sons of Light,&quot; a title he took from the Dead Sea Scrolls writings. During this period he was known to his followers as the &quot;B&#x27;nai Or Rebbe&quot;, and the rainbow prayer shawl he designed for his group was known as the &quot;B&#x27;nai Or tallit&quot;. Both the havurah experiment and B&#x27;nai Or came to be seen as the early stirrings of the Jewish Renewal movement. The congregation later changed its name to the more gender-neutral &quot;P&#x27;nai Or&quot; (meaning &quot;Faces of Light&quot;), and it continues under this name.

In the 1980s, Schachter added &quot;Shalomi&quot; (based on the Hebrew word &quot;shalom&quot;, or peace) to his name as a statement of his desire for peace in Israel and around the world.

=== Later years and death ===
Schachter-Shalomi was among the group of rabbis, from a wide range of Jewish denominations, who traveled together to India to meet with the Dalai Lama and discuss diaspora survival for Jews and Tibetan Buddhists with him. Tibetans, exiled from their homeland for more than three generations, face some of the same assimilation challenges experienced by Jewish diaspora. The Dalai Lama was interested in knowing how the Jews had survived with their culture intact. That journey was chronicled in Rodger Kamenetz&#x27; 1994 book &quot;The Jew in the Lotus&quot;.

In his later years, Schachter-Shalomi held the World Wisdom Chair at The Naropa Institute; he was Professor Emeritus at both Naropa and Temple University. He also served on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Omega, the NICABM, and other institutions. He was co-founder, with Rabbi Arthur Waskow, of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, bringing together P&#x27;nai Or and The Shalom Center. He was also the founder of the ALEPH Ordination Programs. The seminary he founded has ordained over 80 rabbis and cantors.

Zalman Schachter-Shalomi died of complications from pneumonia in 2014 at the age of 89. Schachter-Shalomi was married four times and was the father of 11 children.

== Themes and innovations ==
Schachter-Shalomi&#x27;s work reflects several recurring themes, including:

*&quot;Paradigm shifts&quot; within Judaism
* New approaches to halakha (Jewish law) including &quot;psycho-halakha&quot; (as of 2007, called &quot;integral halakha&quot;) and doctrines like eco-kashrut
*The importance of interfaith dialogue and &quot;deep ecumenism&quot; (meaningful connections between traditions)
* &quot;Four Worlds&quot; Judaism (integrating the Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and Spiritual realms)

He was committed to the Gaia hypothesis, to feminism, and to full inclusion of LGBT people within Judaism. His innovations in Jewish worship include chanting prayers in English while retaining the traditional Hebrew structures and melodies, engaging (worshipers) in theological dialogue, leading meditation during services and the introduction of spontaneous movement and dance. Many of these techniques have also found their way into the more mainstream Jewish community.

Schachter-Shalomi encouraged diversity among his students and urged them to bring their own talents, vision, views and social justice values to the study and practice of Judaism. Based on the Hasidic writings of Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbitz, he taught that anything, even what others consider sin and heresy, could be God&#x27;s will.

His major academic work, &quot;Spiritual Intimacy: A study of Counseling in Hasidism&quot;, was the result of his doctoral research into the system of spiritual direction cultivated within Chabad Hasidism. This led to his encouragement of students to study widely in the field of Spiritual Direction (one-on-one counseling) and to innovate contemporary systems to help renew a healthy spirituality in Jewish life. He also pioneered the practice of &quot;spiritual eldering&quot;, working with fellow seniors on coming to spiritual terms with aging and becoming mentors for younger adults.

=== Typology of Hasidic rebbes ===
Schachter-Shalomi theorized that the historical Hasidic Rebbes may be viewed as occupying one or several of the following roles or functions in relation to their support of their followers:
* &quot;The Rav&quot; – This role refers to Hasidic Rebbes who also served as ordained rabbis serving Jewish communities. Examples of this type cited by Schachter-Shalomi include Shmelke of Nikolsburg and Pinchas Horowitz. For some Hasidic Rebbes, such as Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, the term Rav was used instead of Rebbe.
* &quot;The Good Jew&quot; – This role, known in Yiddish as the &quot;Guter Yid&quot;, refers to a popular Hasidic Rebbe who is viewed as enjoying God&#x27;s favor and whose legacies spoke to the conditions of struggling Hasidim. This role was viewed as a continuation of the Talmudic legacy of individuals such as Honi HaMe&#x27;agel. Examples of Hasidic Rebbes of this type cited include Aryeh Leib of Shpola and Berishil of Krakow.
* &quot;The Seer&quot; – This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Chozeh&quot;, refers to a Hasidic Rebbe to whom prophetic powers were ascribed. Examples of this type cited include the Seer of Lublin and his student Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov.
* &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; – This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Ba&#x27;al Mofet&quot;, was often assumed by Hasidim to involve expertise in Practical Kabbalah. Examples cited include Ber of Radoshitz.
* &quot;The Healer&quot; – This role is understood as involving more than mere healing but also involved the expectation that the Hasid would alter his behavior to merit healing.
** &quot;The Gaon&quot; – A variant of the healer-type was the Talmudic genius (&quot;gaon&quot;) who could offer blessing through the merit of his Talmudic study. This tradition was not limited to Hasidism but also was applied to non-Hasidic rabbis such as Yechezkel Landau of Prague and the Gaon of Vilna.
* &quot;The Son or Grandson of the Tzaddik&quot; – This role applied to Hasidic Rebbes who would utilize ancestral merit of a Hasidic predecessor to invoke blessing. In Yiddish, the term &quot;eynikl&quot; (grandson) would sometimes be used. Often, this role involved the use of petitions at the gravesite of the Hasidic predecessor. Examples cited of this type include Boruch of Medzhybizh who was the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism.
* &quot;The Block Rebbe&quot; – This type is viewed to have developed in New York City from 1900 to 1940 and involved a grandfatherly role to local Jewish residents.
* &quot;The Kabbalist&quot; – This role, also known in Hebrew as the &quot;Ba&#x27;al M&#x27;kubal&quot;, involved expertise in the theoretical teachings of Jewish mysticism. Examples cited include Shneur Zalman of Lyady (the founder of Chabad Hasidism), Yisroel Hopstein (the Maggid of Kozhnitz), and Isaac of Komarno.
* &quot;The Spiritual Guide&quot; – This role, known in Hebrew as the &quot;Moreh Derekh&quot; (&quot;Teacher of the Path&quot;), reflects the Hasidic notion that Rebbe is the expert on matters of the Love and Fear of God. The Hasidic Rebbe Aharon Roth reportedly insisted on the use of this term. While Schachter-Shalomi notes that Hasidim valued the living guide over the use of books, some Rebbes, such as Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch, wrote various tracts for different types of spiritual seekers.
* &quot;The Tzaddik of the Generation&quot; – This role, known in Hebrew as &quot;Tzaddik HaDor&quot;, or &quot;Rashey Alafim&quot; (&quot;Head of Thousands&quot;), invokes the stature of Biblical leaders and is viewed mystically as the conduit of all blessing for the Jewish people of that generation.

==Honors==
Schachter-Shalomi was honored by the New York Open Center in 1997 for his &quot;Spiritual Renewal&quot;.

In 2012 his book &quot;Davening: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Prayer&quot; won the Contemporary Jewish Life and Practice Award (one of the National Jewish Book Awards).

He was also recognized as a &quot;shaikh&quot; in the Sufi Order of Pir Vilayat Khan in the United States and in the Holy Land.

In 2012, the Unitarian Universalist Starr King School for the Ministry awarded Schachter-Shalomi an honorary doctorate of theology, and he gave a popular series of lectures on the &quot;Emerging Cosmology&quot;.

<doc id="142879" wikidata="Q2495957" url="?curid=142879" title="Magpie">
<text>Magpies are birds of various species of the family Corvidae. Like other members of their family, they are widely considered to be intelligent creatures. The Eurasian magpie, for instance, is thought to rank among the world&#x27;s most intelligent creatures, and is one of the few nonmammalian species able to recognize itself in a mirror test. Magpies have shown the ability to make and use tools, imitate human speech, grieve, play games, and work in teams. They are particularly well known for their songs and were once popular as cagebirds. In addition to other members of the genus &quot;Pica&quot;, corvids considered magpies are in the genera &quot;Cissa&quot;, &quot;Urocissa&quot;, and &quot;Cyanopica&quot;.

Magpies of the genus &quot;Pica&quot; are generally found in temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and western North America, with populations also present in Tibet and high-elevation areas of Kashmir. Magpies of the genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot; are found in East Asia and the Iberian Peninsula. The birds called magpies in Australia are, however, not related to the magpies in the rest of the world.

==Name==
References dating back to Old English call the bird a &quot;pie&quot;, derived from the Latin &quot;pica&quot; and cognate to French &quot;pie&quot;; this term has fallen out of use. The tendency in previous centuries was to give birds common names, such as robin redbreast (which now is called the robin) and jenny wren. The magpie was originally variously maggie pie and mag pie. The term &quot;pica&quot; for the human disorder involving a compulsive desire to eat items that are not food is borrowed from the Latin name of the magpie, &quot;pica&quot;, for its reputed tendency to feed on miscellaneous things.

==Systematics and species==

According to some studies, magpies do not form the monophyletic group they are traditionally believed to be; tails have elongated (or shortened) independently in multiple lineages of corvid birds. Among the traditional magpies, two distinct lineages apparently exist. One consists of Holarctic species with black and white colouration, and is probably closely related to crows and Eurasian jays. The other contains several species from South to East Asia with vivid colouration, which is predominantly green or blue. The azure-winged magpie and the Iberian magpie, formerly thought to constitute a single species with a most peculiar distribution, have been shown to be two distinct species, and are classified as the genus &quot;Cyanopica&quot;.

Other research has cast doubt on the taxonomy of the &quot;Pica&quot; magpies, since &quot;P. hudsonia&quot; and &quot;P. nuttalli&quot; may not be different species, whereas the Korean race of &quot;P. pica&quot; is genetically very distinct from the other Eurasian (as well as the North American) forms. Either the North American, Korean, and remaining Eurasian forms are accepted as three or four separate species, or else only a single species, &quot;Pica pica&quot;, exists.

** Black-rumped magpie. &quot;Pica bottanensis&quot; (may be conspecific with &quot;P. pica&quot;)

==Other &quot;magpies&quot;==
*The black magpies, &quot;Platysmurus&quot;, are treepies; they are neither magpies, nor as was long believed, jays. Treepies are a distinct group of corvids externally similar to magpies.
*The Australian magpie, &quot;Cracticus tibicen&quot;, is conspicuously &quot;pied&quot;, with black and white plumage reminiscent of a Eurasian magpie. It is a member of the family Artamidae and not a corvid.
*The magpie-robins, members of the genus &quot;Copsychus&quot;, have a similar &quot;pied&quot; appearance, but they are Old World flycatchers, unrelated to the corvids.

=== Cultural references ===
==== East Asia ====

In East Asian cultures, the magpie is a very popular bird and is a symbol of good luck and fortune.

The magpie is a common subject in Chinese paintings. It is also often found in traditional Chinese poetry and couplets. In addition, in Chinese folklore, all the magpies of the Qixi Festival every year will fly to the Milky Way and form a bridge, where the separated Cowherd and Weaver Girl will meet. The Milky Way is like a river, and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl refer to the famous α-Aquilae and α-Lyrae of modern Astronomy, respectively. For this reason, the magpie bridge has come to symbolize a relationship between men and women.

Magpies have an important place in the birth myth of Ai Xinjue Luo Bukuri Yushun, the ancestor of the Qing dynasty.

The magpie is a national bird of Korea and a symbol of its capital Seoul.

==== Europe ====

In European culture, the magpie is reputed to collect shiny objects such as wedding rings and other valuables, a well known example being Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Gazza Ladra&quot; (&quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;). A recent study conducted by Exeter University found that Eurasian magpies express neophobia when presented with unfamiliar objects, and were less likely to approach or interact with the shiny objects - metal screws, foil rings and aluminium foil - used in the experiments. However, magpies are naturally curious like other members of the corvid family, and may collect shiny objects, but do not favour shiny objects over dull ones.

=== As pests ===
Magpies are common orchard pests in some regions of the world.

==In legend==
*Magpies are the National bird of Bangladesh.
*In England, magpies were traditionally viewed as omens either of fortune or misfortune, depending upon the number of birds one saw. An English nursery rhyme known as &quot;One for Sorrow&quot; recounts the tradition:
John Brand was an English antiquarian and Church of England clergyman, who was appointed Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, in 1784. His book, &quot;Observations of Popular Antiquities&quot;, (1780), has the first-known record of counting Magpies to predict good or ill-fortune, in the description, and records only four lines:

&quot;One for sorrow,
Two for mirth,
Three for a funeral,
And four for a birth&quot;.
&quot;Popular antiquities&quot; later became known as folklore, (a term coined by William John Thoms in 1846).

In that year, the rhyme was added to &quot;Proverbs and Popular Sayings of the Seasons&quot;, by Michael Aislabie Denham, an English merchant and collector of folklore. The following lines were added:-

&quot;Five for heaven,
Six for hell,
Seven for the devil, his own self&quot;.
Sir Humphry Davy attributed the connection for the feeling of one, then two magpies to joy and sorrow in his, &quot;Salmonia : or Days of Fly Fishing&quot;, (1828); he wrote:
&quot;For anglers in spring it is always unlucky to see &quot;single&quot; magpies, but &quot;two&quot; may be always regarded as a favourable omen; and the reason is, that in cold and stormy weather one magpie alone leaves the nest in search of food, the other remaining sitting upon the eggs or the young ones; but when two go out together, it is only when the weather is warm and mild, and thus favourable for fishing.&quot;

* In sports, some teams that wear black and white striped kits are nicknamed the magpies, such as Newcastle United and Notts County from England.

<text>The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) is an American tobacco manufacturing company based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Founded by namesake R. J. Reynolds in 1875, it is the largest tobacco company in the United States. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco.

RJR has a large brand portfolio, which includes Camel, Newport, Doral, Eclipse, Kent, and Pall Mall. Other brands commercialized in the past included Barclay, Belair, and Real.

==History==

===Early history===
The son of a tobacco farmer in Virginia, Richard Joshua &quot;R. J.&quot; Reynolds sold his shares of his father&#x27;s company in Patrick County, Virginia, and ventured to the nearest town with a railroad connection, Winston-Salem, to start his own tobacco company. He bought his first factory building from the Moravian Church and established the &quot;little red factory&quot; with seasonal workers. The first year, he produced of tobacco; by the 1890s, production had increased to several million pounds per year. The company&#x27;s factory buildings were the largest buildings in Winston-Salem, with new technologies such as steam power and electric lights. The second primary factory building was the oldest Reynolds factory still standing and was sold to Forsyth County in 1990.
At the beginning of the 1900s, Reynolds bought most of the competing tobacco factories in Winston-Salem. The company produced 25% of America&#x27;s chewing tobacco. 1907&#x27;s Prince Albert smoking tobacco became the company&#x27;s national showcase product, which led to high-profile advertising in New York City&#x27;s Union Square. The Camel cigarette became the most popular cigarette in the country. The Reynolds company imported so much French cigarette paper and Turkish tobacco for Camel cigarettes that Winston-Salem was designated by the United States federal government as an official port of entry for the United States, despite the city being inland. Winston-Salem was the eighth-largest port of entry in the United States by 1916.

In 1917, the company bought 84 acres (34 ha) of property in Winston-Salem and built 180 houses that it sold at cost to workers, to form a development called &quot;Reynoldstown&quot;.

At the time Reynolds died in 1918 (of pancreatic cancer), his company owned 121 buildings in Winston-Salem. He was so integral to company operations that executives did not hang another chief executive&#x27;s portrait next to Reynolds&#x27;s in the company board room until 41 years later. Reynolds&#x27;s brother William Neal Reynolds took over following Reynolds&#x27;s death, and six years later Bowman Gray became the chief executive. By that time, Reynolds Co. was the top taxpayer in the state of North Carolina, paying $1 out of every $2.50 paid in income taxes in the state, and was one of the most profitable corporations in the world. It made two-thirds of the cigarettes in the state.
Reynolds Co.&#x27;s success during this period can also be measured by the concurrent success of many Winston-Salem companies that received large amounts of business from Reynolds: Wachovia National Bank became one of the largest banks in the Southeast, and the company&#x27;s law firm Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice became the largest law firm in North Carolina.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco diversified into other areas, buying Pacific Hawaiian Products, the makers of Hawaiian Punch, in 1962, Sea-Land Service in 1969, and Del Monte Foods in 1979. Sea-Land was spun off in 1984.

Because of the company&#x27;s diversification, the company changed its name to R. J. Reynolds Industries, Inc. in 1970. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. was a subsidiary.

===RJR Nabisco===

R. J. Reynolds Industries merged with Nabisco Brands in 1985, and the name changed to RJR Nabisco in August 1986. In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms to acquire RJR Nabisco. Finally, the private equity takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts &amp; Co (commonly referred to as KKR) was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. This was documented in several articles in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. These articles were later used as the basis of a bestselling book, &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, and then into a television movie. As a result, in February 1989, RJR Nabisco paid executive F. Ross Johnson US$53,800,000 as part of a golden handshake clause, the largest such deal in history at the time, as severance compensation for his acceptance of the KKR takeover. He used the money to open his own investment firm, RJM Group, Inc. In 1999 RJR Nabisco spun off R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, which began trading on June 15 as R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., and a year later announced it would buy Nabisco Group Holdings Inc., the company that had been RJR Nabisco. This followed the sale of Nabisco Holdings Group to Philip Morris.

===Recent history===
In 1994, then CEO James Johnston testified under oath before Congress, saying that he didn&#x27;t believe that nicotine is addictive.
In 1998, the company was part of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement with 46 U.S. states, agreeing to pay smoking-related health care costs and restrict advertising in return for protection against private lawsuits.

In 1999, R. J. Reynolds was spun out of RJR Nabisco. The same year, the company sold all its non-U.S. operations to Japan Tobacco, which made those operations into its international arm, JT International. Consequently, any Camels, Winstons or Salems sold outside the United States are now actually Japanese cigarettes.

In 2002, the company was fined $15 million for handing out free cigarettes at events attended by children, and was fined $20 million for breaking the 1998 Master Agreement, which restricted targeting youth in its tobacco advertisements.

In 2001–2011, the European Union was involved in three civil suits against R. J. Reynolds in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, accusing the company of selling black market cigarettes to drug traffickers and mobsters from Italy, Russia, Colombia and the Balkans. The suits were unsuccessful.

On July 30, 2004, R. J. Reynolds merged with the U.S. operations of British American Tobacco (operating under the name of Brown &amp; Williamson). A new parent holding company, Reynolds American Inc., was established as part of the transaction.
In May 2006 former R. J. Reynolds vice-president of sales Stan Smith pleaded guilty to charges of defrauding the Government of Canada of $1.2 billion (CDN) through a cigarette smuggling operation. Smith confessed to overseeing the 1990s operation while employed by RJR. Canadian-brand cigarettes were smuggled out of and back into Canada, or smuggled from Puerto Rico, and sold on the black market to avoid taxes. The judge referred to it as biggest fraud case in Canadian history.

Since 2006, R. J. Reynolds has been the subject of a Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) campaign to reduce the exploitative nature of its tobacco procurement system. FLOC&#x27;s goal is to meet with Reynolds executives, growers, and workers in collective bargaining to improve farmworkers&#x27; pay and living conditions. Although there are many layers of subcontractors within the procurement system that seemingly absolve Reynolds of responsibility, FLOC asserts that its executives have the ability to make changes within the system due to their wealth and enormous power. Despite repeated refusals to meet from CEO Susan Ivey, FLOC continues the campaign against R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

In 2010, Reynolds American announced that the company would close its manufacturing plants in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. Production from these plants will be moved to the Tobaccoville, North Carolina, plant.

On July 15, 2014, Reynolds American agreed to buy Lorillard Tobacco Company for $27.4 billion. The deal also included the sale of the Kool, Winston, Salem, and blu brands to Imperial Tobacco for $7.1 billion.

In January 2017, Reynolds American agreed to a $49.4 billion deal to be taken over by British American Tobacco. The deal was completed July 25, 2017.

==Marketing, sponsorships and criticisms==
From 1972, R. J. Reynolds was a title sponsor of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series, the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and until , the IMSA Camel GT for sportscars.

The NHRA sponsorship lasted up to 2001, before a new governing rule called the Master Settlement Agreement, which restricted R. J. Reynolds to one sponsorship of a sporting event; the company sponsored NASCAR up to 2003.

The Lotus Formula One team was sponsored by Camel from 1987 until 1990.

RJR brand Winston was a sponsor of the 1982 FIFA World Cup whilst fellow RJR brand Camel was a sponsor of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

In late 2005, R. J. Reynolds opened the Marshall McGearty Lounge in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago as part of a marketing strategy to promote a brand of &quot;superpremium&quot; cigarettes and counteract local smoking bans in restaurants and cafes that took effect in 2006. The lounge, which offered thirteen varieties of exclusive &quot;hand-crafted&quot; cigarette, along with alcohol and &quot;light food&quot;, had been &quot;well received&quot; in the neighborhood and by the targeted upscale market, according to company officials. The lounge has since been closed due to Illinois indoor smoking restrictions. The company planned to open a second location in Winston-Salem in the summer of 2007, but abandoned those plans within weeks of opening, citing the increasing number of smoking restrictions in public places by state and local governments.

===Joe Camel===

In 1987, RJR resurrected the mascot for their Camel brand of cigarette, Joe Camel. Joe Camel, an anthropomorphic cartoon camel wearing sunglasses, was claimed to be a ploy to entice and interest the underaged in smoking. R. J. Reynolds maintained that Joe&#x27;s &quot;smooth character&quot; was meant only to appeal to adult smokers.

This criticism was reinforced by a 1991 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that more children five and six years old could recognize Joe Camel than could recognize Mickey Mouse or Fred Flintstone (coincidentally, Fred Flintstone was also once used to sell R. J. Reynolds&#x27;s Winston cigarettes) and alleged that the Joe Camel advertisement campaign was targeting children, despite R. J. Reynolds&#x27;s contention that the campaign had been researched only among adults and was directed only at the smokers of other brands. In response to this criticism, RJR instituted &quot;Let&#x27;s Clear the Air on Smoking&quot;, a campaign of full-page advertisements consisting entirely of large type text, which denied the charges and declared that smoking is &quot;an adult custom&quot;.

== Early knowledge of the harms of cigarettes ==
By 1953, R. J. Reynolds held an internal belief that cigarettes caused cancer. On February 2 of that year, R. J. Reynolds research chemist and executive Claude Teague released &#x27;Survey of Cancer Research&#x27;, a confidential internal document for R. J. Reynolds upper management. He concluded that clinical data was confirming the fact that tobacco was &quot;an important etiologic factor in the induction of primary cancer of the lung&quot;. He also wrote that many findings of animal studies &quot;would seem to indicate the presence of carcinogens&quot;.

==Lawsuits==
In May 2011, a Miami-Dade Circuit jury awarded Julie Reese, an 82-year-old Cape Coral smoker represented by The Ferraro Law Firm, a total verdict of $1 million from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, after she developed laryngeal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The jury found Reynolds to be negligent, guilty of fraud by concealment and fraud conspiracy, and guilty of placing a defective product on the market.

On February 25, 2020, Chief Judge Rodney Gilstrap of the United States District for the Eastern District of Texas determined that Reynolds remained liable for its full portion of an annual $8 billion settlement payment based on a settlement agreement that Reynolds reached with the State of Texas in 1998. Reynolds had previously claimed that its divestiture of several brands to Imperial Tobacco Group Brands, LLC had extinguished its obligation to make payments for those brands under the 1998 Settlement Agreement. Chief Judge Gilstrap disagreed in a 92-page memorandum opinion and order, finding that Reynolds&#x27;s position was &quot;oppressive, inequitable, and unreasonable&quot; in addition to being contrary to governing law.

==Brands==
R. J. Reynolds brands include Newport, Camel, Doral, Eclipse, Kent and Pall Mall. Brands still manufactured but no longer receiving significant marketing support include Capri, Carlton, GPC, Lucky Strike, Misty, Monarch, More, Now, Old Gold, Tareyton, Vantage, and Viceroy. Discontinued brands include Barclay, Belair, and Real. The company also manufactures certain private-label brands. Five of the company&#x27;s brands are among the top ten best selling cigarette brands in the United States, and it is estimated that one in three cigarettes sold in the country were manufactured by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In 2010 R. J. Reynolds acquired the rights to the smokeless tobacco products Kodiak and Grizzly dip.

===Uptown===
In 1990, R. J. Reynolds planned to launch a new cigarette brand called Uptown, aimed primarily at African-Americans. To appeal to black Americans seeking a less pronounced menthol taste (similar to Lorillard&#x27;s Newport, which was gaining share), Reynolds decided against using green on the packaging, and instead used black and gold, the colors of luxury European cigarettes.

Narrowing the marketing further, Uptown cigarettes were to be packed with filters facing down, the reverse of the usual arrangement. Market research indicated that many African-American smokers open packs from the bottom, possibly to avoid crushing the filters. It was later discovered that cigarette packs were opened from the bottom for a different reason: &quot;This phenomenon traces back at least to World War II, when cigarettes were a valued commodity among soldiers. Often a soldier temporarily without cigarettes and without funds would &quot;bum&quot; a smoke from a fellow soldier. It was impolite to refuse such a request. However, there were two occasions when a refusal was not considered impolite: if there was only one cigarette left in the pack and if the pack was not yet opened. A pack opened from the bottom and resting, as it normally did, in a shirt pocket would appear unopened. Therefore, the soldier in possession of cigarettes would be able to avoid having to give too many away.&quot;

The promotional blitz was scheduled to begin on February 5, 1990, and Philadelphia was selected as the test market because of its large black population. Before it began, the campaign came under fire from religious, health and black-interest groups who expressed concerns about promoting cigarette smoking to African-Americans.

On January 19, 1990, Reynolds abruptly decided to cancel the cigarette, saying that the test marketing would no longer be reliable because of what it called, &quot;the unfair and biased attention that brand has received&quot;.

==Facilities==
===Downtown===
R. J. Reynolds built the &quot;Little Red Factory&quot; in 1892. It was uncertain whether it was torn down or made a part of Building 256-1, one of several red brick buildings on Chestnut Street built between 1911 and 1925. Much of the Building 256 complex burned in one of the city&#x27;s worst fires ever on August 27, 1998, when the former factories were being renovated for Piedmont Triad Research Park. Albert Hall, or Building 256-9, was made of concrete and did not burn but had smoke damage; it was used for training until 1990 and was being renovated in 1998.

In 1916, the first of five buildings known as Plant 64 between Fourth and Fifth Streets was built. The 400,000-square-foot Plant 64 was the oldest remaining Reynolds plant when it was renovated at a cost of $55 million into 242 apartments, with the first residents moving in on July 1, 2014.

The last building used for making cigarettes downtown was Building No. 12 across Second Street from the Building 256 complex, which Forsyth County bought when manufacturing ended there in 1990; finished in 1916, it was to be renovated for county offices after an announcement in 1999. Building 60 was built in 1923 and later renovated. Three buildings which were part of the &quot;90 series&quot; on Vine Street were later renovated; the one at 525 Vine was built in 1926, while Buildings 90-3 and 90-1A at 635 Vine, used for tobacco processing, were built in the early 1960s. Building 91, a machine shop built in 1937, was later renovated and became part of the research park. Bailey Power Plant, a coal-fired plant built in 1947, included Buildings 23-1, 23-2 and the Morris Building, and was used until 1997 and later became part of the research park.

The company&#x27;s headquarters were located in the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem for more than 50 years. Built in 1929, the 21-story building was designed by the same architects (Shreve &amp; Lamb) who later designed the Empire State Building in New York City.

===Reynolds Boulevard===
The first R. J. Reynolds buildings on present-day Reynolds Boulevard (formerly 33rd Street) were the three-story leaf buildings, the 2-1 building built in 1937 and the 2-2 building in 1955. These were named to the National Register of Historic Places in October 2017, and in October 2019 C.A. Harrison Cos. LLC, developer of Plant 64, announced the buildings would be renovated for loft apartments.

Built in 1961 at a cost of $32 million ($271 million in 2023 dollars), the Whitaker Park plant had 790,300 square feet of manufacturing space and was considered &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most modern cigarette-manufacturing plant&quot;. It was announced in May 2010 that cigarette manufacturing would cease at Whitaker Park; by mid-2011, this had been done. Manufacturing formerly performed at the Whitaker Park plant was consolidated in the more-modern Tobaccoville plant. On January 7, 2015, Reynolds announced that Whitaker Park was being donated to Whitaker Park Development Authority Inc., started in April 2011 by Winston-Salem Business Inc., the Winston-Salem Alliance and Wake Forest University. The 120-acre site and 13 buildings were officially transferred in 2017. In 2019 Cook Medical announced it would buy the 850,000-square-foot 601-1 building with plans to move its 650 employees there by 2022. As of October 2019, Hanesbrands had taken over space in the 426,800-square-foot 601-11 building as a distribution center, and Nature&#x27;s Value bought that building in August 2021.

On August 23, 2023, Cook Medical, which paid $4 million for its space in Whitaker Park in 2021, announced it would sell because the remote work trend meant it no longer needed the space. Purple Crow chief executive and president Dan Calhoun confirmed his company had a contract to buy the property. Purple Crow, which had already asked for incentives from the city, pledged in its incentive request to spend $50 million and create 274 jobs, nearly doubling its area work force.

18 buildings and 100 acres in the area continue to be used for tobacco processing and warehousing.

===Headquarters buildings===
In September 1977, R. J. Reynolds Industries moved the first of 1200 headquarters employees into the not-yet-completed, $40 million, 519,000-square-foot glass and steel World Headquarters Building being built across Reynolds Boulevard from the Whitaker Park plant. At the same time, the company had plans for a new skyscraper downtown.

The current headquarters, the RJR Plaza Building, is 16 stories tall and was completed in 1982 adjacent to the original 1929 Reynolds Building. The tobacco company moved its headquarters to RJR Plaza in 1982, and the 1929 building continued to be used for some company offices until 2009; the older building stood vacant until new owners in 2014 began the process to convert it to a hotel.

With the parent company (renamed RJR Nabisco in 1985 after merging with Nabisco) planning to move its headquarters to Atlanta in September 1987, the company donated the World Headquarters Building to Wake Forest University in January 1987, and in July of that year, the company voted to move its Planters-Life Savers division to one-third of that building. In May 1999, BB&amp;T bought what was then called the First Union Building for $2.5 million from Aon Consulting Inc., which moved about 400 employees to the former headquarters building which was called University Corporate Center. In 2010, the building&#x27;s tenants were Aon, BB&amp;T, and PepsiCo. On November 1 of that year, Pepsi announced 195 new jobs and a $7.5 million expansion of University Corporate Center, with BB&amp;T moving two of its operations to Reynolds Business Center. Aon and Pepsi remained the primary occupants in 2015.

===Other facilities===
The Ziglar Sheds, Buildings 82 and 83 on East 25th Street in Winston-Salem, were built in the 1920s, the first warehouses built for tobacco storage according to company specifications, and sold in 1992. In 2024 they were being considered for the National Register of Historic Places.

R. J. Reynolds&#x27;s largest plant, Tobaccoville, a 2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) facility constructed in 1986, is located in the town of Tobaccoville, North Carolina near Winston-Salem.

Macon manufacturing, located in Macon, Georgia, resides in a 1.4-million-square-foot (130,000 m2) facility built in 1974. This manufacturing plant was formerly known as Brown &amp; Williamson, which was purchased by Reynolds and eventually closed in 2006.

R. J. Reynolds has a tobacco-sheet manufacturing operation in Winston-Salem. The sheet manufacturing operation in Chester, Virginia, was closed in 2006. Also, there are leaf operations in Wilson, North Carolina; tobacco-storage facilities in Blacksburg, South Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia; and a significant research-and-development facility in Winston-Salem.

A manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico was closed in 2010. Among these facilities, R. J. Reynolds employs approximately 6,800 people.

R. J. Reynolds&#x27;s subsidiary, &quot;R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Foreign Sales Corporation&quot;, is established in the British Virgin Islands to minimize its tax liability.

<doc id="142884" wikidata="Q834462" url="?curid=142884" title="Nichiren Shōshū">
<text>is a branch of Nichiren Buddhism based on the traditionalist teachings of the 13th century Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222–1282), claiming him as its founder through his senior disciple Nikko Shonin (1246–1333), the founder of Head Temple Taiseki-ji, near Mount Fuji. The lay adherents of the sect are called Hokkeko members. The Enichizan Myohoji Temple in Los Angeles, California serves as the temple headquarters within the United States.

The sect is known for vehemently rejecting the various forms of Buddhism taught by Shakyamuni Buddha as incomplete, expired and heretical for the Third Age of Buddhism. Instead, the sect is based on the exclusivist teachings of Nichiren and the chanting of &quot;Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot; along with reciting curated portions of the Lotus Sutra.

The object worshipped by its believers is the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; while its religious symbol is the rounded crane bird. Both its leadership and adherents claim that only their practice is &quot;The True Buddhism&quot; and ascribe the honorific title to Nichiren, as the &quot;Sacred Original &quot;True&quot; Buddha&quot; (御本仏, &quot;Go-Honbutsu&quot;) and the &quot;Dai-Shonin&quot; (大聖人, &quot;Great Holy Teacher&quot;) while maintaining that the sole legitimate successor to both his ministry and legacy is Nikko Shonin and the successive high priests of the sect, led by the current 68th High Priest, Hayase Myo-e Ajari Nichinyo Shonin, who ascended to the position on 15 December 2005.

==Historical name==

Following the death of Nichiren, centuries of doctrinal divisions arose among various schools of Nichiren&#x27;s followers. During the Meiji Restoration, numerous Nichiren sects were consolidated by the imperial government into several major schools: Nichiren Shu in 1874, Fuju-fuse and Fuju-fuse Komon in 1876, and in 1891 the five interrelated schools of Kempon Hokkeshu, Honmon Hokkeshu, Honmyo Hokkeshu, Hokkeshu, and Honmonshu.

In 1900, the Taiseki-ji temple split away from Honmonshu and renamed itself Nichirenshu Fuji-ha, or the &quot;Nichiren Shu (School) of the Fuji area, the branch of Taisekiji Temple&quot;, indicating the general naming of sects at the time. In 1913, the sect&#x27;s name was changed to its current “Nichiren Shoshu.” This changed was purportedly made by Emperor Taisho in reference to the sect&#x27;s orthodox claims. The sect is also sometimes called &quot;Nichiren Masamune&quot;, based on the local Japanese dialect in Shizuoka.

==Overview==

Its head temple Taiseki-ji is located on the lower slopes of Mount Fuji in Japan. Taiseki-ji is visited regularly by Nichiren Shōshū believers from around the world who come to chant to the Dai Gohonzon, which they claim to physically embody the spirit of Nichiren in both wooden form and sumi ink.

Unlike other Mahayana Buddhist practices, Nichiren championed the Lotus Sutra as the only valid Buddhist practice and chanting &quot;Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot; as the only valid path for anyone to obtain Buddhahood regardless of one&#x27;s position in life, condition of circumstances, gender and occupational role as well as not necessarily waiting to be reborn into another future life existence.

Nichiren Shōshū claims to operate over 700 temples and temple-like facilities (lay propagation centers) in Japan, as well as 24 temples outside Japan, and a membership of over 800,000 global adherents.

Nichiren Shōshū claims a direct lineage (&quot;yuiju ichinin kechimyaku sojo&quot;) of successive High Priests from Nikko Shonin, who they believe was originally chosen by Nichiren to carry on the propagation of his Buddhist practice in the Three Ages of Buddhism, a claim that other Nichiren Buddhist sects assert as well, such as Nichiren-shū but rejected by others. Nichiren Shōshū claims this lineage is accorded to them through the following documents (copies existing, the original documents were stored in a treasure box at Omosu Honmon-ji, but were stolen during a raid by the soldiers of Takeda Katsuyori in 1581) :
# “Document Entrusting the Dharma that Nichiren propagated throughout his Life” (日蓮–期弘法付属書, &quot;Nichiren ichigo guho fuzokusho&quot;)
# “Document Entrusting Minobu-san” (身延相承書, &quot;Minobu-san fuzokusho&quot;)
# The “One Hundred and Six Articles&quot; (百六箇抄, &quot;Hyaku rokka-sho&quot;)

The current leader of the sect is the 68th High Priest, Nichinyo Shōnin (1935–). Nichiren Shōshū priests distinguish themselves from those of most other schools by wearing only white and grey vestment robes and a white surplice, as they believe Nichiren did.

By the imperial Daijō-kan Decree #133 of the Emperor Meiji since 1872, Nichiren Shōshū priests, like other Japanese Buddhist sects as well as other former traditionalist &quot;celibate&quot; lifestyles such as artisans and Geisha et cetera, have been permitted to marry.

Accordingly, the sect does not impose any regulations of Buddhist morality on gender or marital relationships, poverty or wealthy lifestyles, ranging from personal habits or vices, divorce, abortion, sartorial or dietary choices including the consumption of vegetables versus meat, dairy or alcohol, et cetera.

The sect also vehemently rejects monetary and material donations from non-members who are not registered or affiliated with a local branch temple, citing claims of &quot;karmic impurity&quot; from non-believers and those who belong to other religions. This position of not accepting alms from non-believers is taught by Nichiren in his &quot;Letter to Ni&#x27;ike&quot; (&quot;Ni&#x27;ike gosho&quot;), and by Nikko Shonin in his &quot;Twenty-six Admonitions&quot; (&quot;Nikko yuikai okimon&quot;). Accordingly, the offertory fee to register as a new member is strongly forbidden to be paid for by a fellow Hokkeko believer, except under rare circumstances of extreme poverty or dire homelessness.

The sect categorizes three forms of donations for its registered believers:
# The pro-active sharing of its religious practice to non-believers through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and Shakubuku.
# The offertory of food and monetary donations to sustain the local temple and its priests. 
# The ancient Asian practice of gaining Buddhist merit (Japanese: 廻向, Eko) by providing free labor services (cleaning, volunteer work) for the temple.

The lay member organization of the sect, &quot;Hokkeko–Rengo–Kai&quot; is headquartered at the Grand Hodo-in Temple in Toshima, Tokyo.

==Hokkeko==

Lay believers belong to official congregations known as Hokkekō groups, designed to encourage solidarity among fellow members to study Nichiren Shoshu doctrines and plan one&#x27;s &quot;Tozan&quot; pilgrimage to the head temple in Japan. Most attend services at a local temple or in private homes when no temple is nearby. Services are usually officiated by a priest, but lay leaders sometimes fill in when no priest is available. When they gather, believers frequently study Nichiren Shōshū teachings, particularly the various writings of Nichiren, called &quot;Gosho&quot;. A leader in a local group or district is called &quot;Koto&quot; while a widely held position on a grander scale was once called &quot;So-Koto&quot;, but is now no longer used. The present &quot;Dai-Koto&quot; leader of the Hokkeko Federation is Mr. Koichiro Hoshino.

The official symbol of Nichiren Shōshū is the crane bird (&quot;Tsuru&quot;) in a rounded shape &quot;(Tsuru-no-Maru).&quot; Another symbol is the eight-spoked wheel of the Noble Eightfold Path called &quot;Rimbo&quot; (&quot;Treasure Ring&quot;) as well as the tortoise crest for Nikko Shonin, who is considered by the school to be the sole and legitimate successor to Nichiren. The Three Friends of Winter combination crest is also present in temple altars, representing Nichimoku Shonin.

==Religious doctrines==
Nichiren Shōshū doctrine extends the Tiantai classification of the Buddhist sutras into the following:
# Five periods of time + eight categories (五時八教, &quot;Goji-hakkyō&quot;)
# The theory of 3,000 interpenetrating realms within a single life-moment (一念三千, &quot;Ichinen Sanzen&quot;)
# Its world view of the &quot;Three Truths&quot; (三諦, &quot;San Tai&quot;).

===The doctrine of &quot;Buddhist Slander&quot;===
The sect seeks to eradicate all other religions and vehemently rejects all forms of religious interfaith practices as both evil and heretical, referring to any syncretism as &quot;Slander&quot; (謗 法, Ho–bo) against the Dharma taught by the founder Nichiren. It further maintains that directly supporting other religions outside the sect gains negative karma and brings grave punishment, disasters and generational suffering.

===The Laws of Karma and Rebirth===
The sect teaches that human children choose to be reborn to their parents based on the parents&#x27; accumulated karma of causes and conditions that existed from past and present lives. Accordingly, the sect further teaches that other life forms also generate their own karma based on cause and effect that does not recognize both space and time. These willed rebirths include humans, animals and other life forms (and vice versa) that choose to be reborn in whatever capacity to advance the Buddhist enlightenment of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo in the universe.

===Expired teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha===
The sect claims that Shakyamuni&#x27;s myriad forms of Buddhism have now lost their salvific power to gain Buddhahood for the modern age, designated at the Third Age of Buddhism since the year 1052 to the present. In addition, the school claims that Nichiren was fulfilling an eschatological prophecy made by Shakyamuni Buddha in Chapter 21 of the Lotus Sutra regarding the Three Ages of Buddhism which states:

===Interpretation of the Three Buddhist Jewels===
# Buddha – Nichiren Shōshū teaches that Nichiren is the “&quot;True Original Buddha&quot;” for the modern times corresponding to the Third Buddhist Age and for all eternity.
# Dharma – The Dharma is referred to by the sect as &quot;The Mystic Law&quot;, referring to the ultimate teachings of Nichiren, crystallized in &quot;Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot;. The sect further teaches that this Mystic Law is the internal enlightenment of Nichiren himself called &quot;Naisho&quot; (内 証) and is the &quot;Original True Buddha&quot; from an infinite, mystical timeless point in the Universe (久遠元初, &quot;Kuon–Ganjo&quot;). Furthermore, the sect teaches that this enlightenment is physically embodied within the Dai-Gohonzon wooden mandala and was left for the posterity of future generations. The same definition of Dharma is accorded to its authorized, transcribed copies called &quot;Gohonzon&quot; that are loaned by the sect to its followers.
# Sangha – The Sangha refers to one of Nichiren&#x27;s senior disciples, Nikko Shonin, its lineage of succeeding High Priests, along with the entire collective of Nichiren Shōshū priests who serve to teach, protect and preserve the doctrines and dogmas of Nichiren Shōshū.

Accordingly, the sect teaches that the Three Jewels of Buddhism are a single, inseparable entity that equally share the internal enlightenment of Nichiren. More specifically, the sect teaches that the Buddha and the Dharma are perpetrated and upheld by the Sangha priesthood (Heisei Shinpen). The common parlance used in the sect among believers to describe the three Buddhist treasures is termed &quot;Buddha–Law–Priesthood&quot;.
===The &quot;Three Great Secret Laws&quot;===
According to the doctrinal beliefs of Nichiren Shoshu, Nichiren instituted the mastery of three spiritual disciplines:

# Precepts – upholding the Buddhist vows (&quot;Jukai&quot;) of daily Buddhist practice
# Meditation – purifying the mind through chanting &quot;Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot; (&quot;Shodai&quot;)
# Wisdom – upholding the teachings of religion through the office of the Head Temple (&quot;Kaidan&quot;)

Nichiren Shoshu teaches that Nichiren revealed the Three Great Secret Laws which matches the three above:

# The &quot;Dai-Gohonzon&quot; – as the Supreme Object of Worship, sourcing to the vow of Precepts.
# The &quot;Daimoku&quot; – of &quot;Nam Myoho Renge Kyo&quot; as the Supreme Invocation, sourcing to its meditational practice.
# The &quot;Dai-Sekiji no Honmon Kaidan&quot; (&quot;Tai-sekiji&quot;) – as the Platform of the High Sanctuary of Essential Teaching, sourcing to its authoritative office of Wisdom.

===On the Lotus Sutra===
The Lotus Sutra is the core basis of the teachings of the sect, and divides the book into two parts:
* &quot;Theoretical Teachings&quot; ( &quot;Gate of Tracing&quot;, Jp: 迹 門 Shaku–mon) – Chapters 1–14
* &quot;Essential Teachings&quot; ( &quot;Gate of Origin&quot;, Jp: 本 門 Hon–mon) – Chapters 15–28

The sect teaches that a significant difference between the two lies with the standpoint of who is preaching them. The Theoretical Teachings (Chapters 1–14) are preached by Shakyamuni Buddha who reached Buddhahood in Bodhgaya, India. On the other hand, Shakyamuni declares in the Essential Teachings (Chapters 15–28) that his enlightenment in India was only temporary, and that he in fact already attained Buddhahood in a mysterious, timeless point in the Universe.

As result of these interpretations of the Tendai school and Nichiren schools of thought, all the provisional Buddhas, such as Amida Nyorai, Dainichi Nyorai, and Yakushi Nyorai, were integrated into one single original Buddha.

Another doctrine taught by the sect is that Chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra does not reveal the cause or &quot;seed&quot; of enlightenment gained by Shakyamuni Buddha. Rather, this secret was revealed in Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra by Ākāśagarbha (&quot;Heavenly Jewel&quot;) Bodhisattva to Nichiren and his latter claim to the expressed public recitation of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo through an alleged deeper understanding of the text.

Furthermore, the sect teaches that:
* The recitation of Chapter 2 is a self–declaration to reject and abolish the various religions and forms of Buddhism taught by Shakyamuni Buddha.
* The recitation of Chapter 16 (through a metaphysical reading) crystallizes this Buddhist secret (also called &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot;) which gains a person the state of Buddhahood. The sect teaches that this hidden mystical secret is the practice of &quot;Jigyo–Keta&quot; (自 行 化 他) or the widespread propagation of the practice to non-believers.

===The meaning of &quot;Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot;===

The sect teaches that &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; is the quintessential core practice of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings, is weighted on heavily with great significance in the &quot;Ongi Kuden&quot;. &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; is explained in the &quot;Ongi Kuden&quot; as follows:
==Ceremonies==

Several ceremonies are conducted within Nichiren Shoshu, some as memorials for lauded figures, others in commemoration or celebration of momentous events, as well as life-cycle event ceremonies for individuals including conversion to Buddhism, marriages and funerals. Visitors who enter the temple may consider becoming a member by accepting the &quot;Gojukai&quot; ceremony which the lay believer accepts the precepts of Nichiren Shōshū and vow to defend and venerate the Dai-Gohonzon in their present existence and future existences if reborn once again. Nichiren Shoshu claims this tradition from the Chapter 21 of the Lotus Sutra where Shakyamuni Buddha passes his vow to the Visistacaritra Bodhisattva and his &quot;infinite followers&quot; along with the merits of the &quot;Seven Jewels of the Treasure Tower&quot;.

Former members who have not been active are allowed to receive the &quot;Kankai&quot; or reaffirmation vows.
* &quot;Gojukai&quot; ceremony for new members
* &quot;Kaigen-shu&quot; for consecrating and &quot;opening the eyes&quot; of Gohonzon, Nenju prayer beads and Buddhist gravestones 
* &quot;Kankai-kishi&quot; ceremony for former members
* Gohonzon approval (dependent on priestly discretion)
* &quot;Kantoku&quot; ceremony for transferring ownership of an heirloom Gohonzon to a practicing descendant
* &quot;Toba&quot; (Stupa) memorials for dead relatives and friends
* Inscription for &quot;Kakocho&quot; memorial / ancestral book for the home altar
* &quot;Gokaihi&quot; ceremony at the &quot;Hoando&quot;, donation for the prayers and maintenance of the Dai-Gohonzon

Donations to a Nichiren Shōshū temple is highly regarded as private and is therefore always contained in small white envelopes labeled &quot;Gokuyo&quot; offering with a checklist that labels the purpose of ones donation. In addition, monetary donations from non-members is strongly prohibited.

The difference between a Nichiren Shōshū Gohonzon granted to lay believers by the priesthood and all other types is that they are the only ones specifically sanctioned and issued by Nichiren Shōshū. The following Gohonzons are issued if deemed worthy of the lay believer upon application:
* &quot;Joju&quot; type – a carved wooden platform or grand paper scroll with a special inscription that is reserved for grand temples and buildings, or descendants of who have protected the Dai Gohonzon or Head Temple during times of disaster.
* Regular sized &quot;katagi&quot;, or woodblock – commonly issued to practicing members
* Large size &quot;katagi Tokubetsu&quot; – granted depending on the Chief Priest highly commendable discretion
* &quot;mamori&quot; or pocket sized – issued to traveling practitioners

Regardless of their type, all Gohonzons issued by Nichiren Shōshū have been consecrated by one of the successive High Priests in a ceremony conducted in the Hoando building of Taiseki-ji temple. It is believed that this ceremony endows a Gohonzon with the same enlightened property of the Dai-Gohonzon, thus giving it the same power. Upon death, a Gohonzon must be returned to a Nichiren Shōshū temple. Unauthorized reproduction or photography of the Gohonzon is prohibited to believers.

==Interpretation of Buddhahood==

The sect teaches that personal enlightenment can be achieved in one&#x27;s present life form existence (即身成仏, &quot;Sokushin Jobutsu&quot;). The repetitive chanting of &quot;Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo&quot; is central and primary to their practice. Accordingly, the sect maintains that only by chanting these words to their object of worship (Jp, Hon–zon) that a human person (the minimal level of existence, and excluding animals, insects or insentient beings) is believed to change or eradicate the accumulation of negative karma and ultimately achieve both happiness and enlightenment. In this process of achieving benefits, obstacles overcome or personal wishes granted, the individual chooses to lead others to an enlightened state of being.

The phrase &quot;Nam-Myōhō-Renge-Kyō&quot; is referred by the sect as the &quot;Daimoku&quot; (題目: &quot;title&quot;) of the revered text, the Lotus Sutra. This stems from their belief that it is composed of &quot;Nam&quot; and the Japanese title of the Lotus Sutra, &quot;Myōhō-Renge-Kyō&quot;, as revealed by the founder Nichiren for widespread propagation consisting of the following components (termed &quot;Powers of the Mystic Law&quot;):

# The believer&#x27;s practice (&quot;Gyō–riki&quot;: power of practice)
# Faith (&quot;Shin–riki&quot;: power of faith)
# Invoking the power of the Buddha (&quot;Butsu–Riki&quot;)
# Then coupled with the power of the Dharma inherent in the Gohonzon (&quot;Ho–riki&quot;).

This four-part combination of physical practice and religious faith are claimed to eradicate negative forms of karma, attract positive new karma and transcend to a happier and higher life status.

The current version of its daily practice consists of performing &quot;Gongyo&quot;, a recitation of the Lotus Sutra and chanting its words (Shodai). It consists of the prose section of Chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra and the prose and verse portion of Chapter 16 along with five designated prayers.

This regimented practice when shared with non-believers (Jigyo–Keta) is regarded by the sect as the quintessential essence (called &quot;True Cause&quot;) for gaining the life state of Buddhahood. Furthermore, it teaches that this secret was revealed by the Buddhist god Ākāśagarbha at a large open garden during the training years of Nichiren prior to his attempted execution and revelation of enlightenment at Shichirigahama beach.

==Object of Worship==
The Dai Gohonzon (also called: &quot;Dai-Gohonzon of the High Sanctuary of Essential Teachings&quot;) is a calligraphic mandala inscribed with Sanskrit and Chinese characters on a plank of Japanese camphorwood as the only object of worship by believers. The sect claims that Nichiren inscribed it on 12 October 1279 (Japanese: &quot;Koan&quot;).

The sect claims the &quot;ninpō-ikka&quot; or &quot;Unity of the Person and the Buddhist Dharma&quot; as one entity and the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; is revered as the personification of Nichiren himself. Every Nichiren Shōshū temple and household possesses a &quot;gohonzon&quot;, or transcription of the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; rendered by its successive High Priests.

The &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; is enshrined at the &quot;Hoando&quot; worship hall within the Taiseki-ji Grand Main Temple complex grounds at the foot of Mount Fuji. The temple priesthood will only expose the image for constant public veneration once the conversion of the Emperor of Japan and &quot;Kosen-rufu&quot; is achieved, maintaining the beliefs of Nichiren Shōshū as the primary religion in the world by Japanese imperial decree. Unlike the other Gohonzons enshrined at the Head Temple, it is not enshrined with &quot;shikimi&quot; branches nor Taiko drums.

Transcriptions of the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot;, made by successive High Priests of Nichiren Shōshū, are called &quot;gohonzon&quot; (&quot;go&quot;, honorific prefix indicating respect). Most &quot;gohonzons&quot; in temples are wood tablets in which the inscription is carved; the tablets are coated with black &quot;urushi&quot; and have gilded characters. &quot;Gohonzons&quot; enshrined in temples and other similar facilities are personally transcribed by one of the successive High Priests.

Hokkeko followers can make a request to receive a personal &quot;gohonzon&quot; to their local temple chief priest. These &quot;gohonzons&quot; are rituallyconsecrated facsimiles printed on paper using a traditional method and presented as a small scroll, measuring approximately 7 x 15 inches. The local chief priest sends all requests to the Head Temple. As these requests are granted, &quot;gohonzons&quot; are then delivered to the recipient&#x27;s local priest and he bestows them on the individual members. In this ritual, the recipient vows to sincerely believe in Nichiren&#x27;s teachings and to faithfully practice the religion and uphold its doctrines.

== Expelled lay and priestly groups ==

The following groups, which had been associated with Nichiren Shoshu, were expelled in the years 1974 (Kenshokai), 1980 (Shoshinkai), and 1991 (Soka Gakkai).

=== Kenshokai (顕正会, Clear and Orthodox Group), 1974 ===

In 1974, a lay group called Myōshinkō from the Myokoji Temple in Shinagawa ward in Tokyo was expelled by High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi from Nichiren Shōshū after holding a public protest against Soka Gakkai for claiming that the Shohondo building was the true and permanent national sanctuary of the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; as mandated by Nichiren, even without the religious conversion of Emperor Showa. The group was known for being brazen in confronting Soka Gakkai and former High Priest Nittatsu Shonin, resulting in a lawsuit against him amidst public protest.

The group later changed its corporation name to &quot;Fuji Taisekiji Kenshōkai&quot;. Kenshōkai has been described as one of the fastest growing denominations of Buddhism in Japan. The Kenshokai sometimes uses an enlarged, variant copy of the Dai Gohonzon image from the year 1728 by Nichikan Shonin, the 26th High Priest of Head Temple Taisekiji, along with contemporary ones issued by the Taisekiji Head Temple. These Gohonzon images use the same brown ornamental border sourced and used by Nichiren Shoshu.

=== Shōshinkai (正信会, Orthodox Faith Group), 1980 ===

In 1980, a group of Nichiren Shōshū priests and lay supporters called Shōshinkai (English: Correct Faith Group) were expelled from the Head Temple by 67th High Priest Nikken Shonin for questioning the legitimacy of the new head abbot Nikken and for criticising Soka Gakkai&#x27;s influence on temple affairs. At the time, Soka Gakkai supported Nikken&#x27;s claim to be the rightful successor of Nittatsu Hosoi as high priest. Shōshinkai continues to refer to itself as the true Nichiren Shōshū. Shōshinkai later founded a dissident association of Nichiren Shoshu priests seeking reformation and began transcribing their own version of the &quot;Gohonzon&quot; rather than taking a transcribed copy from one of the Nichiren Shōshū high priests. Most of them have aged or deceased, and their temples have since reverted to Nichiren Shoshu administration after their death, having been replaced with younger priests affiliated with the Head Temple Taiseki-ji. Some of these older priests have also joined other Nichiren sects or made their own, such as the case in Taiwan.

=== Soka Gakkai (創価学会, Value Creation Society), 1991 ===

Nichiren Shōshū excommunicated the Soka Gakkai and the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) on 28 November 1991 due to doctrinal conflicts and the reputation of the Soka Gakkai, at that time entangled in political and financial scandals.

Soka Gakkai had emerged as a lay organization, but as early as 1956, doctrinal conflicts simmered, evidenced by the alleged declaration of the second president of Soka Gakkai, Josei Toda, to the 65th High Priest Nichijun Shonin during the reconstruction of Myoden-ji Temple, claiming the organizational leadership no longer upheld Nichiren Shoshu doctrines. Nikken Abe publicly criticized the Soka Gakkai for deviating from the traditionalist doctrines of Nichiren Shoshu. Also, Nichiren Shoshu denounced &quot;a whole series of scandals and anti-social behavior, such as the obstacle to certain publications or the affair of listening to the telephone conversations of the honorary president of the PC. On a more recent date, we can mention (. ..) his involvement in the political and stock market scandal Recruit, in illegal transactions on Renoir paintings and in a case of false income declarations&quot;.

These and other conflicts resulted in a complete and formal disassociation of the two sides after Nichiren Shōshū excommunicated the leaders of the Sōka Gakkai and stripped it of its status as a lay organization of Nichiren Shōshū in 1991. Ultimately, Daisaku Ikeda was excommunicated from the role of &quot;Sokoto&quot; or lay leader by High Priest Nikken, while the formal decree of excommunication invalidated the tax exempt status of Soka Gakkai under Japanese law due to its lack of temple affiliation.

On 30 September 1997, Nichiren Shōshū excommunicated all Soka Gakkai International members.

==Criticism==

Various criticisms of Nichiren Shoshu are often published by its former lay organization, the Soka Gakkai. In its dissenting group &quot;Soka Spirit&quot; that questions and opposes Nichiren Shoshu doctrines, the Soka Gakkai rejects both the priestly authority of the High Priest of Taisekiji and the intermediary role of the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood as relevant or necessary in practicing Buddhism for a contemporary age.

Former practitioners often cite the orthodox beliefs of Nichiren Shoshu that places great emphasis on religious piety and religious ceremonies that prohibit tolerance for other cultures and foreign religious values under an atmosphere of orthodoxy. Chief among this is the prohibition of members to attend other religious venues, the purchase of Buddhist religious articles outside of its local Temple branches or the Taisekiji vicinity. Most significant is the alleged monopoly of Nichiren Buddhism through the devotional &quot;Tozan&quot; pilgrimages to the Dai Gohonzon. The donations, while voluntary, are granted for &quot;Toba&quot; memorial tablets, &quot;Kakocho&quot; ancestral books and the overwhelming Japanese conservative customs and mannerisms associated with Buddhist practice.

Furthermore, allegations of accepting Ofuda and Omamori Shinto talismans during the Second World War to support the Japanese Emperor Showa&#x27;s patriotic war effort to maintain immunity from persecution was supposedly contradictory to its doctrinal beliefs to reject other religions, though both the temple priesthood and Tsunesaburo Makiguchi in his writings at the time did lend support for the world war effort as dictated by the Japanese Emperor. The first talisman dedicated to the solar goddess Amaterasu-Omikami enshrined at the &quot;Dai-Kyakuden&quot; Hall was installed by the Japanese Imperial Army.

The most prominent of these criticisms is the posthumous elevation of the High Priest of Nichiren Shoshu as the sole inheritor of the enlightened entity of the Buddha called the &quot;Living Essence&quot; or the &quot;Heritage of the Law&quot;, referring to its doctrinal office of Taisekiji while the Soka Gakkai claims to be the inheritor of &quot;Heritage of the Faith&quot; without any distinct priestly lineage. A longstanding negative sentiment is crystallized in the destruction of the &quot;Sho-hondo&quot; and other Soka Gakkai funded buildings which came from member donations during the 1970s. In addition, the alleged manipulation of Nichiren&#x27;s writings called &quot;Gosho&quot; by either abbreviating or manipulating their interpretative meaning to suit a hierarchical sentiment is leveled as a criticism against the priesthood and its school.

Outside researchers such as author Daniel Metraux view the issue of perceived authority as the central point of the conflict:

<text>Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō () are Japanese words chanted within all forms of Nichiren Buddhism. In English, they mean &quot;Devotion to the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra&quot; or &quot;Glory to the Dharma of the Lotus Sutra&quot;.

The words refer to the Japanese title of the Lotus Sūtra. The mantra is referred to as () or, in honorific form, () meaning &quot;title&quot; and was first publicly declared by the Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren on 28 April 1253 atop Mount Kiyosumi, now memorialized by Seichō-ji temple in Kamogawa, Chiba prefecture, Japan.

The practice of prolonged chanting is referred to as (). Believers claim that the purpose of chanting is to reduce suffering by eradicating negative karma along with reducing karmic punishments both from previous and present lifetimes, with the goal of attaining perfect and complete awakening.

==Buddhist proponents==
While the Tendai monks Saicho (767-822) and Genshin (942-1017) have been said by some to have originated the , the Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222-1282) is known today as its greatest propagator for popularizing it in Japan. The mantra is an homage to the Lotus Sutra. In Nichiren&#x27;s writings, he frequently quotes passages from the Lotus Sutra in which the Buddha declared it to be his highest teaching. These passages include: &quot;I have preached various sutras and among those sutras the Lotus is the foremost!&quot;, &quot;Among all the sutras, it holds the highest place,&quot; and &quot;This sutra is king of the sutras.&quot;

Before Nichiren&#x27;s time, during a Lotus Sutra lecture series in Japan in 1110 C.E., a tale was told of an illiterate monk in Sui-dynasty China who was instructed to chant from dawn to night the daimoku mantra &quot; as a way to honor the Lotus Sutra as the One Vehicle teaching of the Buddha since he could not read the sutra. The monk upon suicide plunged into hell then recited &quot;, which was heard by Yama who subsequently sent the monk back to life. 

The &quot;Kūkan&quot; (Contemplation of Emptiness), a text attributed to the Tendai monk Genshin, advocates for those who aspire to Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land to recite &quot;&quot; which can be interpreted as honoring correspondingly the three jewels of Buddhism. Nichiren, who himself was a Tendai monk, may have reappropriated the chant down to , and Nichiren Buddhists are responsible for its wide popularity and usage all over the world today.

==Nichiren==
The Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren was a known advocate of this recitation, claiming it is the exclusive method to happiness and salvation suited for the Third Age of Buddhism. According to varying believers, Nichiren cited the mantra in his &quot;Ongi Kuden&quot;, a transcription of his lectures about the Lotus Sutra, &quot;Namu&quot; () is a transliteration into Japanese of the Sanskrit &quot;namas&quot;, and &quot;Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot; is the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese title of the Lotus Sutra (hence, &quot;Daimoku&quot;, which is a Japanese word meaning &#x27;title&#x27;), in the translation by Kumārajīva. Nichiren gives a detailed interpretation of each character (see Ongi kuden#The meaning of Nam(u) Myōhō Renge Kyō) in this text.

The Lotus Sutra is held by Nichiren Buddhists, as well as practitioners of the Tiantai and corresponding Japanese Tendai schools, to be the culmination of Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s fifty years of teaching. However, followers of Nichiren Buddhism consider to be the name of the ultimate law permeating the universe, in unison with human life which can manifest realization, sometimes termed as &quot;Buddha Wisdom&quot; or &quot;attaining Buddhahood&quot;, through select Buddhist practices.

==Word-by-word translation==
&quot;Namu&quot; is used in Buddhism as a prefix expressing taking refuge in a Buddha or similar object of veneration. Among varying Nichiren sects, the phonetic use of &quot;Nam&quot; versus &quot;Namu&quot; is a linguistic but not a dogmatic issue, due to common contractions and &quot;u&quot; is devoiced in many varieties of Japanese words. In this mantra, the Japanese drop the &quot;u&quot; sound when chanting at a fast pace, but write &quot;Namu&quot;, seeing as it is impossible to contract the word into &#x27;Nam&#x27; in their native script.

&quot;Namu – Myōhō – Renge – Kyō&quot; consists of the following:

* &quot;Namu&quot; &quot;devoted to&quot;, a transliteration of Sanskrit meaning: &#x27;obeisance, reverential salutation, adoration&#x27;.
* &quot;Myōhō&quot; &quot;exquisite law&quot;
** &quot;Myō&quot; , from Middle Chinese &quot;mièw&quot;, &quot;strange, mystery, miracle, cleverness&quot; (cf. Mandarin )
** &quot;Hō&quot; , from Middle Chinese &quot;pjap&quot;, &quot;law, principle, doctrine&quot; (cf. Mand. )
* &quot;Renge-kyō&quot; &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;
** &quot;Renge&quot; &quot;padma (Lotus)&quot;
*** &quot;Ren&quot; , from Middle Chinese &quot;len&quot;, &quot;lotus&quot; (cf. Mand. )
*** &quot;Ge&quot; , from Middle Chinese &quot;xwæ&quot;, &quot;flower&quot; (cf. Mand. )
** &quot;Kyō&quot; , from Middle Chinese &quot;kjeng&quot;, &quot;sutra&quot; (cf. Mand. )

<doc id="142890" wikidata="Q3100949" url="?curid=142890" title="Fractal landscape">
<text>A fractal landscape or fractal surface is generated using a stochastic algorithm designed to produce fractal behavior that mimics the appearance of natural terrain. In other words, the surface resulting from the procedure is not a deterministic, but rather a random surface that exhibits fractal behavior.

Many natural phenomena exhibit some form of statistical self-similarity that can be modeled by fractal surfaces. Moreover, variations in surface texture provide important visual cues to the orientation and slopes of surfaces, and the use of almost self-similar fractal patterns can help create natural looking visual effects.
The modeling of the Earth&#x27;s rough surfaces via fractional Brownian motion was first proposed by Benoit Mandelbrot.

Because the intended result of the process is to produce a landscape, rather than a mathematical function, processes are frequently applied to such landscapes that may affect the stationarity and even the overall fractal behavior of such a surface, in the interests of producing a more convincing landscape.

According to R. R. Shearer, the generation of natural looking surfaces and landscapes was a major turning point in art history, where the distinction between geometric, computer generated images and natural, man made art became blurred. The first use of a fractal-generated landscape in a film was in 1982 for the movie &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Loren Carpenter refined the techniques of Mandelbrot to create an alien landscape.

==Behavior of natural landscapes==

Whether or not natural landscapes behave in a generally fractal manner has been the subject of some research. Technically speaking, any surface in three-dimensional space has a topological dimension of 2, and therefore any fractal surface in three-dimensional space has a Hausdorff dimension between 2 and 3. Real landscapes however, have varying behavior at different scales. This means that an attempt to calculate the &#x27;overall&#x27; fractal dimension of a real landscape can result in measures of negative fractal dimension, or of fractal dimension above 3. In particular, many studies of natural phenomena, even those commonly thought to exhibit fractal behavior, do not do so over more than a few orders of magnitude. For instance, Richardson&#x27;s examination of the western coastline of Britain showed fractal behavior of the coastline over only two orders of magnitude. In general, there is no reason to suppose that the geological processes that shape terrain on large scales (for example plate tectonics) exhibit the same mathematical behavior as those that shape terrain on smaller scales (for instance, soil creep).

Real landscapes also have varying statistical behavior from place to place, so for example sandy beaches don&#x27;t exhibit the same fractal properties as mountain ranges. A fractal function, however, is statistically stationary, meaning that its bulk statistical properties are the same everywhere. Thus, any real approach to modeling landscapes requires the ability to modulate fractal behavior spatially. Additionally, real landscapes have very few natural minima (most of these are lakes), whereas a fractal function has as many minima as maxima, on average. Real landscapes also have features originating with the flow of water and ice over their surface, which simple fractals cannot model.

It is because of these considerations that the simple fractal functions are often inappropriate for modeling landscapes. More sophisticated techniques (known as &#x27;multi-fractal&#x27; techniques) use different fractal dimensions for different scales, and thus can better model the frequency spectrum behavior of real landscapes

==Generation of fractal landscapes==

A way to make such a landscape is to employ the random midpoint displacement algorithm, in which a square is subdivided into four smaller equal squares and the center point is vertically offset by some random amount. The process is repeated on the four new squares, and so on, until the desired level of detail is reached. There are many fractal procedures (such as combining multiple octaves of Simplex noise) capable of creating terrain data, however, the term &quot;fractal landscape&quot; has become more generic over time.

&quot;Fractal plants&quot; can be procedurally generated using L-systems in computer-generated scenes.

<doc id="142892" wikidata="Q691581" url="?curid=142892" title="The Wonder Years">
<text>The Wonder Years is an American coming-of-age comedy television series created by Neal Marlens and Carol Black. It ran on ABC from January 31, 1988, until May 12, 1993. The series premiered immediately after ABC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XXII. The series stars Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold, a teenager growing up in a suburban middle class family in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It co-stars Dan Lauria as his father Jack, Alley Mills as his mother Norma, Jason Hervey as his brother Wayne, Olivia d&#x27;Abo as his sister Karen, Josh Saviano as his best friend Paul Pfeiffer, and Danica McKellar as his girlfriend Winnie Cooper, with narration by Daniel Stern as an adult version of Kevin.

The show earned a spot in the Nielsen Top 30 during its first four seasons. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named it one of the 20 best shows of the 1980s. After six episodes, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1988. In addition, at age 13, Fred Savage became the youngest actor ever nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor for a Comedy Series at the 41st Primetime Emmy Awards. The show was also awarded a Peabody Award in 1989 for &quot;pushing the boundaries of the sitcom format and using new modes of storytelling&quot;. In total, the series won 22 awards and was nominated for 54 more. In 1997, &quot;My Father&#x27;s Office&quot; was ranked number 29 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time, and in the 2009 revised list, the pilot episode was ranked number 43. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; number 63 on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2017, James Charisma of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the show&#x27;s opening sequence number 14 on a list of the 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time. As of recent years, many critics and fans consider &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; to be a classic with tremendous impact on the industry over the years, inspiring many other shows and how they are structured.

==Plot==
The series depicts the social and family life of a boy in a typical American suburban middle-class family from 1968 to 1973, covering the ages of 12 through 17. Where the Arnold family lives is never specified other than being a suburb, but some episodes have license plates showing California and New York. Each year in the series takes place exactly 20 years before airing (1988 to 1993). 

The show&#x27;s plot centers on Kevin Arnold, the son of Jack and Norma Arnold. Kevin&#x27;s father Jack holds a management job at NORCOM, a defense contractor, while his mother Norma is a housewife. Kevin also has an older brother, Wayne, and an older sister, Karen. Two of Kevin&#x27;s friends and neighbors are prominently featured throughout the series: his best friend, Paul Pfeiffer, and his crush-turned-girlfriend Gwendolyn &quot;Winnie&quot; Cooper. Storylines are told through Kevin&#x27;s reflections as an adult in his mid-30s and learns a lot of life lessons growing up, voiced by Daniel Stern.

In the pilot episode, Winnie&#x27;s older brother Brian, whom Kevin admires, is killed in action in Vietnam in 1968. Kevin meets Winnie in a nearby wooded area called Harpers Woods, and they share what is implied to be each other&#x27;s first kiss. This unsaid relationship between Winnie and Kevin remains dormant for a long while, with Winnie starting to date a popular eighth-grader named Kirk McCray and Kevin briefly going steady with Becky Slater. After Kevin breaks up with Becky due to his feelings for Winnie, Becky becomes a recurring nuisance for Kevin. Winnie eventually dumps Kirk as well and Kevin and Winnie share a second kiss at the start of the 1969 summer vacation. Around Valentine&#x27;s Day 1970, Winnie temporarily dates Paul, who has broken up with his girlfriend Carla. Winnie and Kevin start dating each other soon after.

Just before the summer break, Winnie and her family move to a house four miles away. Although Winnie attends a new school, Lincoln Junior High, she and Kevin decide to remain together and maintain a successful long-distance relationship. A beautiful new student named Madeline Adams joins Kevin&#x27;s school and quickly catches Kevin&#x27;s eye, but it is Winnie who breaks up with Kevin after meeting Roger, a jock at her new school. Neither relationship lasts long, but Winnie and Kevin don&#x27;t reunite until she is injured in a car crash. After graduating from junior high, Kevin and Winnie both go to McKinley High and Paul attends a prep school. Paul would later transfer to McKinley High and join Kevin and Winnie.

Earlier seasons of the show tended to focus on plots involving events within the Arnold household and Kevin&#x27;s academic struggles, whereas later seasons focused much more on plots involving dating and Kevin&#x27;s friends.

Kevin has several brief flings during the summer of 1971 and the 1971–1972 academic year. After Kevin&#x27;s grandfather Albert gets his driver&#x27;s license revoked, he sells his car to Kevin for a dollar. Paul transfers to McKinley High after his first semester at preparatory school when his father Alvin runs into financial troubles. Wayne decides to join the army as a result of his inability to do well in school. This gets turned around when Wayne is not able to pass his physical. Winnie and Kevin are reunited when they go on a double date to a school dance, and find themselves more attracted to each other than their respective partners. In late 1972, Wayne starts working at NORCOM, and dates his co-worker Bonnie Douglas, a divorcée with a son named David, but the relationship does not last. Jack quits NORCOM, and buys a furniture-manufacturing business.

===Final episode and epilogue===
Shortly before the finale, mirroring the women&#x27;s liberation movement of the 1970s, in 1973, Norma, not wanting to let her college degree go to waste, gets a job as a comptroller at Micro Electronics, making $225/week. Meanwhile, Kevin and his friends get their SAT scores, with Kevin scoring a respectable 650 verbal/590 math, while Winnie scores a near-perfect 725 verbal/757 math. As a result, Kevin and Jack start feeling inadequate, but then beat Winnie and Norma in a game of bowling and reconcile.

In the series finale, Winnie decides to take a job for the summer of 1973 as a lifeguard at a resort. Kevin, meanwhile, is at his job at Jack&#x27;s furniture factory and calls Winnie, who is distant and seems to be enjoying her time away from Kevin. Eventually, Kevin and Jack fight and Kevin announces that he is leaving, reasoning that he needs to &quot;find himself&quot;. Kevin drives to the resort where Winnie is working, hopeful that she can secure him a job and they can spend the rest of the summer together.

Kevin eventually secures a job at the resort and plays a round of poker with the house band. He wins big and goes out to search for Winnie to tell her of his good fortune. To his surprise, he sees Winnie engaged in a passionate kiss with Eric, another lifeguard.

The next day, Kevin confronts her and they fight. Kevin then plays another round of poker, losing his car in a bet. Desperate, Kevin confronts Winnie and her new boyfriend Eric at the restaurant and ends up punching Eric in the face. Kevin then leaves the resort on foot.

On a desolate stretch of highway, Kevin decides to begin hitchhiking. He finally gets picked up by an elderly couple and much to his surprise finds Winnie in the backseat. Winnie was fired over the fight Kevin instigated at the resort. Kevin and Winnie begin to argue and the elderly couple lose patience and kick them out of the car. A rainstorm begins and Kevin and Winnie search for shelter. They find a barn and discuss how much things are changing and the future. They make up and kiss passionately (it is heavily implied that they lose their virginity to each other).

The narrator&#x27;s monologue states: 

They soon find their way back to their hometown and arrive hand-in-hand to a Fourth of July parade. During this parade, the adult Kevin (Daniel Stern) describes the fate of the show&#x27;s main characters. Kevin makes up with Jack, graduates from high school in 1974, and leaves for college, later becoming a writer. Paul studies law at Harvard. Karen, Kevin&#x27;s sister, gives birth to a son in September 1973. Norma becomes a businesswoman and corporate board chairwoman. Jack dies in 1975 and Wayne takes over Jack&#x27;s furniture business. Winnie studies art history in Paris while Kevin stays in the United States. Winnie and Kevin end up writing to each other once a week for the next eight years. When Winnie returns to the United States in 1982, Kevin meets her at the airport, with his wife and eight-month-old son.

The final sounds, voice-over narration, and dialogue of the episode and series is that of Kevin as an adult, with children heard in the background:
A little boy (Stern&#x27;s real life son, Henry Stern) can be heard asking &quot;Hey, Dad, want to play catch?&quot; during a break in the final narration. Kevin responds, &quot;I&#x27;ll be right there.&quot;

In 2011, the finale was ranked number 11 on the TV Guide Network special, &quot;TV&#x27;s Most Unforgettable Finales&quot;.

==Episodes==

==Cast==

* Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage): Character born March 18, 1956, Kevin grew up in the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s. The voice of Kevin as an adult (and the show&#x27;s narrator) is supplied by Daniel Stern (Arye Gross in the original broadcast of the pilot).
* John &quot;Jack&quot; Arnold (Dan Lauria): Character born on November 6, 1927, died in 1975. Jack was a gruff, laconic man and a Korean War veteran; he grew up during the Great Depression, served in the US Marine Corps, and is seen in photographs wearing the uniform of a First Lieutenant. He works at NORCOM, a large military defense corporation, in a middle management position he loathes. Later, he starts his own business, building and selling handcrafted furniture. The series&#x27; last episode reveals that he dies in 1975 near the end of Kevin&#x27;s freshman year of college – that is, two years after the time of the show&#x27;s finale – although in a previous episode, an adult Kevin says Jack would later be the grandfather of Kevin&#x27;s sons. Jack represents the viewpoint of the &quot;Silent Generation&quot; that grew up during the Depression and came of age during the Second World War; it was confused and angered by the rapid changes taking place in the 1960s. He is described as a Republican who voted for Richard Nixon twice in the presidential elections of 1968 and 1972.
* Norma Arnold (née Gustavson) (Alley Mills): Character born March 22, 1930, Kevin&#x27;s housewife mother. Unlike her husband, Norma is friendly and upbeat. She also tries to be a peacekeeper in family clashes (mostly between Jack and Karen). She met Jack as a college freshman. When he graduated, she moved across the country with him and did not finish college. She eventually gets her degree late in the series and begins work at a software startup called Micro Electronics. Although she came of age at the same time as her husband Jack, she is less conservative than her husband and increasingly yearns to break out of her homemaker role, reflecting the rise of feminism in the 1960s.
* Karen Arnold (Olivia d&#x27;Abo): Character born circa 1952, Kevin&#x27;s hippie, but mature older sister. Her free-spirited ways clash with her overbearing father Jack&#x27;s conservatism, and she depends upon her mother Norma as a mediator. When Karen moves in with her boyfriend Michael (David Schwimmer) during her freshman year of college, she has a falling out with her father. The pair marry one year later and move to Alaska, where Michael has secured a good job. Karen ultimately accepts some of her parents&#x27; viewpoints and has a baby, while Michael learns to support Karen and their son.
* Wayne Arnold (Jason Hervey): Character born April 6, 1954, Kevin&#x27;s annoying older brother. Wayne enjoys physically tormenting Kevin and Paul, calling Kevin &quot;&quot; or &quot;scrote&quot;. He ultimately takes over the family furniture business, after his father Jack dies. (Wayne attempted to follow in Jack&#x27;s footsteps by joining the military, but psoriasis kept him out.) Wayne is usually portrayed as a loser in romantic relationships. For a time, he dated a girl named Dolores (Juliette Lewis), but that was more casual than serious. In later seasons, Wayne matures. In the final season, he begins a serious relationship with a divorcée named Bonnie Douglas (Paula Marshall), but is left heartbroken when she reconciles with her ex-husband James.
* Paul Joshua Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano): Character born March 14, 1956, Paul is Kevin&#x27;s long time best friend, a bright and excellent student, and an allergy sufferer. He is also Jewish and in one episode celebrates his Bar Mitzvah. Although Kevin and Paul are best friends in the series&#x27; early seasons, their relationship becomes somewhat strained later. Kevin begins to spend more time with Chuck Coleman (Andy Berman) and Jeff Billings (Giovanni Ribisi), causing tension with Paul. Paul also attends a private prep school for one season, leaving Kevin alone to start public high school. In another episode, Kevin is frustrated and conflicted with Paul after the latter loses his virginity before him. In the final episode, it is revealed that Paul eventually attends Harvard and becomes a lawyer (in real life, Saviano quit acting, went to Yale, and became a lawyer).
* Gwendolyn &quot;Winnie&quot; Cooper (Danica McKellar): Winnie is Kevin&#x27;s main love interest and neighbor. Her older brother Brian (Bentley Mitchum)&#x27;s death in the Vietnam War plays a big part in the pilot. In another episode, Winnie&#x27;s parents Jim (H. Richard Greene) and Evelyn (first played by Lynn Milgrim and then Anne Cooper) separate in grief over Brian&#x27;s death. In the epilogue of the final episode, Winnie travels overseas to study art history in Paris. Kevin and Winnie write to each other every week for eight years until she returns; in the concluding moments of the finale, Kevin says that when Winnie returned to the States, Kevin met her accompanied by his wife and first child, despite the hope among &quot;Wonder Years&quot; fans that Kevin and Winnie would themselves marry. Kevin says at the end, &quot;things never turn out exactly the way you plan them.&quot; As suggested in an episode entitled &quot;The Accident&quot; and in the final episode of the series, every important event in Kevin&#x27;s life has somehow involved Winnie.

==Production==

===Conception===
The series was conceived by writers Neal Marlens and Carol Black, both of &quot;Growing Pains&quot; fame. They set out to create a family show that would appeal to the baby-boomer generation by setting the series in the late &#x27;60s, a time of radical change in America&#x27;s history. They also wanted the series to tie this setting in to the life of a normal boy growing up during the period. After writing the script for the pilot episode, Marlens and Black began pitching the series to television networks. None of them were interested, except for ABC, with whom Marlens and Black reached an agreement.

Marlens had originally wanted the setting to be Huntington, Long Island, where he grew up. Elements were also taken from Black&#x27;s childhood from the White Oak section of Silver Spring, Maryland. ABC, however, insisted that the location remain nonspecific (the colloquial &quot;Anytown, USA&quot;), but several items refer to the setting as Southern California, from car license plates, to the lack of snow and winter weather, to Jack working for a major defense contractor (many located in Southern California at the time), to Wayne&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license listing Culver City, California.

===Writing===
When they started writing the series, Marlens and Black took a script for a future film with which they had been toying, which featured an off-screen narrator. Black explained, &quot;We liked the concept that you could play with what people think and what they&#x27;re saying, or how they would like to see themselves as opposed to how the audience is seeing them.&quot; They based the show, in part, on their own childhood growing up in the suburbs. Black recalled that &quot;we naturally [took] elements of our experience and [threw] them into the pot. The basic setup, the neighborhood, the era – that&#x27;s the time and place where we grew up.&quot; The show&#x27;s title was a satirical nod to a famous 1970s Wonder Bread ad campaign promoting the highly processed white bread as perfect for &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, ages 1 through 12.

===Casting===

The search for the main lead of the show did not take long. Marlens and Black went to five casting directors and interviewed them for recommendations. All five of them recommended Fred Savage, who at the time was famous for his roles as the grandson in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and as Charlie Seymour/Marshall Seymour in &quot;Vice Versa&quot;. Marlens and Black, having never heard of Savage, decided to see the rough cut of &quot;Vice Versa&quot;. Said Marlens, &quot;[We saw] a marvelous actor with a natural quality – which essentially means he has no quality at all except being a kid. It sounds funny, but it&#x27;s a rare thing to find in a child actor.&quot; Marlens and Black took this approach when casting the other kids for the show, looking for natural ability rather than professionalism. According to Marlens, they saw 300 to 400 kids before narrowing it down to 70. &quot;My wife and I made the final choice ... each of whom had to be approved by the network.&quot;

For the choice of Savage&#x27;s character&#x27;s main love interest, the choice came down to actress Danica McKellar and her sister, Crystal McKellar. With just days to go before shooting, the producers eventually selected Danica to play Winnie Cooper. However, Mary Buck, the head of casting, noted, &quot;it was practically a tossup&quot;. Crystal McKellar was liked so much by the producers that they eventually created the character of Becky Slater so that they could have her on the show. Danica later reflected on the experience, &quot;I auditioned, like everyone else. They had read lots of girls but hadn&#x27;t found their &#x27;Winnie&#x27; yet, and I was thrilled to be chosen.&quot;

===Filming===
At the end of the first season, Marlens and Black departed from the show. Although they never gave a reason for their sudden departure, it may have been due to Black&#x27;s pregnancy. She hinted at it in an interview in April 1988, saying &quot;We have secret plans to leave Los Angeles before our kids reach the age of cognizance.&quot; One challenge for the cast and crew was filming around a child actor, meaning that the show had to obey child labor laws. Savage at the time explained, &quot;You have to get at least three hours of school in every day. So whenever I&#x27;m on a break, I go to school. It&#x27;s really intense because I have to get a lot done in short periods. And it&#x27;s hard because if they need you back on the set, they pull you away every 20 minutes. If you&#x27;re writing an essay and suddenly get inspired, you&#x27;ve got to stop and go back to work.&quot; Many exterior shots were filmed in Burbank, California.

===Title sequence===
Three different versions of the opening were made, each set to the Joe Cocker rendition of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;.

====First version (pilot)====
This first version of the opening was very basic: Nothing but a black screen was shown, after the title logo, with each cast member&#x27;s name appearing in the center one by one. Much like the Arye Gross narration, this version of the opening was only used once when the pilot first aired after Super Bowl XXII.

====Second version (seasons one through five)====
This opening consists of home-movie footage from the pilot, after the title logo is shown, ending with the &quot;created by&quot; credit. In season five, more footage is added to show how much the cast has aged.

====Third version (season six)====
The opening was overhauled completely in this version. It consisted of stock footage and images of various moments throughout 1960s and early 1970s culture (i.e. John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s Bed-in, the Kent State shootings, the Moon Landing, and an antiwar protest), and was set to a new edit of Cocker&#x27;s rendition of the song (starting with the chorus, versus the opening of the song, as was the case in seasons one through five). The final image in this version is of Kevin, Paul, Winnie, and presumably some of their classmates in a group photograph edited to look like it belonged in the time period.

===Music===

The official soundtrack released in 1988 by Atlantic/WEA contains a total of 13 tracks, featuring Joe Cocker&#x27;s cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, which is the show&#x27;s theme song.

After the series&#x27; original run was over, Laserlight Digital released a five-disc compilation box set under the title &quot;Music from The Wonder Years&quot; in 1994. This same company later released the first two DVDs for the series, &quot;The Best of The Wonder Years&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Wonder Years&quot;. The disc included 40 oldies favorites and five original songs (each is repeated twice in the set) written exclusively for the series by W. G. Snuffy Walden.

In 2014, Time Life released a new soundtrack for the show that accompanies deluxe versions of its complete series DVD set. The CD is not available for purchase separately from the DVD box set, however.

====DVD music replacements====
The Time Life DVD releases feature around 96% of the original music soundtrack, including Joe Cocker&#x27;s cover of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; at the opening. Fourteen songs were replaced, in most instances featuring generic studio replacement music in place of the original song, while on a few occasions, the original soundtrack song was replaced with another version of the same song. None of the necessary music replacements resulted in footage from the episodes being removed.

*In the episode &quot;The Phone Call&quot;, the &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;&quot; was replaced with a song called &quot;Star Crossed Lovers&quot;, which has been used in many other TV shows and movies, including &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.
*In &quot;Dance With Me&quot;, Joe Cocker&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Letter&quot; was replaced with the original version by The Box Tops, while the Herman&#x27;s Hermits version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Kind of Hush&quot; was replaced with a rerecording by the Craggy Blue Project.
*The episode &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; had two replacements: &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; by The Doors was replaced with &quot;Children of the Night&quot;, while Richie Havens&#x27; cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; was replaced by &quot;Train to Nowhere&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;Whose Woods Are These?&quot;, the Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears recording entitled &quot;Variations on a Theme&quot; by Erik Satie (1st and 2nd Movements, adapted from Satie&#x27;s &quot;Three &quot;Gymnopédies&quot;&quot;) was replaced with &quot;Le Suenne Fite&quot;.
*The episode &quot;How I Am Spending My Summer Vacation&quot; replaced the Doors&#x27; &quot;Light My Fire&quot; with &quot;Love&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, while the episode &quot;Summer Song&quot; replaced Blood, Sweat and Tears&#x27; &quot;Spinning Wheel&quot; with a rerecording by former BS&amp;T frontman David Clayton Thomas.
*In &quot;Family Car&quot;, The Stills-Young Band&#x27;s &quot;Long May You Run&quot; was replaced with &quot;Keep Your Motor Running&quot;.
*In &quot;Wayne on Wheels&quot;, &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;&quot; was again replaced by &quot;Star Crossed Lovers&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;The Treehouse&quot;, Doris Day&#x27;s &quot;Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)&quot; was replaced with &quot;Call the Whole Thing Off&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;Little Debbie&quot;, &quot;Tammy&quot; by Liberace was replaced with a song called &quot;Sammy&quot;.
*&quot;Clip Show&quot; contains the scene from &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in which &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is replaced with &quot;Train to Nowhere&quot;.
*The episode &quot;Kevin Delivers&quot; dropped Blood, Sweat and Tears&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot; with a re-recording by David Clayton Thomas.
*In the episode &quot;Alice in Autoland&quot;, Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; was replaced with a re-recording by him.
*In the final episode &quot;Independence Day&quot;, the Ennio Morricone song &quot;Brothers&quot; from the 1986 motion picture &quot;The Mission&quot;, which was played over the pivotal barn scene featuring Kevin and Winnie&#x27;s last kiss, was replaced with the generic tune &quot;Pastorale&quot; (for this instance alone, the same replacement was used in the 1998 &quot;The Best of The Wonder Years&quot; DVD release).

Also, not a music change per se, but the Daniel Stern redub of the pilot is used, with the standard opening sequence.

Other than the above music changes, all other music is intact.

The UK DVD release from Fabulous Films was intended to have no replaced music, but reviews on online retailers and fan websites show that this is not the case.

===Cancellation===
&quot;The Wonder Years&quot; wrapped its sixth and final season in May 1993. Its cancellation was partially blamed on conflict between producers and executives at ABC. As Kevin matured, the producers wanted the storylines to mature, as well. The executives at ABC, though, felt uncomfortable with more explicit content given the time slot, saying, &quot;We felt it was inappropriate to present Kevin&#x27;s awakening because of the setting in the 1970s, the gentle tone of the series, and most importantly, the 8 pm time period.&quot; Bob Brush noted, &quot;When Kevin became 16 and 17, there were really things he needed to get to that we couldn&#x27;t do at 8 pm, especially with the kind of venerable cachet that the show had obtained with its audience. We would get notes from the network saying, &quot;You could do this on any show besides &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;.&quot; Other reasons for the show&#x27;s cancellation were escalating costs and declining ratings. The cast&#x27;s salary increases, coupled with location shooting (which was due to the producers wanting to reflect Kevin obtaining his driver&#x27;s license), led to Brush claiming that they were spending $1.2 million an episode. The final episode aired on May 12, 1993. Bob Brush noted that the finale was not what he would have wanted it to be, but because the cast and crew were unsure at the time of filming if the sixth season would be the last, he was forced to have the ending be open-ended until the recording of Daniel Stern&#x27;s narration. Fans were somewhat disappointed with the ending, in particular the revelation that Kevin and Winnie do not end up as a couple. Brush acknowledged this disappointment, saying, &quot;Some viewers [were] surprised that nothing works out the way your fondest wish would be,&quot; and explained, &quot;The message I wanted in there is that that&#x27;s part of the beauty of life. It&#x27;s fine to say, &#x27;I&#x27;d like everything to be just the way it was when I was 15 and I was happy,&#x27; but it seemed more nurturing to me to say that we leave these things behind and we go on to forge new lives for ourselves.&quot;

====Lawsuit====
As the show was in the process of wrapping its final season, a costume designer on the show named Monique Long filed a sexual harassment charge against stars Fred Savage and Jason Hervey. The suit brought forward unwanted publicity to the show. In the end, the case was settled out of court with Savage stating that he was &quot;completely exonerated&quot; and adding that it was a &quot;terrible experience&quot;.

In January 2018, Alley Mills said that a sexual harassment lawsuit against Savage and Hervey was a significant factor in the show&#x27;s cancellation.

==Release==
===Syndication and streaming=== 
Reruns of the show aired in syndication between September 1992 and September 1997 (mostly on Fox stations). Nick at Nite then reran the show from October 13, 1997 to January 21, 2001. It also reran on The New TNN (January 22, 2001 to September 28, 2001), ABC Family (November 12, 2001 to October 2, 2004), Ion Television (April 2, 2007 to October 4, 2007), and The Hub (October 11, 2010 to August 31, 2012).

In the UK, the show began airing on Channel 4 on August 20, 1989.

In (West) Germany, the show began airing on RTL plus on February 28, 1990 as &quot;Wunderbare Jahre&quot;. Seasons 1-4 were shown on RTL plus until February 1, 1992 on Saturdays at 6:00 pm. Reruns were shown on RTL 2 between September 6 and October 25, 1993 and December 17-31, 1994. On July 17, 1995, the show began airing again on RTL 2 on weekdays until the end of the year; this time, between October 20 and December 29, 1995, previously unaired Seasons 5 and 6 were shown.

In Canada, the show aired on CTS Ontario from September 2010 until September 2, 2011. In Australia, the show aired on Network Ten between 1989 and 1995, then from March 31, 2012, on ABC1. In the Philippines, the show aired on GMA Network.

In Spain, the series initially aired Mondays 9:30 pm on TVE2 (now La2) as part of the Monday-night comedy block, which also featured &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. The series was later promoted to main channel TVE1, where it aired Fridays 9:00 pm. Years later, in the late &#x27;90s, commercial station Antena 3TV recovered the series and aired it first in its 2:00 pm comedy hour, later relocating it to a 5:30 pm slot as part of the youth macroshow &quot;La Merienda&quot;.

===Home media===
Initially, the first four episodes were released on two VHS cassettes by Anchor Bay in 1997, with most of the music intact (a select few songs, however, were re-recordings). In the coming years, fees for licensing music prevented further episodes from being released on VHS. The two volumes that were released on VHS were later released on DVD in 2000. Four episodes of the series were also included in two official &quot;best-of&quot; DVD sets (&quot;The Best of The Wonder Years&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Wonder Years&quot;), without much of the original music.

For many years, full seasons of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; remained unreleased on DVD due to music licensing issues. Because of this issue, &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; routinely appeared on the list of TV shows in high demand for a DVD release.

In a blog update on the Netflix website on March 30, 2011, and a press release issued the next day, Netflix stated that they would be adding &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; to their instant streaming service. The other three 20th Century Fox series noted as part of the deal were added to the Watch Instantly service by April 2, 2011 while &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; remained unavailable. On October 1, 2011, 114 full-length episodes of the series were added to Netflix. The clip show from the end of Season 4, which was released on DVD, was not included.

On September 26, 2011, Amazon Prime&#x27;s streaming video service announced it would be adding &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, describing the series as &quot;available on digital video for the first time&quot;, although Netflix added the series ahead of Amazon&#x27;s release. All 115 episodes (including the clip show) became available to Prime members starting October 6, 2011.

On both digital streaming services, portions of the soundtrack have been replaced. The show&#x27;s opening theme has been replaced on Netflix and Amazon with the version of the song that played in the UK and other overseas airings. The majority of the show&#x27;s soundtrack remains unchanged. Songs such as &quot;Light My Fire&quot; by The Doors and &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; by Jimi Hendrix have been replaced by generic sound-alikes with different lyrics.

On February 11, 2014, StarVista/Time Life announced the upcoming DVD release of the complete series in the second half of the year, noting that it was &quot;painstakingly securing the rights for virtually every song.&quot; On June 11, packaging details for complete set were revealed. The packaging consists of a miniature school locker featuring a replica yearbook with signatures from cast members, behind-the-scenes photos, and classic show memorabilia. Also included are two notebooks similar to those carried by the two lead characters, each featuring detailed episode information, production photos, all 115 episodes, and over 15 hours of bonus features on 26 DVDs. Customized &quot;Wonder Years&quot; magnets are also included. On September 30, 2014, the complete series was released to those who ordered the set through mail order from Time Life/Star Vista. A box set for the first four seasons was also released. October 10, 2014, though, was considered the official release date.

On October 7, 2014, Star Vista released season one on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. Season two was released on February 3, 2015. Season three was released on May 26, 2015. Season four was released on January 12, 2016. Season five was released on May 24, 2016. Season six was released on September 27, 2016.

On October 6, 2015, Star Vista released &quot;The Wonder Years- The Complete Series: Collectors Box Set&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years- The Complete Series&quot; DVD collections in a wide general retail release.

On May 9, 2016, Fabulous Films released &quot;The Wonder Years - The Deluxe Edition&quot; on 26 DVDs in the UK. It was intended to be the first release to contain every episode in its original transmission presentation, although in the end this did not happen. The set includes over 23 hours of bonus material.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% with an average rating of 10.00/10 based on 9 reviews. On Metacritic, the series has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 9 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;My Father&#x27;s Office&quot; was ranked number 29 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time, and in the 2009 revised list, the pilot episode was ranked number 43.

==Book==
In 1990, the book &quot;The Wonder Years - Growing Up in the Sixties&quot; by Edward Gross was published by Pioneer Books (). It contains information about the creation and production of the show, interviews with cast and crew, and an extensive episode guide (up to the middle of the 4th season when the book was published).

==Remake==
In Colombia, the production company BE-TV made a version for Caracol Televisión also titled &quot;Los años maravillosos&quot; (&quot;The Wonder Years&quot;), set in the 1980s and with a Colombian cast. The series was a critical failure.

==Reboot==

On July 8, 2020, ABC announced that they were rebooting the series with film director, producer, and screenwriter Lee Daniels, longtime television writer and producer Saladin Patterson, and original series star Fred Savage as executive producers. Savage would also direct the pilot episode, and original series co-creator Neal Marlens will be a consultant on the project. The new series would once again take place in the late 1960s—but this time, it would focus on the life of a black middle-class family living in Montgomery, Alabama. In March 2021, it was announced that Don Cheadle would serve as the series narrator. In May 2021, ABC officially picked up the series. The series premiered on September 22, 2021.

A connection between the two series was established when in the Season 1 episode &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; aired April 13, 2022, Bruce Williams (Spence Moore II) reveals that while he was serving in the Vietnam War, his life was saved by Brian Cooper, Winnie&#x27;s brother, who died trying to save others.

<doc id="142898" wikidata="Q611626" url="?curid=142898" title="Grease (musical)">
<text>Grease is a musical, first staged in 1971, with music, lyrics, and a book by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers and set in 1959 at the fictional Rydell High School in Northwest Chicago (based on Taft High School in Chicago, Illinois, and named after rock singer Bobby Rydell), the musical follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics, personal core values, and love.

The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll. In its original production in Chicago, &quot;Grease&quot; was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions toned down the more risqué content. The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy, peer pressure, and gang violence; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion, sexual exploration during adolescence. Jacobs described the show&#x27;s basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema, since the female lead, who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character, is instead drawn into the man&#x27;s influence and transforms into his wild, roguish fantasy.

Since it was first performed on February 5, 1971, at Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago, &quot;Grease&quot; has been successful on both stage and screen, but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitués (the characters&#x27; Polish-American backgrounds in particular are ignored with last names often changed, although two Italian-American characters are left identifiably ethnic) and more generic. The first Broadway production opened on June 7, 1972; when it closed in 1980, &quot;Grease&quot;″s 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history, although it was surpassed by &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; on September 29, 1983. It went on to become a West End hit, a successful feature film, two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007, and a staple of regional theatre, summer stock, community theatre, and high school and middle school drama groups. It remains Broadway&#x27;s 17th longest-running show.

&quot;Grease&quot; was adapted in 1978 as a feature film, which starred John Travolta (who himself had been in stage productions in a different role) and British-Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-John, removed the musical&#x27;s Chicago urban setting, and changed some plot elements, characters, and songs while adding new songs and elaborating on some plot elements only alluded to in the musical. Some of these revisions have been incorporated into revivals of the musical. A used elements from both the original stage version and the film. A 1982 film sequel, &quot;Grease 2&quot;, included only a few supporting characters from the film and musical and had no involvement from Jacobs or Casey; Jacobs has gone on record to voice his disapproval of &quot;Grease 2&quot;.

==Production history==

===Original productions and Broadway===
The show&#x27;s original production was directed by Guy Barile, choreographed by Ronna Kaye and produced by the Kingston Mines Theatre Company founded by June Pyskacek on Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Avenue. The script was based on Jim Jacobs&#x27; experience at William Taft High School, Chicago. Warren Casey collaborated with Jim and together they wrote the music and lyrics. It ran for eight months. The cast: Doug Stevenson (Danny), Leslie Goto (Sandy), Sue Williams (Rizzo), Polly Pen (Patty), Gary Houston (Roger), Marilu Henner (Marty), James Canning (Doody), Hedda Lubin (Frenchy), Bruce Hickey (Kenickie), Sheila Ray Ceaser (Jan), Bill Cervetti (Miller), Jerry Bolnick (Sonny), Judy Brubaker (Miss Lynch), Mike O&#x27;Connor (Vince Fontaine), Steve Munro (Eugene), Barbara Munro (Cha Cha), Mac Hamilton (Teen Angel) and George Lopez (Bum). In addition to the &quot;R-rated&quot; profanity and deliberate use of shock value, the Chicago version of &quot;Grease&quot; included a substantially different songbook, which was shorter and included multiple references to real Chicago landmarks.

Producers Ken Waissman and Maxine Fox saw the show and made a deal to produce it Off-Broadway. The team headed to New York City to collaborate on the New York production of &quot;Grease&quot;. It was after test runs of the original Chicago production had drawn extremely poor reviews that the production team transformed &quot;Grease&quot; into its familiar form. The new production, directed by Tom Moore and choreographed by Patricia Birch (who later choreographed the film adaptation, and directed the ill-fated sequel), opened Off-Broadway at the Eden Theatre in lower Manhattan on February 14, 1972. Though &quot;Grease&quot; opened geographically off-Broadway, it did so under first class Broadway contracts. The show was deemed eligible for the 1972 Tony Awards, receiving seven Tony Award nominations.

On June 7, 1972, the production moved to the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway, and on November 21, it moved to the Royale Theatre there, where it ran until January 27, 1980. For the five final weeks of the run, the show moved to the larger Majestic Theatre. By the time it closed on April 13, 1980, it had run 3,388 performances.

The original Broadway cast included Barry Bostwick as Danny, Carole Demas as Sandy, Adrienne Barbeau as Rizzo, and Timothy Meyers as Kenickie, with Alan Paul, Walter Bobbie and Marya Small in supporting roles. Replacements later in the run included Jeff Conaway as Danny, Candice Earley as Sandy, John Lansing as Danny, Peter Gallagher as Danny, Richard Gere as Sonny, Ilene Graff as Sandy, Randee Heller as Rizzo, Marilu Henner as Marty, Judy Kaye as Rizzo, Marcia Mitzman Gaven as Rizzo, Patrick Swayze as Danny, John Travolta as Doody, Treat Williams as Danny, Laurie Graff as Frenchy, and Jerry Zaks as Kenickie.

===1973 London run and 1979 return engagement===
After an out-of-town tryout in Coventry, &quot;Grease&quot; made its London debut at the New London Theatre on June 26, 1973, with a cast that included Richard Gere as Danny, Stacey Gregg as Sandy, and Jacquie-Ann Carr as Rizzo. Later Paul Nicholas and Elaine Paige took over the leads. The production closed on February 14, 1974.

The show was revived at the Astoria Theatre from June 7 to September 22, 1979, with Michael Howe as Danny, Jacqueline Reddin as Sandy, and Hilary Labow as Rizzo. The company also included Tracey Ullman as Frenchy and Su Pollard as Cha-Cha.

===1993 London revival===
The revival opened at the Dominion Theatre before transferring to the Cambridge Theatre in October 1996, where it ran until September 11, 1999. Directed by David Gilmore and produced by Robert Stigwood (who had also produced the film), the opening cast included Craig McLachlan (Danny); Debbie Gibson (Sandy — Sonia, then Samantha Janus later replaced Gibson as Sandy); Mike Doyle (Vince Fontaine); Tamzin Outhwaite (Patty); Shane Ritchie (Kenickie) and Sally Ann Triplett (Rizzo). (&quot;Variety&quot;, Review Abroad Grease, August 2–August 8, 1993) McLachlan was succeeded by Shane Richie, Luke Goss, Ian Kelsey and Darren Day. The production&#x27;s success led to the first British national tour which featured Shane Ritchie as Danny, Helen Way as Sandy, Toby Hinson as Vince Fontaine/Teen Angel, Ben Richards/Alex Bourne as Kenickie and Michele Hooper as Rizzo. The score included four songs written for the film adaptation: &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, and the title number. As in the film, the Burger Palace Boys&#x27; were renamed the T-Birds for this revival.

===1994 Broadway revival and U.S. tour===
After 20 previews, a Broadway revival directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun premiered on May 11, 1994, at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre, where it ran for 1,505 performances. The opening cast included Ricky Paull Goldin (Danny), Susan Wood (Sandy), Rosie O&#x27;Donnell (Rizzo), Sam Harris (Doody), Hunter Foster (Roger), Megan Mullally (Marty), and Billy Porter (Teen Angel). The production set a new standard for star replacements, casting celebrities from different entertainment sectors for limited engagements. Some of these notable performers were Linda Blair, Debby Boone, Chubby Checker, Dominique Dawes, Micky Dolenz, Sheena Easton, Debbie Gibson, Jasmine Guy, Al Jarreau, Lucy Lawless, Darlene Love, Maureen McCormick, Joe Piscopo, Mackenzie Phillips, Jon Secada, and Brooke Shields. Shields proved so popular in the role of Rizzo that the cast album was re-released with her voice substituting for O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s.

A U.S. national tour of the 1994 production started in September 1994 in New Haven, Connecticut, and ran for several years. The opening tour cast included Sally Struthers (Miss Lynch), who stayed with the tour for several years, Angela Pupello (Rizzo), Rex Smith (Danny), Trisha M. Gorman (Sandy), and Davy Jones (Vince Fontaine). Brooke Shields (Rizzo) started on the tour in November 1994 before joining the Broadway cast.

Callahan (Vince Fontaine).

===2007 Broadway and London revivals and UK tours===
A second Broadway revival, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, began previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on July 24, 2007, and opened on August 19, 2007. Max Crumm and Laura Osnes were selected to portray Danny and Sandy via viewer votes cast during the run of the NBC reality series &quot;&quot;. The original score includes four songs written for the film adaptation: &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;, &quot;Sandy&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, and the title number. The Burger Palace Boys&#x27; name is the T-Birds in this revival. The production ended on January 4, 2009, after 31 previews and 554 performances. At the announcement of its closure, the producers revealed that the production recouped its entire investment during its 52nd playing week.

A West End revival opened at the Piccadilly Theatre, London on August 8, 2007, and ran for nearly four years (the longest running show in the Piccadilly Theatre&#x27;s history). The leads were similarly cast via ITV&#x27;s &quot;Grease Is the Word&quot;, with Danny Bayne and Susan McFadden playing Danny and Sandy. The production closed on April 30, 2011, after over 1,300 performances with a U.K. tour to begin on May 6, 2011, in Edinburgh.

A further UK and Ireland tour of Grease was scheduled to commence from Curve, Leicester, on 30 July 2021. This production will star Peter Andre as Teen Angel and Vince Fontaine. The production will be directed by Nikolai Foster and choreographed by Arlene Phillips. It is unknown if this tour went to production or not, as it was repeatedly rescheduled from earlier 2021 dates as well as its originally scheduled tour in 2020, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===2008 U.S. tour===
A U.S. national tour began on December 2, 2008, in Providence, Rhode Island, and closed on May 23, 2010, at the Palace Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio.

Returned to Chicago&quot;. It featured songs and scenes from drafts of both the original Chicago and Broadway productions. Unlike the school version, this version reinstated the raunchiness of the original show and references to Chicago locations. The sixth Burger Palace Boy was restored and named Miller. The Chicago production of &quot;The Original Grease&quot; opened on May 2 and closed on August 21. This version was presented once more in Australia in 2016 from April 6 to May 7. In Chicago, Adrian Aguilar played Danny and Kelly Davis Wilson played Sandy.

A third revival opened on September 28, 2017 at Théâtre Mogador in Paris. It is the first production completely in French, the previous ones were in French with English songs. Despite originally being billed as a limited engagement, it was extended to July 8, 2018 following its success.

An Australian revival opened at Brisbane&#x27;s Lyric Theatre on August 27, 2013, before heading on an Australian tour. The cast included Rob Mills as Danny, Gretel Scarlett as Sandy, Anthony Callea as Johnny Casino, Stephen Mahy as Kenickie, Lucy Maunder as Rizzo, Todd McKenney as Teen Angel, and Bert Newton as Vince Fontaine.

In 2016 a 90-minute version of the show premiered on Royal Caribbeans Harmony of the Seas in May and Independence of the Seas in July.

A June 2022 Australian production, directed by Drew Anthony and choreographed by Jamie and Susie Rolton, was staged at Perth&#x27;s Royale Theatre, with John Berry as Danny, Elaina O&#x27;Connor as Sandy, Peter Cumins as Teen Angel, Blake Williams as Vince Fontaine and Lucy Williamson as Miss Lynch.

A 2023-24 Australian tour production, directed by Luke Joslin and choreographed by Eric Giancola was announced in May 2023. The principal cast was later revealed in June 2023 with Patti Newton as Miss Lynch, Marcia Hines as Teen Angel, Jay Laga’aia as Vince Fontaine, Annelise Hall as Sandy and Joseph Spanti as Danny Zuko.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The Robert Stigwood Organization adapted &quot;Grease&quot; into a 1978 feature film, directed by Randal Kleiser. John Travolta, who had played Doody on Broadway and the national tour, performed as lead Danny Zuko, while Olivia Newton-John, an English Australian country-pop singer, was cast as Sandy; to accommodate the casting move, the character was rewritten as Australian immigrant Sandy Olsson (named after the maiden name of Ann-Margret, who was briefly considered for the role in the film), and parts of the score were replaced. Substantial portions of the script — which included replaced or reduced supporting character roles and added on-screen roles for characters unseen in the stage version — were written in by Bronte Woodard.

&quot;Grease&quot; was a major success both for Stigwood and for Paramount Pictures, the latter of which re-released the film several times; the made international hits out of several of the songs. Paramount also produced a sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot; in 1982, which featured a younger class of students at Rydell High School led by Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer. &quot;Grease 2&quot; was both a financial disappointment and a critical failure that Jim Jacobs disowned after its release. In the 2010s, work began on expanding the &quot;Grease&quot; brand into a full-fledged media franchise, with two prequels in production, &quot;Summer Lovin&#x27; &quot; (a film focusing on Danny and Sandy&#x27;s summer before the events of the original &quot;Grease&quot;) and &quot;Rise of the Pink Ladies&quot; (a television series documenting the ascent of the Pink Ladies clique).

===Television production===

On January 31, 2016, in the wake of similar productions that NBC had performed for other musicals, Fox broadcast a live production of &quot;Grease&quot;, known as &quot;&quot;, as a television special starring Julianne Hough, Aaron Tveit, Vanessa Hudgens and Jordan Fisher.

==Synopsis==
Because of changes to the musical that have been made since the 1978 film adaptation, several variants exist. In the event two songs are listed at any given point, the first is from the 1972 Off-Broadway version, and the second is from revivals that use the film music, such as the 2007 version.

===Act I===
At revivals that use the 1978 song &quot;Grease&quot;, it is typically inserted at or near the beginning of the show.

At the Rydell High Class of 1959 reunion (&quot;Alma Mater&quot;), old maid English teacher Miss Lynch introduces former cheerleader/yearbook-editor Patty Simcox Honeywell and class valedictorian Eugene Florczyk. Eugene gives a rousing speech, mentioning that the alumni who are missing from the reunion are surely present in spirit. The scene segues to bring in the greaser gang known as the Burger Palace Boys (known in later versions as the &quot;T-Birds&quot;) and their auxiliary, the &quot;Pink Ladies&quot;, as they sing a cruder version of the Rydell &quot;alma mater&quot; (&quot;Alma Mater (Parody)&quot;).

Flashing back to the first day of high school in fall 1958, the Pink Ladies sit in the lunchroom, and the Burger Palace Boys sit at the entrance to the school. One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy, introduces her new neighbor Sandy Dumbrowski, who had been unjustly rejected from a Catholic school, to the others (Marty, Jan and Rizzo), as well as Patty. Sandy tells of how she had a brief love affair the summer before, which ended with unresolved love. Meanwhile, womanizing greaser Danny Zuko is telling the Burger Palace Boys (Kenickie, Roger, Doody and Sonny) the story of his own summer fling (&quot;Summer Nights&quot;). The Pink Ladies soon after realize that Sandy&#x27;s summer fling was the same Danny Zuko that attends Rydell High and arrange for the two to bump into each other at school; the resulting meeting is tense and awkward, as Danny had previously told Sandy that he attended a private academy and does not want to admit to the Burger Palace Boys that she was the woman he was talking about. As the Burger Palace Boys leave, Sandy is hurt and angry, but the Pink Ladies cheer her up, by inviting her over to Marty&#x27;s pajama party.

Shortly afterwards, the teenagers gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar and performs a song (&quot;Those Magic Changes&quot;).

At Marty&#x27;s pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, pierce their ears and talk about boys. The sheltered Sandy goes into shock and falls ill from seeing blood when the Pink Ladies try to pierce her ears, leading them to mock her when she&#x27;s not in the room (in some revivals, the song &quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m Sandra Dee&quot; is placed here, mirroring the film). Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a Marine named Freddy and it is implied that she maintains it only because of the lavish gifts he sends her from Japan (&quot;Freddy, My Love&quot;).

That same night, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps, unaware that the hubcaps are on Kenickie&#x27;s car, Greased Lightnin&#x27;. Unfazed by the others&#x27; skepticism, Kenickie sings of the upgrades needed to make the car a racing-worthy (&quot;Greased Lightnin&#x27;&quot;).

Danny sees Sandy again at her cheerleader practice, and tries to apologize for his behavior. Patty interrupts and flirts with Danny. Patty informs Danny that track try-outs are nearing, and Danny tells Sandy that he will join the track team to prove himself; he leaves as Patty and Sandy practice cheering (&quot;Rydell Fight Song&quot;).

As the Burger Palace Boys and Pink Ladies gather at the park, Danny reveals to the rest of the greasers that he has joined the track team, much to their dismay and skepticism. After Roger and Jan bicker about food, drink and religion, she asks him how he earned the nickname Rump; he explains that, as &quot;King of the Mooners&quot;, he has a hobby of baring his backside to unsuspecting victims, and in the process, both reveal their affections for each other (&quot;Mooning&quot;). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage &quot;ingénue&quot;, Sandra Dee, and the other greasers join in as she makes fun of Sandy, who has not arrived at the picnic yet (&quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m Sandra Dee&quot;).

Sandy, working on a biology assignment with Eugene, comes in just as the greasers finish making fun of her. She attacks Rizzo in a fit of rage and erroneously assumes Danny is the one behind the mockery. Furious, she tells Danny that she wishes she never met him and storms out of the picnic. Danny shrugs off Sandy&#x27;s negative response, and the greasers pair off for the upcoming sock hop. Danny teases Marty for not having a date (recommending Eugene), and the greasers all laugh (&quot;We Go Together&quot;).

For revivals that use &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot;, the exact placement varies. It sometimes replaces the first rendition of &quot;We Go Together&quot; and in other examples, such as the 2007 revival, it is placed early in Act II.

===Act II===
The night of the sock hop arrives (&quot;Shakin&#x27; At the High School Hop&quot;). Sandy is at home by herself, listening to the radio and crying over how much she misses Danny (&quot;It&#x27;s Raining on Prom Night&quot;).

Meanwhile, Kenickie comes into the dance with his date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, a girl from Saint Bernadette&#x27;s Academy. Patty tries to pair up with Danny, trash-talking Sandy&#x27;s cheerleading skills in the process, but is unable to get out of her promise to dance with Eugene despite Rizzo trying to seduce Eugene as a distraction. Kenickie ends up paired off with Rizzo, and Danny with Cha-Cha. The MC Vince Fontaine, a radio disc jockey, begins the hand jive dance contest, and everyone eagerly participates as he tags the contestants out (&quot;Born to Hand Jive&quot;). In the end, Danny and Cha-Cha are the winners. Amongst the awards given to the couple, Danny receives two free drive-in movie tickets.

Sometime later outside of the Burger Palace hangout, Kenickie, Doody, and Sonny run into Frenchy. The boys are armed with an &quot;arsenal&quot; of household items and reveal that, to their surprise, Cha-Cha was the girlfriend of someone in the boys&#x27; rival gang, the Flaming Dukes; the Dukes, hearing of Cha-Cha&#x27;s dancing with the Burger Palace Boys, challenged the boys to a rumble. Danny sprints into the scene wearing his track suit, to the disbelief of the other boys. Danny tells the boys he cannot partake in the rumble because of a track meet and sprints off.

The three remaining boys go into the Burger Palace for a snack before the fight, and Frenchy laments at what to do with her life, having dropped out of beauty school in frustration at failing all of her classes. The heavenly Teen Angel appears with a chorus of back-up singing angels and tells her to return to high school (&quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot;).

The three boys exit the Burger Palace, bemoaning Danny&#x27;s betrayal while only halfheartedly noticing Roger is unaccounted for. They wait for the Flaming Dukes, but the rival gang never turns up. Roger finally turns up with only a broken antenna as a weapon; in response, the other three proceed to strip Roger of his pants and shoes.

At the drive-in, Danny tries to make up for his behavior and offers Sandy his class ring. She initially is thrilled, but pulls back and exits the car when he tries to move beyond a kiss. Danny laments his loneliness (&quot;Alone at a Drive-In Movie&quot; or &quot;Sandy&quot;).

Several days later, Sandy and the greasers — without Danny — are gathered in Jan&#x27;s basement (&quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Party Queen&quot;). Rizzo, who missed her period, fears she is pregnant and tells Marty (who herself laments that Vince tried to spike her drink at the dance) that the father is a stranger who had sex with her with a cheap, broken condom; word gets back to everyone else. The boys offer support as they leave; Rizzo rejects it, which leads Sandy to ask her why and concludes that Kenickie is the presumed father. Rizzo responds by saying that she is a better person than others make her out to be and that showing weakness is the worst thing she knows (&quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot;). Rizzo leaves, and Sandy decides what she needs to do to fit in with the greasers (&quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m Sandra Dee&quot; (Reprise)).

The next day, the boys are hanging out at the Burger Palace. A dejected Patty reveals Danny, who follows her in, has reverted to his old ways and quit the track team. Sandy comes in alongside the Pink Ladies, having transformed herself from an innocent schoolgirl into a greaser&#x27;s fantasy, punching out a dismayed Patty. Danny is delighted at this change and the couple express their mutual feelings for each other (&quot;All Choked Up&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;).

Afterwards, the greasers prepare to head to Roger&#x27;s to watch &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, inviting Patty along. Frenchy takes a job as a makeup saleswoman at Woolworth&#x27;s, Rizzo reveals that she is not pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily, and the Burger Palace Boys, the Pink Ladies, Sandy, and Patty sing about how they will always be friends to the end (&quot;We Go Together&quot; (Reprise)).

===Revival changes===

Due to the popularity of the 1978 film adaptation, which made several changes to the musical&#x27;s songs and themes (many to accommodate its casting choice for singer Olivia Newton-John as Sandy), the subsequent revivals adopted several of the changes made in the film, particularly the replacement of several songs, Sandy is portrayed with blonde hair instead of the original brunette, and the renaming of the Burger Palace Boys to their film name, the T-Birds. However, in the revival, the role of Sandy Dumbrowski is not changed from the original Broadway production.

===School version===
In order to make the original musical suitable for young performers and audiences, Jim Jacobs decided to write a &quot;school version&quot; of the musical. This edition eliminates all of the references to cigarettes and alcohol, and also any swearing or bad language. Most of the songs have also undergone changes as well; the numbers are all shortened greatly and edited for content/language. Some plot lines are missing from the school version, such as Rizzo&#x27;s pregnancy and her song &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do.&quot; This section is entirely cut from the script and score. The beginning of the pajama party in Marty&#x27;s bedroom is also cut. (In this version, the Pink Ladies do not offer Sandy cigarettes or wine. Instead it begins directly with piercing her ears.) Overall, this version is considered to be G-rated.

In addition to the removal of &quot;There Are Worse Things I Could Do&quot;, the following songs of the School Version have undergone lyric changes:
* &quot;Alma Mater Parody&quot;
* &quot;Summer Nights&quot;
* &quot;Freddy, My Love&quot;
* &quot;Greased Lightnin&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;Look at Me, I&#x27;m Sandra Dee&quot;
* &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot;

The remainder of the songs have been greatly edited for time, deleting several verses from the original songs.

A version of the play is available that keeps some of the adult references and innuendo but excises some of the more explicit lyrics.

==Cast and characters==
* Danny Zuko: A smooth greaser from Chicago and successful womanizer, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Burger Palace Boys has his life upended when he falls for a strait-laced square during his summer vacation leading into senior year. Danny was based upon Tom Meyer, Jacobs&#x27;s cousin.
* Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; Dombrowski: An ingénue when she moves into the neighborhood, she experiences severe culture shock as she learns her summer boyfriend&#x27;s true nature but eventually transforms into Danny&#x27;s fantasy dame after she is unable to resist her continued attraction to him. Renamed with surname Olsson for the film and Young for the 2016 TV production. Sandy was based upon Meyer&#x27;s high school girlfriend, Jeanie Kozemczak. Jacobs noted that Meyer and Kozemczak broke up after high school and that Meyer never fully got over her, while Kozemczak eventually married another man.
* Betty Rizzo: Described by Jim Jacobs as a &quot;tough little Italian&quot;, Rizzo is the cynical leader of the Pink Ladies and a strong alpha female who embraces the low culture and refuses to show her feelings. While she is condescending toward almost everyone, she and Danny have a particularly longstanding hostility toward each other, and she openly mocks Sandy in song.
* Kenickie: A hard-nosed tough guy, Kenickie has great pride in his investment, a used car he has named &quot;Greased Lightning&quot;. He has a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with Rizzo and is often at odds with Roger. Kenickie is given a larger role in the film as Danny&#x27;s best friend. He was named Miller in the original Chicago production.
*Doody: A member of the Burger Palace Boys, Doody has some childlike mannerisms and is shown to have great difficulty when approaching his crush, Frenchy, or handling tense situations. He fantasizes about being a great rock-and-roll guitarist. Doody was one of two characters based upon Jacobs himself, representing his more innocent side.
* Roger &quot;Rump&quot;: A sardonic yet very self-confident Burger Palace Boy who is easily able to win over Jan and willing to go into a rumble with only a whip antenna as a weapon. He is frequently seen eating fast food and earned his nickname because he was a proficient mooner. He is stated to be a Roman Catholic. Roger is the other character Jacobs based upon himself, representing his more confident side. Rump does not appear in the film or television versions. Putzie, a non-singing character, appears in Rump&#x27;s stead (though ostensibly sharing the legal first name Roger), and his songs are included on , performed by Louis St. Louis.
* Dominic &quot;Sonny&quot; LaTierri: The only member of the Burger Palace Boys without a musical number, Sonny is a character who imagines himself a Casanova, but most high-school girls find him repulsive. He is also quite cowardly, wilting in the face of any criticism.
* Miller: The sixth member of the Burger Palace Boys, he appeared in the original 1971 production but was cut before the show opened on Broadway. He was named Kenickie in the original Chicago production. Though he did not appear in any subsequent productions, he appeared in &quot;The Original Grease&quot;.
* Frenchy: A member of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy is the first person (other than Danny) to meet Sandy, and the two quickly become friends. She claims to have earned her nickname from being able to &quot;French inhale&quot; a cigarette. She is a very poor student with aspirations of becoming a beautician, but she is equally inept when she drops out to attend beauty school.
*Marty: Given the surname &quot;Maraschino&quot; in the film, Marty is a seasoned member of the Pink Ladies, with much experience in wine, men and cigarettes, and is bigoted against the Japanese and Polish. In Act One, she is said to be engaged to an overseas Marine, mainly because of the expensive gifts she receives by maintaining the relationship. In Act Two, she has a brief fling with DJ Vince Fontaine, and by the end she succumbs to Sonny&#x27;s advances.
* Jan: A member of the Pink Ladies, Jan is a quirky Lutheran who has a voracious appetite and has moments of extreme bluntness. Jamie Donnelly, who played Jan in the film, described her as not being as cool as the other Pink Ladies. She and Roger develop a relationship over the course of the musical, but the two frequently bicker.
* Miss Lynch: A spinster English teacher and stereotypical disciplinarian. Her character role would be rewritten as Principal McGee for screen adaptions.
* Eugene Florczyk: The class valedictorian is usually portrayed as an awkward nerd. He goes on to become a marketing executive after high school. Renamed Felsnick for the film.
* Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Simcox: A high-achieving cheerleader who befriends Sandy early in the show. Patty holds her own attractions to Danny and is especially drawn to him when he tries to change to please Sandy. Other than Rizzo (who at first treats her with contempt), the greasers are amicable with her, while acknowledging their different social cliques. At the beginning of the play, it is noted that she has since gone on to marry a Mr. Honeywell and have a successful career.
* Charlene &quot;Cha-Cha&quot; DiGregorio: a beastly girl who appears at the school dance as Kenickie&#x27;s date, later ends up dancing with Danny, and is ultimately revealed as the girlfriend of a rival greaser gang member.
* Vince Fontaine: the smooth-talking 19-year-old disc jockey and Rydell High alumnus whose voice-overs serve as continuity for the musical. He appears on-stage during the school dance and serves as an on-air host at WAXX, the local top-40 radio station.
* Johnny Casino and the Gamblers: a low-rent rock and roll band that plays at the school dance.
* Teen Angel: Frenchy&#x27;s guardian angel who has blunt advice for his subject.

A number of characters in the musical are not seen: Freddy Strulka, Marty&#x27;s boyfriend and a member of the United States Marine Corps who showers Marty with lavish gifts from Japan; the coach of the track team; the Flaming Dukes, an adversary of the Burger Palace Boys who never show up to a threatened rumble; and Mr. Drucker, a perverted economics teacher who has made passes at the Pink Ladies. In the film, the Flaming Dukes are renamed the Scorpions and have an on-screen role, as does the track coach (who is surnamed Calhoun and is portrayed by Sid Caesar).

<text>This list of museums in [[Northern Ireland]] contains museums which are defined for this context as institutions (including nonprofit organizations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Also included are non-profit art galleries, university art galleries and interpretive centres linked to sites of interest. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not included. Many other small historical displays are located in the country&#x27;s stately homes, including those run by the National Trust.

<text>Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp&#x27;s ridley, and olive ridley.
Six of the seven sea turtle species, all but the flatback, are present in U.S. waters, and are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. All but the flatback turtle are listed as threatened with extinction globally on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The flatback turtle is found only in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia. 

Sea turtles can be categorized as hard-shelled (cheloniid) or leathery-shelled (dermochelyid). The only dermochelyid species of sea turtle is the leatherback.

== Description ==

For each of the seven species of sea turtles, females and males are the same size. As adults, it is possible to tell male turtles from female turtles by their long tails with a cloacal opening near the tip. Adult female sea turtles have shorter tails, with a cloacal opening near the base. Hatchling and sub-adult turtles do not exhibit sexual dimorphism; it is not possible to determine their sex by looking at them.

In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises. However, the streamlined body plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.

The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, reaching 1.4 to more than 1.8 m (4.6 to 5.9 ft) in length and weighing between 300 and 640 kg (661 to 1,411 lbs). Other sea turtle species are smaller, ranging from as little as 60 cm (2 ft) long in the case of the Kemp&#x27;s ridley, which is the smallest sea turtle species, to 120 cm (3.9 ft) long in the case of the green turtle, the second largest.

The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions that are enclosed in bone. Although this condition appears to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil reptiles (anapsids), it is possible it is a more recently evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the anapsids.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Sea turtles, along with other turtles and tortoises, are part of the order Testudines. All species except the leatherback sea turtle are in the family Cheloniidae. The superfamily name Chelonioidea and family name Cheloniidae are based on the Ancient Greek word for tortoise: (&quot;&quot;). The leatherback sea turtle is the only extant member of the family Dermochelyidae.

Fossil evidence of marine turtles goes back to the Late Jurassic (150 million years ago) with genera such as &quot;Plesiochelys&quot;, from Europe. In Africa, the first marine turtle is &quot;Angolachelys&quot;, from the Turonian of Angola. A lineage of unrelated marine testudines, the pleurodire (side-necked) bothremydids, also survived well into the Cenozoic. Other pleurodires are also thought to have lived at sea, such as &quot;Araripemys&quot; and extinct pelomedusids. Modern sea turtles are not descended from more than one of the groups of sea-going turtles that have existed in the past; they instead constitute a single radiation that became distinct from all other turtles at least 110 million years ago. Their closest extant relatives are in fact the snapping turtles (Chelydridae), musk turtles (Kinosternidae), and hickatee (Dermatemyidae) of the Americas, which alongside the sea turtles constitute the clade Americhelydia. 

The oldest possible representative of the lineage (Panchelonioidea) leading to modern sea turtles was possibly &quot;Desmatochelys padillai&quot; from the Early Cretaceous. &quot;Desmatochelys&quot; was a protostegid, a lineage that would later give rise to some very large species but went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. Presently thought to be outside the crown group that contains modern sea turtles (Chelonioidea), the exact relationships of protostegids to modern sea turtles are still debated due to their primitive morphology; they may be the sister group to the Chelonoidea, or an unrelated turtle lineage that convergently evolved similar adaptations. The earliest &quot;true&quot; sea turtle that is known from fossils is &quot;Nichollsemys&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of Canada. In 2022, the giant fossil species &quot;Leviathanochelys&quot; was described from Spain. This species inhabited the oceans covering Europe in the Late Cretaceous and rivaled the concurrent giant protostegids such as &quot;Archelon&quot; and &quot;Protostega&quot; as one of the largest turtles to ever exist. Unlike the protostegids, which have an uncertain relationship to modern sea turtles, &quot;Leviathanochelys&quot; is thought to be a true sea turtle of the superfamily Chelonioidea.

Sea turtles&#x27; limbs and brains have evolved to adapt to their diets. Their limbs originally evolved for locomotion, but more recently evolved to aid them in feeding. They use their limbs to hold, swipe, and forage their food. This helps them eat more efficiently.

=== Cladogram ===
Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relationships of living and extinct sea turtles in the Chelonioidea based on Evers et al. (2019):
An alternate phylogeny was proposed by Castillo-Visa &quot;et al.&quot; (2022):

== Distribution and habitat ==
Sea turtles can be found in all oceans except for the polar regions. The flatback sea turtle is found solely on the northern coast of Australia. The Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle is found solely in the Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast of the United States.

Sea turtles are generally found in the waters over continental shelves. During the first three to five years of life, sea turtles spend most of their time in the pelagic zone floating in seaweed mats. Green sea turtles in particular are often found in &quot;Sargassum&quot; mats, in which they find food, and water. Once the sea turtle has reached adulthood it moves closer to the shore. Females will come ashore to lay their eggs on sandy beaches during the nesting season.

Sea turtles migrate to reach their spawning beaches, which are limited in numbers. Living in the ocean therefore means they usually migrate over large distances. All sea turtles have large body sizes, which is helpful for moving large distances. Large body sizes also offer good protection against the large predators (notably sharks) found in the ocean.

In 2020, diminished human activity resulting from the COVID-19 virus caused an increase in sea turtle nesting. Some areas in Thailand saw an abnormally high number of nests, and Florida experienced a similar phenomenon. Less plastic and light pollution could explain these observations.

==Life cycle==

Sea turtles are thought to reach sexual maturity from about 10−20 years old depending on species and methodology. However, reliable estimates are difficult to ascertain. Mature sea turtles may migrate thousands of miles to reach breeding sites. After mating at sea, adult female sea turtles return to land to lay their eggs. Different species of sea turtles exhibit various levels of philopatry. In the extreme case, females return to the same beach where they hatched. This can take place every two to four years in maturity.

The mature nesting female hauls herself onto the beach, nearly always at night, and finds suitable sand in which to create a nest. Using her hind flippers, she digs a circular hole deep. After the hole is dug, the female then starts filling the nest with her clutch of soft-shelled eggs. Depending on the species, a typical clutch may contain 50–350 eggs. After laying, she re-fills the nest with sand, re-sculpting and smoothing the surface, and then camouflaging the nest with vegetation until it is relatively undetectable visually. She may also dig decoy nests. The whole process takes 30 to 60 minutes. She then returns to the ocean, leaving the eggs untended.

Females may lay 1–8 clutches in a single season. Female sea turtles alternate between mating in the water and laying their eggs on land. Most sea turtle species nest individually. But ridley sea turtles come ashore en masse, known as an &quot;arribada&quot; (arrival). With the Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle this occurs during the day.

Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination. Warmer temperatures produce female hatchlings, while cooler temperatures produce male hatchlings. The eggs will incubate for 50–60 days. The eggs in one nest hatch together over a short period of time. The baby sea turtles break free of the egg shell, dig through the sand, and crawl into the sea. Most species of sea turtles hatch at night. However, the Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle commonly hatches during the day. Sea turtle nests that hatch during the day are more vulnerable to predators, and may encounter more human activity on the beach.
Larger hatchlings have a higher probability of survival than smaller individuals, which can be explained by the fact that larger offspring are faster and thus less exposed to predation. Predators can only functionally intake so much; larger individuals are not targeted as often. A study conducted on this topic shows that body size is positively correlated with speed, so larger baby sea turtles are exposed to predators for a shorter amount of time. The fact that there is size dependent predation on chelonians has led to the evolutionary development of large body sizes.

In 1987, Carr discovered that the young of green and loggerhead sea turtles spent a great deal of their pelagic lives in floating sargassum mats. Within these mats, they found ample shelter and food. In the absence of sargassum, young sea turtles feed in the vicinity of upwelling &quot;fronts&quot;. In 2007, Reich determined that green sea turtle hatchlings spend the first three to five years of their lives in pelagic waters. In the open ocean, pre-juveniles of this particular species were found to feed on zooplankton and smaller nekton before they are recruited into inshore seagrass meadows as obligate herbivores.

== Physiology ==

===Osmoregulation===

Sea turtles maintain an internal environment that is hypotonic to the ocean. To maintain hypotonicity they must excrete excess salt ions. Like other marine reptiles, sea turtles rely on a specialized gland to rid the body of excess salt, because reptilian kidneys cannot produce urine with a higher ion concentration than sea water. All species of sea turtles have a lachrymal gland in the orbital cavity, capable of producing tears with a higher salt concentration than sea water.

Leatherback sea turtles face an increased osmotic challenge compared to other species of sea turtle, since their primary prey are jellyfish and other gelatinous plankton, whose fluids have the same concentration of salts as sea water. The much larger lachrymal gland found in leatherback sea turtles may have evolved to cope with the higher intake of salts from their prey. A constant output of concentrated salty tears may be required to balance the input of salts from regular feeding, even considering leatherback sea turtle tears can have a salt ion concentration almost twice that of other species of sea turtle.
Hatchlings depend on drinking sea water immediately upon entering the ocean to replenish water lost during the hatching process. Salt gland functioning begins quickly after hatching, so that the young sea turtles can establish ion and water balance soon after entering the ocean. Survival and physiological performance hinge on immediate and efficient hydration following emergence from the nest.

=== Thermoregulation ===
All sea turtles are poikilotherms. However, leatherback sea turtles (family Dermochelyidae) are able to maintain a body temperature warmer than the ambient water by thermoregulation through the trait of gigantothermy.

Green sea turtles in the relatively cooler Pacific are known to haul themselves out of the water on remote islands to bask in the sun. This behavior has only been observed in a few locations, including the Galapagos, Hawaii, Europa Island, and parts of Australia. 

=== Diving physiology ===

Sea turtles are air-breathing reptiles that have lungs, so they regularly surface to breathe. Sea turtles spend a majority of their time underwater, so they must be able to hold their breath for long periods. Dive duration largely depends on activity. A foraging sea turtle may typically spend 5–40 minutes underwater while a sleeping sea turtle can remain underwater for 4–7 hours. Remarkably, sea turtle respiration remains aerobic for the vast majority of voluntary dive time. When a sea turtle is forcibly submerged (e.g. entangled in a trawl net) its diving endurance is substantially reduced, so it is more susceptible to drowning.

When surfacing to breathe, a sea turtle can quickly refill its lungs with a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation. Their large lungs permit rapid exchange of oxygen and avoid trapping gases during deep dives.

Cold-stunning is a phenomenon that occurs when sea turtles enter cold ocean water (), which causes the turtles to float to the surface and therefore makes it impossible for them to swim.

===Fluorescence===

Gruber and Sparks (2015) have observed the first fluorescence in a marine tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrates). Sea turtles are the first biofluorescent reptile found in the wild.

According to Gruber and Sparks (2015), fluorescence is observed in an increasing number of marine creatures (cnidarians, ctenophores, annelids, arthropods, and chordates) and is now also considered to be widespread in cartilaginous and ray-finned fishes.

The two marine biologists accidentally made the observation in the Solomon Islands on a hawksbill sea turtle, one of the rarest and most endangered sea turtle species in the ocean, during a night dive aimed to film the biofluorescence emitted by small sharks and coral reefs. The role of biofluorescence in marine organisms is often attributed to a strategy for attracting prey or perhaps a way to communicate. It could also serve as a way of defense or camouflage for the sea turtle hiding during night amongst other fluorescent organisms like corals. Fluorescent corals and sea creatures are best observed during night dives with a blue LED light and with a camera equipped with an orange optical filter to capture only the fluorescence light.

=== Sensory modalities ===

==== Navigation ====

Below the surface, the sensory cues available for navigation change dramatically. Light availability decreases quickly with depth, and is refracted by the movement of water when present, celestial cues are often obscured, and ocean currents cause continuous drift. Most sea turtle species migrate over significant distances to nesting or foraging grounds, some even crossing entire ocean basins. Passive drifting within major current systems, such as those in the North Atlantic Gyre, can result in ejection well outside of the temperature tolerance range of a given species, causing heat stress, hypothermia, or death. In order to reliably navigate within strong gyre currents in the open ocean, migrating sea turtles possess both a bicoordinate magnetic map and magnetic compass sense, using a form of navigation termed Magnetoreception. Specific migratory routes have been shown to vary between individuals, making the possession of both a magnetic map and compass sense advantageous for sea turtles.

A bicoordinate magnetic map gives sea turtles the ability to determine their position relative to a goal with both latitudinal and longitudinal information, and requires the detection and interpretation of more than one magnetic parameter going in opposite directions to generate, such as Magnetic field intensity and Inclination angle. A magnetic compass sense allows sea turtles to determine and maintain a specific magnetic heading or orientation. These magnetic senses are thought to be inherited, as hatchling sea turtles swim in directions that would keep them on course when exposed to the magnetic field signatures of various locations along their species&#x27; migratory routes.

Natal homing behavior is well described in sea turtles, and genetic testing of turtle populations at different nesting sites has shown that magnetic field is a more reliable indicator of genetic similarity than physical distance between sites. Additionally, nesting sites have been recorded to &quot;drift&quot; along with isoline shifts in the magnetic field. Magnetoreception is thought to be the primary navigation tool used by nesting sea turtles in returning to natal beaches. There are three major theories explaining natal site learning: inherited magnetic information, socially facilitated migration, and geomagnetic imprinting. Some support has been found for geomagnetic imprinting, including successful experiments transplanting populations of sea turtles by relocating them prior to hatching, but the exact mechanism is still not known.

== Ecology ==

=== Diet ===
The loggerhead, Kemp&#x27;s ridley, olive ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles are omnivorous their entire life. Omnivorous turtles may eat a wide variety of plant and animal life including decapods, seagrasses, seaweed, sponges, mollusks, cnidarians, Echinoderms, worms and fish. However, some species specialize on certain prey.

The diet of green sea turtles changes with age. Juveniles are omnivorous, but as they mature they become exclusively herbivorous. This diet shift has an effect on the green sea turtle&#x27;s morphology. Green sea turtles have a serrated jaw that is used to eat sea grass and algae.

Leatherback sea turtles feed almost exclusively on jellyfish and help control jellyfish populations.

Hawksbill sea turtles principally eat sponges, which constitute 70–95% of their diets in the Caribbean.

=== Larynx mechanisms ===
There was little information regarding the sea turtle&#x27;s larynx. Sea turtles, like other turtle species, lack an epiglottis to cover the larynx entrance. Key findings from an experiment reveal the following in regards to the larynx morphology: a close apposition between the linguolaryngeal cleft&#x27;s smooth mucosal walls and the laryngeal folds, a dorsal part of the glottis, the glottal mucosa attached to the arytenoid cartilage, and the way the hyoid sling is arranged and the relationship between the compressor laryngis muscle and cricoid cartilage. The glottal opening and closing mechanisms have been examined. During the opening stage, two abductor artytenoideae muscles swing arytenoid cartilages and the glottis walls. As a result, the glottis profile is transformed from a slit to a triangle. In the closing stage, the tongue is drawn posteriorly due to the close apposition of the glottis walls and linguolaryngeal cleft walls and hyoglossal sling contractions.

=== Relationship with humans ===

Sea turtles are caught worldwide, although it is illegal to hunt most species in many countries. A great deal of intentional sea turtle harvests worldwide are for food. Many parts of the world have long considered sea turtles to be fine dining. In England during the 1700s, sea turtles were consumed as a delicacy to near extinction, often as turtle soup. Ancient Chinese texts dating to the 5th century B.C.E. describe sea turtles as exotic delicacies. Many coastal communities around the world depend on sea turtles as a source of protein, often harvesting several sea turtles at once and keeping them alive on their backs until needed. Coastal peoples gather sea turtle eggs for consumption.

To a much lesser extent, some species are targeted for their shells. Tortoiseshell, a traditional decorative ornamental material used in Japan and China, comes from the carapace scutes of the hawksbill sea turtle. Ancient Greeks and ancient Romans processed sea turtle scutes (primarily from the hawksbill sea turtle) for various articles and ornaments used by their elites, such as combs and brushes. The skin of the flippers is prized for use as shoes and assorted leather goods. In various West African countries, sea turtles are harvested for traditional medicinal use.

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals. They often depicted sea turtles in their art. J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;Fastitocalon&quot; echoes a second-century Latin tale in the &quot;Physiologus&quot; of the &quot;Aspidochelone&quot; (&quot;round-shielded turtle&quot;); it is so large that sailors mistakenly land and light a fire on its back, and are drowned when it dives.
Beach towns, such as Tortuguero, Costa Rica, have transitioned from a tourism industry that made profits from selling sea turtle meat and shells to an ecotourism-based economy. Tortuguero is considered to be the founding location of sea turtle conservation. In the 1960s the cultural demand for sea turtle meat, shells, and eggs was quickly killing the once-abundant sea turtle populations that nested on the beach. The Caribbean Conservation Corporation began working with villagers to promote ecotourism as a permanent substitute to sea turtle hunting. Sea turtle nesting grounds became sustainable. Tourists love to come and visit the nesting grounds, although it causes a lot of stress to the sea turtles because all of the eggs can get damaged or harmed. Since the creation of a sea turtle ecotourism-based economy, Tortugero annually houses thousands of tourists who visit the protected beach that hosts sea turtle walks and nesting grounds. Walks to observe the nesting sea turtles require a certified guide and this controls and minimises disturbance of the beaches. It also gives the locals a financial interest in conservation and the guides now defend the sea turtles from threats such as poaching; efforts in Costa Rica&#x27;s Pacific Coast are facilitated by a nonprofit organization, Sea Turtles Forever. Thousands of people are involved in sea turtle walks, and substantial revenues accrue from the fees paid for the privilege.

In other parts of the world where sea turtle breeding sites are threatened by human activity, volunteers often patrol beaches as a part of conservation activities, which may include relocating sea turtle eggs to hatcheries, or assisting hatching sea turtles in reaching the ocean. Locations in which such efforts exist include the east coast of India, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sham Wan in Hong Kong, and the coast of Florida.

=== Importance to ecosystems ===
Sea turtles play key roles in two habitat types: oceans and beaches/dunes.

In the oceans, sea turtles, especially green sea turtles, are among the very few creatures (manatees are another) that eat sea grass. Sea grass needs to be constantly cut short to help it grow across the sea floor. Sea turtle grazing helps maintain the health of the sea grass beds. Sea grass beds provide breeding and developmental grounds for numerous marine animals. Without them, many marine species humans harvest would be lost, as would the lower levels of the food chain. The reactions could result in many more marine species eventually becoming endangered or extinct.

Sea turtles use beaches and sand dunes as to lay their eggs. Such coastal environments are nutrient-poor and depend on vegetation to protect against erosion. Eggs, hatched or unhatched, and hatchlings that fail to make it into the ocean are nutrient sources for dune vegetation and therefore protecting these nesting habitats for sea turtles, forming a positive feedback loop.

Sea turtles also maintain a symbiotic relationship with yellow tang, in which the fish will eat algae growing on the shell of a sea turtle.

=== Conservation status and threats ===

The IUCN Red List classifies three species of sea turtle as either &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;critically endangered&quot;. An additional three species are classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot;. The flatback sea turtle is considered as &quot;data deficient&quot;, meaning that its conservation status is unclear due to lack of data. All species of sea turtle are listed in CITES Appendix I, restricting international trade of sea turtles and sea turtle products. However, the usefulness of global assessments for sea turtles has been questioned, particularly due to the presence of distinct genetic stocks and spatially separated regional management units (RMUs). Each RMU is subject to a unique set of threats that generally cross jurisdictional boundaries, resulting in some sub-populations of the same species&#x27; showing recovery while others continue to decline. This has triggered the IUCN to conduct threat assessments at the sub-population level for some species recently. These new assessments have highlighted an unexpected mismatch between where conservation relevant science has been conducted on sea turtles, and where there is the greatest need for conservation. For example, as at August 2017, about 69% of studies using stable isotope analysis to understand the foraging distribution of sea turtles have been conducted in RMUs listed as &quot;least concern&quot; by the IUCN.
Additionally, all populations of sea turtles that occur in United States waters are listed as threatened or endangered by the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). The US listing status of the loggerhead sea turtle is under review as of 2012.

*The ESA manages sea turtles by population and not by species.

==== Management ====
In the Caribbean, researchers are having some success in assisting a comeback. In September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas, wildlife officials found 128 Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, a record number, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and four on Mustang Island. Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle hatchlings along the Texas coast in recent years.

The Philippines has had several initiatives dealing with the issue of sea turtle conservation. In 2007, the province of Batangas declared the catching and eating of sea turtles (locally referred to as Pawikans) illegal. However, the law seems to have had little effect as sea turtle eggs are still in demand in Batangan markets. In September 2007, several Chinese poachers were apprehended off the Turtle Islands in the country&#x27;s southernmost province of Tawi-Tawi. The poachers had collected more than a hundred sea turtles, along with 10,000 sea turtle eggs.

Evaluating the progress of conservation programs is difficult, because many sea turtle populations have not been assessed adequately. Most information on sea turtle populations comes from counting nests on beaches, but this does not provide an accurate picture of the whole sea turtle population. A 2010 United States National Research Council report concluded that more detailed information on sea turtles&#x27; life cycles, such as birth rates and mortality, is needed.

Nest relocation may not be a useful conservation technique for sea turtles. In one study on the freshwater Arrau turtle (&quot;Podocnemis expansa&quot;) researchers examined the effects of nest relocation. They discovered that clutches of this freshwater turtle that were transplanted to a new location had higher mortality rates and more morphological abnormalities compared to non-transplanted clutches. However, in a study of loggerhead sea turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;), Dellert et al. found that relocating nests at risk of inundation increased the success of eggs and hatchlings and decreased the risk of inundation.

==== Predators and disease ====
Most sea turtle mortality happens early in life. Sea turtles usually lay around 100 eggs at a time, but on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood. Raccoons, foxes, and seabirds may raid nests or hatchlings may be eaten within minutes of hatching as they make their initial run for the ocean. Once in the water, they are susceptible to seabirds, large fish and even other sea turtles.

Adult sea turtles have few predators. Large aquatic carnivores such as sharks and crocodiles are their biggest threats; however, reports of terrestrial predators attacking nesting females are not uncommon. Jaguars have been reported to smash into sea turtle shells with their paws, and scoop out the flesh.

Fibropapillomatosis disease causes tumors in sea turtles.

While many of the things that endanger sea turtles are natural predators, increasingly many threats to the sea turtle species have arrived with the ever-growing presence of humans.

==== Bycatch ====
One of the most significant and contemporary threats to sea turtles comes from bycatch due to imprecise fishing methods. Long-lining has been identified as a major cause of accidental sea turtle deaths. There is also a black-market demand for tortoiseshell for both decoration and supposed health benefits.

Sea turtles must surface to breathe. Caught in a fisherman&#x27;s net, they are unable to surface and thus drown. In early 2007, almost a thousand sea turtles were killed inadvertently in the Bay of Bengal over the course of a few months after netting.

However, some relatively inexpensive changes to fishing techniques, such as slightly larger hooks and traps from which sea turtles can escape, can dramatically cut the mortality rate. Turtle excluder devices (TEDs) have reduced sea turtle bycatch in shrimp nets by 97 percent.
==== Beach development ====
Light pollution from beach development is a threat to baby sea turtles; the glow from city sources can cause them to head into traffic instead of the ocean. There has been some movement to protect these areas. On the east coast of Florida, parts of the beach known to harbor sea turtle nests are protected by fences. Conservationists have monitored hatchings, relocating lost baby sea turtles to the beach.

Hatchlings find their way to the ocean by crawling towards the brightest horizon and can become disoriented along the coastline. Lighting restrictions can prevent lights from shining on the beach and confusing hatchlings. Sea turtle-safe lighting uses red or amber LED light, invisible to sea turtles, in place of white light.

==== Poaching ====

Another major threat to sea turtles is the black-market trade in eggs and meat. This is a problem throughout the world, but especially a concern in China, the Philippines, India, Indonesia and the coastal nations of Latin America. Estimates reach as high as 35,000 sea turtles killed a year in Mexico and the same number in Nicaragua. Conservationists in Mexico and the United States have launched &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat Sea Turtle&quot; campaigns in order to reduce this trade in sea turtle products. These campaigns have involved figures such as Dorismar, Los Tigres del Norte and Maná. Sea turtles are often consumed during the Catholic season of Lent, even though they are reptiles, not fish. Consequently, conservation organizations have written letters to the Pope asking that he declare sea turtles meat.

==== Marine debris ====
Another danger to sea turtles comes from marine debris, especially plastics, such as in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which may be mistaken for jellyfish, and abandoned fishing nets in which they can become entangled.

Sea turtles in all types are being endangered by the way humans use plastic. Recycling is known of and people recycle but not everyone does. The amount of plastic in the oceans and beaches is growing every day. The littering of plastic is 80% of the amount.

When turtles hatch from their eggs on the beach, they are already endangered with plastic. Turtles have to find the ocean by themselves and on their journey from land to sea, they encounter a lot of plastic. Some even get trapped in the plastic and die from lack of resources and from the sun being too hot.

Sea turtles eat plastic bags because they confuse them with their actual diet, jellyfish, algae and other components. The consumption of plastic is different for every breed of sea turtle, but when they ingest the plastic, it can clog their intestines and cause internal bleeding which will eventually kill them.

In 2015, an olive ridley sea turtle was found with a plastic drinking straw lodged inside its nose. The video of Nathan J. Robinson has helped raise considerable awareness about the threat posed by plastic pollution to sea turtles.

The research into turtle consumption of plastic is growing. A laboratory of Exeter and Plymouth Marine tested 102 turtles and found plastic in every one of their stomachs. The researchers found more than 800 pieces of plastic in those 102 turtles. That was 20 times more than what was found in the last research. Those researchers stated that the most common things found were cigarette buds, tire, plastic in many forms and fishing material.

The chemicals in the plastic that sea life eats damages their internal organs and can also clog their airway. The chemicals in the plastic that they eat is also a leading cause of the death of the turtles. If the turtles are close to laying eggs, the chemicals that they ingested from the plastic can seep into their eggs and affect their offspring. It is unlikely for the baby sea turtles to survive with those chemicals in their system.

There is a large quantity of plastic in the ocean, 80% of which comes from landfills; the ratio of plankton to plastic in the ocean is one to six. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a swirl of garbage in the Pacific Ocean that is deep and contains 3.5 million tons of garbage. This is also known as the &quot;plastic island&quot;.

==== Climate change ====
Climate change may also cause a threat to sea turtles. Since sand temperature at nesting beaches defines the sex of a sea turtle while developing in the egg, there is concern that rising temperatures may produce too many females. However, more research is needed to understand how climate change might affect sea turtle gender distribution and what other possible threats it may pose.

Studies have shown that climate change in the world is making sea turtles gender change. The study that was in January 2018 &quot;Current Biology&quot; &quot;Environmental Warning and Feminization of One of the Largest Sea Turtle Populations in the World&quot;, showed how baby sea turtles were being born female a lot more than being born male. Scientists took blood samples from many baby sea turtles near the Great Barrier Reef. Prior to this study, the ratio of male to female was pretty normal. There was a little more female than there was male but it was enough to keep reproduction and life cycle normal. The study showed that there was 99% more female sea turtles then male.

The temperature of the sand has a big impact on the sex of the sea turtle. This is not common with other animals but it is with sea turtles. Warmer or hot sand usually makes the sea turtle female and the cooler the sand usually makes male. Climate change has made the temperatures much hotter than they should be. The temperature of the sand gets hotter every time it is time for sea turtles to lay their eggs. With that, adaption to the sand should occur but it would take generations for them to adapt to that one temperature. It would be hard because the temperature of the sand is always changing.

The sand temperature is not the only thing that impacts sea turtles. The rise of the sea levels messes with their memory. They have an imprinted map in their memory that shows where they usually give birth and go after they do. With the rise in water levels, that map is getting messed up and is hard for them to get back to where they started. It is also taking away their beaches that they lay their eggs on. Climate change also has an impact on the number of storms and the severity of them. Storms can wipe out the sea turtles nesting ground and take out the eggs that already laid. The rising level of water is also a way for the nesting grounds to disappear. Sea turtles maps and their nesting grounds getting destroyed is harmful to them. That is because with their maps being messed up and not being able to lay eggs where they usually do makes it hard for them to find a new place to nest. They usually stick to a schedule and the messing up of a schedule messes them up.

The temperature of the ocean is also rising. This impacts their diet and what they can eat. Coral reefs are majorly impacted by the rising temperatures and a lot of sea turtles diet is coral reefs or in the coral reef. Most animals that live in coral reefs need the reefs to survive. With the reefs dying, the sea life around it also does, impacting many animals.

==== Oil spills ====
Sea turtles are very vulnerable to oil pollution, both because of the oil&#x27;s tendency to linger on the water&#x27;s surface, and because oil can affect them at every stage of their life cycle. Oil can poison the sea turtles upon entering their digestive system.

Sea turtles have a cycle that they follow from birth. The cycle depends on the sex of the turtle but they follow it all the way through life. They start by hatching on the beach, they reach the water then move out to find food. They then start their breeding migration and then mate with another turtle. For females, they make their way to the beach to start it all over again. With males, they go back to feeding after mating and doing that over again. Oil spills can affect this cycle majorly. If the female was to go and lay eggs and ingest oil, the chemicals from the oil can get passed on to the offspring and will be hard for them to survive. The diet of the sea turtles can also be impacted by oil. If the things that they eat has oil on it or has ingested oil, it can get into their system and start attacking the insides of the turtle.

==== Rehabilitation ====
Injured sea turtles are rescued and rehabilitated (and, if possible, released back to the ocean) by professional organizations, such as the Gumbo Limbo Nature Center in Boca Raton, Florida, the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in Surf City, North Carolina, and Sea Turtles 911 in Hainan, China.

One rescued sea turtle, named Nickel for the coin that was found lodged in her throat, lives at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.

=== Symbiosis with barnacles ===
Sea turtles are believed to have a commensal relationship with some barnacles, in which the barnacles benefit from growing on sea turtles without harming them. Barnacles are small, hard-shelled crustaceans found attached to multiple different substrates below or just above the ocean. The adult barnacle is a sessile organism; however, in its larval stage it is planktonic and can move about the water column. The larval stage chooses where to settle and ultimately the habitat for its full adult life, which is typically between 5 and 10 years. However, estimates of age for a common sea turtle barnacle species, &quot;Chelonibia testudinaria&quot;, suggest that this species lives for at least 21 months, with individuals older than this uncommon. &quot;Chelonibia&quot; barnacles have also been used to distinguish between the foraging areas of sea turtle hosts. By analyzing stable isotope ratios in barnacle shell material, scientist can identify differences in the water (temperature and salinity) that different hosts have been swimming through, and thus differentiate between the home areas of host sea turtles.

A favorite settlement for barnacle larvae is the shell or skin around the neck of sea turtles. The larvae glue themselves to the chosen spot, a thin layer of flesh is wrapped around them and a shell is secreted. Many species of barnacles can settle on any substrate; however, some species of barnacles have an obligatory commensal relationship with specific animals, which makes finding a suitable location harder. Around 29 species of &quot;turtle barnacles&quot; have been recorded. However, it is not solely on sea turtles that barnacles can be found; other organisms also serve as a barnacle&#x27;s settlements. These organisms include mollusks, whales, decapod crustaceans, manatees and several other groups related to these species.

Sea turtle shells are an ideal habitat for adult barnacles for three reasons. Sea turtles tend to live long lives, greater than 70 years, so barnacles do not have to worry about host death. However, mortality in sea turtle barnacles is often driven by their host shedding the scutes on which the barnacle is attached, rather than the death of the sea turtle itself. Secondly, barnacles are suspension feeders. Sea turtles spend most of their lives swimming and following ocean currents and as water runs along the back of the sea turtle&#x27;s shell it passes over the barnacles, providing an almost constant water flow and influx of food particles. Lastly, the long distances and inter-ocean travel these sea turtles swim throughout their lifetime offers the perfect mechanism for dispersal of barnacle larvae. Allowing the barnacle species to distribute themselves throughout global waters is a high fitness advantage of this commensalism.

This relationship, however, is not truly commensal. While the barnacles are not directly parasitic to their hosts, they have negative effects to the sea turtles on which they choose to reside. The barnacles add extra weight and drag to the sea turtle, increasing the energy it needs for swimming and affecting its ability to capture prey, with the effect increasing with the quantity of barnacles affixed to its back.

<text>Frederick George Jackson (6 March 1860 – 13 March 1938) was an English Arctic explorer remembered for his expedition to Franz Josef Land, when he located the missing Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Jackson was born the son of George Frederick and Mary Elizabeth Jackson at Alcester Lodge, Alcester, Warwickshire, England and educated at Denstone College in Staffordshire and Edinburgh University.

=== Career ===
His first voyage in Arctic waters was on a whaling cruise in 1886–1887, and in 1893 he made a sledge-journey of 3000 miles across the frozen tundra of Siberia lying between the Ob and the Pechora. His narrative of this journey was published under the title of &quot;The Great Frozen Land&quot; (1895).

==== Jackson–Harmsworth expedition ====

On his return, he was given the command of the Jackson–Harmsworth expedition of 1894. Sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society, this expedition was to conduct general exploration of Franz Josef Land. Whilst leading this expedition, Jackson and his men met by chance on 17 June 1896 the Norwegian arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen, who had not been heard of for three years and were presumed dead, but were in fact trying to reach Spitsbergen by kayak. Jackson informed him that they were in fact on Franz Josef Land, and with Jackson&#x27;s help, Nansen and Johansen returned home aboard the expedition&#x27;s supply ship &quot;Windward&quot; on 7 August. Jackson and his party wintered at their camp according to plan.

The Jackson–Harmsworth expedition proved that Franz Josef Land is nothing more than an archipelago of small islands.

In recognition of his services he received a knighthood of the first class of the Norwegian Royal Order of St Olaf in 1898, and was awarded the gold medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1899. His account of the expedition was published under the title of &quot;A Thousand Days in the Arctic&quot; (1899).

=== Later career ===
Jackson was commissioned as an officer in the 5th (Militia) Battalion, Manchester Regiment as a captain on 5 March 1900. He saw active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, and following the end of the war, he stayed on as a militia officer in the battalion. He transferred to the 4th Battalion, East Surrey Regiment in 1905, serving in the First World War and reaching the rank of Major. He resigned his commission in 1917. After being invalided home he commanded Southwark Recruiting District for two years, followed by commands of a number of prisoner of war camps in Germany.

His travels also include a journey across the Australian deserts.

He is buried in the churchyard of St Michael and St Mary Magdalene at Easthampstead in Berkshire, and there is a memorial plaque on the wall of the church near the front.

One of the headlands discovered on the expedition was named St Chad&#x27;s Head (Denstone College was originally called St Chad&#x27;s College), and the sledge used was presented to Denstone College.

<text>Creativity is the ability to form novel and valuable ideas or works using one&#x27;s imagination. Products of creativity may be intangible (e.g. an idea, scientific theory, literary work, musical composition, or joke), or a physical object (e.g. an invention, dish or meal, piece of jewelry, costume, a painting). 

Creativity may also describe the ability to find new solutions to problems, or new methods to accomplish a goal. Therefore, creativity enables people to solve problems in new ways.

Most ancient cultures (including Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India) lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery rather than a form of creation. In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition, creativity was seen as the sole province of God, and human creativity was considered an expression of God&#x27;s work; the modern conception of creativity came about during the Renaissance, influenced by humanist ideas.

Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily psychology, business studies, and cognitive science. It is also present in education and the humanities (including philosophy and the arts). 

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;creativity&quot; comes from the Latin terms (meaning &quot;to create&quot;). Its derivational suffixes also come from Latin. The word &quot;create&quot; appeared in English as early as the 14th century—notably in Chaucer&#x27;s The Parson&#x27;s Tale to indicate divine creation. The modern meaning of creativity in reference to human creation did not emerge until after the Age of Enlightenment.

== Definition ==
In a summary of scientific research into creativity, psychology professor Michael Mumford wrote, &quot;We seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products.&quot; In psychologist Robert Sternberg&#x27;s words, creativity produces &quot;something original and worthwhile&quot;.

Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: social geographer Peter Meusburger estimated that over a hundred different definitions can be found in literature. One definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance in the context of assessing an individual&#x27;s creative ability is &quot;a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results.&quot;

Philosophy professor Ignacio L. Götz, following the etymology of the word, argued that creativity is not necessarily &quot;making&quot;. He confined it to the act of creating without thinking about the end product. While many definitions of creativity seem almost synonymous with originality, Götz also emphasized the difference between creativity and originality. Götz asserted that one can be creative without necessarily being original. When someone creates something, they are certainly creative at that point, but they may not be original in the sense that their creation is not something new. However, originality and creativity can go hand-in-hand.

Creativity in general is usually distinguished from innovation in particular, where the emphasis is on implementation. Academics and authors Teresa Amabile and Michael Pratt defined creativity as the production of novel and useful ideas and innovation as the implementation of creative ideas, while the OECD and Eurostat stated that &quot;innovation is more than a new idea or an invention; an innovation requires implementation, either by being put into active use or by being made available for use by other parties, firms, individuals, or organizations.&quot; Therefore, while creativity involves generating new ideas, innovation is about transforming those ideas into tangible outcomes that have practical applications. The distinction is critical because creativity without implementation remains an idea, whereas innovation leads to real-world impact.

There is also emotional creativity, which is described as a pattern of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to originality and appropriateness in emotional experience.

== Conceptual history ==

=== Ancient ===
Most ancient cultures, including Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms for &quot;to create&quot; or &quot;creator&quot; except for the expression (to make), which only applied to (poetry) and to the (poet, or &quot;maker&quot;, who made it). Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. He asks in the &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;Will we say of a painter that he makes something?&quot; He answers, &quot;Certainly not, he merely imitates.&quot;

It is commonly argued that the notion of &quot;creativity&quot; originated in Western cultures through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration. According to scholars, the earliest Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of the creation given in &quot;Genesis&quot;. However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God&#x27;s work. A similar concept existed in Greek culture, where Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative &quot;daemon&quot; (Greek) or &quot;genius&quot; (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West until the Renaissance and even later.

=== Renaissance ===
It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first conceived not as a conduit from the divine, but as arising from the abilities of &quot;great men.&quot; This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism, which developed an intensely anthropocentric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual. From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principles of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.

=== From the 17th to the 19th centuries ===
However, the shift from divine inspiration to the abilities of the individual was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Age of Enlightenment. By the 18th century, creativity (notably in aesthetics) linked with the concept of imagination became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition. William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but not breaking new ground) and genius.

As an independent topic of study, creativity received little attention until the 19th century. Psychologist Mark Runco and Robert Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who, through his eugenicist outlook, took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.

=== Modern ===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes. The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas and Max Wertheimer. In his work &quot;Art of Thought&quot;, published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of five stages:

# &quot;preparation&quot; (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual&#x27;s mind on the problem and explores the problem&#x27;s dimensions),
# &quot;incubation&quot; (in which the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind although nothing appears externally to be happening),
# &quot;intimation&quot; (the creative person gets a &quot;feeling&quot; that a solution is on its way),
# &quot;illumination&quot; or insight (in which the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness);
# &quot;verification&quot; (in which the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).

Wallas&#x27;s model is also often treated as four stages, with &quot;intimation&quot; seen as a sub-stage.

Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, &quot;Origins of Genius: Darwinian Perspectives on Creativity&quot;.

In 1927, mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as &quot;Process and Reality&quot;. He is credited with having coined the term &quot;creativity&quot; to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme.

Although psychometric studies of creativity had been conducted by The London School of Psychology as early as 1927 with the work of H.L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination. The formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with psychologist J.P. Guilford&#x27;s address to the American Psychological Association in 1950. That address helped to popularize the study of creativity and to focus attention on scientific approaches to conceptualizing creativity. Statistical analyzes led to the recognition of creativity as a aspect of human cognition separate from IQ-type intelligence, under the study of which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford&#x27;s work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.

=== Across cultures ===
Creativity is viewed differently in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centered in Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people (i.e. what they can contribute to society). Mpofu, et al., surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to &quot;creativity&quot;, with Arabic being the exception. The linguistic relativity hypothesis (i.e. that language can affect thought) suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for &quot;creativity&quot; may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less—or more—creative. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa and Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but there are cultural differences between northern countries. In Scandinavia, creativity is seen as an individual attitude that helps people cope with life&#x27;s challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.

== Classification ==

=== &quot;Four C&quot; model ===
Psychologists James Kaufman and Ronald Beghetto introduced a &quot;four C&quot; model of creativity. The four &quot;C&#x27;s&quot; are:

# &quot;mini-c&quot; (&quot;transformative learning&quot; involving &quot;personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights&quot;).
# &quot;little-c&quot; (everyday problem-solving and creative expression).
# &quot;Pro-C&quot; (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative, though not necessarily eminent).
# &quot;Big-C&quot; (creativity considered great in a given field).

This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and a historic transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.

The contrast signified by the terms &quot;Big C&quot; and &quot;little C&quot; has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto, and Runco used a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity. Margaret Boden distinguished between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).

Ken Robinson and Anna Craft focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;little c&quot; creativity and cites Robinson as referring to &quot;high&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defined creativity in terms of individuals judged to have made significant creative and perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton analyzed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.

=== &quot;Four P&#x27;s&quot; aspects ===
Theories of creativity (and empirical investigations of why some people are more creative than others) have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as &quot;the four P&#x27;s,&quot; a framework first put forward by Mel Rhodes:
;Process:A focus on &quot;process&quot; is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as that of Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as that of Wallas) are primarily theories of the creative process.
;Product:A focus on a creative &quot;product&quot; usually attempts to assess creative output, whether for psychometrics (see below) or to understand why some objects are considered creative. It is from a consideration of product that the standard definition of creativity as the production of something both novel and useful arises.
;Person:A focus on the nature of the creative &quot;person&quot; considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on.
;Press and place:A focus on &quot;place&quot; (or &quot;press&quot;) considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors, as well as flexibility.

=== &quot;Five A&#x27;s&quot; aspects ===
In 2013, based on a sociocultural critique of the Four-P&#x27;s model as individualistic, static, and decontextualized, psychology professor and author Vlad Petre Glăveanu proposed a &quot;Five A&#x27;s&quot; model consisting of actor, action, artifact, audience, and affordance. In this model, the &quot;actor&quot; is the person with attributes but who is also located within social networks; &quot;action&quot; is the process of creativity not only in internal cognitive terms but also external, bridging the gap between ideation and implementation; &quot;artifacts&quot; emphasize how creative products typically represent cumulative innovations over time rather than abrupt discontinuities; and &quot;press/place&quot; is divided into &quot;audience&quot; and &quot;affordance&quot;, which consider the interdependence of the creative individual with the social and material world, respectively. Although not supplanting the Four P&#x27;s model in creativity research, the Five A&#x27;s model has exerted influence over the direction of some creativity research, and has been credited with bringing coherence to studies across a number of creative domains.

== Process theories ==
There has been significant research conducted in the fields of psychology and cognitive science towards better understanding the processes by which creativity occurs. The results of these studies have led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity.

=== Incubation ===
&quot;Incubation&quot; is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. Empirical research has investigated whether, as the concept of &quot;incubation&quot; in Wallas&#x27;s model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Early work proposed that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied with other tasks. This hypothesis is included in Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s five-phase model of the creative process, which describes incubation as a time when one&#x27;s unconscious takes over. This was supposed to allow for unique connections to be made without the conscious mind trying to make logical order out of the problem.

Ward listed various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with a different hypothesis: incubation aids creative problems in that it enables &quot;forgetting&quot; of misleading clues. The absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate problem-solving strategies.

=== Divergent thinking ===
J. P. Guilford drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production, or convergent and divergent thinking. Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct, or best solution to a problem (e.g. &quot;How can we get a crewed rocket to land on the moon safely and within budget?&quot;). Divergent thinking, on the other hand, involves the creative generation of multiple answers to an open-ended prompt (e.g. &quot;How can a chair be used?&quot;). Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychological literature or is considered the necessary precursor to creativity. However, as Runco pointed out, there is a clear distinction between creative thinking and divergent thinking. Creative thinking focuses on the production, combination, and assessment of ideas to formulate something new and unique, while divergent thinking focuses on conceiving a variety of ideas that are not necessarily new or unique. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms &quot;flexible&quot; thinking or fluid intelligence, which are also roughly similar to (but not synonymous with) creativity. While convergent and divergent thinking differ greatly in terms of approach to problem solving, it is believed that both are employed to some degree in solving most real-world problems.

=== Geneplore model ===
In 1992, Finke, et al., proposed the &quot;Geneplore model&quot;, in which creativity takes place in two phases: a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called &quot;preinventive&quot; structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, those ideas are structured in predictable ways in accordance with properties of existing categories and concepts. Weisberg argued, in contrast, that creativity involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results.

=== Explicit–implicit interaction theory ===
Helie and Sun proposed a framework for understanding creativity in problem solving, namely the explicit–implicit interaction (EII) theory of creativity. This theory attempts to provide a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight).

The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles:
# co-existence of, and the difference between, explicit and implicit knowledge
# simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks
# redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge
# integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing
# iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing

A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work is an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity, encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena.

=== Conceptual blending ===
In &quot;The Act of Creation&quot;, Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of &quot;bisociation&quot; – that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor, analogy, and structure mapping converged, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art, and humor emerged under the label conceptual blending.

=== Honing theory ===
Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way by which the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also on the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When one is faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between one&#x27;s conception of the task and one&#x27;s worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point the task is conceived of differently and the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed, following the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge. Dissonance in a person&#x27;s worldview is, in some cases, generated by viewing their peers&#x27; creative outputs, and, so, people pursue their own creative endeavors to restructure their worldviews and reduce dissonance. This shift in worldview and cognitive restructuring through creative acts has also been considered as a way to explain possible benefits of creativity for mental health. The theory also addresses challenges not addressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors guiding restructuring and the evolution of creative works. 

A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a &quot;potentiality state&quot;. Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly &quot;mutating&quot; predefined possibilities but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural-cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process, one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus, the creative idea may feel &quot;half-baked&quot;. At that point, it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with.

Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity—for example, how different works by the same creator exhibit a recognizable style or &quot;voice&quot; even in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator&#x27;s uniquely structured worldview. Another example is the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, and trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. In line with this idea, Gabora posits that creativity is a product of culture and that our social interactions evolve our culture in way that promotes creativity.

=== Everyday imaginative thought ===
In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think &quot;if only...&quot;. Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on cognitive processes that are similar to rational thought.

Imaginative thought in everyday life can be categorized based on whether it involves perceptual or motor-related mental imagery, novel combinatorial processing, or altered psychological states. This classification aids in understanding the neural foundations and practical implications of imagination. 

Creative thinking is a central aspect of everyday life, encompassing both controlled and undirected processes. This includes divergent thinking and stage models, highlighting the importance of extra- and meta-cognitive contributions to imaginative thought.

Brain-network dynamics play a crucial role in creative cognition. The default and executive control networks in the brain cooperate during creative tasks, suggesting a complex interaction between these networks in facilitating everyday imaginative thought.

=== Dialectical theory ===
The term &quot;dialectical theory of creativity&quot; dates back to psychoanalyst Daniel Dervin and was later developed into an interdisciplinary theory. This theory starts with the ancient concept that creativity takes place in an interplay between order and chaos. Similar ideas can be found in neuroscience and psychology. Neurobiologically, it can be shown that the creative process takes place in a dynamic interplay between coherence and incoherence that leads to new and usable neuronal networks. Psychology shows how the dialectics of convergent and focused thinking with divergent and associative thinking leads to new ideas and products.

Personality traits such as the &quot;Big Five&quot; seem to be the creative process: emotional instability versus stability, extraversion versus introversion, openness versus reserve, agreeableness versus antagonism, and disinhibition versus constraint. The dialectical theory of creativity also applies to counseling and psychotherapy.

=== Neuroeconomic framework ===
Lin and Vartanian developed a neurobiological description of creative cognition. This interdisciplinary framework integrates theoretical principles and empirical results from neuroeconomics, reinforcement learning, cognitive neuroscience, and neurotransmission research on the locus coeruleus system. It describes how decision-making processes studied by neuroeconomists as well as activity in the locus coeruleus system underlie creative cognition and the large-scale brain network dynamics associated with creativity. It suggests that creativity is an optimization and utility maximization problem that requires individuals to determine the optimal way to exploit and explore ideas (e.g., the multi-armed bandit problem). This utility-maximization process is thought to be mediated by the locus coeruleus system, and this creativity framework describes how tonic and phasic locus coeruleus activities work in conjunction to facilitate the exploiting and exploring of creative ideas. This framework not only explains previous empirical results but also makes novel and falsifiable predictions at different levels of analysis (ranging from neurobiological to cognitive and personality differences).

=== Behaviorism theory ===
B.F. Skinner attributed creativity to accidental behaviors that are reinforced by the environment. In behaviorism, creativity can be understood as novel or unusual behaviors that are reinforced if they produce a desired outcome. Spontaneous behaviors by living creatures are thought to reflect past learned behaviors. In this way, a behaviorist may say that prior learning caused novel behaviors to be reinforced many times over, and the individual has been shaped to produce increasingly novel behaviors. A creative person, according to this definition, is someone who has been reinforced more often for novel behaviors than others. Behaviorists suggest that anyone can be creative, they just need to be reinforced to learn to produce novel behaviors.

=== Investment theory ===
The &quot;investment theory of creativity&quot; suggests that many individual and environmental factors must exist in precise ways for extremely high, as opposed to average, levels of creativity to result. In the &quot;investment&quot; sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy to something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognized idea to the point where it is established as a new and creative idea. Just as in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy-in, while others are less productive and do not generate returns to the extent that the investor expected. This &quot;investment theory of creativity&quot; asserts that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.

=== Computational creativity ===
Jürgen Schmidhuber&#x27;s formal theory of creativity postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress.

Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn, through informed trial and error, sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But for Schmidhuber&#x27;s objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model &quot;wow-effects&quot;. This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent, even when there are no external goals.

A wow-effect is formally defined as follows: as the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the predictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network, or some other machine learning device, that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs (storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time) needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoder&#x27;s present knowledge, which changes over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present wow-effect due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences that cause more wow-effects.

Irregular, random data (or noise) do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are &quot;boring&quot; by nature (providing no reward). Already-known and predictable regularities also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration.

Schmidhuber&#x27;s work is highly influential in intrinsic motivation, which has emerged as a research topic in the study of artificial intelligence and robotics.

According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and comedians. For example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations that obey previously unpublished physical laws, permitting better data compression. Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements. Similarly, a comedian gets an intrinsic reward for &quot;inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line, related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data.&quot;

Schmidhuber augured that computer hardware advances would greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists. He used the theory to create low-complexity art and an attractive human face.

=== Psychometric approaches ===

==== History ====
J. P. Guilford&#x27;s group, which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several performance-based tests to measure creativity in 1967, including asking participants to write original titles for a story with a given plot, asking participants to come up with unusual uses for everyday objects such as bricks, and asking participants to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events, such as the loss of gravity. Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so, he also created a model for creativity. Guilford assumed that creativity was not an abstract concept, which was an important assumption needed for creativity research. The idea that creativity was a category, rather than a single concept, enabled other researchers to look at creativity from a new perspective.

Additionally, Guilford hypothesized one of the first models that specified the components of creativity. He explained that creativity was a result of having three qualities: the ability to recognize problems, &quot;fluency&quot;, and &quot;flexibility&quot;. &quot;Fluency&quot; encompassed &quot;ideational fluency&quot;, or the ability to rapidly produce a variety of ideas fulfilling stated requirements; &quot;associational fluency&quot;, or the ability to generate a list of words associated with a given word; and &quot;expressional fluency&quot;, or the ability to organize words into larger units such as phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. &quot;Flexibility&quot; encompassed both &quot;spontaneous flexibility&quot;, or the general ability to be flexible, and &quot;adaptive flexibility&quot;, or the ability to produces responses that are novel and of high quality.

This represents the base model which several researchers would alter to produce their own new theories of creativity years later. Building on Guilford&#x27;s work, tests were developed, sometimes called &quot;divergent thinking&quot; (DT) tests, which have been both praised and criticized. One example is the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking developed in 1966. These test set forth tasks requiring divergent thinking, as well as other problem-solving skills, the tests being scored according to four categories: &quot;fluency&quot;, the total number of meaningful, and relevant, ideas generated; &quot;flexibility&quot;, the number of different categories of responses; &quot;originality&quot;, the statistical rarity of the responses; and &quot;elaboration&quot;, the amount of detail given.

==== Computer scoring ====
Considerable progress has been made in the automated scoring of divergent-thinking tests, using a semantic approach. When compared to human raters, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are reliable and valid for the scoring of originality. Computer programs were able to achieve a correlation to human graders of 0.60 and 0.72.

Semantic networks also devise originality scores that yield significant correlations with socio-personal measures. A team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing: the SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system. This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation to human graders of 0.73.

=== Social-personality approaches ===
Researchers have taken a social-personality approach by using personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking as measures of personal creativity. Within the framework of the Big Five personality traits, a consistent few of these traits have emerged as being correlated to creativity. Openness to experience is consistently related to a host of different assessments of creativity. Investigation of the other Big Five traits has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.

=== Self-reporting questionnaires ===
Biographical methods use quantitative characteristics, such as the number of publications, patents, or artistic performances that can be credited to a person. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating recipes. The self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research is the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across ten domains, which was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluations of creative output.

== Factors ==

=== Intelligence ===
The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the last half of the twentieth century, when many influential studies extensively studied both. This joint focus highlighted both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers were interested in not only &quot;if&quot; the two qualities were related, but also &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.

There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with there being three main theories. Threshold theory states that intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for creativity, and that there is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120. Certification theory states that creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level of intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education or work, which in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. In this theory, displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence. Interference theory states, in contrast, that extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.

Sternberg and O&#x27;Hara proposed a different framework of five possible relationships between creativity and intelligence: that creativity was a subset of intelligence; that intelligence was a subset of creativity; that the two constructs overlapped; that they were both part of the same construct (coincident sets); or that they were distinct constructs (disjoint sets).

==== Creativity as a subset of intelligence ====
A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence, for example:
* Sternberg&#x27;s Theory of Successful Intelligence includes creativity as a main component and comprises three sub-theories: contextual (analytic), contextual (practical), and experiential (creative). Experiential sub-theory—the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems—is directly related to creativity.
* The Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory (CHC) includes creativity as a subset of intelligence, associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval (Glr). Glr narrows abilities relating to creativity include ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originality/creativity. Silvia &quot;et al.&quot; conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad-level Glr factor. Martindale extended the CHC-theory by proposing that people who are creative are also selective in their processing speed. Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as a person begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased.
* The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence posits a two-factor or type model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process and concerns goal-directed thoughts. Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. Each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees.

==== Intelligence as a subset of creativity ====
In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity, for example:
* Sternberg &amp; Lubart&#x27;s Investment Theory, using the metaphor of a stock market, demonstrates that creative thinkers are like good investors—they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like undervalued or low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere and convince others of the idea&#x27;s value. After convincing others, and thus increasing the idea&#x27;s value, the creative individual &quot;sells high&quot; by leaving the idea with the other people and moving on to generate another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can, either solely or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.
* Amabile&#x27;s Componential Model of Creativity posits three within-individual components needed for creativity—domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation—and one component external to the individual—their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires the confluence of all components. High creativity will result when a person is intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.
* The Amusement Park Theoretical Model is a four-step theory in which domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that, within each of the following creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
** To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time and transportation needed to go to the park). Initial requirements (such as intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if a person does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts and behaviour.
** Secondly, there are the subcomponents—general thematic areas—that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g., a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g., poetry).
** Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit (e.g., if one chooses a waterpark, that person has to choose which specific park to go to). For example, within the poetry domain there are many different forms (e.g., free verse, riddles, sonnets, etc.).
** Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain (e.g., individual rides at the waterpark equate to individual lines in a poem in free-verse).

==== Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs ====
These concepts posit creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs, for example:
* In Renzulli&#x27;s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness, giftedness is an overlap of above-average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they overlap under the correct conditions.
* In the PASS theory of intelligence, the planning component—the ability to solve problems, make decisions, and take action—strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.
* Threshold Theory (TT) derives from a number of previous research findings that suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence—both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak. TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.

==== Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets ====
Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity from those used in normal problem solving, and in normal problem solving there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins referred to this as the &quot;nothing-special&quot; view.

==== Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets ====
In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.

=== Affective influence ===
Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. The term &quot;affect&quot; in this context refers to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making.

According to Alice Isen, positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity. First, it makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association. Second, it leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem. Third, it increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes enable creativity.

Barbara Fredrickson, in her broaden-and-build, model suggests that positive emotions, such as joy and love, broaden a person&#x27;s available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity.

According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association (attention scope) and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem (cognitive scope). Day-by-day psychological experiences—including emotions, perceptions, and motivation—significantly impact creative performance. Creativity is higher when emotions and perceptions are more positive and when intrinsic motivation is stronger.

Some meta-analyses, such as Baas, et al., (2008) analyzing 66 studies of creativity and affect, support the link between creativity and positive affect.

=== Mental health ===
Links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). However, different artists have described mental illness as having both positive and negative effects on their work. In general, people who have worked in the arts industry throughout history have faced many environmental factors that are associated with, and can sometimes influence, mental illness—things such as poverty, persecution, social alienation, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and high stress.

==== Studies ====
A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity to be greater in people with schizotypal personality disorder than in people with either schizophrenia or those without mental health disorders. While divergent thinking was associated with activation of both sides of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their &quot;right&quot; prefrontal cortex. That study hypothesized that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. Consistent with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also more common in people with schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia. Three studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal personality disorder, hypomanic personality, and several different measures of creativity.

A study of 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions of those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.

Another study, involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder. Those in the creative professions were no more likely to have psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the &quot;Journal of Psychiatric Research&quot; reported.

Nancy Andreasen was one of the first researchers to carry out a large-scale study of creativity and whether mental illnesses have an impact on someone&#x27;s ability to be creative. She expected to find a link between creativity and schizophrenia, but her research sample (the book-authors she pooled) had no history of schizophrenia. Her findings instead showed that 80% of the creative group previously had some episode of mental illness in their lifetime. When she performed follow-up studies over a 15-year period, she found that 43% of the authors had bipolar disorder, compared to 1% of the general public.

In 1989 another study, by Kay Redfield Jamison, reaffirmed those statistics, with 38% of her sample of authors having a history of mood disorders. Anthony Storr, a prominent psychiatrist, remarked: 

==== Bipolar disorders ====
People diagnosed with bipolar disorder report themselves as having a larger range of emotional understanding, heightened states of perception, and an ability to connect better with those in the world around them. Other reported traits include higher rates of productivity, higher senses of self-awareness, and greater empathy. Those who have bipolar disorder also understand their own sense of heightened creativity and ability to get immense numbers of tasks done all at once. In one study, of 219 participants (aged 19 to 63) diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 82% of them reported having elevated feelings of creativity during their hypomanic swings.

A study done by Shapiro and Weisberg also showed a positive correlation between the manic upswings of the cycles of bipolar disorder and the ability of an individual to be more creative. The data showed, however, that it was not the depressive swing that brings forth dark creative spurts, but the act of climbing out of the depressive episode that sparks creativity. The reason behind this spur of creative genius could come from the type of self-image that the person has during a time of hypomania. A hypomanic person may feel a bolstered sense of self-confidence, creative confidence, and sense of individualism.

==== Opinions ====
Vaitsa Giannouli believes that the creativity a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder feels comes as a form of &quot;stress management&quot;. In the realm of music, one might be expressing one&#x27;s stress or pains through the pieces one writes in order to better understand those same feelings. Famous authors and musicians, along with some actors, would often attribute their wild enthusiasm to something like a hypomanic state. The artistic side of society has been notorious for behaviors that are seen as maladapted to societal norms. Symptoms of bipolar disorder correlate with behaviors in high-profile creative personalities such as alcohol addiction; drug abuse including stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens and dissociatives, opioids, inhalants, and cannabis; difficulties in holding regular occupations; interpersonal problems; legal issues; and a high risk of suicide.

Robert Weisberg believes that the state of mania sets &quot;free the powers of a thinker&quot;. He implies that not only has the person become more creative, but they have fundamentally changed the kind of thoughts they produce. In a study of poets, who are especially highly afflicted with bipolar disorders, over a period of three years those poets would have cycles of creating really creative and powerful works of poetry. The timelines over the three-year study looked at the poets&#x27; personal journals and their clinical records, and found that the timelines between their most powerful poems matched that of their upswings in bipolar disorder.

=== Personal traits ===
Creativity can be expressed in a variety of ways, depending on the uniqueness of people and environments. Theorists have suggested a number of different models of the creative person. However, the creativity-profiling approach must take into account the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterized by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that group creativity is founded on diversity and difference.

From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people who are less creative.

==== Divergent production ====
One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called &quot;divergent production&quot;—the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount, of responses to a given situation. One way to measure divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, which assess the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants&#x27; responses to a variety of open-ended questions. Some researchers also emphasize how creative people are better at balancing between divergent and convergent production, which depends on an individual&#x27;s innate preference or ability to explore and exploit ideas.

==== Dedication and expertise ====
Other researchers of creativity see that what distinguishes creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem-solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hardworking people study the work of people before them in their milieu, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous information in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge of their subject on average exhibited greater creativity in carrying out their projects.

==== Motivation ====
A person&#x27;s motivation may also be predictive of their level of creativity. Motivation stems from two different sources: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.

=== Environment ===
In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people usually had supportive, but rigid and non-nurturing, parents. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relatively uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their determination.

== In different fields ==

=== Art ===
Creativity is a fundamental component of the creative arts and design practice. It allows artists and designers to generate innovative ideas, solve complex problems, create products and experiences that are meaningful and impactful, stay ahead of trends, and anticipate future needs. Author Austin Kleon asserts that all creative work builds on what came before. Embracing influences and educating oneself in the work of others is conducive to creativity.

=== Neuroscience ===

The neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behavior. One article writes that &quot;creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected.&quot; People who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways: first, they have a high level of specialized knowledge; second, they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe; and, third, they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe. Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity. 

A 2015 study of creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions. In 2018, some experiments showed that when the brain suppresses obvious or &quot;known&quot; solutions, the outcome is solutions that are more creative. This suppression is mediated by alpha oscillations in the right temporal lobe and activity in the right frontal pole. 

==== REM sleep ====
Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. This may be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex, and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, during which higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. REM sleep may aid creativity by allowing &quot;neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.&quot;

==== Vandervert model ====
Vandervert described how the brain&#x27;s frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to facilitate creativity and innovation. Vandervert&#x27;s explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory (responsible for processing all thought) are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. The cerebellum (consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the in the entirety of the rest of the brain) also adaptively models all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellum&#x27;s adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes, where creative and innovative thoughts arise. (Apparently, creative insight or the &quot;aha&quot; experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe.)

According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in &quot;forward&quot; cerebellar models, which are anticipatory/exploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control (HMOSAIC). New, hierarchically-arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture (HMOSAIC) develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, Vandervert&#x27;s approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy, and thought in general.

Vandervert argues that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. He also argues that this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert–Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Furthermore, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive &quot;mental prototyping&quot;, or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy.

The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.

==== Flaherty model ====
In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies, and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes may be responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal-directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, with all three effects increasing the drive to generate ideas. 

==== Lin and Vartanian model ====
In 2018, Lin and Vartanian proposed a neuroeconomic framework that precisely describes norepinephrine&#x27;s role in creativity and modulating large-scale brain networks associated with creativity. This framework describes how neural activity in different brain regions and networks, such as the default mode network, track utility or subjective values of ideas.

=== Economics ===
Economic approaches to creativity have focused on three aspects – the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modeling markets for creativity, and the maximization of economic creativity (innovation).

In the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of &quot;creative destruction&quot; to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.

Mark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a &quot;psychoeconomic&quot; model of creativity. In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity; the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticized for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility, and for the way it prematurely analyzes the value of future innovations.

In his 2002 book, &quot;The Rise of the Creative Class&quot;, economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with &quot;3 T&#x27;s of economic development: Technology, Talent, and Tolerance&quot; also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development.

=== Sociology ===
Creativity research for most of the twentieth century was dominated by psychology and business studies, with little work done in sociology. Since the turn of the millennium, there has been more attention paid by sociological researchers, but sociology has yet to establish creativity as a specific research field, with reviews of sociological research into creativity a rarity in high-impact literature.

While psychology has tended to focus on the individual as the locus of creativity, sociological research is directed more at the structures and context within which creative activity takes place, primarily based in sociology of culture, which finds its roots in the works of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. This has meant a focus on the cultural and creative industries as sociological phenomena. Such research has covered a variety of areas, including the economics and production of culture, the role of creative industries in development, and the rise of the &quot;creative class&quot;.

=== Education ===
For those who view the conventional system of schooling as stifling creativity, an emphasis is made (particularly in the preschool/kindergarten and early school years) to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate and creative problem-solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. The Waldorf School is an example of an education program that promotes creative thought.

Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and to structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.

Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well-defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativity. However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to everyday creative expression.

Musical creativity is a gateway to the flow state, which is conducive to spontaneity, improvisation, and creativity. Studies show that it is beneficial to emphasize students&#x27; creative side and integrate more creativity into their curriculums, with a notable strategy being through music. One reason for this is that students are able to express themselves through musical improvisation in a way that taps into higher order brain regions, while connecting with their peers and allowing them to go beyond typical pattern generation. In this sense, improvisation is a form of self-expression that can generate connectivity between peers and surpass the age-old rudimentary aspects of school.

==== Scotland ====
In the Scottish education system, creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life, and work, and is defined as &quot;a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual. It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes, and using imagination to explore new possibilities.&quot; The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching, and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim; and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity across all subjects and sectors of education – curiosity, open-mindedness, imagination, and problem solving. Distinctions are made between creative learning (when learners are using their creativity skills), creative teaching (when educators are using their own creativity skills), and creative change (when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement). Scotland&#x27;s national Creative Learning Plan supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators&#x27; expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources has been created to support and assess this, including a national review of creativity learning by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate for Education.

==== China ====
China recognizes that creativity is crucial for national security, social development, and generally benefitting the people. Measures have been proposed to enhance creative ability in the country. 

==== European Union ====
The European Union sees creativity as important for the development of basic skills, and has declared 2009 the Year of Creativity and Innovation. Countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have made the encouragement of creativity a part of their educational and economic policies. 

== Organizational creativity ==
Various research studies set out to establish that organizational effectiveness depends to a large extent on the creativity of the workforce. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon the organization&#x27;s mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself – how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes.

Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists (who research factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations) have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the elements of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture. These theoretical models also emphasize the mutually reinforcing relationships between those elements in promoting innovation.

Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels: macro, meso, and micro. Macro studies are at a societal or transnational level. Meso studies focus on organizations. Micro investigations center on the working of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension when researching business, economics, education, human resource management, knowledge and organizational management, sociology, psychology, knowledge economy-related sectors – especially software, and advertising.

=== Organizational culture ===
Supportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety, encourage risk-taking, and tolerate mistakes increase team creativity. Organizations in which help-seeking, help-giving, and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur. Additionally, leadership styles that downplay hierarchies or power differences within an organization, and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions, also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity.

=== Team composition ===
The diversity of team members&#x27; backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the collection of unique information that is available to the team and by introducing different perspectives that can be integrated in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.

=== Team processes ===
Team communication norms, such as respecting others&#x27; expertise, paying attention to others&#x27; ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, negotiating, remaining open to others&#x27; ideas, learning from others, and building on each other&#x27;s ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving. Through these processes, team members can access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect, which facilitates collective creativity.

=== Constraints ===
There is a long-standing debate on how material constraints (e.g., lack of money, materials, or equipment) affect creativity. In psychological and managerial research, there are two competing views. In one view, scholars propose a negative effect of material constraints on innovation and claim that material constraints starve creativity. Proponents argue that adequate material resources are needed to engage in creative activities such as experimenting with new solutions and idea exploration. In an opposing view, scholars assert that people tend to stick to established routines or solutions as long as they are not forced to deviate from them by constraints. For example, material constraints facilitated the development of jet engines in World War II.

To reconcile these competing views, contingency models were proposed. The rationale behind these models is that certain contingency factors (e.g., creativity climate or creativity-relevant skills) influence the relationship between constraints and creativity. These contingency factors reflect the need for higher levels of motivation and skills when working on creative tasks under constraints. Depending on these contingency factors, there is either a positive or negative relationship between constraints and creativity.

==Fostering creativity==
Several researchers have proposed methods of increasing a person&#x27;s creativity. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive—such as the Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono&#x27;s lateral thinking—to the highly structured—such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided morphological analysis.

An empirical synthesis, of which methods work best in enhancing creativity, was published by Haase et al. Summarising the results of 84 studies, the authors found that complex training courses, meditation, and cultural exposure were most effective in enhancing creativity, while the use of cognitive-manipulation drugs was noneffective.

===Need for closure===
Experiments suggest the need for closure of task participants, whether as a reflection of personality or induced (through time pressure), negatively impacts creativity. Accordingly, it has been suggested that reading fiction, which can reduce the cognitive need for closure, may encourage creativity.

== Malevolent creativity ==
&quot;Malevolent creativity&quot; is the &quot;dark side&quot; of creativity. This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. While it is often associated with criminal behavior, it can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating, and betrayal.

Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is malevolently motivated.

===Crime===
Malevolent creativity is a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is permanent tension between being creative and going too far—in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, and increased levels of aggression correlate with a higher likelihood of committing crime.

===Predictive factors===
Although everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others for their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is treated unfairly, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a key predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving. The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence, and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity. Harris and Reiter-Palmon&#x27;s research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that designed to trigger malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem designed to trigger prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those high in implicit aggression, even if they tended to be highly impulsive, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. The researchers concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression, controlled an individual&#x27;s expression of malevolent creativity.

The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13-item Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale (MCBS).

<doc id="142911" wikidata="Q7799108" url="?curid=142911" title="Thunderbolt (1910 film)">
<text>Thunderbolt is a 1910 Australian feature film based on the life of the bushranger Captain Thunderbolt. It was the directorial debut of John Gavin who later claimed it was the first &quot;four-reel movie&quot; made in Australia. It has also been called the first film made in New South Wales.

The movie was very successful and launched a cycle of bushranger films until they were banned in 1912.

Unlike most Australian silent films, part of the film survives today.

==Synopsis==

Frederick Ward is a cattle drover earning money for his wedding when he is accused of cattle theft and sentenced to seven years at Cockatoo Island. He escapes three years later by swimming across the water only to learn that his fiancée, Jess Anson, has died of grief. He seeks his revenge by taking on a life of crime, becoming the bushranger Captain Thunderbolt.

He befriends some aboriginal people, steals a racehorse, &quot;Combo&quot;, and robs the Moonbi Mail Coach. He then enters &quot;Combo&quot; in a horse race and wins. He is rescued from a police trap involving Chinese by a half-caste girl, Sunday. He is grateful to her and they get married. He then holds up the Carlisle Hotel, and narrowly escapes. He takes on a boy apprentice and Sunday dies. Thunderbolt then dies in a shoot out with police on the riverbank at Uralla.

* Arrest of Frederick Ward, Cattle Duffer. 
* Death Blow of Jess Anson, his Sweetheart. 
* Thunderbolt&#x27;s Escape from the Quarry and Great Swim. 
* Thunderbolt&#x27;s Vow at the Graveside.

==Cast==
* John Gavin as Thunderbolt
* Ruby Butler as Jess Anson/Sunday
* H.A. Forsyth as Monckton, the boy bushranger
* Charles Henry Lay as the prison gang guard and later the sergeant of police.

==Production==

The film was based on the book &quot;Three Years With Thunderbolt&quot; and its play adaptation &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;. R.F. Stephens later claimed he was the one who suggested adapting the play to John Gavin.

H. A. Forsyth produced the film and adapted the play into a screenplay. He also appeared in the film as a young bushranger. John Gavin directed and played the lead role.

The female lead, Ruby Butler, was a model and beauty contest winner.

Because the film was longer than the typical movies of the time Gavin later claimed that &quot;everyone warned him that his venture was doomed to failure&quot;.

Shooting took place in October and November 1910 Lithgow and Hartley Vale, with extras recruited from local miners who were then on strike. Forsyth told the press Lithgow was chosen due to its resemblance to the area where Thunderbolt operated. The scene depicting the death of Thunderbolt was shot near the second junction bridge, on tho road from Bowenfels to Rydal. One scene was shot at the Gap, ten miles from Lithgow. Gavin later recalled:
 When the troopers had to shoot Thunderbolt with blank cartridges, the lead was taken out and the space filled with hard soap. Being near a brewery, both bushrangers and troopers wore imbibing frequently, with the result that when the chase along the road was to commence, nearly all the supers were pretty nigh ‘full of hops. You can believe me, the American cowboy had nothing on some of that wild bunch.
The shoot reportedly took less than three weeks.

==Reception==
A film called &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, about the bushranger, was screened in Wagga Wagga in February 1910. It is unclear whether this is the Gavin film, which officially premiered in Sydney on 12 November 1910.

The movie was usually screened accompanied by a lecturer.

===Critical===
Reviews were generally positive. One critic, for &quot;The Newsletter&quot;, wrote that:
The film has been admirably produced, being as clear and as distinct as any yet shown in Australia, and great credit is due to the bio operator, Mr. Moulton... Mr. Jack Gavin made an impressive Thunderbolt, being a fine upstanding man, big-enough to fight Jack Johnson; and Mr. Bert Forsyth was all that could be desired as Monkton, the boy bushranger. Mr. H. A. Forsyth is to be congratulated upon the success of his initial attempt at picture production, and his efforts augur well for his success in future efforts.
The &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot; stated that:
The various scenes were shown with a clearness that lent realism to the picture, which is one of the best ever thrown on the screen in Newcastle. The outlaw&#x27;s swim from Cockatoo Island, where he had been imprisoned, was a very fine scene, and his theft of a horse followed by his sticking up of the Moonbi mail coach, in which the antics of the passengers caused amusement, was excellent... The audience showed appreciation by loud applause, which the picture deserved thoroughly.
The &quot;Bunbury Southern Times&quot; said that the film &quot;is said to be a masterpiece in motion picture cinematography. This picture is full of exciting and sensational plots.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was a big success at the box office. Gavin said it was &quot;a very successful money maker&quot; that made &quot;a fortune&quot; for its investors. A writer for &quot;The Newsletter&quot; called it &quot;a boon unprecedented in the annals of local picture showdom.&quot; Another article in the same publication said the film was &quot;proving a big draw wherever exhibited, in fact a perfect money spinner, and the firm is troubled to supply the demand the demand made upon their film department.&quot;

&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was so popular, Forsyth indicated he wanted to make further bushranger movies. The &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; declared, &quot;Forsyth has a mine of suitable matter right under his hand, and he has already, demonstrated that the &quot;Southern Cross Enterprise&quot; is capable of producing films of a merit, which renders it unnecessary for showmen to seek their cinematographic repertoire abroad.&quot; Gavin and Forsyth subsequently went on to make a film about Captain Moonlite. Then the two went their separate ways and Gavin made movies on Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner. In advertising Forsyth would claim he was the &quot;original creator&quot; of the films on Thunderbolt and Moonlite, not mentioning Gavin at all.

&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; was still screening in theatres as late as 1916. Gavin wanted to re-release the film in 1922 but was unable to do so due to the ban on bushranging films introduced in 1912.

==The film today==
The film was thought lost but in 1992 1,452 feet of surviving footage constituting 24 minutes was donated to the National Film and Sound Archive in a cake tin. According to the Archive, &quot;the acting in the surviving footage is broad and unconvincing, and several scenes are poorly shot so that the principal action is in fact taking place in the distance rather than the foreground of the shot.&quot;

==Lawsuit==
In 1929 Gavin successfully sued Australasan Films for £150 over losing a copy of the movie.

<text>Mason Jackson (25 May 1819 – 28 December 1903) was an English wood engraver.

==Life==
Jackson was born at Ovingham, Northumberland in 1819, and was trained as a wood engraver by his brother, John Jackson, the author of a history of this art.

In the middle of the 19th century, Jackson&#x27;s prints for &quot;The Art Union&quot; gave him a considerable reputation, along with Charles Knight&#x27;s Shakespeare and other standard books. On the death of Herbert Ingram in 1860, Jackson was appointed art editor of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, a post he held for thirty years. He wrote a history of the rise and progress of illustrated journalism, entitled &quot;The Pictorial Press: Its Origins and Progress&quot;, published in 1885.

Jackson died in December 1903 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Amongst his apprentices was Edmund Morison Wimperis, who became a notable watercolour landscape painter.

<doc id="142915" wikidata="Q194688" url="?curid=142915" title="Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve">
<text>Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve is a protected area in the Northern Territory of Australia located in the locality of Warumungu about south of Tennant Creek, and north of Alice Springs. The nearest settlement is the small town of Wauchope located to the south. The hamlet of Wycliffe Well is located to the south.

The Devils Marbles are of great cultural and spiritual significance to the Aboriginal traditional owners of the land, and the reserve protects one of the oldest religious sites in the world as well as the natural rock formations found there. &quot;Karlu Karlu&quot; is the local Aboriginal term for both the rock features and the surrounding area. The Aboriginal term translates as &quot;round boulders&quot; and refers to the large boulders found mainly in the western side of the reserve. The English name for the boulders derives from a quote by John Ross during the 1870 Australian Overland Telegraph Line expedition, where he said &quot;This is the Devil’s country; he’s even emptied his bag of marbles around the place!&quot;

The area was originally named Devils Marbles Reserve in October 1961. The name was changed to &quot;Devil&#x27;s Marbles Conservation Reserve&quot; on 21 September 1979 under the &quot;Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act&quot;. In 1980, the conservation reserve was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. In 1982, almost the entire reserve was registered as a sacred site by the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority.

Ownership of Karlu Karlu/Devils Marbles was officially passed from the Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory back to the traditional owners at a ceremony held on the reserve in October 2008. The reserve is now leased back to the Parks Service under a 99-year lease and the site is jointly managed by rangers and traditional owners. Visitor access has not been affected, making it an Indigenous Protected Area. On 6 July 2011, the name &quot;Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve&quot; was assigned, corresponding with the joint management structure.

==Features==

The &quot;Devils Marbles&quot; are large granitic boulders that form the exposed top layer of an extensive and mostly underground granite formation. The natural processes of weathering and erosion have created the various shapes of the boulders. Some of the boulders are naturally but precariously balanced atop one another or on larger rock formations, while others have been split cleanly down the middle by natural forces. The boulders are situated in a wide and shallow desert valley, and are found in scattered groups mainly in the western side of the reserve. A short access road leads directly into the boulder fields from the Stuart Highway.

Being one of the most widely recognised symbols of Australia’s outback, the Devils Marbles are also one of the most visited reserves/places in the Northern Territory. The Parks and Wildlife Service recorded 96,172 visitors in 2007. The visitation count increased to 137,500 by 2012. The peak season is in the cooler months from May to August. The reserve is one of the main tourist attractions in the Barkly region since it is easily seen and accessed just off the Stuart Highway, the major north/south road connecting Darwin and Alice Springs, and points further south.

The Devils Marbles are accessible all year round with a network of pathways, information boards and a basic camping area. Rangers offer a program of live events at the site as part of their &quot;Territory Parks Alive&quot; program between May and September each year.

==Aboriginal significance==
Karlu Karlu are culturally and spiritually significant objects of the local Aboriginal people. Most of the conservation reserve is a Registered Sacred Site, protected under the &quot;Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989&quot;. Although Karlu Karlu is within country originally belonging to the Alyawarre people, all of the other local Aboriginal groups, which include the Kaytetye, Warumungu and Warlpiri people, also have spiritual connections and responsibilities for the area.

Accounts of local Aboriginal people believing the boulders to be eggs of the mythical Rainbow Serpent are incorrect. In reality, a number of traditional Dreaming stories (none of which are about serpents) have Karlu Karlu as their setting, hence its great importance as a sacred site. These stories are alive and well and are passed on from generation to generation of traditional owners. Only a handful of stories are considered suitable to tell to uninitiated visitors.

One of the main Dreaming stories for the area which can be told to the public relates to how Karlu Karlu was created. This tradition tells of &quot;Arrange&quot;, the Devil Man, who came from a hill nearby and travelled through the area. Whilst walking along, Arrange made a hair-string belt which is a kind of traditional adornment worn only by initiated men. As he was twirling the hair to make strings, he dropped clusters of hair on the ground.

The clusters turned into the big red boulders at Karlu Karlu that have become so famous today. On his way back to his hill, Arrange spat on the ground. His spit turned into the granite boulders in the central part of the reserve. Arrange finally returned to his place of origin, a hill called &quot;Ayleparrarntenhe&quot; where he remains today.

==Formation==

The Devils Marbles constitute a degraded nubbin. The formation is made of granite and are part of the top layer of a formation which penetrates the ground from below, like little geological islands in the desert, surrounded by large amounts of sandstone. The granite was formed millions of years ago as a result of the hardening of magma within the Earth&#x27;s crust. Thick layers of sandstone on top of the granite exerted extreme downward pressure on the granite. After some time, tectonic forces caused folding of the Earth&#x27;s crust in the area, which lifted the granite and fractured the sandstone, allowing the granite to come closer to the surface. As the pressure diminished, the granite expanded causing cracks to form, and then the larger formations began to separate into big, square blocks.

The next phase of the formation of the Marbles started when the blocks were exposed to water. The surface of the blocks began to decay under the influence of the water and a layer of loose material surrounded the individual blocks. When the blocks came to the surface completely, the loose material was eroded away by water and wind.

The rounding of the granite blocks is a result of chemical and physical (also called mechanical) weathering. Chemical processes cause the surface of the blocks to expand and contract, resulting in thin layers of rock coming off the boulder in a process called exfoliation. This process rounds the granite block because the chemical processes have more effect on areas with edges. The rock begins to look like it is made of layers like an onion. Only the outer few centimetres are affected by chemical weathering in a process called spheroidal weathering.

The boulders are affected more deeply by the extreme temperature differences between day and night in the arid desert region where the reserve is located. During daylight hours the rocks expand slightly and after nightfall they contract slightly, repeating the process every 24 hours. These repeated cycles of expansion and contraction, called thermal stress weathering, create cracks which sometimes go so deep that the boulder is completely split in half.

==Controversy==

One of the boulders was removed from the reserve in 1952 and taken to Alice Springs to form a memorial to John Flynn, the founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The boulder was chosen as a symbol of his link to the outback, but it became the source of a lengthy controversy. The boulder had unwittingly been removed from a sacred site of the Aboriginal women of the area. Eventually, after more than 45 years of negotiations, a boulder swap was arranged and the sacred boulder was removed from the grave and returned to its original place on 4 September 1999. The grave is now marked with a similar but non-sacred boulder donated by the Arrernte people.

<text>Jacobus de Voragine, OP (13/16 July 1298) was an Italian chronicler and archbishop of Genoa. He was the author, or more accurately the compiler, of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, a collection of the legendary lives of the greater saints of the medieval church that was one of the most popular religious works of the Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Jacobus was born either in Varazze or in Genoa, where a family originally from Varazze and bearing that name is attested at the time. He entered the Dominican order in 1244, and became the prior at Como, Bologna and Asti in succession. Besides preaching with success in many parts of Italy, he also taught in the schools of his own fraternity. He was provincial of Lombardy from 1267 till 1286, when he was removed at the meeting of the order in Paris. He also represented his own province at the councils of Lucca (1288) and Ferrara (1290). On the last occasion he was one of the four delegates charged with signifying Pope Nicholas IV&#x27;s desire for the deposition of Munio de Zamora – who had been master of the Dominican order from 1285 and was eventually deprived of his office by a papal bull dated 12 April 1291.

In 1288 Nicholas empowered him to absolve the people of Genoa for their offence in aiding the Sicilians against Charles II. Early in 1292 the same pope, himself a Franciscan, summoned Jacobus to Rome, intending to consecrate him archbishop of Genoa. Jacobus reached Rome on Palm Sunday (30 March), only to find his patron ill of a deadly sickness, from which he died on Good Friday (4 April). The cardinals, however, &quot;propter honorem Communis Januae&quot; (&quot;for the honor of the commune of Genoa&quot;), determined to carry out this consecration on the Sunday after Easter. He was a good bishop, and especially distinguished himself by his efforts to appease the civil discords of Genoa among Guelfs and Ghibellines. A story, mentioned by Échard as unworthy of credit, makes Pope Boniface VIII, on the first day of Lent, cast the ashes in the archbishop&#x27;s eyes instead of on his head, with the words, &quot;Remember that thou art a Ghibelline, and with thy fellow Ghibellines wilt return to naught.&quot;

He died in 1298 or 1299, and was buried in the Dominican church at Genoa. He was beatified by Pius VII in 1816.

==Works==
Jacobus de Voragine left a list of his own works. Speaking of himself in his &quot;Chronicon januense&quot;, he says: &quot;While he was in his order, and after he had been made archbishop, he wrote many works. For he compiled the legends of the saints (&quot;Legenda sanctorum&quot;) in one volume, adding many things from the &quot;Historia tripartita et scholastica,&quot; and from the chronicles of many writers.&quot;

The other writings he claims are two anonymous volumes of &quot;Sermons concerning all the Saints&quot; whose yearly feasts the church celebrates. Of these volumes, he adds, one is very diffuse, but the other short and concise. Then follow &quot;Sermones de omnibus evangeliis dominicalibus&quot; for every Sunday in the year; &quot;Sermones de omnibus evangeliis,&quot; i.e., a book of discourses on all the Gospels, from Ash Wednesday to the Tuesday after Easter; and a treatise called &quot;Marialis, qui totus est de B. Maria compositus,&quot; consisting of about 160 discourses on the attributes, titles, etc., of the Virgin Mary. In the same work the archbishop claims to have written his &quot;Chronicon januense&quot; in the second year of his episcopate (1293), but it extends to 1296 or 1297.

To Jacobus&#x27; own list his biographer Giovanni Monleone adds several other works, such as a defence of the Dominicans, printed at Venice in 1504, and a &quot;Summa virtutum et vitiorum Guillelmi Peraldi,&quot; a Dominican who died in 1271. Jacobus is also said by Sixtus of Siena (&quot;Biblioth. Sacra,&quot; lib. ix) to have translated the Old and New Testaments into his own tongue. &quot;But,&quot; adds the historian of the Dominican order Jacques Échard, &quot;if he did so, the version lies so closely hid that there is no recollection of it,&quot; and it may be added that it is highly improbable that the man who compiled the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; ever conceived the necessity of having the Scriptures in the vernacular.

===The &quot;Golden Legend&quot;===

The &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, one of the most popular religious works of the Middle Ages, is a collection of the legendary lives of the greater saints of the medieval church. The preface divides the ecclesiastical year into four periods corresponding to the various epochs of the world&#x27;s history, a time of deviation, of renovation, of reconciliation and of pilgrimage. The book itself, however, falls into five sections: (a) from Advent to Christmas (cc. 1–5); (b) from Christmas to Septuagesima (6–30); (c) from Septuagesima to Easter (31–53); (d) from Easter Day to the octave of Pentecost (54–76); (e) from the octave of Pentecost to Advent (77–180). The saints&#x27; lives are full of fanciful legend, and in not a few cases contain accounts of 13th century miracles wrought at special places, particularly with reference to the Dominicans. The penultimate chapter (181), &quot;De Sancto Pelagio Papa&quot;, contains a universal history from the point of view of Lombardy, or &quot;Historia Lombardica&quot; (History of Lombardy&quot;), from the middle of the 6th century. The last (182) is a somewhat allegorical disquisition on the dedication of churches, &quot;De dedicatione ecclesiae&quot;.

The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; was translated into Catalan in the 13th century and a first dated version was published in Barcelona in 1494. A French version was made by Jean Belet de Vigny in the 14th century. A Latin edition is assigned to about 1469; and a dated one was published at Lyon in 1473. Many other Latin editions were printed before the end of the century. A French translation by Master John Bataillier is dated 1476; Jean de Vigny&#x27;s appeared at Paris, 1488; an Italian one by Nic. Manerbi (?Venice, 1475); a Czech one at Plzeň, 1475–1479, and at Prague, 1495; Caxton&#x27;s English versions, 1483, 1487, and 1493; and a German one in 1489. Overall, during the first five decades of printing in Europe, editions of the &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; appeared at a rate of about two per year.

===&quot;Sermones&quot; and &quot;Mariale&quot;===
Almost as popular as the &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; were Jacobus&#x27; collected sermons, also termed &quot;Aurei&quot;. Several 15th-century editions of the &quot;Sermons&quot; are also known; while his &quot;Mariale&quot; was printed at Venice in 1497 and at Paris in 1503.

===&quot;Chronicon januense&quot;===
Jacobus&#x27; other chief work is his &quot;Chronicon januense&quot;, a history of Genoa. It is divided into twelve parts. The first four deal with the mythical history of the city from the time of its founder, Janus, called the first king of Italy, and its enlarger, a second Janus, &quot;citizen of Troy&quot;, till its conversion to Christianity &quot;about twenty-five years after the passion of Christ&quot;. The fifth part professes to treat of the beginning, growth and perfection of the city; but of the first period the writer candidly confesses he knows nothing except by hearsay. The second period includes the Genoese crusading exploits in the East, and extends to their victory over the Pisans (c. 1130), while the third reaches down to the author&#x27;s days as archbishop. The sixth part deals with the constitution of the city, the seventh and eighth with the duties of rulers and citizens, the ninth with those of domestic life. The tenth gives the ecclesiastical history of Genoa from the time of its first known bishop, Saint Valentine, &quot;whom we believe to have lived about 530 A.D.&quot;, until 1133, when the city was raised to archiepiscopal rank. The eleventh contains the lives of all the bishops in order, and includes the chief events during their episcopates; the twelfth deals in the same way with the archbishops, not forgetting the writer himself.

==Marian views==
Jacobus is relevant to mariology in light of his numerous Marian sermons, &quot;Sermones de sanctis per circulum anni feliciter&quot; and his &quot;Laudes Beatae Mariae Virginis&quot;. He describes the miracles of Mary and explains specific local customs and usages on Marian feast days. Since most of these usages do not exist anymore, Jacobus de Varagine serves as a valuable source for the study of medieval Marian customs. Theologically Jacobus is one of the first of several Christian writers, who view Mary as mediatrix or mediator between God and humanity. In his view of the mystical body of Christ, she is the &quot;neck&quot; through which &quot;all&quot; graces flow from Christ to his body. This view was later shared by others such as Bernardino of Siena, and, most recently, by one of the noted mariologists of the 20th century, Gabriel Roschini.

<doc id="142917" wikidata="Q622038" url="?curid=142917" title="Joseph Jacotot">
<text>Joseph (or Jean-Joseph) Jacotot (4 March 177030 July 1840) was a French teacher and educational philosopher, creator of the method of &quot;intellectual emancipation.&quot;

==Life==
Jacotot was born at Dijon on 4 March 1770. He was educated at the university of Dijon, where in his nineteenth year he was made a professor of Latin, after which he studied law, became a lawyer, and at the same time devoted a large amount of his attention to mathematics.

In 1788 he organized a federation of the youth of Dijon for the defence of the principles of the Revolution; and in 1792, with the rank of captain, he set out to take part in the campaign of Belgium, where he conducted himself with bravery and distinction. After filling the office of secretary of the &quot;commission d’organisation du mouvement des armées&quot;, in 1794 he became deputy of the director of the École Polytechnique. Upon the founding of the central schools at Dijon he was appointed to the chair of the &quot;method&quot; or instruction of science. There he made his first experiments in his &quot;emancipatory&quot; method of teaching. When the central schools were replaced by other educational institutions, Jacotot occupied the chairs of mathematics and of Roman law until the overthrow of the empire. In 1815 he was elected a representative to the chamber of deputies; but after the Second Restoration he found it necessary to quit his native land.

Having taken up his residence at Brussels, in 1818 Jacotot was nominated teacher of the French language at the University of Louvain, where he systematized the educational principles which he had already practised successfully in France.

==Teaching method==
His emancipatory or &quot;panecastic&quot; (French: &quot;panécastique&quot; &quot;everything in each&quot; from Greek and ) method was not only adopted in several institutions in Belgium, but also met with some approval in France, England, Germany, and Russia. It was based on three principles:

# all men have equal intelligence;
# every man has received from God the faculty of being able to instruct himself;
# everything is in everything.

Regarding the first principle, he maintained that it is only in the will to use their intelligence that men differ. His own process, depending on the third principle, was to give a student learning a language for the first time a short passage of a few lines, and to encourage the pupil to study first the words, then the letters, then the grammar, then the meaning, until a single paragraph became the occasion for learning an entire literature. A book that he often used as a source material for learning was &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot;. After the revolution of 1830 Jacotot returned to France, and he died in Paris on 30 July 1840.

Jacotot described his system in &quot;Enseignement universel (universal education), langue maternelle&quot; (Louvain and Dijon, 1823)—which passed through several editions—and in various other works; and he also advocated his views in the &quot;Journal de l’émancipation intellectuelle&quot; and elsewhere. For a complete list of his works and fuller details regarding his career, see &quot;Biographie de J. Jacotot&quot;, by Achille Guillard (Paris, 1860).

Jacotot&#x27;s educational doctrines became popular in England through the interest taken by British educationalist Joseph Payne in a study of his work, called &quot;A Compendious Exposition of the Principles and Practice of Professor Jacotot’s Celebrated System of Education (1830).&quot;

<text>Joseph Marie Charles &quot;dit&quot; (called or nicknamed) Jacquard (; 7 July 1752 – 7 August 1834) was a French weaver and merchant. He played an important role in the development of the earliest programmable loom (the &quot;Jacquard loom&quot;), which in turn played an important role in the development of other programmable machines, such as an early version of digital compiler used by IBM to develop the modern day computer.

== Life ==
In his grandfather&#x27;s generation, several branches of the Charles family lived in Lyon&#x27;s Couzon-Au-Mont d’Or suburb (on Lyon&#x27;s north side, along the Saône River). To distinguish the various branches, the community gave them nicknames; Joseph&#x27;s branch was called &quot;Jacquard&quot; Charles. Thus, Joseph&#x27;s grandfather was Bartholomew Charles &quot;dit&quot; [called] Jacquard.

Joseph Marie Charles &quot;dit&quot; Jacquard was born into a conservative Catholic family in Lyon, France, on 7 July 1752. He was one of nine children of Jean Charles &quot;dit&quot; Jacquard, a master weaver of Lyon, and his wife, Antoinette Rive. However, only Joseph and his sister Clémence (born 7 November 1747) survived to adulthood. Although his father was a man of property, Joseph received no formal schooling and remained illiterate until he was 13. He was finally taught by his brother-in-law, Jean-Marie Barret, who ran a printing and book selling business. Barret also introduced Joseph to learned societies and scholars. Joseph initially helped his father operate his loom, but the work proved too arduous, so Jacquard was placed first with a bookbinder and then with a maker of printers&#x27; type.

His mother died in 1762, and when his father died in 1772, Joseph inherited his father&#x27;s house, looms and workshop as well as a vineyard and quarry in Couzon-au-Mont d’Or. Joseph then dabbled in real estate. In 1778, he listed his occupations as master weaver and silk merchant. Jacquard&#x27;s occupation at this time is problematic because by 1780 most silk weavers did not work independently; instead, they worked for wages from silk merchants, and Jacquard was not registered as a silk merchant in Lyon.

There is some confusion about Jacquard&#x27;s early work history. British economist Sir John Bowring met Jacquard, who told Bowring that at one time he had been a maker of straw hats. Eymard claimed that before becoming involved in the weaving of silk, Jacquard was a type-founder (a maker of printers&#x27; type), a soldier, a bleacher (&quot;blanchisseur&quot;) of straw hats, and a lime burner (a maker of lime for mortar). Barlow claims that before marrying, Jacquard had worked for a bookbinder, a type-founder, and a maker of cutlery. After marrying, Jacquard tried cutlery making, type-founding, and weaving. However, Barlow does not cite any sources for that information.

On 26 July 1778, Joseph married Claudine Boichon. She was a middle-class widow from Lyon who owned property and had a substantial dowry. However, Joseph soon fell deeply into debt and was brought to court. Barlow claims that after Jacquard&#x27;s father died, Jacquard started a figure-weaving business but failed and lost all his wealth. However, Barlow cites no sources to support his claim. To settle his debts, he was obliged to sell his inheritance and to appropriate his wife&#x27;s dowry. His wife retained a house in Oullins (on Lyon&#x27;s south side, along the Rhone River), where the couple resided. On 19 April 1779, the couple had their only child, a son, Jean Marie. Charles Ballot stated that after the rebellion of Lyon in 1793 was suppressed, Joseph and his son escaped from the city by joining the revolutionary army. They fought together in the Rhine campaign of 1795, serving in the Rhone-and-Loire battalion under General Jean Charles Pichegru. Joseph&#x27;s son was killed outside of Heidelberg. However, Ballot repeated rumors and was a sloppy historian. For example, he stated that Jacquard&#x27;s wife Claudette Boichon was the daughter of Antoine-Hélon Boichon, a master swordsmith, whereas Claudette was a widow who had been married to a Mr. Boichon before she married Jacquard.

By 1800, Joseph began inventing various devices. He invented a treadle loom in 1800, a loom to weave fishing nets in 1803, and starting in 1804, the &quot;Jacquard&quot; loom, which would weave patterned silk automatically. However, these early inventions did not operate well and thus were unsuccessful.

In 1801, Jacquard exhibited his invention at the Exposition des produits de l&#x27;industrie française in Paris, where he was awarded a bronze medal.
In 1803 he was summoned to Paris and attached to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. A loom by Jacques de Vaucanson on display there suggested various improvements in his own, which he gradually perfected to its final state. The loom was declared public property in 1805, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. Although his invention was fiercely opposed by the silk-weavers, who feared that its introduction, owing to the saving of labour, would deprive them of their livelihood, its advantages secured its general adoption, and by 1812 there were 11,000 Jacquard looms in use in France. This claim has been challenged: Initially few Jacquard looms were sold because of problems with the punched card mechanism. Only after 1815 — once Jean Antoine Breton had solved the problems with the punched card mechanism — did sales of looms increase.

Jacquard died at Oullins (Rhône), 7 August 1834. Six years later, a statue was erected to him in Lyon, on the site where his 1801 exhibit loom was destroyed.

==Jacquard machine==

The Jacquard Loom is a mechanical loom that uses pasteboard cards with punched holes, each card corresponding to one row of the design. Multiple rows of holes are punched in the cards and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order. It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1728) and Jacques Vaucanson (1740).

To understand the Jacquard loom, some basic knowledge of weaving is necessary. Parallel threads (the &quot;warp&quot;) are stretched across a rectangular frame (the &quot;loom&quot;). For plain cloth, every other warp thread is raised. Another thread (the &quot;weft thread&quot;) is then passed (at a right angle to the warp) through the space (the &quot;shed&quot;) between the lower and the upper warp threads. Then the raised warp threads are lowered, the alternate warp threads are raised, and the weft thread is passed through the shed in the opposite direction. With hundreds of such cycles, the cloth is gradually created.

By raising different (not just alternate) warp threads and using colored threads in the weft, the texture, color, design, and pattern can be varied to create varied and highly desirable fabrics. Weaving elaborate patterns or designs manually is a slow, complicated procedure subject to error. Jacquard&#x27;s loom was intended to automate this process.

Jacquard was not the first to try to automate the process of weaving. In 1725 Basile Bouchon invented an attachment for draw looms that used a broad strip of punched paper to select the warp threads that would be raised during weaving. Specifically, Bouchon&#x27;s innovation involved a row of hooks. The curved portion of each hook snagged a string that could raise one of the warp threads, whereas the straight portion of each hook pressed against the punched paper, which was draped around a perforated cylinder. Whenever the hook pressed against the solid paper, pushing the cylinder forward would raise the corresponding warp thread; whereas whenever the hook met a hole in the paper, pushing the cylinder forward would allow the hook to slip inside the cylinder and the corresponding warp thread would not be raised. Bouchon&#x27;s loom was unsuccessful because it could handle only a modest number of warp threads.

By 1737, a master silk weaver of Lyon, Jean Falcon, had increased the number of warp threads that the loom could handle automatically. He developed an attachment for looms in which Bouchon&#x27;s paper strip was replaced by a chain of punched cards, which could deflect multiple rows of hooks simultaneously. Like Bouchon, Falcon used a &quot;cylinder&quot; (actually, a four-sided perforated tube) to hold each card in place while it was pressed against the rows of hooks. His loom was modestly successful; about 40 such looms had been sold by 1762.

In 1741, Jacques de Vaucanson, a French inventor who designed and built automated mechanical toys, was appointed inspector of silk factories. Between 1747 and 1750, he tried to automate Bouchon&#x27;s mechanism. In Vaucanson&#x27;s mechanism, the hooks that were to lift the warp threads were selected by long pins or &quot;needles&quot;, which were pressed against a sheet of punched paper that was draped around a perforated cylinder. Specifically, each hook passed at a right angle through an eyelet of a needle. When the cylinder was pressed against the array of needles, some of the needles, pressing against solid paper, would move forward, which in turn would tilt the corresponding hooks. The hooks that were tilted would &quot;not&quot; be raised, so the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would remain in place; however, the hooks that were &quot;not&quot; tilted, would be raised, and the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would also be raised. By placing his mechanism above the loom, Vaucanson eliminated the complicated system of weights and cords (tail cords, simple, pulley box, etc.) that had been used to select which warp threads were to be raised during weaving. Vaucanson also added a ratchet mechanism to advance the punched paper each time that the cylinder was pushed against the row of hooks. However, Vaucanson&#x27;s loom was not successful, probably because, like Bouchon&#x27;s mechanism, it could not control enough warp threads to make sufficiently elaborate patterns to justify the cost of the mechanism.

To stimulate the French textile industry, which was competing with Britain&#x27;s industrialized industry, Napoleon Bonaparte placed large orders for Lyon&#x27;s silk, starting in 1802. In 1804, at the urging of Lyon fabric maker and inventor Gabriel Dutillieu, Jacquard studied Vaucanson&#x27;s loom, which was stored at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. By 1805 Jacquard had eliminated the paper strip from Vaucanson&#x27;s mechanism and returned to using Falcon&#x27;s chain of punched cards.

The potential of Jacquard&#x27;s loom was immediately recognized. On 12 April 1805, Emperor Napoleon and Empress Josephine visited Lyon and viewed Jacquard&#x27;s new loom. On 15 April 1805, the emperor granted the patent for Jacquard&#x27;s loom to the city of Lyon. In return, Jacquard received a lifelong pension of 3,000 francs; furthermore, he received a royalty of 50 francs for each loom that was bought and used during the period from 1805 to 1811.

<text>The Countryside Alliance (CA) is a British organisation promoting issues relating to the countryside such as farming, rural services, small businesses and field sports, aiming to &quot;Give Rural Britain a voice&quot;.

==History==
The Countryside Alliance was formed on 10 July 1997 from three organisations: the British Field Sports Society, the Countryside Business Group, and the Countryside Movement. The Alliance was formed to help promote and defend the British countryside and rural life, both in the media and in Parliament. Since then, the Countryside Alliance has campaigned on a number of issues which they believe are important to rural Britain. In 2008 organisation was named the &#x27;most inspiring political personality&#x27; of the last ten years by &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;.
It broadly outlines its major campaigns through a Rural Charter which focuses on the following major themes:

* &#x27;Make Brexit work for the countryside&#x27;
* &#x27;Buy British by supporting our farmers and producers&#x27;
* &#x27;Recognise the importance of wildlife management and the value of hunting, shooting and fishing&#x27;
* &#x27;Connect the countryside by delivering first class digital infrastructure&#x27;
* &#x27;Tackle crime in rural areas&#x27;

===Campaigns===

== The Countryside Alliance Foundation ==
The Countryside Alliance Foundation is the charitable arm of the organisation. Its mission aim, according to its website, is to &quot;help adults and children alike make the most of the incredible remedial and educational benefits of being involved in the natural environment. By introducing people to the delights of rural Britain we hope to inspire them to become passionate about the countryside, and helping to protect the natural environment.&quot;

The Foundation&#x27;s core projects include the Casting For Recovery (UK and Ireland) programme, Fishing for Schools and Falconry for Schools.

=== Casting for Recovery ===
The Casting for Recovery programme was set up by The Foundation to provide women affected by breast cancer treatment with an opportunity to learn the sport of fly fishing as part of a free weekend retreat. The retreats are run by health care volunteers, qualified fishing instructors and fishing guides. The programme was established by Sue Shaw. In an article for the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;, the aim of the programme is stated to be &quot;to give the women a shared, safe environment in which to discuss their illness and share experiences. They receive all the latest advice from an oncology nurse and an on-staff counsellor is also there to lend expertise on the specific fears and worries associated with breast cancer. Retreats can stir up emotions for many of the women, so the professionalism and expertise of the medics and counsellors is vital.&quot;

=== Fishing for Schools ===
Fishing for Schools was set up in 2007 by award-winning angler Charles Jardine. In a profile piece written by David Profumo for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the programme is described as being &quot;aimed at students in secondary education, especially those with learning difficulties, physical disabilities and a spectrum of special needs. Working alongside teachers in and out of the classroom, it explores core curricular subjects (maths, natural science, English) through the medium of angling and its range of associated skills – social, practical and interactive. It fills the gap between fun and academia.&quot; According to its webpage, the programme offers participants between the ages of 10-16 the opportunity to gain qualifications through accredited schemes run by ASDAN, COPE, BTEC and NOCN.

=== Falconry for Schools ===
The Falconry for Schools project sees birds of prey taken into primary and secondary schools, with an aim of teaching knowledge and understanding of the natural world to pupils as part of general subjects relating to history, science and technology.

== The Countryside Alliance Awards ==
The Countryside Alliance Awards is a national awards scheme set up in 2006, also known as The Rural Oscars. Its aim is to &quot;award rural businesses that go the extra mile, who support their local economy and are unsung heroes in every community&quot;. The awards are led by public nominations, covering seven categories: village shop/post office, local food and drink, rural enterprise, pub, butcher, game and the Clarissa Dickson Wright award, which was instituted in 2013.

In 2019, the Countryside Alliance stated that it had received over 17,000 nominations. The awards ceremony is usually held in the month of June at the House of Lords. Previous judges have included Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Liz Truss, William Sitwell and the late Clarissa Dickson Wright.

== Key campaigns ==

=== Tackling rural crime ===
The Countryside Alliance provides a number of guides for its members and the wider public that relate to crimes often associated as common rural crimes. These include dog theft, fly-tipping, sheep rustling, hare poaching, fuel theft as well as the impact of hunt saboteurs and online bullying.

==== Church and religious buildings crime report ====
In November 2019, the Countryside Alliance produced a report which detailed the number of crimes recorded by police forces at churches and other religious buildings in England, Wales and Northern Ireland using powers under Freedom of Information laws. Police Scotland did not comply with the request. The final report found that between January 2017 and July 2019 over 20,000 crimes had been recorded, which included lead and metal theft, general theft, violent assault and vandalism. Following the publication of the report, The Countryside Alliance issued the following public statement: &quot;As a society, irrespective of faith or none, we need to be much more vigilant when it comes to watching over churches and places of worship by reporting suspicious activity. These figures serve as a reminder of the importance of funding and pushing for visible policing, particularly in rural areas where churches are more remote.&quot;

=== Food and farming ===
The Countryside Alliance describes the food and farming industry as &quot;nationally important&quot; arguing it is responsible for &quot;generating over £108 billion a year for the UK economy and employing one in eight people. It is particularly important for our most rural areas where farming is often central to the economic and social life of the community as well as playing a vital role in conservation&quot;.

==== Campaign for &#x27;proper&#x27; labelling ====
During the UK General Election of 2019, the organisation called for the next government to ensure food labelling showed where an animal was reared and slaughtered for all meat – including that where meat is an ingredient and part of an overall product. It argued &quot;Country of origin food labelling must be mandatory for all processed meat to ensure a level playing field for hard-working British farmers after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.&quot;

==== Opposition to Animal Rebellion ====
Following a planned occupation of Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London in opposition to the meat industry by animal rights group Animal Rebellion, the Countryside Alliance publicly stated that the group&#x27;s activities would put the livelihoods of farmers and traders at risk. Speaking to The Telegraph newspaper, The CA&#x27;s Chief Executive Tim Bonner said: &quot;Their idea of a day out is to cause misery to others. They (Animal Rebellion) mask their political driven agenda by pretending to care about animals. They are fuelled by hatred of people and those that opt for an alternative lifestyle to them.&quot; A spokesman for the Countryside Alliance attended the occupation on 7 October 2019 to record a public video, opposing Animal Rebellion and calling on consumers to back UK farmers and sustainable meat production.

=== Campaign for Shooting ===
The Campaign for Shooting &quot;gives a clear political and public voice to the shooting community&quot;. It lists its objectives as: to secure and enhance the long-term sustainability of the sport, and its associated land management practices, and to manage and reduce political risk at local, national and devolved levels.

On 12 August 2019, the Labour Party claimed that the financial benefits of shooting grouse were outweighed by the environmental cost and subsequently called for its review. The Countryside Alliance&#x27;s Director of Shooting Adrian Blackmore stated &quot;those with any knowledge of grouse shooting and its associated management will know that some of the claims being made by Labour are complete nonsense, and if an independent review into grouse shooting would help increase Labour&#x27;s understanding of its considerable environmental, economic and social benefits, then it should be welcomed.&quot;

=== Campaign for Hunting ===
The inception of the Hunting Act 2004 on 18 February 2005 saw traditional foxhunting and other forms of hunting with hounds become restricted. According to its website, The Countryside Alliance supports all forms of legal hunting, but continues to make clear that it will oppose what they believe is ultimately a bad piece of legislation. The group has stated that the ban, brought forward by the then Labour administration under Tony Blair, is &quot;the worst possible example of a law that was passed as an attack on a minority in society&quot;.

A proposed ban on trail-hunting and hound exercise on public land submitted by a Labour Councillor in Essex saw the Countryside Alliance campaign against the motion brought forward to Essex County Council on 14 May 2019. The motion was defeated at a meeting of the Full Council at County Hall.

Following an announcement by the Labour Party in August 2019 that it would strengthen the Hunting Act, the Countryside Alliance accused them of &quot;reverting to class war&quot; and said &quot;We can&#x27;t get any straight answers on what the problem (with foxhunting) is or what solutions Labour have, other than they seem to desperately want people who wear red coats and ride horses in court&quot;.

==== Boxing Day Meet ====
The Countryside Alliance promotes the annual Boxing Day Meet of registered hunts throughout the United Kingdom, using an online mapping tool. It reports that around 300 hunts meet annually, with 25 in Yorkshire alone.

=== Digital communications ===
The Countryside Alliance campaigns for better broadband and mobile connectivity in rural areas.

During the UK General Election of 2019 the group welcomed an announcement by the Conservative Party, which pledged to fast-track a plan for a &#x27;Shared Rural Network&#x27;, which the Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed would see new masts built and existing infrastructure shared between the four mobile phone providers – 02, Three, Vodafone and EE. A CA spokesman said at the time &quot;For far too long the countryside has been left behind when it comes to mobile connectivity.&quot;

The Countryside Alliance publicly opposed a policy announcement by the Labour Party in November 2019, which pledged to nationalise broadband and provide free full-fibre broadband by 2030. The group stated on its website that &quot;The Countryside Alliance is concerned that Labour&#x27;s proposals to renationalise BT risks delaying broadband delivery in rural areas. By removing private investment and stifling competition, especially in the most remote areas of the countryside, they will disincentivise other tech businesses from delivering innovative solutions which are so important in closing the digital divide.&quot;

== Hunting with hounds ==

The Alliance has long defended hunting and shooting, especially hunting with hounds, opposing the legislation (the Hunting Act 2004) which came into effect in England and Wales in February 2005. Amongst other causes, the Scottish Countryside Alliance campaigns against the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, which prohibited hunting north of the border. In 2002, the Alliance organised the Liberty &amp; Livelihood March, one of the largest demonstrations in British history with almost half a million people marching through London to demonstrate against the proposed ban. The Countryside Alliance mounted a series of legal challenges to the Hunting Act 2004 which were unsuccessful.

Following the first conviction under the act, on 4 August 2006, the Alliance reaffirmed its belief that legislation was &quot;illogical and unclear&quot; and vowed to support the appeal against the conviction, which was later successful.

Critics of the Alliance claim that this is the sole focus of the organisation, a claim it denies, saying that this campaigning is a response to the (previous) government&#x27;s &quot;preoccupation with the issue&quot;. On BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 18 November 2014, Ann Mallalieu stated &quot;What&#x27;s actually happened to the foxes...because of the growth of commercial shooting...foxes are being shot at night by lampers...people with bright lights shooting them with guns...&quot;

==Countryside March: Liberty &amp; Livelihood ==
In September 2002, the Countryside Alliance organised a march in central London to promote the interests of rural Britain. It was dubbed one of the largest marches of its type in history, with the BBC reporting around 400,000 in attendance. The Countryside Alliance hailed the march as a huge success and it called on the government to make a &quot;considered response&quot;. While a central focus of the march was to show opposition to a ban on hunting with hounds in England and Wales, a wide range of other grievances from rural communities were also being linked with the demonstration around farming. Over 300,000 people were in attendance, including Iain Duncan Smith, Vinnie Jones, Edward Fox, Clarissa Dickson-Wright, Earl Spencer, and Michael Marsham, 7th Earl of Romney. Richard Burge, the then Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance, said of the march &quot;This is a march for the people and by the people and not simply rural people.The strength of support, not just from the countryside, but from towns and cities across the UK makes us feel both humble and proud.&quot; The British National Party had called for its members to join the march and support the countryside; however, the Countryside Alliance issued the following statement: &quot;Everything we stand for is the opposite of what they believe in.&quot;

==Countryside Rocks==
The organisation held fundraising rock concerts in 2006 and 2007 under the banner &quot;Countryside Rocks&quot; which have attracted support from stars including Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters, The Who&#x27;s Roger Daltrey, Procol Harum&#x27;s Keith Reid, Roxy Music&#x27;s Bryan Ferry, Eric Clapton and Genesis&#x27; Mike Rutherford.

==Conflict with conservationists==
The Countryside Alliance has previously expressed repeated concern over the governance of the RSPCA, which it argues has resulted in the charity pursuing &quot;extremely questionable activities&quot;. In 2017 the Charity Commission announced it would be intervening, complaining that the RSPCA&#x27;s standards of governance were &#x27;unacceptably low&#x27;. In 2018, the Countryside Alliance&#x27;s Chief Executive, Tim Bonner, argued that despite the intervention and recommendations by the Charity Commission, the RSPCA had not changed. In a 2013 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the Alliance&#x27;s executive chairman, Lieutenant General Sir Barney White-Spunner, called the RSPCA a &quot;sinister and nasty&quot; organisation and urged Alliance members to stop donating to it. The RSPCA responded by saying: &quot;Sir Barney White-Spunner&#x27;s interview shows once again how far out of touch he and his colleagues at the pro-bloodsports Countryside Alliance are with the reality of public opinion in this country.&quot; The Alliance has also criticised the RSPB and called for the sacking of TV presenter Chris Packham.

<text>Wintel (portmanteau of &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Intel&quot;) is the partnership of Microsoft and Intel producing personal computers (PCs) using Intel x86-compatible processors running Windows.

== Background ==
By the early 1980s, the chaos and incompatibility that was rife in the early microcomputer market had given way to a smaller number of de facto industry standards, including the S-100 bus expansion board, the CP/M operating system, the Apple II home computer, the use of the programming language Microsoft BASIC in read-only memory (ROM), and the inch floppy drive storage medium. Firms competed fiercely to control the industry, and innovation in hardware and software was the rule. Microsoft Windows and Intel processors gained ascendance and their ongoing alliance gave them market dominance.

Intel has claimed that this partnership has enabled the two companies to give customers the benefit of &quot;a seemingly unending spiral of falling prices and rising performance&quot;. In addition, they claim a &quot;history of innovation&quot; and &quot;a shared vision of flexible computing for the agile business&quot;.

== IBM ==

In 1981, IBM entered the microcomputer market. The IBM PC was created by a small subdivision of the firm. It was unusual for an IBM product because it was largely sourced from outside component suppliers and was intended to run third-party operating systems and software. IBM published the technical specifications and schematics of the PC, which allowed third-party companies to produce compatible hardware, the so-called open architecture. The IBM PC became one of the most successful computers of all time. 

The key feature of the IBM PC was that it had IBM&#x27;s enormous public respect behind it. It was an accident of history that the IBM PC happened to have an Intel CPU (instead of the technically superior Motorola 68000 that had been tipped for it, or an IBM in-house design), and that it shipped with IBM PC DOS (a licensed version of Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS) rather than the CP/M-86 operating system, but these accidents were to have enormous significance in later years.

Because the IBM PC was an IBM product with the IBM badge, personal computers became respectable. It became easier for a business to justify buying a microcomputer than it had been even a year or two before, and easiest of all to justify buying the IBM Personal Computer. Since the PC architecture was well documented in IBM&#x27;s manuals, and PC DOS was designed to be similar to the earlier CP/M operating system, the PC soon had thousands of different third-party add-in cards and software packages available. This made the PC the preferred option for many, since the PC supported the hardware and software they needed.

== Competitors ==
Industry competitors took one of several approaches to the changing market. Some (such as Apple, Amiga, Atari, and Acorn) persevered with their independent and quite different systems. Of those systems, Apple&#x27;s Mac is the only one remaining on the market. Others (such as Digital, then the world&#x27;s second-largest computer company, Hewlett-Packard, and Apricot) concentrated on making similar but technically superior models. Other early market leaders (such as Tandy-Radio Shack or Texas Instruments) stayed with outdated architectures and proprietary operating systems for some time before belatedly realizing which way market trends were going and switching to the most successful long-term business strategy, which was to build a machine that duplicated the IBM PC as closely as possible and sell it for a slightly lower price, or with higher performance. Given the very conservative engineering of the early IBM personal computers and their higher than average prices, this was not a terribly difficult task at first, bar only the great technical challenge of crafting a BIOS that duplicated the function of the IBM BIOS exactly but did not infringe on copyrights.

The two early leaders in this last strategy were both start-up companies: Columbia Data Products and Compaq. They were the first to achieve reputations for very close compatibility with the IBM machines, which meant that they could run software written for the IBM machine without recompilation. Before long, IBM had the best-selling personal computer in the world and at least two of the next-best sellers were, for practical purposes, identical.

For the software industry, the effect was profound. First, it meant that it was rational to write for the IBM PC and its clones as a high priority, and port versions for less common systems at leisure.

Second (and even more importantly), when a software writer in pre-IBM days had to be careful to use as plain a subset of the possible techniques as practicable (so as to be able to run on any hardware that ran CP/M), with a major part of the market now all using the same exact hardware (or a very similar clone of it) it was practical to take advantage of any and every hardware-specific feature offered by the IBM.

Independent BIOS companies like Award, Chips and Technologies, and Phoenix began to market a clean room BIOS that was 100% compatible with IBM&#x27;s, and from that time on any competent computer manufacturer could achieve IBM compatibility as a matter of routine.

From around 1984, the market was fast growing but relatively stable. There was as yet no sign of the &quot;Win&quot; half of &quot;Wintel,&quot; though Microsoft was achieving enormous revenues from DOS sales both to IBM and to an ever-growing list of other manufacturers who had agreed to buy an MS-DOS license for every machine they made, even those that shipped with competing products. As for Intel, every PC made either had an Intel processor or one made by a second source supplier under license from Intel. Intel and Microsoft had enormous revenues, Compaq and many other makers between them made far more machines than IBM, but the power to decide the shape of the personal computer rested firmly in IBM&#x27;s hands.

In 1987, IBM introduced the PS/2 computer line. Although the open architecture of the PC and its successors had been a great success for them, and they were the biggest single manufacturer, most of the market was buying faster and cheaper IBM-compatible machines made by other firms. The PS/2s remained software compatible, but the hardware was quite different. It introduced the technically superior Micro Channel architecture bus for higher speed communication within the system, but failed to maintain the open AT bus (later called the ISA bus), which meant that none of the millions of existing add-in cards would function. In other words, the new IBM machines were not IBM-compatible.

Further, IBM planned the PS/2 in such a way that for both technical and legal reasons it would be very difficult to clone. Instead, IBM offered to sell a PS/2 licence to anyone who could afford the royalty. They would not only require a royalty for every PS/2-compatible machine sold, but also a payment for every IBM-compatible machine the particular maker had ever made in the past.

Many PC manufacturers signed up as PS/2 licensees. (Apricot, who had lost badly by persevering with their &quot;better PC than IBM&quot; strategy up until this time, was one of them, but there were many others.) Many others decided to hold off before committing themselves. Some major manufacturers, known as the Gang of Nine, decided to group together and decide on a bus type that would be open to all manufacturers, as fast as or faster than IBM&#x27;s Microchannel, and yet still retain backward compatibility with ISA.

This was the crucial turning point: the industry as a whole was no longer content to let IBM make all the major decisions about technical direction. In the event, the new EISA bus was itself a commercial failure beyond the high end: By the time the cost of implementing EISA was reduced to the extent that it would be implemented in most desktop PCs, the much cheaper VESA Local Bus had removed most of the need for it in desktop PCs (though it remained common in servers due to for example the possibility of data corruption on hard disk drives attached to VLB controllers), and Intel&#x27;s PCI bus was just around the corner. But although very few EISA systems were sold, it had achieved its purpose: IBM no longer controlled the computer industry. IBM would belatedly amend the PS/2 series with the PS/ValuePoint line, which tracked the features of the emerging &quot;ad hoc&quot; platform.

At around this same time, the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows operating environment started to become popular, and Microsoft&#x27;s competitor Digital Research started to recover a share of the DOS press and DOS market with DR-DOS. IBM planned to replace DOS with the vastly superior OS/2 (originally an IBM/Microsoft joint venture, and unlike the PS/2 hardware, highly backward compatible), but Microsoft preferred to push the industry in the direction of its own product, Windows. With IBM suffering its greatest ever public humiliation in the wake of the PS/2 disaster, massive financial losses, and a marked lack of company unity or direction, Microsoft&#x27;s combination of a soft marketing voice and a big financial stick was effective: Windows became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

For the competing computer manufacturers, large or small, the only common factors to provide joint technical leadership were operating software from Microsoft, and CPUs from Intel.

== Dominance ==

Over the following years, both firms in the Wintel partnership would attempt to extend their monopolies. Intel made a successful major push into the motherboard and chipset markets—becoming the largest motherboard manufacturer in the world and, at one stage, almost the &quot;only&quot; chipset manufacturer—but badly fumbled its attempt to move into the graphics chip market, and (from 1991) faced sharp competition in its core CPU territory from AMD, Cyrix, VIA and Transmeta.

Microsoft fared better. In 1990, Microsoft had two competitors in its core market (Digital Research and IBM), Intel had none. By 1996, Intel had two competitors in its core market (CPUs), while Microsoft had none. Microsoft had pursued a policy of insisting on per-processor royalties, thus making competing operating systems unattractive to computer manufacturers and provoking regulatory scrutiny from the European Commission and US authorities, leading to an undertaking by Microsoft to cease such practices. However, the integration of DOS into Windows 95 was the masterstroke: not only were the other operating system vendors frozen out, Microsoft could now require computer manufacturers to comply with its demands on pain of higher prices (as when it required IBM to stop actively marketing OS/2 or else pay more than twice as much for Windows 95 as its competitor Compaq) or by withholding &quot;Designed for Windows 95&quot; endorsement (which was regarded as an essential hardware marketing tool). Microsoft was also able to require that free publicity be given over to them by hardware makers. (For example, the Windows key advertising symbols on nearly all modern keyboards, or the strict license restrictions on what may or may not be displayed during system boot and on the Windows desktop.) Also, Microsoft was able to take over most of the networking market (formerly the domain of Artisoft&#x27;s LANtastic and Novell&#x27;s NetWare) with Windows NT, and the business application market (formerly led by Lotus and WordPerfect) with Microsoft Office.

Although Microsoft is by far the dominant player in the Wintel partnership now, Intel&#x27;s continuing influence should not be underestimated. Intel and Microsoft, once the closest of partners, have operated at an uneasy distance from one another since their first major dispute, which had to do with Intel&#x27;s heavy investment in the 32-bit optimized Pentium Pro and Microsoft&#x27;s delivery of an unexpectedly high proportion of 16-bit code in Windows 95. Both firms talk with one another&#x27;s competitors from time to time, most notably with Microsoft&#x27;s close relationship with AMD and the development of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition utilizing AMD-designed 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture, and Intel&#x27;s decision to sell its processors to Apple Inc.

The Wintel platform is still the dominant desktop and laptop computer architecture.

There have been opinions that Microsoft Windows by its natural software bloat has eaten up much of the &quot;hardware progress&quot; that Intel processors gave to the &quot;Wintel platform&quot; via Moore&#x27;s law. After the rise of smartphones and netbooks some media outlets have speculated predicting a possible end of Wintel dominance with more and more cheap devices employing other technologies.

Intel is investing in Linux, and Microsoft ported Windows 8 to the ARM architecture with Windows RT.

== Modern usage of the term ==

In the strictest sense, &quot;Wintel&quot; refers only to computers that run Windows on an Intel processor. However, Wintel is now commonly used to refer to a system running a modern Microsoft operating system on any modern x86-compatible CPU, manufactured by either Intel or AMD. That is because the PC applications that can run on an x86 Intel processor usually can run on an x86 AMD processor too. 

In mid-October 2017, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon is at the final stage of testing. That would not be considered a &quot;Wintel&quot;. Systems running a Microsoft operating system using an Intel processor based on the Itanium or ARM architecture, despite the fact that the processor is manufactured by Intel, are also not considered to be a Wintel system.

<doc id="142930" wikidata="Q211113" url="?curid=142930" title="Scottish Borders">
<text>The Scottish Borders is one of 32 council areas of Scotland. It is bordered by West Lothian, Edinburgh, Midlothian, and East Lothian to the north, the North Sea to the east, Dumfries and Galloway to the south-west, South Lanarkshire to the west, and the English ceremonial counties of Cumbria and Northumberland to the south. The largest settlement is Galashiels, and the administrative centre is Newtown St Boswells.

The term &quot;Scottish Borders&quot; is also used for the areas of southern Scotland and northern England that bound the Anglo-Scottish border, namely Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders, Northumberland, and Cumbria. The council area occupies approximately the same area as the historic shires of Berwickshire, Peeblesshire, Roxburghshire, and Selkirkshire. 

==History==
The term Borders sometimes has a wider use, referring to all of the counties adjoining the English border, also including Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire, as well as Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland in England.

Roxburghshire and Berwickshire historically bore the brunt of the conflicts with England, both during declared wars such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, and armed raids which took place in the times of the Border Reivers. During this period, at the western end of the border there was a strip of country, called the &quot;Debatable Land&quot;, because the possession of it was a constant source of contention between England and Scotland until its boundaries were adjusted in 1552. Thus, across the region are to be seen the ruins of many castles, abbeys and even towns. The only other important conflict belongs to the Covenanters&#x27; time, when the marquess of Montrose was defeated at the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645. Partly for defence and partly to overawe the freebooters and moss-troopers who were a perpetual threat until they were suppressed later in the 17th century, castles were erected at various points on both sides of the border.

From early on, the two sovereigns agreed on the duty to regulate the borders. The Scottish Marches system was set up, under the control of three wardens from each side, who generally kept the peace through several centuries until being replaced by the Middle Shires under James VI/I.

===Administrative history===
Prior to 1975 the area that is now Scottish Borders was administered as the four separate counties of Berwickshire, Peeblesshire, Roxburghshire, and Selkirkshire, plus part of Midlothian. An elected county council was established for each county in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. The county councils were abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. A region called Borders was created covering the area. The region contained four districts, called Berwickshire, Ettrick and Lauderdale, Roxburgh, and Tweeddale.

Further local government reform in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the area&#x27;s four districts and the regional council abolished, with a new unitary authority created covering the same area as the former Borders Region. The 1994 Act called the new council area &quot;The Borders&quot;, but the shadow council elected in 1995 to oversee the transition changed the name to &quot;Scottish Borders&quot; prior to the changes coming into effect in 1996.

==Geography==
The Scottish Borders are in the eastern part of the Southern Uplands. The region is hilly and largely rural, with the River Tweed flowing west to east through it. The highest hill in the region is Broad Law in the Manor Hills. In the east of the region, the area that borders the River Tweed is flat and is known as &#x27;The Merse&#x27;. The Tweed and its tributaries drain the entire region with the river flowing into the North Sea at Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland, and forming the border with England for the last twenty miles or so of its length.

The term &quot;Central Borders&quot; refers to the area in which the majority of the main towns and villages of Galashiels, Selkirk, Hawick, Jedburgh, Earlston, Kelso, Newtown St Boswells, St Boswells, Peebles, Melrose and Tweedbank are located.

Two of Scotland&#x27;s 40 national scenic areas (defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection from inappropriate development) lie within the region:
* The Eildon and Leaderfoot National Scenic Area covers the scenery surrounding Eildon Hill, usually called the Eildons because of the three &#x27;peaks&#x27;, and extends to include the town of Melrose and Leaderfoot Viaduct.
* The Upper Tweeddale National Scenic Area covers the scenery surrounding the upper part of the River Tweed between Broughton and Peebles.

==Population==
At the census held on 27 March 2011, the population of the region was 113,870 (final total), an increase of 6.66% from the 106,764 enumerated at the previous (2001) census. The Census of 20 March 2022 produced a population of 
116,821.

==Language and literature==
Although there is evidence of some Scottish Gaelic in the origins of place names such as Innerleithen (&quot;confluence of the Leithen&quot;), Kilbucho and Longformacus, which contain identifiably Goidelic rather than Brythonic Celtic elements and are an indication of at least a Gaelic-speaking elite in the area, the main languages in the area since the 5th century appear to have been Brythonic (in the west) and Old English (in the east), the latter of which developed into its modern forms of English and Scots.

Border ballads occupied a distinctive place in literature. Many of them were rescued from oblivion by Walter Scott, who gathered materials for his &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;, which appeared in 1802 and 1803. Border traditions and folklore, and the picturesque incidents of which the country was so often the scene, appealed strongly to James Hogg (&quot;the Ettrick Shepherd&quot;), John Wilson, writing as &quot;Christopher North&quot;, and John Mackay Wilson, whose &quot;Tales of the Borders&quot;, published in 1835, enjoyed popular favour throughout the 1800s.

==Transport==

Until September 2015, the region had no working railway stations. Although the area was well connected to the Victorian railway system, the branch lines that supplied it were closed in the decades following the Second World War. A bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament to extend the Waverley Line, which aimed to re-introduce a commuter service from Edinburgh to Stow, Galashiels and Tweedbank. This section of the route re-opened on 6 September 2015, under the Borders Railway branding. The other railway route running through the region is the East Coast Main Line, with Edinburgh Waverley, Dunbar and Berwick being the nearest stations on that line, all of which are outwith the Borders. Since 2022, after much discussion a railway station was re-opened at Reston which is within the region and serves Eyemouth. To the west, Carlisle, Carstairs and Lockerbie are the nearest stations on the West Coast Main Line.

The area is served by buses which connect the main population centres. Express bus services link the main towns with rail stations at Edinburgh and Carlisle.

The region also has no commercial airports; the nearest are Edinburgh and Newcastle, both of which are international airports.

The main roads to and from the region are:
*The A1, which runs along the east coast from London to Edinburgh; passing near Eyemouth.
*The A7 which runs north to south from Edinburgh to Carlisle and the M6; passing through Galashiels, Selkirk and Hawick.
*The A68 running from Darlington to Edinburgh; passing through Jedburgh, St Boswells, Earlston and Lauder.
*The A72, which runs east to west from Galashiels to Hamilton; passing through Innerleithen and Peebles

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is covered by BBC Scotland broadcasting from Glasgow and ITV Border which broadcast from Gateshead. Television signals are received from the Selkirk TV transmitter.

Radio stations are provided by BBC Radio Scotland which broadcast the local opt-out from its studios in Selkirk. The commercial radio station, Radio Borders broadcasts from Edinburgh but still broadcast local news bulletins to the area as well as to Berwick-upon Tweed in Northumberland.

The area is served by the main local newspapers: &quot;Southern Reporter&quot; and &quot;The Border Telegraph&quot;.

==Governance==
===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 1999. Since the 2022 election the council has been run by an administration of the Conservatives and three of the independent councillors.

The first election to the Borders Regional Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the reforms which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control of the council since 1975 has been as follows:

Borders Regional Council
Scottish Borders Council
===Leadership===
The first leader of the council following the 1996 reforms was Drew Tulley, who had been the last leader of the former Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council. The leaders since 1996 have been:

===Premises===
Scottish Borders Council is based at the Council Headquarters in Newtown St Boswells. The building had been the headquarters of Roxburghshire County Council prior to 1975, and subsequently served as the served as the main office of the Borders Regional Council between 1975 and 1996.

===Elections===

Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:

====Constituencies====
There are two British Parliamentary constituencies in the Scottish Borders; Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk covers most of the region and is represented by John Lamont of the Conservatives. The western Tweeddale area is included in the Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale &amp; Tweeddale constituency and is represented by David Mundell of the Conservatives.

At Scottish Parliament level, there are also two seats. The eastern constituency is Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which is currently represented by Conservative Rachael Hamilton. The western constituency is Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale and is represented by SNP Christine Grahame.

<doc id="142932" wikidata="Q211106" url="?curid=142932" title="Moray">
<text>Moray ( ; or ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. It lies in the north-east of the country, with a coastline on the Moray Firth, and borders the council areas of Aberdeenshire and Highland. Its council is based in Elgin, the area&#x27;s largest town. The main towns are generally in the north of the area on the coastal plain. The south of the area is more sparsely populated and mountainous, including part of the Cairngorms National Park.

The council area is named after the historic county of Moray (called Elginshire prior to 1919), which was in turn named after the medieval Province of Moray, each of which covered different areas to the modern council area. The modern area of Moray was created in 1975 as a lower-tier district within the Grampian Region. The Moray district became a single-tier council area in 1996.

==History==
The name, first attested around 970 as &#x27;, and in Latinised form by 1124 as &#x27;, derives from the earlier Celtic forms *&quot;mori&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27; and *&quot;treb&quot; &#x27;settlement&#x27; (c.f. Welsh &quot;môr-tref&quot;).

During the Middle Ages, the Province of Moray was much larger than the modern council area, also covering much of what is now Highland. During this period Moray&#x27;s status fluctuated; it was sometimes an independent kingdom, and at other times a vassal of Alba (early Scotland) to the south. In the early 12th century, Moray&#x27;s last independent ruler, Óengus of Moray, was defeated by David I of Scotland, and the area was then absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland. It was divided into the shires of Elginshire, Nairnshire and the mainland parts of Inverness-shire. Elginshire was seen as the core of the old Moray territory and so was often informally called Moray. In 1919 Elginshire County Council renamed the county Moray.

The modern territory called Moray was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which abolished Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts and replaced them with a two-tier system of regions and districts. The new Moray district covered ten of the twelve previous districts of the county of Moray plus over half of the area of the neighbouring county of Banffshire to the east:

&quot;From the county of Moray&quot;
*Burghead burgh
*Duffus and Drainie district
*Elgin burgh
*Elgin district
*Fochabers district
*Forres burgh
*Forres district
*Lossiemouth and Branderburgh burgh
*Rothes burgh
*Rothes and Knockando burgh

&quot;From Banffshire&quot;
*Aberlour burgh
*Buckie burgh
*Buckie district
*Cullen burgh
*Cullen district (except parish of Fordyce, which went to Banff and Buchan)
*Dufftown burgh
*Dufftown district
*Findochty burgh
*Keith burgh
*Keith district
*Portknockie burgh

The only two districts from the pre-1975 county of Moray that were not included in the new Moray district were the burgh of Grantown-on-Spey and the surrounding Cromdale district, which went instead to the Badenoch and Strathspey district of the Highland region. This area had been a comparatively recent addition to the county, having been part of Inverness-shire until 1870. The eastern parts of Banffshire not included in the new Moray district went to the Banff and Buchan district. Moray District Council was a district-level authority, with regional-level functions provided by the Grampian Regional Council, based in Aberdeen.

The districts and regions created in 1975 were abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and replaced with single-tier council areas. The Moray district became one of the new council areas.

The boundaries of the pre-1975 county of Moray are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county. The Moray lieutenancy area covers the parts of the pre-1975 county that are within the modern council area (being the pre-1975 county excluding Cromdale and Grantown-on-Spey). The Banffshire lieutenancy area covers the pre-1975 county, which therefore straddles the modern Moray and Aberdeenshire council areas.

== Politics ==
Moray Council is based at the Council Offices in Elgin, formerly the offices of the old Moray and Nairn Joint County Council.

Moray is represented in large part by the Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey constituency, and in small part by the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency. The MP for the Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey constituency is Graham Leadbitter of the SNP, and the MP for the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency is Seamus Logan of the SNP.

For the Scottish Parliament, the majority of Moray is in the Moray constituency and the Highlands and Islands electoral region. The eastern corner of Moray (consisting of the Buckie ward and the eastern part of the Keith and Cullen ward) is instead in the Banffshire and Buchan Coast constituency and the North-East Scotland electoral region.

In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Moray voted &#x27;No&#x27; by an above-average percentage of 57.6%. In the 2016 European Union membership referendum, Moray voted &#x27;Remain&#x27; by a 50.1% margin. It had the biggest percentage for &#x27;Leave&#x27; out of all the Scottish council areas and the narrowest margin of victory for either side anywhere in the UK.

== Settlements ==
The large majority of Moray&#x27;s population live in the northern part of the district; only one of its eight wards covers the glens to the south. Elgin is by far the largest town, being home to 25% of the population at the 2011 census.

Largest settlements by population:

==Education==

There are 45 primary and eight secondary schools in Moray and the council currently has responsibility for educating more than 13,000 pupils. The council&#x27;s community learning and development team is also involved in arranging a wide range of classes and courses for adult learners. The council also currently operates 15 public libraries, all with free internet and e-mail access, and two mobile libraries, which service users in more remote areas.

Moray is also home to the University of the Highlands and Islands affiliated Moray College, and to Gordonstoun independent boarding school and its accompanying preparatory school, Aberlour House.

==Infrastructure==

Moray Council is also responsible for the maintenance of 1,000 miles of roads, 450 miles of footpaths, 468 bridges, 16,000 street lights and 10,500 road signs.

As a housing authority, Moray Council manages nearly 6,000 council properties and operates a council house waiting list. It also provides housing which has been specially designed, built, or adapted to meet the requirements of certain groups, such as the elderly and those with special needs. The council&#x27;s development control section, which is part of the environmental services department, deals with thousands of planning applications every year from individuals and organisations seeking permission to erect buildings or adapt existing ones.

== Drug issues ==
In 2020, Scotland had the highest number of drug-related deaths in Europe, almost 3.5 times higher than the rest of the UK.

Figures from the National Records of Scotland show there were 17 drug deaths in the Moray area in 2018 compared to 7 the year before. That compares to 10 in both 2016 and 2015, 2 in 2014 and 5 in 2013. The 2018 figures for the Moray area were the highest since records began in 1996, mirroring the national picture.

In 2019, 12 drug-related deaths were reported - 5 fewer than the record high of the previous year. This represents a drug-related death rate per 1,000 people of 0.12. By comparison, the death rate in neighbouring Aberdeenshire per 1,000 people was 0.08; in Dundee it was 0.36 (the highest in the country); in Glasgow it was 0.35 (the second highest in the country); the lowest in Scotland was Orkney with a rate of 0.06.

==Environment==
Approximately 50,000 tonnes of waste is collected from homes and commercial properties in Moray. Households in many communities benefit from a kerbside recycling service. There are over 60 recycling points located throughout Moray in addition to eight larger recycling centres.

==Economy==
===Employment===
The working population of Moray in 2003 was nearly 40,000: of whom around 34,000 were employees and 6000 self-employed. Of these 34,000, 31% were employed in the public sector, compared with 27% for Scotland and 25% for the UK (the RAF personnel are not included in these figures). Only 18% of jobs are managerial or professional, compared to 25% for Scotland.

===Economic performance and development===
The gross value added (GVA) in Moray was £1.26 billion in 2003. This corresponds to an output of £14,500 per resident and was 6% below the average for Scotland and 12% below that of the UK.

The diagrams show the strong reliance on the food and drink industry, i.e. the distilling, canned food and biscuit manufacturing industries. The public sector is also very prominent. Of the total GVA of £1.26 billion, food and drink is responsible for 19% while 3% is the Scottish figure and 2% for the UK. Moray is responsible for 9% of the entire food and drink GVA of Scotland. Significant areas where Moray has a larger than average share of national markets are in tourism, forest products, textiles and specialised metal working. In contrast, however, Moray is significantly underrepresented in the business services area at 15% of GVA, while it is 19% for Scotland and 25% for the UK.
In March 2014 a tourism strategy was launched by the Moray Economic Partnership aimed at doubling the £95m industry over the next decade. In June 2014 a website (morayspeyside.com) was launched under the auspices of the Moray Chamber of Commerce to support the strategy and provide a one-stop shop for visitors.

===Earnings===
Compared to Scottish or British levels, average incomes in Moray are low. The average wage in 2003 was £286 per week, which was 12% below the Scottish average and 18% below the British (these statistics exclude the armed forces). These figures reflect the large amount of part-time employment, with fewer qualified workers and less managerial and professional jobs. 16% of residents commute outwards, which is relatively high. Of these, two-thirds work in Aberdeen or Aberdeenshire, mainly in the oil and gas industry. These outward commuters earn significantly more than local workers.

===Business base===
In 2004, there were around 2,500 VAT registered businesses in Moray, with 75% of businesses employing fewer than five people and about half of firms with a turnover of less than £100,000. 60% of employees are employed in small firms, compared to 48% for Scotland as a whole.

Moray&#x27;s major companies export their products to other British regions and abroad and many of the smaller companies have direct involvement with neighbouring economies in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, and Highland. Also, a large outward-commuting workforce (estimated to be in excess of 5,000 people) derives its income from the neighbouring centres of Aberdeen and Inverness.

==Demographics==
An inhabitant of Moray, especially the historic Mormaer of Moray, is called, &#x27;Moravian.&#x27;


===Ethnicity===
===Language===
The first records on language use in the area indicate that in 1705, most of Moray except for the coast was described as &quot;Wholly Irish &amp; Highland Countreys&quot; and &quot;Ye Irish Parishes in which both languages are spoken.&quot; By 1822, Scottish Gaelic had weakened in the area, with only the far south of Moray reporting that, at most, 10% of the population were speaking Gaelic better than English. Records towards the end of the 19th century improved and show that between 1881 and 1921 the percentage of Gaelic speakers in Moray fluctuated as shown in the following table:

Since then, it has been consistently below 1%. It was largely replaced by Doric and latterly Scottish English.

<doc id="142935" wikidata="Q455951" url="?curid=142935" title="Norman Spinrad">
<text>Norman Richard Spinrad (born September 15, 1940) is an American science fiction author, essayist, and critic. His fiction has won the Prix Apollo and been nominated for numerous awards, including the Hugo Award and multiple Nebula Awards.

== Personal life==
Born in New York City, Spinrad is a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. In 1957 he entered City College of New York and graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Science degree as a pre-law major. He has lived in San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and New York City. He married fellow novelist N. Lee Wood in 1990; they divorced in 2005. Spinrad served as President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) from 1980 to 1982 and again from 2001 to 2002. He has also worked as a phone-in radio show host, a vocal artist, a literary agent, and President of World SF. 

In an interview with &quot;Locus&quot; magazine in 1999, Spinrad described himself as an &quot;anarchist&quot; and a &quot;syndicalist&quot;.

==Style==
Some critics have noted utopian themes in Spinrad&#x27;s works. In a 1999 interview, he talked about his hopes for the role of science fiction in society:

How much science fiction is being published now that&#x27;s set in worlds that are better than ours? Not that have bigger shopping malls or faster space ships, but where the characters are morally superior, where the society works better, is more just? Not many. It becomes difficult to do it, and that&#x27;s a feedback relationship with what&#x27;s happening in the culture, with science fiction being the minor note. People don&#x27;t credit it anymore! Not just better gizmos and more virtual reality gear, but better societies. People don&#x27;t believe the future will be a better place. And that is very scary.

According to critic Galen Strickland, &quot;Spinrad has never taken the easy course of artistic repetition, nor tailored his thoughts to the dictates of any editor. Each of his books is unique, and explores avenues of thought and speculation few others have traveled. Sex and power are usually his primary themes&quot;. Consciousness-altering drugs often feature prominently in his stories. According to Spinrad:

If there&#x27;s one gaping void in the story of American literary history in the second half of the twentieth century as currently promulgated, it&#x27;s the influence of grass and psychedelic drugs, not only on the lives of writers, but on the content of what&#x27;s been written, and on the form and style too. It&#x27;s hard to be critically or biographically courageous when so much creative work was done under the influences of jailable offenses.

==Controversies==
Spinrad had difficulty finding a publisher willing to print &quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot; as a book. Publisher Michael Moorcock printed the novel in installments in the magazine &quot;New Worlds&quot;. The newsstand company WHSmith refused to distribute one of the issues because of the installment of Spinrad&#x27;s novel. The Arts Council of Great Britain, which subsidized &quot;New Worlds&quot;, put public pressure on WHSmith and forced the company to distribute the issue. This led to denunciations of Spinrad, The Arts Council, and &quot;New Worlds&quot; in the British Parliament.

Spinrad could not find an American publisher for his 2007 novel &quot;Osama the Gun&quot;. &quot;[O]ne rejection letter, foaming at the mouth, declared that no American publisher would touch it.&quot; He decided to self-publish the novel as an e-book. The book, which features several scenes set in Paris, has been published in French by Flammarion as &quot;J&#x27;ai lu&quot; (2011).

==Major works==
===&quot;The Solarians&quot;===
&quot;The Solarians&quot; (1966), was Spinrad&#x27;s first published novel. Unlike Spinrad&#x27;s controversial later work, this novel is a mainstream space opera featuring space battles, faster-than-light spacedrives, and an alien enemy, the &quot;Duglaari&quot;. The plot of the novel concerns a fleet commander named Palmer who makes contact with a race called the Solarians, who emerge from isolation to help humanity in its long war against the Duglaari.

===&quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot;===
&quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot; (1969), a pre-cyberpunk tale of a cynical, exploitative talk-show host who gradually uncovers a conspiracy concerning an immortality treatment and the methods used in that treatment, was serialised in the British magazine &quot;New Worlds&quot; during Michael Moorcock&#x27;s editorship. With its explicit language and cynical attitude to politicians, it roused one British Member of Parliament&#x27;s ire at the magazine&#x27;s partial funding by the British Arts Council.

===&quot;The Iron Dream&quot;===
&quot;The Iron Dream&quot; (1972) is an alternate history novel, the bulk of which is the middle part consisting of a fictional fantasy classic entitled &quot;Lord of the Swastika&quot;, written by Adolf Hitler, who took up science fiction after failing as a politician. The first part explains that the deceased author Hitler was a sci-fi writer and that this novel was widely praised by fandom. The third part is a critical review of the novel and its aftermath. According to Spinrad, the book was banned for twenty-five years in Germany, but was finally exonerated after appeals. More accurately, the book was indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, thus the sale of the book was permitted, but the public display of the book or its covers was prohibited, despite the fact that there were no swastikas on the cover of the first German edition. The Iron Dream won a Prix Tour-Apollo Award, and was nominated for an American Book Award.

===&quot;A World Between&quot;===
&quot;A World Between&quot; (1979) tells of a mildly turbulent period on the planet of Pacifica, a utopic, democratic electronically mediated society, on which lands a ship from each of the two factions in the &quot;Pink and Blue War&quot;: the patronizingly paternalistic Institute of Transcendental Science on the one side, and the rabidly man-hating lesbian Femocrats on the other. Nobody suffers a worse fate than political embarrassment, and status quo is restored by the simple fact of Pacifican society being better than that of either of the off-world factions.

===&quot;The Void Captain&#x27;s Tale&quot;===
&quot;The Void Captain&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1983) takes place three or four thousand years in the future in an era called the Second Starfaring Age, a setting Spinrad revisited in the 1985 novel &quot;Child of Fortune&quot;. The book contains elements of confession, love story, eroticism, and horror.

===&quot;Child of Fortune&quot;===
&quot;Child of Fortune&quot; (1985) deals with the adventures of a young woman, Moussa, in her search for her true calling. In Moussa&#x27;s culture, young people of her age and class undertake a wanderjahr during which they wander from planet to planet, free to go wherever and do whatever they wish. While on their travels they are known as Children of Fortune, and are treated with indulgence and kindness by most in memory of their own wanderjahr. The Children of Fortune blend elements of gypsies, hippies of 1960s America, and other groups and legends, including Peter Pan. While some parents give their children a great deal of money for the trip, Moussa&#x27;s parents believe that she will learn more with a true wanderjahr rather than a subsidized tour, so they give her little but a voucher for a one-way ticket home. Moussa becomes a &quot;ruespieler&quot; or storyteller, and takes the name &quot;Wendy&quot; in honor of Pater Pan, the man she meets, loves, and loses during her wanderjahr. The wanderjahr bears a superficial resemblance to the Grand Tour which many upper-class young men undertook after finishing school, the difference being that Children of Fortune are expected to have explored themselves as well as the world during their travels, and to come home knowing who they are and what place they want for themselves.

===&quot;The Druid King&quot;===
&quot;The Druid King&quot; (2003) is a historical novel about the conflict between Vercingetorix and the Roman Empire.

==Film and television==
Spinrad wrote the script for an episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, titled &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; (1967). This episode was nominated for a Hugo Award. He also wrote an unproduced Star Trek script for &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, and episodes for &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; and &quot;Werewolf&quot;.

He has been credited as a writer on two feature films, &quot;The Red Siren&quot; and &quot;Druids&quot;. Universal Pictures bought the film rights to &quot;Bug Jack Barron&quot;, and Costa-Gavras was slated to direct. Harlan Ellison wrote an early version of the script, but the movie was never made.

<text>This is a list of [[Scottish castles|castles in Scotland]]. A castle is a type of fortified structure built primarily during the Middle Ages. Scholars debate the scope of the word &quot;castle&quot;, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, although this distinction is not absolute and the same structure may have had different uses from time to time. The term has been popularly applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms.

In Scotland, earlier fortifications had included hill forts, brochs, and duns; and many castles were on the site of these earlier buildings. The first castles were built in Scotland in the 11th and 12th centuries, with the introduction of Anglo-Norman influence. These motte and bailey castles were replaced with the first stone-built castles from around 1200.

By the late 14th century, the large curtain-walled castles had begun to give way to more modest tower houses – vertical dwellings with less formidable defences. This type of vertical house continued to be popular with Scotland&#x27;s landowning class through to the late 17th century, when classical architecture made its first appearance in the country. Meanwhile, the advance of artillery pressed military engineers to devise stronger fortifications for important royal strongholds.

Tower houses and castles were often given painted ceilings and decorative plasterwork in the 16th and 17th centuries, employing distinctive national styles. In the late 18th century, forms found in medieval Scottish architecture were revived and castle-style houses were constructed. These &quot;castles&quot; had no defensive capability, but drew on military and tower house architecture for their decorative details. This architectural trend culminated in the Scottish Baronial style of the 19th century.

There have been well over two thousand castles in Scotland, although many are known only through historical records. They are found in all parts of the country although tower houses and peel towers are concentrated along the border with England, while the best examples of larger Renaissance-era tower houses are clustered in the north-east. There is some discussion about whether Scottish castles can be considered to be &quot;true&quot; castles, although this discussion is mainly focused around opinions held by some scholars as per the exact scope of the word castle.
