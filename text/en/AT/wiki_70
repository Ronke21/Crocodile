<text>A bonfire is a large and controlled outdoor fire, used for waste disposal or as part of a celebration.

== Etymology ==
The earliest attestations date to the late 15th century, with the Catholicon Anglicum spelling it as &quot;banefyre&quot; and John Mirk&#x27;s &quot;Book of Festivals&quot; speaking of a communal fire in celebrations of Saint John&#x27;s Eve that &quot;was clene bones &amp; no wode &amp; that is callid a bone fyre&quot;. The word is thus a compound of &quot;bone&quot; and &quot;fire.&quot;

Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1755 &quot;Dictionary&quot; incorrectly analyzed &quot;bon&quot; as the French &quot;bon&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;.

==Regional traditions==

In many regions of continental Europe, bonfires are made traditionally on 24 June, the solemnity of John the Baptist, as well as on Saturday night before Easter. Bonfires are also a feature of Walpurgis Night in central and northern Europe, and the celebrations on the eve of St. John&#x27;s Day in Spain. In Sweden bonfires are lit on Walpurgis Night celebrations on the last day of April. In Finland and Norway bonfires are tradition on Midsummer Eve and to a lesser degree in Easter. 

===Alpine and Central Europe===
Bonfire traditions of early spring, lit on the Sunday following Ash Wednesday (, otherwise called Quadragesima Sunday), are widespread throughout the Alemannic German speaking regions of Europe and in parts of France. The burning of &quot;winter in effigy&quot; at the Sechseläuten in Zürich (introduced in 1902) is inspired by this Alemannic tradition. In Austria, the custom of the &quot;Osterfeuer&quot; or Easter fires is widespread, but also regulated in some cities, districts and countries to hold down the resulting annual peak of PM10-dust emission. There are also &quot; (solstice fires) ignited on the evening of 21 June.

Since 1988 &quot; (fires in the Alps) have been lit on a day in August on mountains so they can be seen from afar as an appeal for sustainable development of mountain regions.

In the Czech Republic the festival called &quot;Burning the Witches&quot; (also Philip and Jacob Night, Walpurgis Night, or Beltane) takes place on the night between 30 April and 1 May. This is a very old and still observed folk custom and special holiday. On that night, people gather together, light bonfires, and celebrate the coming of spring. In many places people erect maypoles.

The night between 30 April and 1 May was considered magical. The festival was probably originally celebrated when the moon was full closest to the day exactly between the spring equinox and summer solstice. People believed that on this night witches fly to their Sabbath, and indeed this is one of the biggest pagan holidays. People also believed, for example, in the opening of various caves treasures were hidden. The main purpose of this old folk custom was probably a celebration of fertility.

To protect themselves against witches, people lit bonfires in high places, calling these fires &quot;Burning the Witches&quot;. Some people took to jumping over the fire to ensure youth and fertility. The ash from these fires supposedly had a special power to raise crops, and people also walked their cattle through the ashes to ensure fertility.

===Australia===
In Australia bonfires are rarely allowed in the warmer months due to fire danger. Legislation about bonfires varies between states, metropolitan and rural regions, local government areas, and property types. For example, in urban areas of Canberra bonfires may be lit around the King&#x27;s Official Birthday if local fire authorities are notified; however, they are banned the rest of the year. Smaller fires such as campfires and outdoor barbecues are usually permitted outside of fire restriction periods. In the state of Queensland, the rural town of Killarney hosts an annual Bonfire night for the greater community; proceeds support the town&#x27;s aged care facilities.

===Canada===
Due to their historic connection to Britain and Ireland, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has many communities that celebrate bonfire nights, particularly Guy Fawkes Night; this is one of the times when small rural communities come together. In the province of Quebec, many communities light bonfires on 24 June to celebrate Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.

===France===
In France the bonfire celebrates Jean le Baptiste during the (&quot;St John&#x27;s Day&quot;), first Saturday after the solstice, about 24 June. Like the other countries, it was a pagan celebration of the solstice, or midsummer, but Christianisation transformed it into a Catholic celebration.

===India===
In India particularly in Punjab, people gather around a bonfire and eat peanuts and sweets during the festival of Lohri to celebrate the winter solstice which occurred during the Indian month of Magh. People have bonfires on communal land. If there has been a recent wedding or a new born in the family, people will have a bonfire outside their house to celebrate this event. The festival falls in the second week of January every year. In the northeastern state of Assam, the harvest festival of Bhogali Bihu is celebrated to mark the end of the harvest season in mid-January. In southern India, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Mumbai, the Bhogi Festival is celebrated on the last day of Maarkali, which is also the first day of the farming festival of Pongal. People collect unwanted items from their houses and throw them into a bonfire to celebrate. During the ten days of Vijayadashami, effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna and son Meghanad are erected and burnt by enthusiastic youths at sunset. Traditionally a bonfire on the day of Holi marks the symbolic annihilation of Holika the demoness as described above.

===Iran===

Chaharshanbe Suri is a fire jumping festival celebrated by Persian people, Kurdish people and some other ethnicities. The event takes place on the eve of the last Wednesday before Nowruz. Loosely translated as Wednesday Light, from the word , which means light in Persian, or more plausibly, consider to be a variant of (red) and take it to refer either to the fire itself or to the ruddiness (sorkhi), meaning good health or ripeness, supposedly obtained by jumping over it, is an ancient Iranian festival dating back to at least 1700 BCE of the early Zoroastrian era. Also called the Festival of Fire, it is a prelude to Nowruz, which marks the arrival of spring. The words Chahar Shanbeh mean Wednesday and Suri means red. Bonfires are lit to &quot;keep the sun alive&quot; until early morning. The celebration usually starts in the evening, with people making bonfires in the streets and jumping over them singing &quot;&quot;. The literal translation is, my yellow is yours, your red is mine. This is a purification rite. Loosely translated, this means you want the fire to take your pallor, sickness, and problems and in turn give you redness, warmth, and energy. There are Zoroastrian religious significance attached to Chahārshanbeh Suri and it serves as a cultural festival for Iranian and Iranic people.

Another tradition of this day is to make special Chaharshanbe Suri Ajil, or mixed nuts and berries. People wear disguises and go door to door knocking on doors as similar to Trick-or-treating. Receiving of the Ajeel is customary, as is receiving of a bucket of water.

Ancient Persians celebrated the last 5 days of the year in their annual obligation feast of all souls, Hamaspathmaedaya (Farvardigan or popularly Forodigan). They believed Faravahar, the guardian angels for humans and also the spirits of dead would come back for reunion. There are the seven Amesha Spenta, that are represented as the haft-sin (literally, seven S&#x27;s). These spirits were entertained as honored guests in their old homes, and were bidden a formal ritual farewell at the dawn of the New Year. The festival also coincided with festivals celebrating the creation of fire and humans. In Sassanid period the festival was divided into two distinct pentads, known as the lesser and the greater Pentad, or Panji as it is called today. Gradually the belief developed that the &#x27;Lesser Panji&#x27; belonged to the souls of children and those who died without sin, whereas &#x27;Greater Panji&#x27; was truly for all souls.

The main celebration takes place at Rabbi Shimon&#x27;s tomb on Mount Meron in northern Israel, but all over the country bonfires are lit in open spaces. Linked by Modern Jewish tradition to the Bar Kokhba Revolt against the Roman Empire (132–135 CE), Lag BaOmer is very popularly observed and celebrated as a symbol for the fighting Jewish spirit. As Lag Ba&#x27;Omer draws near, children begin collecting material for the bonfire: wood boards and planks, old doors, and anything else made of wood. On the night itself, families and friends gather round the fires and youths will burn their bonfires till daybreak.

Historically in England, some time before 1400, fires were lit around Midsummer as a wake in the vigil for St John the Baptist.

(See Aggie Bonfire)
One of the oldest traditions at Texas A&amp;M University involves the building of a bonfire by students to be burnt before their annual game against The University of Texas. The tradition began in 1909 as little more than a burning trash pile. Eventually students began clearing land in the area, by hand, to harvest thousands of logs needed for its construction. In 1969 Aggie Bonfire set a Guinness world record for tallest bonfire at 109 feet. In 1999, there was an accident where the stack collapsed during construction, killing 12 people and injuring 27 others. The accident led to the university to no longer sanction the building of Bonfire. Since 2002, the student-sponsored group Student Bonfire began building an annual bonfire in the spirit of the original.

==Farm and garden bonfires==
Bonfires are used on farms, in large gardens and allotments to dispose of waste plant material that is not readily composted. This includes woody material, pernicious weeds, diseased material and material treated with persistent pesticides and herbicides. Such bonfires may be quite small but are often designed to burn slowly for several days so that wet and green material may be reduced to ash by frequently turning the unburnt material into the centre. Such bonfires can also deal with turf and other earthy material. The ash from garden bonfires is a useful source of potash and may be beneficial in improving the soil structure of some soils although such fires must be managed with safety in mind. Garden and farm bonfires are frequently smoky and can cause local nuisance if poorly managed or lit in unsuitable weather conditions.

<doc id="144835" wikidata="Q191231" url="?curid=144835" title="Manuel I of Portugal">
<text>Manuel I (; 31 May 146913 December 1521), known as the Fortunate (), was King of Portugal from 1495 to 1521. A member of the House of Aviz, Manuel was Duke of Beja and Viseu prior to succeeding his cousin, John II of Portugal, as monarch. Manuel ruled over a period of intensive expansion of the Portuguese Empire owing to the numerous Portuguese discoveries made during his reign. His sponsorship of Vasco da Gama led to the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India in 1498, resulting in the creation of the Portuguese India Armadas, which guaranteed Portugal&#x27;s monopoly on the spice trade. Manuel began the Portuguese colonization of the Americas and Portuguese India, and oversaw the establishment of a vast trade empire across Africa and Asia.

Manuel established the Casa da Índia, a royal institution that managed Portugal&#x27;s monopolies and its imperial expansion. He financed numerous famed Portuguese navigators, including Pedro Álvares Cabral (who discovered Brazil), Afonso de Albuquerque (who established Portuguese hegemony in the Indian Ocean), among numerous others. The income from Portuguese trade monopolies and colonized lands made Manuel the wealthiest monarch in Europe, allowing him to be one of the great patrons of the Portuguese Renaissance, which produced many significant artistic and literary achievements. Manuel patronized numerous Portuguese intellectuals, including playwright Gil Vicente (called the father of Portuguese and Spanish theatre). The Manueline style, considered Portugal&#x27;s national architecture, is named for the king.

==Early life==

Manuel was born in Alcochete on 31 May 1469, the ninth child of Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu and Beatriz of Portugal. His father, Ferdinand, was the son of Edward, King of Portugal and the brother of Afonso V of Portugal, while his mother, Beatriz, was granddaughter of King John I of Portugal. In addition, his sister Eleanor of Viseu was the wife of King John II of Portugal.

Manuel grew up amidst strife between the Portuguese noble families and King John II. In 1483, Fernando II, Duke of Braganza, leader of Portugal&#x27;s most powerful feudal house, was executed for treason. Later, Manuel&#x27;s older brother, Diogo, Duke of Viseu, was accused of leading a conspiracy against the crown and was stabbed to death in 1484 by the king himself.

After the death of his son Prince Afonso and failed attempts to legitimise his illegitimate son, Jorge de Lencastre, Duke of Coimbra, John II named Manuel heir to the throne. Manuel succeeded John as king of Portugal in 1495.

==Reign==
===Imperial expansion===

Manuel would prove a worthy successor to his cousin John II for his support of Portuguese exploration of the Atlantic Ocean and development of Portuguese commerce. During his reign, the following achievements were realised:

1498 – The discovery of a maritime route to India by Vasco da Gama.&lt;br&gt;
1500 – The voyage to Brazil by Pedro Álvares Cabral.&lt;br&gt;
1501 – The voyage to Labrador by Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real.&lt;br&gt;
1503 – The construction of the first feitoria in Brazil by Fernão de Loronha and of a fort in the allied Kingdom of Cochin in India by Afonso de Albuquerque.&lt;br&gt;
1505 – The construction of forts at Kilwa, Sofala, Angediva, and Cannanore by Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of India.&lt;br&gt;
1506 – The capture of Essaouira in Morocco by Diogo de Azambuja.&lt;br&gt;
1507 – The capture of Socotra by Tristão da Cunha and Oman by Afonso de Albuquerque.&lt;br&gt;
1508 – The capture of Safi in Morocco by Diogo de Azambuja.&lt;br&gt;
1510 – The capture of Goa in India by Afonso de Albuquerque.&lt;br&gt;
1511 – The capture of Malacca in Malaysia by Afonso de Albuquerque.&lt;br&gt;
1513 – The capture of Azamor in Morocco by Dom Jaime Duke of Braganza.&lt;br&gt;
1515 – The capture of Ormus in the Persian Gulf by Afonso de Albuquerque.

The capture of Malacca in modern-day Malaysia in 1511 was the result of a plan by Manuel I to thwart the Muslim trade in the Indian Ocean by capturing Aden, blocking trade through Alexandria, capturing Ormuz to block trade through the Persian Gulf and Beirut, and capturing Malacca to control trade with China.

All these events made Portugal wealthy from foreign trade as it formally established a vast overseas empire. Manuel used the wealth to build a number of royal buildings (in the &quot;Manueline&quot; style) and to attract artists to his court.

Commercial treaties and diplomatic alliances were forged with the Ming dynasty of China and the Persian Safavid dynasty. Pope Leo X received a monumental embassy from Portugal during his reign designed to draw attention to Portugal&#x27;s newly acquired riches to all of Europe.

Like Afonso V, Manuel extended his official title to reflect Portugal&#x27;s expansion. He styled himself &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarves, on this side and beyond the Sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea and the Lord of Conquest, Navigation and Commerce in Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India&quot;.

===Judicial reform===
In Manuel&#x27;s reign, royal absolutism was the method of government. The Portuguese Cortes (the assembly of the kingdom) met only four times during his reign, always in Lisbon, the king&#x27;s seat.

He reformed the courts of justice and the municipal charters with the crown, modernizing taxes and the concepts of tributes and rights. During his reign, the laws in force in the kingdom were recodified with the publication of the Manueline Ordinances.

===Religious policy===

Manuel was a very religious man and invested a large amount of Portuguese income to send missionaries to the new colonies, among them Francisco Álvares, and sponsor the construction of religious buildings, such as the Monastery of Jerónimos. Manuel also endeavoured to promote another crusade against the Turks.

At the outset of his reign, Manuel relaxed conditions that had kept Jews in virtual slavery under John II. However, in 1496, while seeking to marry Infanta Isabella of Aragon, he relented to pressure from her parents, Ferdinand and Isabella, and decreed that Jews who refused baptism must leave the country. Then, before the deadline for their expulsion he converted all Jews to Christianity by royal decree. 
That period of time technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as &quot;New Christians&quot; and were given a grace period of thirty years in which no inquiries into their faith would be allowed, which was later extended to end in 1534.

During the Lisbon massacre of 1506, people murdered thousands of accused Jews. The leaders of the riot were executed by Manuel.

In addition, Manuel also ordered the expulsion of Muslims from Portugal, and he is known to have pressured Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain to end the toleration of Islam in their own kingdom.

==Family==
Isabella died in childbirth, thus putting a damper on Portuguese ambitions to rule in Spain, which various rulers had harbored since the reign of King Ferdinand I (1367–1383). Manuel and Isabella&#x27;s young son, Miguel da Paz, was named Prince of Asturias, Prince of Portugal, and Prince of Girona, making him heir apparent of Castile, Portugal, and Aragon until his death in 1500, at the age of two years, ended the ambitions of the Catholic Monarchs and Manuel.

Manuel&#x27;s next wife, Maria of Aragon, was his first wife&#x27;s younger sister. Two of their sons later became kings of Portugal. Maria died in 1517 but the two sisters were survived by two other sisters, Joanna of Castile, who was born in 1479 and had married Archduke Philip (Maximilian I&#x27;s son) and had a son, Charles V who would eventually inherit Spain and the Habsburg possessions, and Catherine of Aragon, first wife of Henry VIII. After Maria&#x27;s death, Manuel married her niece, Eleanor of Austria.

==Honours==

Manuel I was awarded the Golden Rose by Pope Julius II in 1506 and by Pope Leo X in 1514. Manuel I became the first individual to receive more than one Golden Rose after Emperor Sigismund von Luxembourg.

==Death==
In December 1521, while Lisbon was dealing with an outbreak of the Black Plague, Manuel and his court remained at Ribeira Palace. On 4 December, Manuel began displaying symptoms of an intense fever which incapacitated him by the 11th. He died on 13 December 1521, at the age of 52, and was succeeded by his son, John III of Portugal.

The next day, his body was transported to the Belém district of Lisbon, in a black velvet-draped coffin, followed by masses of mourners. He was provisionally buried at Restelo Church, while the royal pantheon of the House of Aviz was furnished inside Jerónimos Monastery. His coffin was buried by four of the most prominent nobles of the kingdom, the Duke of Braganza, the Duke of Coimbra, and the Marquis of Vila Real, in a private ceremony attended only by the royal family and the Portuguese nobility. His remains were transferred to Jerónimos Monastery in 1551, along with his second wife Maria of Aragon.

* Maria, married from 30 October 1500 – 7 March 1517, died from complications of pregnancy
* Eleanor, married from 16 July 1518 – 13 December 1521, outlived Manuel, later Queen Consort of France.

<text>Chronic pain or chronic pain syndrome is a type of pain that is also known by other titles such as gradual burning pain, electrical pain, throbbing pain, and nauseating pain. This type of pain is sometimes confused with acute pain and can last from three months to several years; various diagnostic manuals such as DSM-5 and ICD-11 have proposed several definitions of chronic pain, but the accepted definition is that it is &quot;pain that lasts longer than the expected period of recovery.&quot;

Creating a pain mechanism prevents possible damage to the body, but chronic pain is a pain without biological value (doesn&#x27;t have a positive effect). This pain has different divisions; cancer, post-traumatic or surgery, musculoskeletal and visceral are the most important of these divisions. Various factors cause the formation of chronic pain, which can be neurogenic (gene-dependent), nociceptive, neuropathic, psychological or unknown. Some diseases such as diabetes (high blood sugar), shingles (some viral diseases), phantom limb pain, hypertension and stroke also play a role in the formation of chronic pain. The most common types of chronic pain are back pain, severe headache, migraine, and facial pain.

Chronic pain can cause very severe psychological and physical effects that sometimes continue until the end of life. Analysis of the grey matter (damage to brain neurons), insomnia and sleep deprivation, metabolic problems, chronic stress, obesity and heart attack are examples of physical disorder; and depression, cognitive disorders, perceived injustice (PI) and neuroticism are examples of mental disorder.

A wide range of treatments are performed for this disease; drug therapy (types of opioid and non-opioid drugs), cognitive behavioral therapy and physical therapy are the most significant of them. Medicines are usually associated with side effects and are prescribed when the effects of pain become severe. Medicines such as aspirin and ibuprofen are used for milder pain and morphine and codeine for severe pain. Other treatment methods, such as behavioral therapy and physiotherapy, are often used as a supplement along with drugs due to their low effectiveness. There is currently no definitive cure for any of these methods, and research continues into a wide variety of new management and therapeutic interventions, such as nerve block and radiation therapy.

Chronic pain is considered a kind of disease; this type of pain has affected the people of the world more than diabetes, cancer and heart diseases. During several epidemiological studies conducted in different countries, wide differences in the prevalence of chronic pain have been reported from 8% to 55.2% in countries; for example, studies evaluate the incidence in Iran and Canada between 10% and 20% and in the United States between 30% and 40%. The results show that an average of 8% to 11.2% of people in different countries have severe chronic pain, and its epidemic is higher in industrialized countries than in other countries. According to the estimates of the American Medical Association, the costs related to this disease in this country are about 560 to 635 billion dollars.

==Classification==

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines chronic pain as a general pain without biological value that sometimes continues even after the healing of the affected area; a type of pain that cannot be classified as acute pain and lasts longer than expected to heal, or typically, pain that has been experienced on most days or daily for the past six months, is considered chronic pain. According to the DSM-5 index, a complication is &quot;chronic&quot; when the resulting complication (pain, disorder, and illness) lasts for a period of more than six months (this type of classification does not have any prerequisites such as physical or mental injury). The classification of chronic pain is not only limited to pains that arise in the presence of real tissue damage (secondary pains resulting from a primary event); the title &quot;nociplastic pain&quot; or primary pain is related to the pains that occur in the absence of a health-threatening factor, such as disease or damage to the body&#x27;s somatosensory system, and as a result of permanent nerve stimulation.

The &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases&quot;, in its 11th edition (ICD-11), proposed a seven-category classification for chronic pain:

# Primary chronic pain: Defined by 3 months of continuous pain in one or more areas of the body, the origin of which is not understood.
# Chronic cancer pain: pain in one of the body&#x27;s organs caused by cancer damage (in internal organs, bone or skeletal muscular) is formed.
# Chronic pain post-traumatic or surgery: Pain that occurs 3 months after an injury or surgery, without taking into account infectious conditions and the severity of tissue damage; also, the person&#x27;s past pain is not important in this classification.
# Chronic neuropathic pain: pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system.
# Chronic headache and orofacial pain: pain that originates in the head or face, and occurs for 50% or more days over a 3 months period.
# Chronic visceral pain: pain originating in an internal organ.
# Chronic musculoskeletal pain: pain originating in the bones, muscles, joints or connective tissue.

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that optional criteria or codes can be used in the classification of chronic pain for each of the seven categories of chronic pain (for example, &quot;&quot;diabetic&quot; neuropathic&quot; pain).

Another classification for chronic pain is &quot;nociceptive&quot; (caused by inflamed or damaged tissue that activates special pain sensors called nociceptors) and &quot;neuropathic&quot; (caused by damage or malfunction of the nervous system). The type of &quot;nociceptive&quot; itself is divided into two parts: &quot;superficial&quot; and &quot;deep&quot;; also, deep pains are divided into two parts: &quot;deep physical&quot; and &quot;deep visceral&quot; pain. &quot;neuropathic&quot; pains are also divided into &quot;peripheral&quot; (source The peripheral nervous system) and &quot;central&quot; (Central nervous system from the brain or spinal cord) are divided. Peripheral neuropathic pain is often described as &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;tingling&quot;, &quot;electrical&quot;, &quot;stabbing&quot;, or &quot;pins and needles&quot;.

&quot;Superficial pain&quot; is the result of the activation of pain receptors in the skin or superficial tissues; &quot;deep somatic pain&quot; is caused by stimulation of pain receptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fascia, and muscles. (this type of pain is constant but weak) and &quot;deep visceral pain&quot; is pain that originates from one of the body&#x27;s organs. Deep pain is often very difficult to localize and occurs in multiple areas of the body when injured or inflamed. In the &quot;deep visceral&quot; type, the feeling of pain exists in a place far from the injury, for this reason it is also called vague pain.

== Etiology ==
Chronic pain has many pathophysiological and environmental causes and can occur in cases such as neuropathy of the central nervous system, after cerebral hemorrhage, tissue damage such as extensive burns, inflammation, autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psychological stress such as headache, migraine or abdominal pain (caused by emotional, psychological or behavioral) and mechanical pain caused by tissue wear and tear such as arthritis. In some cases, chronic pain can be caused by genetic factors which interfere with neuronal differentiation, leading to a permanently lowered threshold for pain.

The pathophysiological etiology of chronic pain remains unclear. Many theories of chronic pain fail to clearly explain why the same pathological conditions do not invariably result in chronic pain. Patients&#x27; anatomical predisposition to proximal neural compression (in particular of peripheral nerves) may be the answer to this conundrum. Proximal neural lesion at the level of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) may drive a vicious cycle of chronic pain by causing postural protection of the painful site and consequent neural compression in the same spinal region. Difficulties in diagnosing proximal neural lesion may account for the theoretical perplexity of chronic pain.

=== Pathophysiology ===

The mechanism of continuous activation and transmission of pain messages, leads the body to an activity to relieve pain (a mechanism to prevent damage in the body), this action causes the release of prostaglandin and increase the sensitivity of that part to stimulation; Prostaglandin secretion causes unbearable and chronic pain. Under persistent activation, the transmission of pain signals to the dorsal horn may produce a pain wind-up phenomenon. This triggers changes that lower the threshold for pain signals to be transmitted. In addition, it may cause non-nociceptive nerve fibers to respond to, generate, and transmit pain signals. Researchers believe that the nerve fibers that cause this type of pain are group C nerve fibers; these fibers are not myelinated (have low transmission speed) and cause long-term pain.

These changes in neural structure can be explained by neuroplasticity. When there is chronic pain, the somatotopic arrangement of the body (the distribution view of nerve cells) is abnormally changed due to continuous stimulation and can cause allodynia or hyperalgesia. In chronic pain, this process is difficult to reverse or stop once established. EEG of people with chronic pain showed that brain activity and synaptic plasticity change as a result of pain, and specifically, the relative activity of beta wave increases and alpha and theta waves decrease.

Inefficient management of dopamine secretion in the brain can act as a common mechanism between chronic pain, insomnia and major depressive disorder and cause its unpleasant side effects. Astrocytes, microglia and satellite glial cells also lose their effective function in chronic pain. Increasing the activity of microglia, changing microglia networks, and increasing the production of chemokines and cytokines by microglia may exacerbate chronic pain. It has also been observed that astrocytes lose their ability to regulate the excitability of neurons and increase the spontaneous activity of neurons in pain circuits.

==Management==

Pain management is a branch of medicine that uses an interdisciplinary approach. The combined knowledge of various medical professions and allied health professions is used to ease pain and improve the quality of life of those living with pain. The typical pain management team includes medical practitioners (particularly anesthesiologists), rehabilitation psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Acute pain usually resolves with the efforts of one practitioner; however, the management of chronic pain frequently requires the coordinated efforts of a treatment team. Complete, longterm remission of many types of chronic pain is rare.

Chronic pain may originate in the body, or in the brain or spinal cord. It is often difficult to treat. Epidemiological studies have found that 8–11.2% of people in various countries have chronic widespread pain. Various non-opioid medicines are initially recommended to treat chronic pain, depending on whether the pain is due to tissue damage or is neuropathic. Psychological treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy may be effective for improving quality of life in those with chronic pain. Some people with chronic pain may benefit from opioid treatment while others can be harmed by it. People with non-cancer pain who have not been helped by non-opioid medicines might be recommended to try opioids if there is no history of substance use disorder and no current mental illness.

===Nonopioids===
Initially recommended efforts are non-opioid based therapies. Non-opioid treatment of chronic pain with pharmaceutical medicines might include acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs.

Various other nonopioid medicines can be used, depending on whether the pain is a result of tissue damage or is neuropathic (pain caused by a damaged or dysfunctional nervous system). There is limited evidence that cancer pain or chronic pain from tissue damage as a result of a conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) is best treated with opioids. For neuropathic pain other drugs may be more effective than opioids, such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. Some atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, may also be effective, but the evidence to support this is in very early stages. In women with chronic pain, hormonal medications such as oral contraceptive pills (&quot;the pill&quot;) might be helpful. When there is no evidence of a single best fit, doctors may need to look for a treatment that works for the individual person. It is difficult for doctors to predict who will use opioids just for pain management and who will go on to develop an addiction. It is also challenging for doctors to know which patients ask for opioids because they are living with an opioid addiction. Withholding, interrupting or withdrawing opioid treatment in people who benefit from it can cause harm.

Interventional pain management may be appropriate, including techniques such as trigger point injections, neurolytic blocks, and radiotherapy. While there is no high quality evidence to support ultrasound, it has been found to have a small effect on improving function in non-specific chronic low back pain.

Psychological treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy can be helpful for improving quality of life and reducing pain interference. Brief mindfulness-based treatment approaches have been used, but they are not yet recommended as a first-line treatment. The effectiveness of mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM) has been supported by a range of studies.

Among older adults psychological interventions can help reduce pain and improve self-efficacy for pain management. Psychological treatments have also been shown to be effective in children and teens with chronic headache or mixed chronic pain conditions.

While exercise has been offered as a method to lessen chronic pain and there is some evidence of benefit, this evidence is tentative. For people living with chronic pain, exercise results in few side effects.

===Opioids===
In those who have not benefited from other measures and have no history of either mental illness or substance use disorder treatment with opioids may be tried. If significant benefit does not occur it is recommended that they be stopped. In those on opioids, stopping or decreasing their use may improve outcomes including pain.

Some people with chronic pain benefit from opioid treatment and others do not; some are harmed by the treatment. Possible harms include reduced sex hormone production, hypogonadism, infertility, impaired immune system, falls and fractures in older adults, neonatal abstinence syndrome, heart problems, sleep-disordered breathing, physical dependence, addiction, abuse, and overdose.

===Alternative medicine===
Alternative medicine refers to health practices or products that are used to treat pain or illness that are not necessarily considered a part of conventional medicine. When dealing with chronic pain, these practices generally fall into the following four categories: biological, mind-body, manipulative body, and energy medicine.

Implementing dietary changes, which is considered a biological-based alternative medicine practice, has been shown to help improve symptoms of chronic pain over time. Adding supplements to one&#x27;s diet is a common dietary change when trying to relieve chronic pain, with some of the most studied supplements being: acetyl--carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, and vitamin E. Vitamin E is perhaps the most studied out of the three, with strong evidence that it helps lower neurotoxicity in those with cancer, multiple sclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases.

Hypnosis, including self-hypnosis, has tentative evidence. Hypnosis, specifically, can offer pain relief for most people and may be a safe alternative to pharmaceutical medication. Evidence does not support hypnosis for chronic pain due to a spinal cord injury.

Preliminary studies have found medical marijuana to be beneficial in treating neuropathic pain, but not other kinds of long term pain. , the evidence for its efficacy in treating neuropathic pain or pain associated with rheumatic diseases is not strong for any benefit and further research is needed. For chronic non-cancer pain, a recent study concluded that it is unlikely that cannabinoids are highly effective. However, more rigorous research into cannabis or cannabis-based medicines is needed.

Tai chi has been shown to improve pain, stiffness, and quality of life in chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, and osteoporosis. Acupuncture has also been found to be an effective and safe treatment in reducing pain and improving quality of life in chronic pain including chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation for reduction of chronic pain is not supported by high quality evidence, and the demonstrated effects are small and short-term.

Spa therapy could potentially improve pain in patients with chronic lower back pain, but more studies are needed to provide stronger evidence of this.

While some studies have investigated the efficacy of St John&#x27;s Wort or nutmeg for treating neuropathic (nerve) pain, their findings have raised serious concerns about the accuracy of their results.

Kinesio tape has not been shown to be effective in managing chronic non-specific low-back pain.

Myofascial release has been used in some cases of fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain, and tennis elbow but there is not enough evidence to support this as method of treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Chronic pain varies in different countries affecting anywhere from 8% to 55% of the population. It affects women at a higher rate than men, and chronic pain uses a large amount of healthcare resources around the globe.

A large-scale telephone survey of 15 European countries and Israel found that 19% of respondents over 18 years of age had suffered pain for more than 6 months, including the last month, and more than twice in the last week, with pain intensity of 5 or more for the last episode, on a scale of 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable). 4839 of these respondents with chronic pain were interviewed in-depth. Sixty-six percent scored their pain intensity at moderate (5–7), and 34% at severe (8–10); 46% had constant pain, 56% intermittent; 49% had suffered pain for 2–15 years; and 21% had been diagnosed with depression due to the pain. Sixty-one percent were unable or less able to work outside the home, 19% had lost a job, and 13% had changed jobs due to their pain. Forty percent had inadequate pain management and less than 2% were seeing a pain management specialist.

In the United States, chronic pain has been estimated to occur in approximately 35% of the population, with approximately 50 million Americans experiencing partial or total disability as a consequence. According to the Institute of Medicine, there are about 116 million Americans living with chronic pain, which suggests that approximately half of American adults have some chronic pain condition. The Mayday Fund estimate of 70 million Americans with chronic pain is slightly more conservative. In an internet study, the prevalence of chronic pain in the United States was calculated to be 30.7% of the population: 34.3% for women and 26.7% for men.

In Canada it is estimated that approximately 1 in 5 Canadians live with chronic pain and half of those people have lived with chronic pain for 10 years or longer. Chronic pain in Canada also occurs more and is more severe in women and Canada&#x27;s Indigenous communities.

==Outcomes==
Sleep disturbance, and insomnia due to medication and illness symptoms are often experienced by those with chronic pain. These conditions can be difficult to treat due to the high potential of medication interactions, especially when the conditions are treated by different doctors.

Severe chronic pain is associated with increased risk of death over a ten-year period, particularly from heart disease and respiratory disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this increase, such as an abnormal stress response in the body&#x27;s endocrine system. Additionally, chronic stress seems to affect risks to heart and lung (cardiovascular) health by increasing how quickly plaque can build up on artery walls (arteriosclerosis). However, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between severe chronic pain, stress and cardiovascular health.

People with chronic pain tend to have higher rates of depression and although the exact connection between the comorbidities is unclear, a 2017 study on neuroplasticity found that &quot;injury sensory pathways of body pains have been shown to share the same brain regions involved in mood management.&quot; Chronic pain can contribute to decreased physical activity due to fear of making the pain worse. Pain intensity, pain control, and resilience to pain can be influenced by different levels and types of social support that a person with chronic pain receives, and are also influenced by the person&#x27;s socioeconomic status.

In a study, Mendelian randomization was used to identify causal relationships between chronic pain and certain psychiatric, cardiovascular, and inflammatory conditions that were initially thought to be unrelated to pain. It was found that exposure to depression increases the likelihood of reporting pain, but not the other way around. Exposure to coronary diseases increases the risk of developing chronic pain, and vice versa. An increase in body mass index modestly raises the likelihood of experiencing pain, while high blood HDL levels reduce the probability of suffering from chronic pain. Regarding inflammatory traits, exposure to asthma increases the likelihood of experiencing pain, and vice versa.

Chronic pain of different causes has been characterized as a disease that affects brain structure and function. MRI studies have shown abnormal anatomical and functional connectivity, even during rest involving areas related to the processing of pain. Also, persistent pain has been shown to cause grey matter loss, which is reversible once the pain has resolved.

One approach to predicting a person&#x27;s experience of chronic pain is the biopsychosocial model, according to which an individual&#x27;s experience of chronic pain may be affected by a complex mixture of their biology, psychology, and their social environment.

Chronic pain may be an important contributor to suicide.

==Psychology==

===Personality===
Two of the most frequent personality profiles found in people with chronic pain by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) are the &quot;conversion V&quot; and the &quot;neurotic triad&quot;. The conversion V personality expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings, develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, and often fails to recognize their own emotional state, including depression. The neurotic triad personality also expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings and develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, but is demanding and complaining.

Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing neuroticism. When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and anxiety fall, often to normal levels. Self-esteem, often low in people with chronic pain, also shows improvement once pain has resolved.

It has been suggested that catastrophizing might play a role in the experience of pain. &quot;Pain catastrophizing&quot; is the tendency to describe a pain experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to think a great deal more about the pain when it occurs, or to feel more helpless about the experience. People who score highly on measures of catastrophization are likely to rate a pain experience as more intense than those who score low on such measures. It is often reasoned that the tendency to catastrophize &quot;causes&quot; the person to experience the pain as more intense. One suggestion is that catastrophizing influences pain perception through altering attention and anticipation, and heightening emotional responses to pain. However, at least some aspects of catastrophization may be the &quot;product&quot; of an intense pain experience, rather than its cause. That is, the more intense the pain feels to the person, the more likely they are to have thoughts about it that fit the definition of catastrophization.

=== Comorbidity with trauma ===
Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a high comorbidity with chronic pain. Patients with both PTSD and chronic pain report higher severity of pain than those who do not have a PTSD comorbidity.

=== Comorbidity with depression ===
People with chronic pain may also have symptoms of depression. In 2017, the British Medical Association found that 49% of people with chronic pain had depression.

===Effect on cognition===
Chronic pain&#x27;s impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published. Most people with chronic pain complain of cognitive impairment, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention, and difficulty completing tasks. Objective testing has found that people in chronic pain tend to experience impairment in attention, memory, mental flexibility, verbal ability, speed of response in a cognitive task, and speed in executing structured tasks. A review of studies in 2018 reports a relationship between people in chronic pain and abnormal results in test of memory, attention, and processing speed.

== Prognosis ==
Chronic pain leads to a significant decrease in quality of life, decreased productivity, decreased wages, worsening of other chronic diseases, and mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Many drugs that are often used to treat chronic pain have risks and potential side effects and possible complications associated with their use, and the constant use of opioids is associated with decreased life expectancy and increased mortality of patients. Acetaminophen, a standard drug treatment for chronic pain, can cause hepatotoxicity when taken in excess of four grams per day. In addition, therapeutic doses for patients with chronic liver diseases may also cause hepatotoxicity. Long-term risks and side effects of opioids include constipation, drug tolerance or dependence, nausea, indigestion, arrhythmia (QT prolongation of electrocardiography in methadone treatment), and endocrine gland problems that can lead to amenorrhea, impotence, gynecomastia, and decreased become energy. Also there is a risk of opioid overdose depending on the dose taken by the patient.

Current treatments for chronic pain can reduce pain by 30%. This reduction in pain can significantly improve patients&#x27; performance and quality of life. However, the general and long-term prognosis of chronic pain shows decreased function and quality of life. Also, this disease causes many complications and increases the possibility of death of patients and suffering from other chronic diseases and obesity. Similarly, patients with chronic pain who require opioids often develop drug tolerance over time, and this increase in the amount of the dose taken to be effective increases the risk of side effects and death.

Mental disorders can amplify pain signals and make symptoms more severe. In addition, comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, can significantly delay the diagnosis of pain disorders. Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are the most common comorbidities associated with chronic pain. Patients with underlying pain and comorbid mental disorders receive twice as much medication from doctors annually as compared to patients who do not have such co-morbidities. Studies have shown that when coexisting diseases exist along with chronic pain, the treatment and improvement of one of these disorders can be effective in the improvement of the other. Patients with chronic pain are at higher risk for suicide and suicidal thoughts. Research has shown approximately 20% of people with suicidal thoughts and between 5 and 14% of patients with chronic pain who commit suicide. Of patients who attempted suicide, 53.6% died of gunshot wounds and 16.2% died of opioid overdose.

A multimodal treatment approach is important for better pain control and outcomes, as well as minimizing the need for high-risk treatments such as opioid medications. Managing comorbid depression and anxiety is critical in reducing chronic pain. Also, patients with chronic pain should be carefully monitored for severe depression and any suicidal thoughts and plans. Periodic referral of the patient to the doctor for physical examination and to check the effectiveness of treatment 2 is necessary, and the rapid and correct treatment and management of chronic pain can prevent the occurrence of potential negative consequences on the patient&#x27;s life and increase in healthcare costs.

==Social and personal impacts==

===Social support===
Social support has important consequences for individuals with chronic pain. In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain have been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain. Higher levels of pain were associated with a decrease in social activities, lower levels of social support, and reduced social functioning.

===Racial disparities===
Evidence exists for unconscious biases and negative stereotyping against racial minorities requesting pain treatment, although clinical decision making was not affected, according to one 2017 review. Minorities may be denied diagnoses for pain and pain medications, and are more likely to go through substance abuse assessment, and are less likely to transfer for pain specialist referral. A 2010 University of Michigan Health study found that black patients in pain clinics received 50% of the amount of drugs that patients who were white received. Preliminary research showed that health providers might have less empathy for black patients and underestimated their pain levels, resulting in treatment delays. Minorities may experience a language barrier, limiting the high level of engagement between the person with pain and health providers for treatment.

===Perceptions of injustice===
Similar to the damaging effects seen with catastrophizing, perceived injustice is thought to contribute to the severity and duration of chronic pain. Pain-related injustice perception has been conceptualized as a cognitive appraisal reflecting the severity and irreparability of pain- or injury-related loss (e.g., &quot;I just want my life back&quot;), and externalizing blame and unfairness (&quot;I am suffering because of someone else&#x27;s negligence.&quot;). It has been suggested that understanding problems with top down processing/cognitive appraisals can be used to better understand and treat this problem.

===Chronic pain and COVID-19===
COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of many, leading to major physical, psychological and socioeconomic impacts in the general population. Social distancing practices defining the response to the pandemic alter familiar patterns of social interaction, creating the conditions for what some psychologists are describing as a period of collective grief. Individuals with chronic pain tend to embody an ambiguous status, at times expressing that their type of suffering places them between and outside of conventional medicine. With a large proportion of the global population enduring prolonged periods of social isolation and distress, one study found that people with chronic pain from COVID-19 experienced more empathy towards their suffering during the pandemic.

=== Effect of chronic pain in the workplace ===
In the workplace, chronic pain conditions are a significant problem for both the person with the condition and the organization; a problem only expected to increase in many countries due to an aging workforce. In light of this, it may be helpful for organizations to consider the social environment of their workplace, and how it may be working to ease or worsen chronic pain issues for employees. As an example of how the social environment can affect chronic pain, some research has found that high levels of socially prescribed perfectionism (perfectionism induced by external pressure from others, such as a supervisor) can interact with the guilt felt by a person with chronic pain, thereby increasing job tension, and decreasing job satisfaction.

<text>Bruce Charles &quot;Bill&quot; Mollison (4 May 1928 – 24 September 2016) was an Australian researcher, author, scientist, teacher and biologist. In 1981, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for developing and promoting the theory and practice of permaculture&quot;.

Permaculture (from &quot;permanent agriculture&quot;) is an integrated system of ecological and environmental design which Mollison co-developed with David Holmgren and which they envisioned together as a perennial and sustainable form of agriculture. In 1974, Mollison began his collaboration with Holmgren and in 1978 they published their book &quot;Permaculture One&quot;, which introduced this design system to the general public. Mollison is also the developer of the herb spiral, a herb-growing structure that allows herbs with different growing requirements to coexist in a small space.

Mollison founded The Permaculture Institute in Tasmania and created the education system to train others under the umbrella of permaculture. This education system of &quot;train the trainer&quot;, utilized through a formal Permaculture Design Course and Certification (PDC), has taught hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world how to grow food and be sustainable using permaculture design principles.

==Life and work==
===Biography===
Bruce Charles &quot;Bill&quot; Mollison was born in 1928 in the Bass Strait fishing village of Stanley located in the north-west of Tasmania, Australia. In 1987, he moved from Tasmania to Tyalgum in the Tweed Valley of northern New South Wales, where he lived for the next decade before returning to Tasmania. He spent his final years at Sisters Beach, north-western Tasmania. He died in Hobart, Tasmania, in 2016, aged 88. He was survived by his fifth wife, Lisa, four daughters and two sons.

===Career===
Mollison left school at age 15 to help run the family bakery. In the following 10 years he worked as a shark fisherman, seaman, forester, mill worker, trapper, snarer, tractor-driver and naturalist.

In 1954, at the age of 26, Mollison joined and worked for the &#x27;Wildlife Survey Section&#x27; of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In the 1960s, he worked as a curator at the Tasmanian Museum. He also worked with the Inland Fisheries Commission, where he was able to resume his field work. In 1966, he entered the University of Tasmania. After he received a degree in bio-geography, he stayed on to lecture and teach and developed the unit of Environmental Psychology. He retired from teaching in 1979.

===Development of permaculture===
Mollison&#x27;s work with the CSIRO laid the foundation for his life-long passion: Permaculture. Mollison told his student Toby Hemenway that the original idea for permaculture came to him in 1959 while he was observing marsupials browsing in the Tasmanian rain forests, because he was &quot;inspired and awed by the life-giving abundance and rich interconnectedness of this eco-system.&quot; At that moment, Mollison jotted down the following words in his diary: &quot;I believe that we could build systems that would function as well as this one does.&quot; By the late 1960s, he started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of Tasmania. This resulted from his own personal observations of the growth and use of the industrial-agricultural methods that he believed had rapidly degraded the soil of his native state. In his view, these same methods posed a danger because they were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing biodiversity, and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes. Writes Mollison:
In 1974–75, he and David Holmgren &quot;jointly evolved a framework for a sustainable agricultural system based on a multi-crop of perennial trees, shrubs, herbs (vegetables and weeds), fungi, and root systems&quot; for which they coined the word &quot;permaculture&quot;. Holmgren was a student at the radical Environmental Design School in the Tasmanian College of Environmental Education. Mollison was a senior tutor in the Psychology Dept of the University of Tasmania.&quot;

Originally intended as a contraction of permanent agriculture, Mollison quickly realised it was a system for permanent culture, as without a productive landscape, a healthy ecology and a circular economy, no culture would survive. Permaculture began as both a positive concept – open to new information – and a practice that could integrate the knowledge about sustainable, ecological techniques from all parts of the world.

Soon after permaculture was first introduced and then put into practice by the public, Mollison recognized that permaculture principles encompassed a movement that included not only agriculture, horticulture, architecture, and ecology, but also economic systems, land access strategies, and legal systems for businesses and communities:
He helped found the first Permaculture Institute, established in 1979 to &quot;teach the practical design of sustainable soil, water, plant, and legal and economic systems to students worldwide.&quot; Bill Mollison taught the first Permaculture Design course at Stanley, Tasmania in January 1980. It was attended by 10 Australian students including Max O&#x27;Lindegger and Denis McCarthy (co-recipients of the first Permaculture Institute&#x27;s Community Service Award), Dave Blewett (author of Arid Land Permaculture), Ginger Gordy (second President of the Permaculture Association of WA), Kirsten Beggs (WA), John Fargher (SA) and Tagari Community members Andrew Jeeves &amp; Simon Fjell (co-founder Permaculture Institute in 1979, currently Permaculture Institute International). In May 1980 Bill Mollison, his wife Philomena, Andrew Jeeves, Peter Moore (photographer) and Denis McCarthy began a three month lecture tour of USA and Canada, during which he visited &amp; gave talks at the International Tree Crops Institute (Miles &amp; Libby Merwin, Winters, CA), Farallones Institute Rural Centre (Sonoma, CA), Integral Urban House (Berkeley, CA), Village Homes (Davis, CA), Appropriate Technology Group (Professor Isao Fujimoto, Davis CA), The Tree People (Andy Lipkis, Los Angeles, CA), Rural Education Center (Samuel Kaymen, Wilton NH, in 1983 called Stonyfield Farm), New Alchemy Institute (John &amp; Nancy Todd, Woods Hole, MA), Institute for Local Self-Reliance (Washington, DC), Office of Appropriate Technology (Scott Sklar, now Professor Scott Sklar, Director George Washington Solar Institute, Washington, DC), and The Farm (Summertown, TN) He taught a three-week course at The Tree People in Los Angeles in 1981. In 1981, the first graduates of the permaculture design course (PDC) that he had helped to initiate, started to design permaculture systems in their respective communities. In this way, the philosophy of permaculture had begun to move beyond its original context in &quot;land management&quot; to cover most, if not all, aspects of human life.

In 1987, Mollison taught the first PDC course that was offered in India. By 2011 there had been over 300,000 such graduates practicing and teaching throughout the world.

He has been called the founder and &quot;father&quot; of permaculture.

<doc id="144842" wikidata="Q1416634" url="?curid=144842" title="River Axe (Lyme Bay)">
<text>The River Axe is a long river in the counties of Dorset, Somerset and Devon, in the south-west of England. It rises in Dorset and flows south to Lyme Bay which it enters through the Axe Estuary in Devon. It is a shallow, non-navigable river, although its mouth at Seaton has some boating activity. The name &quot;Axe&quot; derives from a Common Brittonic word meaning &quot;abounding in fish&quot;, and is cognate with &quot;pysg&quot; (a variant of &quot;pysgod&quot;), the Welsh word for fish.

The River Axe rises in several streams to the south of Chedington in Dorset, close to the source of the River Parrett that flows north to the Bristol Channel. The Axe then flows west through Mosterton and Seaborough before turning south and forming the county boundary between Dorset and Somerset. In this section it flows past the villages of Wayford and Winsham, and the former Forde Abbey. At a point some north of Axminster it is joined by the Blackwater River and enters the county of Devon. It is then joined by the River Kit, before passing through Axminster after which it is joined by the River Yarty and continues south by the villages of Whitford and Colyford, where it is joined by the River Coly. At this point it spreads out to form the tidal Axe Estuary. The estuary flows past the village of Axmouth, on its eastern bank, before passing through a high shingle bank to the east of the seaside town of Seaton and entering Lyme Bay on the English Channel.

In 1999, a section of the river extending for —from the confluence with the Blackwater River to Colyford Bridge—was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by England&#x27;s conservation body, Natural England. It was described as supporting &quot;an exceptionally diverse aquatic and marginal flora&quot;. The river&#x27;s diversity comes from its active geomorphology, which has created a number of natural features that support niche ecologies; it also comes from there being a limited number of trees on the river bank, allowing in light; and also the riverbed stability in the lower reaches of the river. A majority of the SSSI runs through Devon; only runs through Dorset. The underlying geology of the riverbed is alluvium with areas of valley gravel, clay, shale and marl. The fish life in the river is considered of European interest; ;other animals include more generally includes salmon, bullheads, otters, medicinal leeches and kingfishers, whilst there is a diverse aquatic and marginal plant life. The geomorphology of the meanders south of Axminster are the particular geological interest.

Although now shallow and largely unnavigable, the estuary of the Axe was once important for shipping. According to Historic England, the village of Axmouth, which is some inland, &#x27;was ranked as a major port by the mid-14th century and accounted for 15% of the country’s shipping trade&#x27;. The remains of a late medieval fishing boat can be seen at low tide in the river, just south-west of Axmouth village. Over the following years the estuary silted up and a moving shingle bar formed at the mouth. In 1870 the current Axmouth Harbour was developed at the river mouth. Although the harbour is nearer the town of Seaton than the village of Axmouth, the harbour and all of the estuary are in the parish of Axmouth.

The estuary is flanked to its west by a series of low-level nature reserves, collectively known as Seaton Wetlands and including Seaton Marshes, Black Hole Marsh, Colyford Common and Stafford Marsh. Between them, these reserves include freshwater grazing marshes, intertidal lagoons, scrapes, ditches and bird hides, and are host to a diverse variety of birds and mammals such as otters. The reserves are separated from the estuary by the embankment of the former Seaton branch railway, which now carries the Seaton Tramway on its route between Seaton, Colyford and Colyton. with the open-topped trams offering a good view of both estuary and reserves. To its east, the estuary is flanked by the steeply rising land of the hills behind the Jurassic Coast and the Axmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff.

Prehistoric archaeology: The Axe valley has produced evidence for some of the earliest human (Palaeolithic) activity in the south-west of England. The Broom gravel pits (near Holditch) produced at least 1,800 Lower Palaeolithic handaxes when they were quarried in the late 19th century and the 1930s and 1940s. More recent archaeological investigations suggested that these artefacts are around 300,000 years old. Similar artefacts have been found in the gravel pits around Chard Junction.

<text>Brisance (; ) is the shattering capability of a high explosive, determined mainly by its detonation pressure.

==Application==
Brisance is of practical importance in explosives engineering for determining the effectiveness of an explosion in blasting and quarrying, and in weaponry such as fragmenting shells, bomb casings, grenades, and plastic explosives. The sand crush test and Trauzl lead block test are commonly used to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT (which is considered a standard reference for many purposes).

The value of brisance depends on the application. At one extreme, if an explosive is to be used for propulsion, e.g. by driving a piston or a bullet, brisance is likely to be undesirable, because the objective will be to &quot;move&quot; the load, not to shatter it or the engine or firearm, nor to produce a loud report. Such propulsive charges are designed to burn controllably, such as carburetted fuel/air mixes in vehicle piston engines, or nitrocellulose fibres or grains of controlled textures in firearm cartridges. 

For certain types of blasting, as in some civil engineering works, the objective is to loosen the undesired material with the least amount of explosion and expense, both in explosive and safety precautions. Similarly, in quarrying a product such as slate, in which the objective is to loosen it from surrounding rock with as little damage as possible, no more brisance than is necessary to split off the valuable product profitably, without unacceptable waste, is desired. For this purpose blasting powder of &quot;low&quot; brisance is necessary. 

In shattering hard rock or military defences, high brisance generally is necessary, so high explosives with extremely high detonation velocity are used as far as is practical. One of the most brisant of the conventional explosives is cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (also known as RDX or Hexogen). RDX is the explosive agent in the plastic explosive commonly known as C-4, constituting 91% RDX by mass.

Fragmentation occurs by the action of the transmitted shock wave, the strength of which depends on the detonation pressure of the explosive. Generally, the higher this pressure, the finer the fragments generated. High detonation pressure correlates with high detonation velocity, the speed at which the detonation wave propagates through the explosive, but not necessarily with the explosive&#x27;s total energy (or work capacity), some of which may be released after passage of the detonation wave. A more brisant explosive, therefore, projects smaller fragments but not necessarily at a higher velocity than a less brisant one.

<doc id="144848" wikidata="Q193982" url="?curid=144848" title="Sinéad O'Connor">
<text>Shuhada&#x27; Sadaqat (born Sinéad Marie Bernadette O&#x27;Connor ( ); 8 December 1966 – 26 July 2023) was an Irish singer, songwriter, and activist. Her debut studio album, &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;, was released in 1987 and achieved international chart success. Her 1990 album, &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;, was her biggest commercial success, selling over seven million copies worldwide. Its lead single, &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, was honoured as the top world single of the year at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

O&#x27;Connor achieved chart success with &quot;Am I Not Your Girl?&quot; (1992) and &quot;Universal Mother&quot; (1994), both certified gold in the UK, as well as &quot;Faith and Courage&quot; (2000), certified gold in Australia. &quot;Throw Down Your Arms&quot; (2005) achieved gold status in Ireland. Her career encompassed songs for films, collaborations with numerous artists, and appearances at charity fundraising concerts. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Rememberings,&quot; was released in 2021 and became a bestseller.

O&#x27;Connor drew attention to issues such as child abuse, human rights, racism, and women&#x27;s rights. During a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performance in 1992, nearly a decade before the world became fully aware of the prolific sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, she tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II to protest against the abuse, sparking controversy by those who did not know or who were hiding the truth of the scandal. Throughout her musical career, she openly discussed her spiritual journey, activism, socio-political viewpoints, and her experiences with trauma and struggles with mental health. Having converted to Islam in 2018, she adopted the name Shuhada&#x27; Sadaqat while continuing to perform and record under her birth name. In 2024, O&#x27;Connor was posthumously nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Early life and education ==
Sinéad Marie Bernadette O&#x27;Connor was born on 8 December 1966 at the Cascia House Nursing Home on Baggot Street in Dublin. She was named Sinéad after Sinéad de Valera, the mother of the doctor who presided over her delivery (Éamon de Valera, Jnr.), and Bernadette in honour of Saint Bernadette of Lourdes. She was the third of five children; an older brother is the novelist Joseph O&#x27;Connor. Her parents were John Oliver &quot;Seán&quot; O&#x27;Connor, a structural engineer later turned barrister and chairperson of the Divorce Action Group, and Johanna Marie O&#x27;Grady (1939–1985), who married in 1960 at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Drimnagh, Dublin. She attended Dominican College Sion Hill school in Blackrock, County Dublin.

In her 2021 memoir, &quot;Rememberings&quot;, O&#x27;Connor wrote that she was regularly beaten by her mother, who also taught her to steal from the collection plate at Mass and from charity tins. In 1979, at age 13, O&#x27;Connor went to live with her father, who had recently returned to Ireland after marrying Viola Margaret Suiter () in Alexandria, Virginia, United States, in 1976.

At the age of 15, following her acts of shoplifting and truancy, O&#x27;Connor was placed for 18 months in the Grianán Training Centre in Drumcondra, which was run by the Order of Our Lady of Charity. She thrived in certain aspects, particularly in the development of her writing and music, but she chafed under the imposed conformity of the asylum, despite being given freedoms not granted to the other girls, such as attending an outside school and being allowed to listen to music, write songs, etc. For punishment, O&#x27;Connor described how &quot;if you were bad, they sent you upstairs to sleep in the old folks&#x27; home. You&#x27;re in there in the pitch black, you can smell the shit and the puke and everything, and these old women are moaning in their sleep  ... I have never—and probably will never—experience such panic and terror and agony over anything.&quot; She later attended Maryfield College in Drumcondra, and Newtown School in Waterford for fifth and sixth year as a boarder, but did not sit the Leaving Certificate in 1985.

On 10 February 1985, when O&#x27;Connor was 18, her mother died in a car accident, aged 45, after losing control of her car on an icy road in Ballybrack and crashing into a bus. In June 1993, O&#x27;Connor wrote a public letter in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in which she asked people to &quot;stop hurting&quot; her: &quot;If only I can fight off the voices of my parents / and gather a sense of self-esteem / Then I&#x27;ll be able to REALLY sing ...&quot; The letter repeated accusations of child abuse by her parents as a child which O&#x27;Connor had made in interviews. Her brother Joseph defended their father to the newspaper but agreed regarding their mother&#x27;s &quot;extreme and violent abuse, both emotional and physical&quot;. That month, Sinéad said: &quot;Our family is very messed up. We can&#x27;t communicate with each other. We are all in agony. I for one am in agony.&quot;

== Music career ==

===1980s===

One of the volunteers at the Grianán centre was the sister of Paul Byrne, the drummer for the band In Tua Nua, who heard O&#x27;Connor singing &quot;Evergreen&quot; by Barbra Streisand. She recorded a song with them called &quot;Take My Hand&quot; but they felt that at 15, she was too young to join the band. Through an ad she placed in &quot;Hot Press&quot; in mid-1984, she met Colm Farrelly. Together they recruited a few other members and formed a band, Ton Ton Macoute. The band moved to Waterford briefly while O&#x27;Connor attended Newtown School, but she soon dropped out of school and followed them to Dublin, where their performances received positive reviews. Their sound was inspired by Farrelly&#x27;s interest in world music, though most observers thought O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s singing and stage presence were the band&#x27;s strongest features.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s time with Ton Ton Macoute brought her to the attention of the music industry, and she was eventually signed by Ensign Records. She also acquired an experienced manager, Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh, former head of U2&#x27;s Mother Records. Soon after she was signed, she embarked on her first major assignment, providing the vocals for the song &quot;Heroine&quot;, which she co-wrote with the U2 guitarist the Edge for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Captive&quot;. Ó Ceallaigh, who had been fired by U2 for complaining about them in an interview, was outspoken with his views on music and politics, and O&#x27;Connor adopted the same habits; she defended the actions of the Provisional IRA and said U2&#x27;s music was &quot;bombastic&quot;. She later retracted her IRA comments saying they were based on nonsense, and that she was &quot;too young to understand the tense situation in Northern Ireland properly&quot;.

=== 1987–1989: &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot; ===

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot;, was &quot;a sensation&quot; when it was released in 1987 on Chrysalis Records. O&#x27;Connor named Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Pretenders as the artists who influenced her on her debut album. The single &quot;Mandinka&quot; was a college radio hit in the United States, and &quot;I Want Your (Hands on Me)&quot; received both college and urban play in a remixed form that featured rapper MC Lyte. The song &quot;Troy&quot; was also released as a single in the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands, where it reached number 5 on the Dutch Top 40 chart.

In her first US network television appearance, O&#x27;Connor sang &quot;Mandinka&quot; on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1988. She was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and performed &quot;Mandinka&quot; at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards. She painted the logo of the hip hop group Public Enemy on her head to protest the first-ever Best Rap Performance award being conferred off-screen.

In 1989, O&#x27;Connor provided guest vocals on The The album &quot;Mind Bomb&quot;, on the duet &quot;Kingdom of Rain&quot;. That same year, she made another foray into cinema, starring in and writing the music for the Northern Irish film &quot;Hush-a-Bye-Baby&quot;.
=== 1990–1993: &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot; ===
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s second album, &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;, was released in 1990. It gained considerable attention and mostly positive reviews. &quot;NME&quot; named it the year&#x27;s second-best album. She was praised for her voice and original songs, while being noted for her appearance: trademark shaved head, often angry expression, and sometimes shapeless or unusual clothing. Her shaved head has been seen as a statement against traditional views of femininity.

The album featured Marco Pirroni (of Adam and the Ants fame), Andy Rourke (from the Smiths) and John Reynolds, her first husband. It contained her international breakthrough hit &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, a song written by Prince and originally recorded and released by a side project of his, the Family. Hank Shocklee, producer for Public Enemy, remixed the album&#x27;s next single, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, for a 12-inch that was coupled with another song from the LP, &quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot;. Pre-dating but included on &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;, was &quot;Jump in the River&quot;, which originally appeared on the &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; soundtrack; the 12-inch version of the single had included a remix featuring performance artist Karen Finley.

O&#x27;Connor withdrew from a scheduled appearance on the American programme &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when she learnt that it was to be hosted by Andrew Dice Clay, who she said was disrespectful to women. In July 1990, O&#x27;Connor joined other guests for the former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters&#x27; performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; in Berlin. She contributed a cover of &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute/AIDS fundraising album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; was followed by the release of &quot;Am I Not Your Girl?&quot;, an album made of covers of jazz standards and torch songs she had listened to while growing up; the album received mixed-to-poor reviews, and was a commercial disappointment in light of the success of her previous work. Her take on Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifice&quot; was acclaimed as one of the best efforts on the tribute album &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot;.
Also in 1990, O&#x27;Connor said she would not perform if the United States national anthem was played before one of her concerts, saying she felt the American music industry was racist. She was attacked as ungrateful and anti-American, and drew criticism from celebrities including the singer Frank Sinatra, who threatened to &quot;kick her in the ass&quot;. When people steamrolled her albums outside the offices of her record company in New York City, O&#x27;Connor attended in a wig and sunglasses and gave a television interview pretending to be from Saratoga.

O&#x27;Connor was nominated for four awards at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards and won for Best Alternative Music Performance. She refused to attend the ceremony or accept her award, and wrote an open letter to the Recording Academy criticising the industry for promoting materialistic values over artistic merit. At the Brit Awards 1991, she won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist, but did not attend the ceremony. She accepted the Irish IRMA in February 1991.

O&#x27;Connor spent the following months studying bel canto singing with teacher Frank Merriman at the Parnell School of Music. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, published in May 1993, she reported that the lessons were the only therapy she was receiving, describing Merriman as &quot;the most amazing teacher in the universe&quot;.

In 1992, O&#x27;Connor contributed vocals on the songs &quot;Come Talk to Me&quot; and &quot;Blood of Eden&quot; from the album &quot;Us&quot; by Peter Gabriel.

====&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; protest====
On 3 October 1992, O&#x27;Connor appeared on the American television programme &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) and staged a protest against the Roman Catholic Church. After performing an a cappella rendition of Bob Marley&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;War&quot; with new lyrics related to child abuse, she tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II taken from her mother&#x27;s bedroom wall eight years earlier, said &quot;fight the real enemy&quot;, and threw the pieces to the floor. A month later, O&#x27;Connor said she felt the Catholic Church bore some responsibility for the physical, sexual and emotional abuse she had suffered as a child. In describing her actions, she said the church had destroyed &quot;entire races of people&quot;, and that Catholic priests had been abusing children for years. Her protest took place nine years before John Paul II publicly acknowledged child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.

The protest triggered hundreds of complaints from viewers. It attracted criticism from institutions including the Anti-Defamation League and the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, and celebrities including Roman Catholic Mezzogiorno Italian Americans Joe Pesci, Frank Sinatra and Madonna, who mocked the performance on &quot;SNL&quot; later that season. Two weeks after her &quot;SNL&quot; appearance, O&#x27;Connor was booed at the 30th-anniversary tribute concert for Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden in New York City before Kris Kristofferson came on stage, put his arm around her and offered words of encouragement. In her 2021 memoir, &quot;Rememberings&quot;, O&#x27;Connor wrote that she did not regret the protest and that it was more important for her to be a protest singer than a successful pop star. &quot;Time&quot; later named O&#x27;Connor the most influential woman of 1992 for her protest.

=== 1993–2000 ===
The 1993 soundtrack to the film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; featured O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart&quot;. Her more conventional &quot;Universal Mother&quot; album (1994) spawned two music videos for the first and second singles, &quot;Fire on Babylon&quot; and &quot;Famine&quot;, that were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. She toured with Lollapalooza in 1995, but dropped out when she became pregnant with her second child. In 1997, she released the &quot;Gospel Oak&quot; EP.

In 1994, she appeared in &quot;A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who&quot;, also known as &quot;Daltrey Sings Townshend&quot;. This was a two-night concert at Carnegie Hall produced by Roger Daltrey of the Who in celebration of his 50th birthday. A CD and a VHS video of the concert were issued in 1994, followed by a DVD in 1998.In January 1995, O&#x27;Connor appeared on the British late-night television programme &quot;After Dark&quot; on an episode titled &quot;Ireland: Sex &amp; Celibacy, Church &amp; State&quot;. She linked abuse in families to the Catholic Church. The discussion included a Dominican friar and another representative of the Roman Catholic Church, along with former taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. Host Helena Kennedy described the event: &quot;Sinéad came on and argued that abuse in families was coded in by the church because it refused to accept the accounts of women and children.&quot;

In 1996, O&#x27;Connor provided guest vocals on &quot;Broken China&quot;, a solo album by Richard Wright of Pink Floyd. She made her final feature film appearance in Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot; in 1997, playing the Virgin Mary. Also in 1997, she performed in the Nobel Peace Prize concert in Oslo, Norway, singing &quot;This is a Rebel Song&quot; and &quot;He Moved Through the Fair&quot;. In 1998, she worked again with the Red Hot Organization to co-produce and perform on &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;.

===2000s===

&quot;Faith and Courage&quot; was released in 2000, including the single &quot;No Man&#x27;s Woman&quot;, and featured contributions from Wyclef Jean of the Fugees and Dave Stewart of Eurythmics.

Her 2002 album, &quot;Sean-Nós Nua&quot;, marked a departure in that O&#x27;Connor interpreted or, in her own words, &quot;sexed up&quot; traditional Irish folk songs, including several in the Irish language. In &quot;Sean-Nós Nua&quot;, she covered a well-known Canadian folk song, &quot;Peggy Gordon&quot;.

In 2003, she contributed a track to the Dolly Parton tribute album &quot;Just Because I&#x27;m a Woman&quot;, a cover of Parton&#x27;s &quot;Dagger Through the Heart&quot;. That same year, she also featured on three songs of Massive Attack&#x27;s album &quot;100th Window&quot; before releasing her double album, &quot;She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty&quot;. This compilation contained one disc of demos and previously unreleased tracks and one disc of a live concert recording. Directly after the album&#x27;s release, O&#x27;Connor announced that she was retiring from music. &quot;Collaborations&quot;, a compilation album of guest appearances, was released in 2005—featuring tracks recorded with Peter Gabriel, Massive Attack, Jah Wobble, Terry Hall, Moby, Bomb the Bass, the Edge, U2, and The The.

Ultimately, after a brief period of inactivity and a bout with fibromyalgia, her retirement proved to be short-lived. O&#x27;Connor stated in an interview with &quot;Harp&quot; magazine that she had only intended to retire from making mainstream pop/rock music, and after dealing with her fibromyalgia she chose to move into other musical styles. The reggae album &quot;Throw Down Your Arms&quot; appeared in late 2005.

On 8 November 2006, O&#x27;Connor performed seven songs from her upcoming album &quot;Theology&quot; at The Sugar Club in Dublin. Thirty fans were given the opportunity to win pairs of tickets to attend along with music industry critics. The performance was released in 2008 as &quot;Live at the Sugar Club&quot; deluxe CD/DVD package sold exclusively on her website.

O&#x27;Connor released two songs from her album &quot;Theology&quot; to download for free from her official website: &quot;If You Had a Vineyard&quot; and &quot;Jeremiah (Something Beautiful)&quot;. The album, a collection of covered and original Rastafari spiritual songs, was released in June 2007. The first single from the album, the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber classic &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;, was released on 30 April 2007. To promote the album, O&#x27;Connor toured extensively in Europe and North America. She also appeared on two tracks of the Ian Brown album &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;, including the anti-war single &quot;Illegal Attacks&quot;.

===2010s===
In January 2010, O&#x27;Connor performed a duet with the R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige produced by former A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s song &quot;This Is To Mother You&quot; (first recorded by O&#x27;Connor on her 1997 &quot;Gospel Oak&quot; EP). The proceeds of the song&#x27;s sales were donated to the organisation GEMS (Girls Educational and Mentoring Services). In 2012 the song &quot;Lay Your Head Down&quot;, written by Brian Byrne and Glenn Close for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; and performed by O&#x27;Connor, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.
 In 2011, O&#x27;Connor worked on recording a new album, titled &quot;Home&quot;, to be released in the beginning of 2012, titled &quot;How About I Be Me (and You Be You)?&quot;, with the first single being &quot;The Wolf is Getting Married&quot;. She planned an extensive tour in support of the album but suffered a serious breakdown between December 2011 and March 2012, resulting in the tour and all her other musical activities for the rest of 2012 being cancelled. O&#x27;Connor resumed touring in 2013 with The Crazy Baldhead Tour. The second single &quot;4th and Vine&quot; was released on 18 February 2013.

In February 2014, it was revealed that O&#x27;Connor had been recording a new album of original material, titled &quot;The Vishnu Room&quot;, consisting of romantic love songs. In early June 2014, the new album was retitled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Bossy, I&#x27;m the Boss&quot;, with an 11 August release date. The title derives from the Ban Bossy campaign that took place earlier the same year. The album&#x27;s first single is entitled &quot;Take Me to Church&quot;.

In November 2014, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s management was taken over by Simon Napier-Bell and Björn de Water. On 15 November, O&#x27;Connor joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording a new version of the track &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.

In 2017, O&#x27;Connor changed her legal name to Magda Davitt, saying she wished to be free of &quot;patriarchal slave names&quot; and &quot;parental curses&quot;. In September 2019, she performed live for the first time in five years, singing &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; with the Irish Chamber Orchestra on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

===2020–2023: Memoir and death of son===
O&#x27;Connor released a cover of Mahalia Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Trouble of the World&quot; in October 2020, with proceeds from the single to benefit Black Lives Matter charities. O&#x27;Connor released the memoir &quot;Rememberings&quot; on 1 June 2021 to positive reviews, listed among the best books of the year on &quot;BBC Culture&quot;. The Irish postal service An Post released a postage stamp on 15 July 2021 bearing an image of O&#x27;Connor singing.

O&#x27;Connor announced in June 2021 that the album &quot;No Veteran Dies Alone&quot; would be her last, and that she was retiring from music. She retracted the statement days later, describing it as &quot;a knee-jerk reaction&quot; to an insensitive interview, and announced that her scheduled 2022 tour would go ahead. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s son Shane died by suicide at the age of 17 on 7 January 2022. O&#x27;Connor canceled her tour and &quot;No Veteran Dies Alone&quot; was postponed indefinitely. According to the producer David Holmes, by the time of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death in 2023, the album was &quot;emotional and really personal&quot; and was complete but for one song.

In February 2023, O&#x27;Connor shared a version of &quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot;, a 19th-century Scottish adaptation of a 1782 Gaelic song, which is also the theme for the fantasy drama series &quot;Outlander&quot;. The following month she was awarded the inaugural Choice Music Prize Classic Irish Album by the Irish broadcaster RTÉ for her 1990 album &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;. In September 2023, BBC Television drama series &quot;The Woman in the Wall&quot;, which focuses on the Irish Magdalene Laundries, played an unreleased O&#x27;Connor song, &quot;The Magdalene Song&quot;. The song had been given to the series&#x27; producers by O&#x27;Connor shortly before her death.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first son, Jake, was born on 16 June 1987. His father was the music producer John Reynolds, who co-produced several of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Universal Mother&quot;. O&#x27;Connor married Reynolds at Westminster Register Office in March 1989. She had an abortion the same year, and later wrote the song &quot;My Special Child&quot; about the experience. The couple announced their plan to divorce in November 1991 after having been separated for some time.

In September 1995, O&#x27;Connor announced that she was pregnant by her friend, the Irish columnist John Waters. Their daughter, Brigidine Roisin Waters, generally known as Roisin, was born on 6 March 1996. Soon after the birth, the pair began a long custody battle that ended in 1999 with O&#x27;Connor agreeing to let Roisin live with Waters in Dublin.

In August 2001, O&#x27;Connor married the British journalist Nick Sommerlad in Wales. Their marriage ended after 11 months, in July 2002, when they mutually agreed to part. By February 2003, the marriage was reportedly over and Sommerlad had moved back home to the United Kingdom. O&#x27;Connor gave birth to her third child, son Shane, on 10 March 2004; his father was the Irish musician Dónal Lunny. Her fourth child, son Yeshua, was born on 19 December 2006, fathered by Frank Bonadio. The pair remained on good terms after separating in early 2007.

O&#x27;Connor was married a third time on 22 July 2010, to her longtime friend and collaborator Steve Cooney. They separated in March 2011. She was married a fourth time on 9 December 2011, to the Irish therapist Barry Herridge; they wed in Las Vegas and the marriage ended after they had &quot;lived together for 7 days only&quot;. On 3 January 2012, O&#x27;Connor said that she and Herridge had reunited. In February 2014, she stated that they had not divorced and were planning to renew their wedding vows, but two weeks later they decided not to do so. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first grandson was born on 18 July 2015, to her son Jake and his girlfriend.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 17-year-old son Shane was found dead from suicide in January 2022. O&#x27;Connor, who had lost custody of Shane in 2013, said he had recently been on suicide watch at Tallaght Hospital. She criticised the Health Service Executive (HSE) for their handling of her son&#x27;s case. A week after her son&#x27;s death, O&#x27;Connor admitted herself to a hospital to receive help for her own mental health struggles.

===Other relationships===
O&#x27;Connor stated that she had a relationship with her manager Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh immediately after her marriage to John Reynolds and during the tour of The Lion and The Cobra. The extra-conjugal relationship ended in 1989 when O&#x27;Connor discovered that Ceallaigh was secretly having an affair with another woman. This experience is reflected in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s song &quot;The Last Day of Our Acquaintance&quot;.

Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers claimed he had a relationship with O&#x27;Connor in 1990 and wrote the song &quot;I Could Have Lied&quot; about the experience. O&#x27;Connor denied this, saying &quot;I never had a relationship with him, ever. I hung out with him a few times and the row we had was because he suggested we might become involved. I don&#x27;t give a shit about the song he wrote.&quot;

Between 1992 and 1993, O&#x27;Connor had an affair with British singer Peter Gabriel, whom she accompanied on his Secret World Tour in May 1993 and at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards in September. In October 1993, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, at the age of 27, said she had attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills as a reaction to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s refusal to make their relationship permanent. This experience inspired her to write &quot;Thank You for Hearing Me&quot;.

In 2014, O&#x27;Connor said she &quot;didn&#x27;t get on at all&quot; with Prince, the writer of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;. According to O&#x27;Connor, Prince demanded she visit him at his home and then chastised her for swearing in interviews, so she told him to &quot;fuck off&quot;, at which point Prince became violent and she fled. In her memoir, O&#x27;Connor gave some details of Prince&#x27;s behaviour, which ranged from having his butler serve up soup despite her repeatedly refusing it, to suggesting a pillow fight and then hitting her with a hard object placed in a pillowcase, and stalking her with his car after she had left the mansion.

===Homes===
In 2007, O&#x27;Connor bought a large Victorian seafront house in Bray, County Wicklow, near Dublin. She sold the property in 2021, after moving temporarily to her holiday home. She later lived at a house in the Kilglass/Scramogue area, between Strokestown and Roosky, County Roscommon, and on the main street of Knockananna, County Wicklow, which she sold in 2022. She later also had a home in Dalkey, a south-east suburb of Dublin. In early 2023, she moved to a flat in London to feel &quot;less lonely&quot;, and said she would soon finish her new album.

===Sexuality===
In a 2000 interview in &quot;Curve&quot;, O&#x27;Connor said that she was a lesbian. She later retracted the statement, and in 2005 told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m three-quarters heterosexual, a quarter gay&quot;.

In 2013, O&#x27;Connor published an open letter on her own website to American singer and actress Miley Cyrus in which she warned Cyrus of the treatment of women in the music industry and stated that sexuality is a factor in this, which was in response to Cyrus&#x27;s music video for her song &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. Cyrus responded by mocking O&#x27;Connor and alluding to her mental health problems. After O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death, Cyrus publicly apologised for her behaviour.

===Politics===
O&#x27;Connor was a vocal supporter of a united Ireland, and called on the left-wing republican Sinn Féin party to be &quot;braver&quot;. O&#x27;Connor called for the &quot;demolition&quot; of the Republic of Ireland and its replacement with a new, united country. She also called for key Sinn Féin politicians like Gerry Adams to step down because &quot;they remind people of violence&quot;, referring to the Troubles.

In 2014, she refused to play in Israel as an act of protest against unjust treatment of Palestinians, stating that &quot;Let&#x27;s just say that, on a human level, nobody with any sanity, including myself, would have anything but sympathy for the Palestinian plight&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with the BBC, O&#x27;Connor said she wished that Ireland had remained under British rule (which ended after the Irish War of Independence, except for Northern Ireland), saying &quot;the church took over and it was disastrous&quot;. Following the Brexit referendum in 2016, O&#x27;Connor wrote on Facebook &quot;Ireland is officially no longer owned by Britain&quot;.

===Religion===
In contradiction with Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women, O&#x27;Connor was ordained in 1999 by Michael Cox, bishop of an Independent Catholic church. The bishop offered her ordination following her appearance on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, during which she told presenter Gay Byrne that had she not been a singer she would have wished to have been a Catholic priest. O&#x27;Connor adopted the religious name Mother Bernadette Mary.

In a July 2007 interview with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, O&#x27;Connor stated that she considered herself a Christian and that she believed in core Christian concepts about the Trinity and Jesus Christ. She said, &quot;I think God saves everybody whether they want to be saved or not. So when we die, we&#x27;re all going home [...] I don&#x27;t think God judges anybody. He loves everybody equally.&quot; In an October 2002 interview, she credited her Christian faith in giving her the strength to live through and overcome the effects of her childhood abuse.

On 26 March 2010, O&#x27;Connor appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; to speak out about the Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland. On 28 March 2010, she had an opinion piece published in the Sunday edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which she wrote about the scandal and her time in a Magdalene laundry as a teenager. Writing for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; she labelled the Vatican as &quot;a nest of devils&quot; and called for the establishment of an &quot;alternative church&quot;, opining that &quot;Christ is being murdered by liars&quot; in the Vatican. Shortly after the election of Pope Francis, she said:

Asked whether from her point of view, it is therefore irrelevant who is elected to be pope, O&#x27;Connor replied:

Tatiana Kavelka wrote about O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s later Christian work, describing it as &quot;theologically charged yet unorthodox, oriented toward interfaith dialogue and those on the margins&quot;. In August 2018, via an open letter, she asked Pope Francis to issue a certificate of excommunication to her, as she had also asked Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II.

In October 2018, O&#x27;Connor converted to Islam, calling it &quot;the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian&#x27;s journey&quot;. The ceremony was conducted in Ireland by Sunni Islamic theologian Shaykh Umar Al-Qadri. She also changed her name to Shuhada&#x27; Davitt. In a message on Twitter, she thanked fellow Muslims for their support and uploaded a video of herself reciting the &quot;adhan&quot;, the Islamic call to prayer. She also posted photos of herself wearing a hijab. She later changed her surname from Davitt to Sadaqat.

After her conversion to Islam, Sadaqat called those who were not Muslims &quot;disgusting&quot; and criticised Christian and Jewish theologians on Twitter in November 2018. She wrote: &quot;What I&#x27;m about to say is something so racist I never thought my soul could ever feel it. But truly I never wanna spend time with white people again (if that&#x27;s what non-muslims are called). Not for one moment, for any reason. They are disgusting.&quot; Two days later, she tweeted that anyone who is not Muslim is &quot;mentally ill&quot;. Later that month, Sadaqat stated that her remarks were made in an attempt to force Twitter to close down her account. In September 2019, she apologised for the remarks, saying &quot;They were not true at the time and they are not true now. I was triggered as a result of Islamophobia dumped on me. I apologize for hurt caused. That was one of many crazy tweets lord knows.&quot;

===Health===
In the early 2000s, O&#x27;Connor revealed that she suffered from fibromyalgia. The pain and fatigue she experienced caused her to take a break from music from 2003 to 2005.

On an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; broadcast on 4 October 2007, O&#x27;Connor disclosed that she had attempted suicide on her 33rd birthday, 8 December 1999, and that she had since been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

In August 2015, she announced that she was to undergo a hysterectomy after suffering gynaecological problems for over three years. She later blamed the hospital&#x27;s refusal to administer hormone replacement therapy after the operation as the main reason for her mental health issues in subsequent years, stating &quot;I was flung into surgical menopause. Hormones were everywhere. I became very suicidal. I was a basket case.&quot;

A cannabis smoker for 30 years, O&#x27;Connor went to a rehabilitation centre in 2016, to end her addiction. She stated in February 2020 that she was agoraphobic. She had also previously been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder.

In August 2017, O&#x27;Connor posted a 12-minute video on her Facebook page in which she stated that she had felt alone since losing custody of her 13-year-old son, Shane, and that for the previous two years she had wanted to kill herself, with only her doctor and psychiatrist &quot;keeping her alive&quot;. The month after her Facebook post, O&#x27;Connor appeared on the 16th-season debut episode of American television talk show &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;. According to the show&#x27;s host, Phil McGraw, O&#x27;Connor wanted to do the interview because she wished to &quot;destigmatise mental illness&quot;, noting the prevalence of mental health problems among musicians. In 2021, O&#x27;Connor commented that she had spent much of the last six years in St Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital in Dublin, and that she was grateful to them for helping her stay alive.

=== Death ===
O&#x27;Connor died on 26 July 2023 in her flat in Herne Hill, south London, at the age of 56. The cause of death was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma.

A private funeral was held on 8 August in Bray, County Wicklow. It was attended by the president of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, and O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s family invited the public to pay their respects at the seafront where the funeral cortège passed. Thousands attended bearing signs and tributes; her burial was held privately at Dean&#x27;s Grange Cemetery.

== Tributes ==

Celebrities including BP Fallon, Janelle Monáe, Patton Oswalt, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tori Amos, Bear McCreary, Massive Attack, Public Enemy, Amanda Palmer, and Toni Collette posted tributes on social media. English singer Morrissey wrote a tribute criticising the reaction from executives and celebrities, and wrote: &quot;You praise her now only because it is too late. You hadn&#x27;t the guts to support her when she was alive and she was looking for you.&quot;

American singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers wrote a tribute to O&#x27;Connor in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, praising her integrity. In November 2023, Boygenius and Irish group Ye Vagabonds released a cover of the Scottish folk song &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; as a charity Christmas song and tribute to O&#x27;Connor.

On 9 January 2024, it was announced that a tribute concert for O&#x27;Connor and Shane MacGowan from the Pogues, who also died in 2023, would take place on 20 March in Carnegie Hall in New York City.

On 4 February 2024, Scottish singer and activist Annie Lennox paid tribute to O&#x27;Connor by performing &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; during the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. During the performance she had a tear painted on her cheek in homage to a similar scene in the song&#x27;s music video. She was accompanied by Wendy &amp; Lisa. Lennox ended the performance by calling for a cease-fire in the Israel–Hamas war and &quot;peace in the world&quot; which was also seen as a tribute to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s political outspokenness. In March 2024, a Bratz doll in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s likeness, to commemorate Women&#x27;s History Month, was announced.

== In popular culture ==
O&#x27;Connor was parodied as Niamh Connolly, a feminist singer, in &quot;Rock a Hula Ted&quot;, an episode of the TV series &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

<doc id="144849" wikidata="Q7337087" url="?curid=144849" title="River Ant">
<text>The River Ant is a tributary river of the River Bure in the county of Norfolk, England. It is long (of which 8.75 miles are now navigable), and has an overall drop of 27 metres from source to mouth. It is said that the Ant was formerly known as the River Smalea and that this is the origin of the name of the village of Smallburgh. The modern name is a back-formation from Antingham.

The Ant Broads &amp; Marshes NNR is a national nature reserve.

==From source to Honing==
The river&#x27;s source is just east of the village of Antingham in North Norfolk at Antingham Ponds. Just below the pools the river&#x27;s route has been used as a canal in the past, starting at what was Antingham bone mill. An Act of Parliament established the North Walsham and Dilham Canal in 1812, as a wide gauge canal able to take a Norfolk wherry. It was built at a cost of £30,000 and opened on 25 July 1826, making the river navigable as far as Dilham, where the river widens and deepens. It carried manure, offal, flour, coal, and farm produce. In 1885, the canal was sold for £600, but the canal company&#x27;s solicitor disappeared with the money. The flood of 1912 washed away several staithes. The wherry &quot;Ella&quot; made the final trading journey on the canal from Bacton staithe in 1934. The canal was never nationalised and still belongs to the North Walsham Canal Company. The river, now in its canal form, curves around the north east of the town of North Walsham passing Bacton Wood Mill. Below Bacton Mill the canal reaches a lock at Ebridge mill. The lock is in poor condition but it is hoped that this section of canal will one day be restored and made navigable again. Further on at Briggate Bridge there is another mill and another disused lock.

==Norfolk Broads (The Broads Authority)==

At Honing Bridge the course enters The Broads, administered by The Broads Authority. Here the canal cuts through a marshy wooded area called Dilham Broad and again curves to the east before resuming its southerly course to pass under Tonnage Bridge. Below the bridge, it passes through Broad Fen, an area containing many drainage channels, and meets Tyler&#x27;s Cut or Dilham Dyke, which runs off to the west. It served the villages of Dilham and Smallburgh, and was the furthest north that the River Ant could be navigated prior to the construction of the North Walsham and Dilham Canal. Below the junction, the course reverts to the river, although it is no longer obvious where the original course of the river was above this point. At Wayford Bridge the river passes the Wayford Bridge Hotel and a row of chalets on pontoons, moored against the east bank of the river. The bridge is a modern concrete slab which carries the A149 road, with around of headroom, making it only passable by small pleasure craft.

 During excavations for a new road in 1976, the remains of what was probably a Roman boat were discovered in the peat about to the north-west of the bridge. The remains were dug out by a mechanical excavator, before it was realised what they were. The work also discovered part of a wooden causeway, which ran from the site towards the ford which existed prior to the first bridge being built in 1797. Just below the bridge, a wooden dug-out canoe was discovered during dredging operations on the river in 1927. It was subsequently found to date from 720, and is the oldest boat found in Norfolk. A Roman road ran from the west side of the bridge to Water Newton in Cambridgeshire, but no trace of it has been found to the east of the bridge.

Continuing downstream there are boat yards on both banks and the river passes the ruined remains of Moy&#x27;s Drainage Mill, probably named after Percy Moy, who farmed land drained by the mill in the 1920s. The mill powered a single scoop wheel, which could also be driven by an auxiliary engine when there was no wind. It was operational until some time after 1935, but by 2007 only about of the tower remained, and a Lister diesel engine drove the pump. The river follows a fairly straight course until it reaches the photogenic Hunsett Drainage Mill. The structure dates from 1860, and originally drove two scoop wheels to raise water into the river. It was restored externally in 1945, but does not contain any internal machinery. The river turns to the south and passes a channel leading eastwards to the staithes at Stalham and Sutton. Stalham Dyke turns to the north-east, to reach a network of jetties and boat years, while Sutton Dyke continues dues east to the staithe, passing through Sutton Broad which is no longer open water, as the navigation channel is flanked on both sides by reedbeds. The river banks of Barton Fen are crowded with trees, marshes, and reeds, the latter formerly harvested and used for thatching for centuries past.

===Barton Broad===
 As the river nears Barton Broad it passes a triangular island called The Heater. The channels either side lead to Barton Turf staithe and its boatyard. The river now enters Barton Broad, the second largest of the Broads, its size only exceeded by Hickling Broad. It has a surface area of and since 1995, much work has been carried out to increase the amount of open water and to dredge polluted mud from the bottom of the broad. Despite opposition from Natural England, the Broads Authority used curtains of bubbles to stop fish from entering the broad. This allowed water fleas to proliferate, which cleared the cloudy water. The broad is a nature reserve managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

Barton Broad is unique in that it has an island, called &quot;Pleasure Hill&quot;. It is believed that Lord Nelson learnt to sail on Barton Broad prior to joining the navy when he was aged 12. The broad was owned by his sister at the time. There are several staithes connected to the broad by channels, including Catfield Wood End staithe to the east and Old Lime Kiln Dyke which ends at a staithe at Neatishead to the west. Britain&#x27;s first solar powered passenger boat, called &quot;Ra&quot;, operates from Neatishead staithe.

===Lower river===
The Ant leaves Barton Broad at its south east corner, at a point which is officially the normal tidal limit It enters a stretch called &quot;The Shoals&quot; to the east of Irstead, a village with some fine thatched and half-timbered cottages. The church building of St Michael is grade II* listed, and much of the fabric dates from the 14th and 15th centuries, although it was restored in 1839 and 1844. Like the cottages, it has a thatched roof. As the river meanders through the flat Broadland countryside, there are several drainage mills along its banks. The first is Clayrack Drainage Mill, near to the entrance to Crome&#x27;s Broad. This was moved here from Ranworth Marshes in 1981, as it was derelict and at risk of being lost forever. It is one of only three hollow post windpumps in Norfolk, and is maintained by the Norfolk Windmills Trust. After being moved, it was restored in 1983 by Richard Seago, and in 2018 its sails had been removed for repair. A little further downstream, also on the east bank is Boardman&#x27;s Windmill. It was built in the late 1800s, and in 1926 the original scoopwheel was replaced by an Apploid turbine. It ceased working in 1938 after it was damaged in a storm. Restoration by the Norfolk Windmills Trust began in 1981 and a cap and sails have been fitted, although they do not drive the turbine. Turf Fen drainage mill is on the west bank, and was built around 1875 to drain Horning marshes into the river. It ceased working in 1944, and was restored between 1984 and 1987. The scoop wheel was refurbished in 2007, but by 2018, it did not have any sails.

Next the river passes How Hill nature reserve, which is open to the public. There are a number of nature trails, passing through sedge beds, marsh meadow and carr woodland. Access is on foot, or in an electric boat. The site includes Toad Hole Cottage, a small marshman&#x27;s house which was refurbished in the 1980s, and is furnished to show what life was like in the 1880s. Visitors can also walk through the gardens, where there is a tea room, but the grade II listed How Hill House is an educational centre, and is not open to the public. How Hill staithe has a thatched boathouse, and the reeds which are cut for thatching are often stacked on the staithe to allow them to dry. Below How Hill the river makes a wide horseshoe bend, passing Neaves Drainage mill as it heads towards Ludham Bridge. The mill was built in 1870, but was becoming derelict in the 1970s. The wooden boat-shaped cap was replaced by an aluminium one in 2009, as the wood was rotten, and it lacks sails. Ludham Bridge drainage mill was built around 1877, but had lost its sails and fantail by 1934. During the Second World War it was used as a pillbox by the home guard. Just the brick tower remains, and it has a distinctive lean to one side. It was built to supplement the larger Beaumont&#x27;s drainage mill to the south of Ludham Bridge, which was built between 1800 and 1802 when Ludham Marshes were enclosed. Both mills were assisted by a steam pumping engine, which was constructed closer to the bridge in the 1890s. Beaumont&#x27;s mill became derelict in the 1940s and was demolished in the 1960s.

Ludham Bridge carries the A1062 road over the Ant. The tidal influence on the river at the bridge is about . The river turns sharply east before straightening out a little. It then turns south and enters the river Bure at Ant Mouth. To the east of the junction are the remains of St James&#x27;s Hospital. Only the chapel, built in the 14th century and converted into a barn in the 18th, remains. To the west of the junction are the ruins of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey, founded in 1019 by Benedictine monks. It is a scheduled monument and the designation covers a long causeway, which linked it to St James&#x27;s Hospital.

==Shipping==
The remains of an Anglo-Saxon boat were found by the Environment Agency in August 2010 when working on the river during vital flood defence work. The boat, around 3 m (9.8 ft) long, had been hollowed out by hand from a single piece of oak and was found at the bottom of the river between Honing Hall and Brown&#x27;s Hill. Five animal skulls were found near the boat, which was taken to specialists in York to be treated with special preservatives. Once the treatment has been completed the boat will be delivered to the Castle Museum in Norwich and put on display to the public.

A special type of Norfolk wherry was used on the Ant, measuring up to .

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Ant system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good are largely a result of the physical modification of the channel, and for the North Walsham and Dilham Canal section, the volume of surface water and groundwater abstracted for agriculture and land management. Some improvements have been made to this section, as it was rated Bad from 2013 to 2015. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Samuel Dashiell Hammett ( ; May 27, 1894 – January 10, 1961) was an American writer of hard-boiled detective novels and short stories. He was also a screenwriter and political activist. Among the characters he created are Sam Spade (&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;), Nick and Nora Charles (&quot;The Thin Man&quot;), The Continental Op (&quot;Red Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;) and the comic strip character Secret Agent X-9.

Hammett is regarded as one of the very best mystery writers. In his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he was described as &quot;the dean of the... &#x27;hard-boiled&#x27; school of detective fiction.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; included Hammett&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot; on its list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. In 1990, the Crime Writers&#x27; Association picked three of his five novels for their list of &quot;The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time&quot;. Five years later, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; placed second on &quot;The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time&quot; as selected by the Mystery Writers of America; &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; were also on the list. His novels and stories also had a significant influence on mystery films, including the style that came to be known as film noir.

==Early life==
Hammett was born near Great Mills on the &quot;Hopewell and Aim&quot; farm in Saint Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, to Richard Thomas Hammett and his wife Anne Bond Dashiell. His mother belonged to an old Maryland family, whose name in French was de Chiel. He had an elder sister, Aronia, and a younger brother, Richard Jr. Known as Sam, Hammett was baptized a Catholic and grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett&#x27;s family moved to Baltimore when he was four years old in 1898, and for the most part, it was the city where he lived until he left permanently in 1920 when he was 26 years old. As a teen, Hammett attended the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, but his formal education ended during his first year of high school; he dropped out in 1908, when he was thirteen years old, due to his father&#x27;s declining health and the need for him to earn money to support the family.

Hammett then held several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for Pinkerton from 1915 to February 1922, with time off to serve in World War I. While working for Pinkerton in Baltimore, he learned the trade and worked in the Continental Trust Building (now One Calvert Plaza). He said that while with the Pinkertons he was sent to Butte, Montana, during miners&#x27; union strikes, though some researchers doubt this really happened. The agency&#x27;s role in strike-breaking eventually left him disillusioned.

Hammett enlisted in 1918 and served in the United States Army Ambulance Service. He was afflicted during that time with the Spanish flu and later contracted tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient at Cushman Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he married on July 7, 1921, in San Francisco.

==Marriage and family==
Hammett and Dolan had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 1921) and Josephine (born 1926). Shortly after the birth of their second child, health services nurses informed Dolan that, owing to Hammett&#x27;s tuberculosis, she and the children should not live with him full time. Dolan rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon fell apart; however, he continued to support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.

==Career and personal life==

Hammett was first published in 1922 in the magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. Known for the authenticity and realism of his writing, he drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative. Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction while he was living in San Francisco in the 1920s; streets and other locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He said, &quot;I do take most of my characters from real life.&quot; His novels were some of the first to use dialogue that sounded authentic to the era. &quot;I distrust a man that . If he&#x27;s got to be careful not to drink too much, it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s not to be trusted when he does.&quot;

The bulk of his early work, featuring a nameless private investigator, The Continental Op, appeared in leading crime-fiction pulp magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot;. Both Hammett and the magazine struggled in the period when Hammett became established.
Because of a disagreement with editor Philip C. Cody about money owed from previous stories, Hammett briefly stopped writing for &quot;Black Mask&quot; in 1926. He then took a full-time job as an advertisement copywriter for the Albert S. Samuels Co., a San Francisco jeweller. He was wooed back to writing for the &quot;Black Mask&quot; by Joseph Thompson Shaw, who became the new editor in the summer of 1926. Hammett dedicated his first novel, &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, to Shaw and his second novel, &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;, to Samuels. Both these novels and his third, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and fourth, &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, were first serialized in &quot;Black Mask&quot; before being revised and edited for publication by Alfred A. Knopf. &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, considered to be his best work, is dedicated to his wife Josephine.

For much of 1929 and 1930, he was romantically involved with Nell Martin, a writer of short stories and several novels. He dedicated &quot;The Glass Key&quot; to her, and in turn she dedicated her novel &quot;Lovers Should Marry&quot; to him. In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year romantic relationship with the playwright Lillian Hellman. Though he sporadically continued to work on material, he wrote his final novel in 1933, more than 25 years before his death. &quot;The Thin Man&quot; is dedicated to Hellman. Why he moved away from fiction is not certain; Hellman speculated in a posthumous collection of Hammett&#x27;s novels, &quot;I think, but I only think, I know a few of the reasons: he wanted to do new kind of work; he was sick for many of those years and getting sicker.&quot; In the 1940s, Hellman and he lived at her home, Hardscrabble Farm, in Pleasantville, New York.

The French novelist André Gide thought highly of Hammett, stating: &quot;I regard his &quot;Red Harvest&quot; as a remarkable achievement, the last word in atrocity, cynicism and horror. Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s dialogues, in which every character is trying to deceive all the others and in which the truth slowly becomes visible through a fog of deception, can be compared only with the best in Hemingway.&quot;

==Politics and service in World War II==
Hammett devoted much of his life to left-wing activism. He was a staunch antifascist throughout the 1930s, and in 1937 joined the Communist Party. On May 1, 1935, Hammett joined the League of American Writers (1935–1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I. F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, Clifford Odets, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.) He suspended his anti-fascist activities when, as a member (and in 1941 president) of the League of American Writers, he served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

Especially in &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, literary scholars have seen a Marxist critique of the social system. One Hammett biographer, Richard Layman, calls such interpretations &quot;imaginative&quot;, but he nonetheless objects to them, since, among other reasons, no &quot;masses of politically dispossessed people&quot; are in this novel. Herbert Ruhm found that contemporary left-wing media already viewed Hammett&#x27;s writing with skepticism, &quot;perhaps because his work suggests no solution: no mass-action... no individual salvation... no Emersonian reconciliation and transcendence&quot;. In a letter of November 25, 1937, to his daughter Mary, Hammett referred to himself and others as &quot;we reds&quot;. He confirmed, &quot;in a democracy all men are supposed to have an equal say in their government&quot;, but added that &quot;their equality need not go beyond that.&quot; He also found, &quot;under socialism there is not necessarily... any leveling of incomes.&quot;

Hellman wrote that Hammett was &quot;most certainly&quot; a Marxist, though a &quot;very critical Marxist&quot; who was &quot;often contemptuous of the Soviet Union&quot; and &quot;bitingly sharp about the American Communist Party&quot;, to which he was nevertheless loyal.

At the beginning of 1942, he wrote the screenplay of &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;, based on Hellman&#x27;s successful play, which received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). But that year the Oscar went to &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In early 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. Because he was 48 years old, had tuberculosis, and was a Communist, Hammett later stated he had &quot;a hell of a time&quot; being inducted into the Army. However, biographer Diane Johnson suggests that confusion over Hammett&#x27;s forenames was the reason he was able to re-enlist. He served as an enlisted man in the Aleutian Islands and initially worked on cryptanalysis on the island of Umnak. For fear of his radical tendencies, he was transferred to the Headquarters Company where he edited an Army newspaper entitled &quot;The Adakian&quot; along with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade veteran (and later professor) Robert Garland Colodny. In 1943, while still a member of the military, he co-authored &quot;The Battle of the Aleutians&quot; with Cpl. Colodny, under the direction of an infantry intelligence officer, Major Henry W. Hall. While in the Aleutians, he developed emphysema.

After the war, Hammett returned to political activism, &quot;but he played that role with less fervour than before&quot;. He was elected president of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946, at a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City, and &quot;devoted the largest portion of his working time to CRC activities&quot;.

In 1946, a bail fund was created by the CRC &quot;to be used at the discretion of three trustees to gain the release of defendants arrested for political reasons.&quot; The trustees were Hammett, who was chairman, Robert W. Dunn, and Frederick Vanderbilt Field.

The CRC was designated a Communist front group by the US Attorney General. Hammett endorsed Henry A. Wallace in the 1948 United States presidential election.

==Imprisonment and the blacklist==

The CRC&#x27;s bail fund gained national attention on November 4, 1949, when bail in the amount of &quot;$260,000 in negotiable government bonds&quot; was posted &quot;to free eleven men appealing against their convictions under the Smith Act for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence.&quot; On July 2, 1951, their appeals exhausted, four of the convicted men fled rather than surrender themselves to federal agents and begin serving their sentences. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued subpoenas to the trustees of the CRC bail fund in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the fugitives.

Hammett testified on July 9, 1951, in front of United States District Court Judge Sylvester Ryan, facing questioning by Irving Saypol, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;the nation&#x27;s number-one legal hunter of top Communists&quot;. During the hearing, Hammett refused to provide the information the government wanted, specifically the list of contributors to the bail fund, &quot;people who might be sympathetic enough to harbor the fugitives.&quot; Instead, on every question regarding the CRC or the bail fund, Hammett declined to answer, citing the Fifth Amendment, refusing to even identify his signature or initials on CRC documents the government had subpoenaed. As soon as his testimony concluded, Hammett was found guilty of contempt of court.

Hammett served time in a West Virginia federal penitentiary, where, according to Lillian Hellman, he was assigned to clean toilets. Hellman noted in her eulogy of Hammett that he submitted to prison rather than reveal the names of the contributors to the fund because &quot;he had come to the conclusion that a man should keep his word.&quot;

By 1952, Hammett&#x27;s popularity had declined as result of the hearings. He found himself impoverished due to a combination of the cancellation of radio programs &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of the Thin Man&quot;, and a lien on his income by the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes owed since 1943. Furthermore, his books were no longer in print.

==Later years and death==
During the 1950s Hammett was investigated by Congress. He testified on March 26, 1953, before the House Un-American Activities Committee about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee. No official action was taken, but his stand caused him to be blacklisted, along with others who were blacklisted as a result of McCarthyism.

Hammett became an alcoholic before working in advertising, and alcoholism continued to trouble him until 1948, when he quit under doctor&#x27;s orders. However, years of heavy drinking and smoking worsened the tuberculosis he contracted in World War I, and then, according to Hellman, &quot;jail had made a thin man thinner, a sick man sicker ... I knew he would now always be sick.&quot;

Hellman wrote that during the 1950s, Hammett became &quot;a hermit&quot;, his decline evident in the clutter of his rented &quot;ugly little country cottage&quot;, where &quot;signs of sickness were all around: now the phonograph was unplayed, the typewriter untouched, the beloved foolish gadgets unopened in their packages.&quot; He may have meant to start a new literary life with the novel &quot;Tulip&quot;, but left it unfinished, perhaps because he was &quot;just too ill to care, too worn out to listen to plans or read contracts. The fact of breathing, just breathing, took up all the days and nights.&quot; Hammett could no longer live alone, and they both knew it, so he spent the last four years of his life with Hellman. &quot;Not all of that time was easy, and some of it very bad&quot;, she wrote, but, &quot;guessing death was not too far away, I would try for something to have afterwards.&quot;

Hammett died in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on January 10, 1961, of lung cancer, diagnosed just two months beforehand.

A veteran of both world wars, Hammett is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Archive==
Many of Hammett&#x27;s papers are held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This archive includes manuscripts and personal correspondence, along with a small group of miscellaneous notes.

The Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at the University of South Carolina holds the Dashiell Hammett family papers.

==Legacy==
Hammett&#x27;s relationship with Lillian Hellman was portrayed in the 1977 film &quot;Julia&quot;. Jason Robards won an Oscar for his depiction of Hammett, and Jane Fonda was nominated for her portrayal of Lillian Hellman.

Hammett was the subject of a 1982 prime time PBS biography, &quot;The Case of Dashiell Hammett&quot;, that won a Peabody Award and a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America.

Frederic Forrest portrayed Hammett semifictionally as the protagonist in the 1982 film &quot;Hammett&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Joe Gores. He would reprise the role of Hammett in the 1992 made-for-TV film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;.

Sam Shepard played Hammett in the 1999 Emmy-nominated biographical television film &quot;Dash and Lilly&quot; along with Judy Davis as Hellman.

Hammett&#x27;s influence on popular culture has continued well after his death. For example, in 1975, the film &quot;The Black Bird&quot; starred George Segal in the role of Sam Spade, Jr.; the film was a sequel and parody of the &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot;. The 1976 comedic film &quot;Murder by Death&quot; spoofed a number of famous literary sleuths, including several of Hammett&#x27;s. The film&#x27;s characters included Sam Diamond and Dick and Dora Charleston, which were parodies of Hammett&#x27;s Sam Spade and Nick and Nora Charles. In 2006, Rachel Cohn published the YA novel, &quot;Nick &amp; Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot;, whose main characters were named for the sleuths in Hammett&#x27;s &quot;Thin Man&quot; series. The book was made into a film of the same name and released in 2008. Later, Rachel Cohn and David Levithan authored several books whose main characters are named for Hammett and his partner. In 2011, they published the YA suspenseful romance, &quot;Dash &amp; Lily&#x27;s Book of Dares&quot;. That was followed by the sequels &quot;The Twelve Days of Dash and Lily&quot; in 2016 and &quot;Mind the Gap, Dash &amp; Lily&quot; in 2020. The book series was made into a Netflix television series.

Raymond Chandler, often considered Hammett&#x27;s successor, summarized his accomplishments in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;:&quot;Hammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse; and with the means at hand, not with hand-wrought dueling pistols, curare, and tropical fish... He is said to have lacked heart, yet the story he thought most of himself [&quot;The Glass Key&quot;] is the record of a man&#x27;s devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.&quot;

===Short fiction===
After their initial publication in pulp magazines, most of Hammett&#x27;s short stories were first collected in ten digest-sized paperbacks by Mercury Publications under an imprint, either Bestsellers Mystery, A Jonathan Press Mystery or Mercury Mystery. The stories were edited by Ellery Queen (Frederic Dannay) and were abridged versions of the original publications. Some of these digests were reprinted as hardcovers by World Publishing under the imprint &quot;Tower Books&quot;. The anthologies were also republished as Dell mapbacks. An important collection, &quot;The Big Knockover and Other Stories&quot;, edited by Lillian Hellman, helped revive Hammett&#x27;s literary reputation in the 1960s and fostered a new series of anthologies. However, most of these used Dannay&#x27;s abridged version of the stories.

The first collection that prints stories in their original unedited forms is &quot;Crime Stories &amp; Other Writings&quot; (2001) edited by Steven Marcus (especially after the third printing that incorporates the original text of &quot;This King Business&quot;). Subsequent collections that print the original texts include &quot;Lost Stories&quot; (2005), &quot;The Hunter and Other Stories&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Big Book of the Continental Op&quot; (2017).

<text>The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (also known as ITPGRFA, International Seed Treaty or Plant Treaty) is a comprehensive international agreement in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims at guaranteeing food security through the conservation, exchange and sustainable use of the world&#x27;s plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA), the fair and equitable benefit sharing arising from its use, as well as the recognition of farmers&#x27; rights. It was signed in 2001 in Madrid, and entered into force on 29 June 2004.

==Main features==

===Participating countries===
There are 153 contracting parties to the Plant Treaty (152 Member States and 1 intergovernmental organization, the European Union) as of July 2024.

===Farmers&#x27; rights===
The treaty recognises &quot;farmers&#x27; rights&quot;, subject to national laws to: a) the protection of traditional knowledge relevant to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; b) the right to equitably participate in sharing benefits arising from the utilisation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; and c) the right to participate in making decisions, at the national level, on matters related to the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Treaty establishes the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing to facilitate plant germplasm exchanges and benefit sharing through Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA).

However, as Regine Andersen of the farmers&#x27; rights project, among others, including Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, argue, the interpretation and realisation of farmers&#x27; rights is weak and is not the same across all countries. Without a consistent, strong international focus on realising the rights of farmers who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA to save, use, exchange and sell seeds saved on-farm, genetic variety of crops and related agricultural biodiversity will suffer. India, for example, includes an interpretation of farmers&#x27; rights in its Plant Variety Protection and Farmers&#x27; Rights (PPV&amp;FR) Act, 2001, allowing farmers a restricted right to save and sell seed they have produced on-farm as they always have, even if it contains genes from a protected variety.

In 2019, the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other people working in rural areas reaffirmed the farmers&#x27; rights contained in the Plant Treaty.

===Multilateral system===
The treaty has implemented a Multilateral System (MLS) of access and benefit sharing, among those countries that ratify the treaty, for a list of 64 of some of the most important food and forage crops essential for food security and interdependence. The genera and species are listed in Annex 1 to the treaty.

The treaty was negotiated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) and since 2006 has its own Governing Body under the aegis of the FAO. The Governing Body is the highest organ of the Treaty as established in Article 19. Composed of representatives of all Contracting Parties, its basic function is to promote the full implementation of the Treaty, including the provision of policy guidance on the implementation of the Treaty. The Governing Body elects its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, in conformity with its Rules of Procedure. They are collectively referred to as &quot;the Bureau&quot;.

Some believe the treaty could be an example of responsible global governance for ensuring that plant genetic resources essential for present and future food security can be kept accessible to all farmers and in the public domain. Chapter 7 of the Second Report on the State of the World&#x27;s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (SoWPGR-2) entitled &quot;Access to Plant Genetic Resources, the sharing of benefits arising out of their utilization and the realization of Farmers&#x27; Rights&quot; is mainly dedicated to the International Treaty.

===Governing Body===
* The Governing Body met for the first time in Madrid in June 2006. It had a ministerial segment and a ministerial declaration was adopted and included in the Report.
* The Second Session of the Governing Body was held in Rome in October/November 2007. This meeting discussed the implementation of Farmers&#x27; Rights, financial rules; the funding strategy, relationship with the Global Crop Diversity Trust; implementation of the Multilateral System (MLS) for access and benefit-sharing, among other issues.
* The Third Session of the Governing Body was held in Tunis in June 2009. This meeting continued the unfinished business of the previous meeting and discussed, among other issues, funding strategy, compliance, sustainable use, the implementation of Farmers&#x27; Rights, relationship with the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the CGRFA, implementation of the Multilateral System (MLS) for access and benefit-sharing.
* The Fourth Session of the Governing Body was held in Bali, Indonesia in March 2011. Prior to the Governing Body meeting, Ministers adopted the Bali Declaration on the Treaty that commits them to engage in further enhancing Treaty implementation to help meet the challenges of agricultural biodiversity erosion, food insecurity, extreme poverty and the effects of climate change; and calls upon parties and relevant stakeholders to prioritize activities relevant to the MLS, sustainable use of PGRFA, and Farmers&#x27; Rights, and to mobilize more funds. With the addition of &#x27;compliance&#x27; mechanisms and financial rules, these issues took up most negotiating time in the Governing Body meeting. The relationship of the Treaty with the CGRFA, the CBD&#x27;s Nagoya Protocol, the Global Crop Diversity Trust and Bioversity International were also included in resolutions.
* The Fifth Session of the Governing Body was held in Muscat, Oman in September 2013. The session was preceded by two days of regional consultations. The Fifth Session achieved:
** a resolution on Farmers&#x27; Rights (FRs), which renewed the commitment of governments to implement Farmers&#x27; Rights;
** a coded call to UPOV and WIPO to report on their impacts on Farmers&#x27; Rights;
** warm acceptance of the offer by Farmers&#x27; Organisations to produce a report for GB6 on the state of implementation of Farmers&#x27; Rights;
** actions designed to improve the sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, linked to commitments to realise Farmers&#x27; Rights;
** commitments to review and change the multi-lateral Access and Benefit Sharing mechanism (MLS), to prevent pillaging of the System by patents on native traits, for example;
** significant new voluntary financial contributions from Norway for the Global Crop Diversity Trust and for the benefit sharing fund to support on-farm conservation;
** acceptance of the distinction between NGOs and Farmers&#x27; Organisations and the need to include representatives of farmers&#x27; social movements in negotiations;
** a request to the Secretary to report on relevant discussions that relate to Farmers&#x27; Rights within other UN fora including the Committee on World Food Security. Civil Society including NGOs (e.g. CENESTA) and the International Farmers&#x27; Movement, La Via Campesina, were active throughout the Session.

===List of crops covered in Annex 1===
Even foods that have been part of a culture for centuries often are indigenous to a region on the other side of the world. This global dispersal shows the generosity with which farmers and farming communities have always shared seeds and genetic materials with neighbors or through trade. As people ventured forth, looking for new lands, their seeds were part of their diasporas. As a result, we now live in a world in which not one country can be considered self-sufficient in terms of being able to survive solely on crops indigenous within its borders. The Treaty facilitates the continued open exchange of food crops and their genetic materials.

The list of plant genetic material included in the Multilateral System of the Treaty is made of major food crops and forages. The Forages are also divided in legume forages and grass forages. They were selected taking into account the criteria of food security and country interdependence.

==History, negotiations, and entry into force==
The treaty was under negotiation for 7 years. A previous voluntary agreement, the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (IU), was adopted in 1983. However, the IU was reliant on the principle of genetic resources being the common heritage of humanity. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (1993) brought genetic resources under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of national governments. However, the CBD recognised the special and distinctive nature of agricultural genetic resources: they were international – crossing countries and continents – their conservation and sustainable use requires distinctive solutions and they were important internationally for food security. Subsequently, the IU was renegotiated, to bring it in harmony with the CBD, and was renamed as a treaty. An account of the long process to achieve the treaty called &quot;Negotiating the Seed Treaty&quot; can be found at Wayback Machine.

The treaty was approved during the FAO Conference (31st Session resolution 3/2001) on 3 November 2001, with 116 votes and 2 abstentions (US and Japan). In accordance with its Article 25, it was opened for signatures until 4 November 2002 by all members of FAO or any state member of the United Nations or of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It was subject to ratification, acceptance or approval (Article 26), by all members.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was open to accession a year after adoption and once closed to signatures (Article 27), i.e., on 4 November 2002. 77 countries and the European Union had signed the treaty by that date.

In accordance with Article 28, the treaty entered into force on the ninetieth day after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, provided that at least twenty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession have been deposited by Members of FAO. Having reached the required number of instruments in order for the treaty to enter into force (40) on 31 March 2004, on which date 13 instruments (including the European Union) were deposited with the Director-General of FAO, the date of entry into force was on 29 June 2004.

==Discussions and criticism==
Plant genetic resources are essential to a sustainable agriculture and food security. FAO estimates humans have used some 10,000 species for food throughout history. However, only about 120 cultivated species provide around 90% of food requirements and four species (maize, wheat, rice and potatoes) provide about 60% of human dietary energy for the world&#x27;s population. Of the myriad of varieties of these crops developed by farmers over millennia, which form an important part of agricultural biodiversity, more than 75% have been lost in the past 100 years.

Some fear that corporate financial interests might prevent safeguarding of livelihoods, promotion of food security, biodiversity-rich farming under control of local communities, and implementation of Farmers&#x27; Rights.

Critics say many of the central issues are unresolved or open to interpretation. Some of the points raised are:
* to what extent will intellectual property rights be allowed on genetic resources in the MLS, within treaty rules: some argue an agreement aiming at open access to genetic resources for food and agriculture should not allow restrictive property rights, and the treaty says in Article 12.3.d that &quot;Recipients shall not claim any intellectual property or other rights that limit the facilitated access to the plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, or their genetic parts or components, in the form received from the Multilateral System&quot;;
* to what extent will farmers and communities be allowed to freely use, exchange, sell and breed the seeds, and what enforcement procedures will be used by national governments to ensure principles of Farmers&#x27; Rights will be respected;
* The mechanism for dispute settlement under the Third Party Beneficiary and the role of FAO.
* The first group of 11 projects funded by the treaty was announced during the Third Session of the Governing Body in Tunis in June 2009. The projects were funded according to criteria established by the Governing Body including regional balance: 5 from Latin America, 5 from Africa and 1 from Asia. The ranking of the projects was done by a Group of Experts nominated by the 7 regional representatives of the Bureau and the final approval was done by the Bureau on behalf of the Governing Body.
* While the whole Brassica family (Cruciferae) including all its sub-species and varieties is in the MLS, the total number of food crops and forages and their relatives included in the treaty is very limited. Soya, sugar cane, oil palm and groundnut are among important crops missing from the list in Annex 1.

The treaty came into force on 29 June 2004, at which time there were more than 54 ratifications by countries. An article prepared on the occasion of the treaty becoming law is posted at International Seed Treaty becomes Law - 29 June 2004. From the entry into force, countries that previously signed are allowed to ratify the treaty, while countries that did not sign the treaty before it came into force can also accede to it. The instrument of ratification has to be deposited with the Director-General of FAO.

<doc id="144855" wikidata="Q3182114" url="?curid=144855" title="John Moore (anarchist)">
<text>John Moore (25 December 1957 – 27 October 2002) was a British anarchist author, teacher, and organiser.

A member of the Anarchist Research Group in London in the 1980s, he was one of the main theorists of the pro-Situ anarchism of the 1990s (most commonly associated with Hakim Bey), and was attracted to anarcho-primitivism in particular; his best-known work is the essay &quot;A Primitivist Primer.&quot; Despite the heavy influence of theorist Fredy Perlman, Moore later turned to theorists of language and subjectivity, such as Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner.

Moore died of a heart attack after collapsing on his way to work as a creative writing lecturer at the University of Luton (now the University of Bedfordshire).

==Works==
During his lifetime he published several short books: &quot;Anarchy and Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Lovebite&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Levelling&quot;. An anthology he was working on at the time of his death, &quot;I Am Not a Man, I Am Dynamite! Friedrich Nietzsche and the Anarchist Tradition&quot;, was completed by Spencer Sunshine and published posthumously by Autonomedia in 2004 ().

<doc id="144856" wikidata="Q1321823" url="?curid=144856" title="Pinkerton (detective agency)">
<text>Pinkerton is an American private investigation and security company established around 1850 in the United States by Scottish-born American cooper Allan Pinkerton and Chicago attorney Edward Rucker as the North-Western Police Agency, which later became Pinkerton &amp; Co. and finally the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. At the height of its power from the 1870s to the 1890s, it was the largest private law enforcement organization in the world. It is currently a subsidiary of Swedish-based Securitas AB.

Pinkerton became famous when he claimed to have foiled the Baltimore Plot to assassinate President-elect Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Lincoln later hired Pinkerton agents to conduct espionage against the Confederacy and act as his personal security during the American Civil War. As such, Pinkerton and his agency are sometimes seen as the forerunners of the United States Secret Service.

Following the Civil War, the Pinkertons began conducting operations against organized labor. During the labor strikes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, businesses hired the Pinkerton Agency to infiltrate unions, supply guards, keep strikers and suspected unionists out of factories, and recruit goon squads to intimidate workers. During the Homestead Strike of 1892, Pinkerton agents were called in to reinforce the strikebreaking measures of industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who was acting on behalf of Andrew Carnegie, the head of Carnegie Steel. Tensions between the workers and strikebreakers erupted into violence, which led to the deaths of three Pinkerton agents and nine steelworkers. During the late nineteenth century, the Pinkertons were also hired as guards in coal, iron, and lumber disputes in Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia and were involved in other strikes such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

During the 20th century, Pinkerton rebranded itself as a personal security and risk management firm. The company has continued to exist in various forms to the present day and is now a division of the Swedish security company Securitas AB, operating as Pinkerton Consulting &amp; Investigations, Inc., doing business as Pinkerton Corporate Risk Management. The former Pinkerton Government Services division, PGS, now operates as Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, Inc.

==Origins==
In the 1850s, Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant, met Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in a local Masonic Hall. The two men formed the North-Western Police Agency, later known as the Pinkerton Agency. Pinkerton used his skills in espionage to attract clients and begin growing the agency. Historian Frank Morn writes: &quot;By the mid-1850s, a few businessmen saw the need for greater control over their employees; their solution was to sponsor a private detective system. In February 1855, Allan Pinkerton, after consulting with six midwestern railroads, created such an agency in Chicago.&quot; The Pinkerton Agency began to hire women and minorities shortly after its founding because they were useful as spies, a practice uncommon at the time.

==Forerunners to the Secret Service==


Among the business&#x27;s early operations was to safely deliver the newly elected President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, from Springfield to Washington, D.C., in light of an assassination threat. Pinkerton detective Kate Warne was assigned and successfully delivered Lincoln to the U.S. capital city through a series of disguises and related tactics that required her to stay awake throughout the entire long journey. As a result of the public notoriety of this success, the business adopted an open eye as its logo and the slogan &quot;We never sleep&quot;. Allan Pinkerton around this time also served in the &quot;Secret Service&quot; intelligence division of what was then known as the U.S. War Department. 

These actions preceded and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the United States Secret Service, which is tasked with serving current and former U.S. Presidents&#x27; security to this day. The official Secret Service was founded on July 5, 1865, less than three months after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

==U.S. government contractor==
In 1871, Congress appropriated $50,000 (about ) to the new Department of Justice to form a sub-organization devoted to &quot;the detection and prosecution of those guilty of violating federal law.&quot; The amount was insufficient to form an internal investigating unit, so they contracted out the services to the Pinkerton National Detective Agency.

However, as news leaked about the Pinkertons&#x27; involvement in strikebreaking, lawmakers began pushing against government contracts with the Pinkertons. The Pinkertons reached their zenith in the 1870s and 80s, which saw them frequently engage in violent crackdowns against striking workers. The most notable example of this was the involvement of the Pinkertons in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. However, it was the confrontation in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1892 that led to a national outcry against the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Following the strike, Congress took swift action against the Pinkertons and passed the Anti-Pinkerton Act in 1893, which severely curtailed the relationship between the federal government and the agency. The act states that &quot;individuals employed by the Pinkerton Detective Agency, or similar organization, may not be employed by the government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia.&quot;

==Molly Maguires==
In the 1870s, Franklin B. Gowen, then president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, hired the agency to investigate the labor unions in the company&#x27;s mines. A Pinkerton agent, James McParland, using the alias &quot;James McKenna&quot;, infiltrated the Molly Maguires, a 19th-century secret society of mainly Irish-American coal miners, leading to the downfall of the organization.

The incident inspired Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; (1914–1915). A Pinkerton agent also appears in a small role in &quot;The Adventure of the Red Circle&quot;, a 1911 Holmes story. A 1970 film, &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot;, was loosely based on the incident.

==Homestead strike==


On July 6, 1892, during the Homestead Strike, 300 Pinkerton agents from New York and Chicago were called in by Carnegie Steel&#x27;s Henry Clay Frick to protect the Pittsburgh-area mill and act as strikebreakers. This resulted in a firefight and siege in which 16 men were killed and 23 others were wounded. Following the confrontation, the Governor of Pennsylvania, Robert E. Pattison, mobilized state law enforcement and the National Guard. Private and government forces broke the strike, and workers returned to the steel mill.

The strike, dubbed &quot;The Battle of Homestead&quot; by local media, ignited a firestorm around the United States. Americans were outraged at the conduct of the Pinkertons and how strikers were treated. The Homestead Strike of 1892 is regarded as a turning point in American labor history and prompted Congress to begin a crackdown on the Pinkertons. As a legacy of the Pinkertons&#x27; involvement, a bridge connecting the nearby Pittsburgh suburbs of Munhall and Rankin was named Pinkerton&#x27;s Landing Bridge.

==Steunenberg murder and trial==
Harry Orchard was arrested by the Idaho police and confessed to Pinkerton agent James McParland that he assassinated former Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho in 1905. Orchard testified (unsuccessfully), under threat of hanging, against Western Federation of Miners (WFM) president Big Bill Haywood, naming him as having hired the hit. With a stirring defense by Clarence Darrow, Haywood and the other defendants of the WFM were acquitted in a nationally publicized trial. Orchard received a death sentence, but it was commuted.

==Outlaws and competition==
Pinkerton agents were hired to track western outlaws Jesse James, the Reno Gang, and the Wild Bunch (including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). On March 17, 1874, two Pinkerton detectives and a deputy sheriff, Edwin P. Daniels, encountered the Younger brothers (associates of the James–Younger Gang); Daniels, John Younger, and one Pinkerton agent were killed. In Union, Missouri, a bank was robbed by George Collins, aka Fred Lewis, and Bill Randolph; Pinkerton Detective Chas Schumacher trailed them and was killed. Collins was hanged on March 26, 1904, and Randolph on May 8, 1905, in Union. Pinkertons were also hired to transport money and other high-quality merchandise between cities and towns, which made them vulnerable to outlaws. Pinkerton agents were usually well paid and well armed.

George Thiel, a former Pinkerton employee, established the Thiel Detective Service Company in St. Louis, Missouri, a competitor to the Pinkerton agency. The agency operated in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

==Modern era==
Due to its conflicts with labor unions, the word &quot;Pinkerton&quot; continues to be associated by labor organizers and union members with strikebreaking. Pinkertons diversified from labor spying following revelations publicized by the La Follette Committee hearings in 1937, and the firm&#x27;s criminal detection work also suffered from the police modernization movement, which saw the rise of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the bolstering of detective branches and resources of the public police. With less of the labor and criminal investigation work on which Pinkertons thrived for decades, the company became increasingly involved in protection services, and in the 1960s, even the word &quot;detective&quot; disappeared from the agency&#x27;s letterhead. The company now focuses on threat intelligence, risk management, executive protection, and active shooter response.

In 1999, the company was bought by Securitas AB, a Swedish security company, for $384 million, followed by the acquisition of the William J. Burns Detective Agency (founded in 1910), a longtime Pinkerton rival, to create (as a division of the parent) Securitas Security Services USA. Today, the company&#x27;s headquarters are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In December 2018, Securitas AB issued a cease and desist notice to video game company Take-Two Interactive over the use of the Pinkerton name and badge imagery in &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. They demanded royalties for each copy of the game sold, or they would take legal action. Take-Two maintained that the Pinkerton name was strongly associated with the Wild West, and its use of the term did not infringe on the Pinkerton trademark. By April 2019, Securitas AB had withdrawn its claim.

In 2020, they were hired by Amazon to spy on warehouse workers for signs of union activity. In 2022, it was reported that Starbucks had hired a former Pinkerton employee as part of their union-busting efforts.

In 2020, Matthew Dolloff, an unlicensed security guard contracted through Pinkerton, shot and killed Lee Keltner, a conservative protester, in Denver, Colorado. Dolloff had been contracted by Pinkerton to guard a camera-crew working for 9News. The camera crew had been assigned to cover rival political groups protesting in Denver. Keltner had told a cameraman to stop filming him; Dolloff then approached Keltner. Keltner slapped Dolloff before spraying him with bear spray, and moments later Dolloff shot Keltner. Dolloff was arrested, investigated for first-degree murder, and charged with second-degree murder. The charge was later dropped.

In 2023, Wizards of the Coast hired Pinkerton to seize products from the &quot;March of the Machine: The Aftermath&quot; card set for the trading card game &quot;&quot; from YouTuber Dan Cannon of &quot;oldschoolmtg.&quot; Cannon had published a video on YouTube showing the contents of an order received ahead of the release date from a local game store. Pinkerton used intimidation and legal servings to force compliance. According to Wizards of the Coast, this was done after several attempts had been made to contact the individual in private, with no response.

<text>EuroNat was a far-right and ultranationalist European political alliance, formed at the congress of the French National Front (FN) in Strasbourg on 30 March 1997. It had a loose organisational structure, and was, in practice, based on coordination by activities of the FN.

The organisation failed to attract much support in Western Europe, as FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was more successful in gathering support in Eastern Europe. NordNat was an attempt to form a regional organisation by Nordic parties. As of the late 2000s, only the FN, BNP, ND, MS-FT, DN and NR parties were listed as members of EuroNat.

In a joint declaration, the founders of EuroNat expressed, among other things, the view that a &quot;reborn&quot; Europe &quot;should be built with the European nations based on civilizations rooted in Greek, Celtic, Germanic, Latin and Christian traditions.&quot; The declaration was signed by representatives of, among others, Forza Nuova, the Greater Romanian Party and Democracia Nacional, as well as the previously mentioned Sweden Democrats and Front National.

Parties that at one point were part of the organisation include:

<text>Nick and Nora Charles are fictional characters created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. The characters were later adapted for film in a series of films between 1934 and 1947; for radio from 1941 to 1950; for television from 1957 through 1959; as a Broadway musical in 1991; and as a stage play in 2009.

==Synopsis==

Nick and Nora are a married couple who solve murder mysteries while exchanging sharp and smart repartee. The tremendous popularity of the characters made them a media archetype, as the bantering, romantically involved detective duo has become a well-used trope in literature, stage, screen, and television ever since.

==Novel==

The characters first appear in Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s best-selling last novel &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934). Nick is a former private detective of Greek ancestry who retired when he married Nora, a wealthy Nob Hill heiress. Hammett reportedly modeled Nora on his longtime partner Lillian Hellman, and the characters&#x27; boozy, flippant dialogue on their relationship. (The novel also mentions that Nick was once a Pinkerton detective, as was Hammett.) The novel is considered one of the seminal texts of the hard-boiled subgenre of mystery novels, but the chief innovation distinguishing it from previous Hammett works such as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;The Glass Key&quot; was its relative lightness and humor. It is nearly as much a comedy of manners as a mystery, and the story tumbles along to the sarcastic banter of Nick and Nora as a reluctant and jaded Nick is dragged into solving a sensational murder, cheered on by the fascinated thrill-enjoying Nora.

==Films==
The film adaptation of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; was a resounding success. Although Hammett never wrote another novel with Nick and Nora Charles, five movie sequels were produced, two of which were adapted by Warner Brothers&#x27; writers from two original Hammett works written after the success of the first film.

The film followed the plot of the novel quite closely, but the Nick Charles character, described in the book as overweight and out of shape, was portrayed by the slim William Powell. Nora was portrayed by Myrna Loy. The title of both the book and the film referred to the murder victim, Clyde Wynant, that Nick is initially hired to find, but producers referred to &quot;The Thin Man&quot; in the titles of each of the sequel films for branding purposes. As a consequence &quot;The Thin Man&quot; was eventually elided by the public into an alias for the character of Nick Charles. So strongly were Powell and Loy identified with the characters of the Charleses in the public mind that many mistakenly assumed the actors were a couple in real life as well.

The on-screen chemistry between Powell and Loy, who often improvised on the set, was key to the wild success of the series and quickly became a defining feature of the characters. The films revolutionized the screen portrayal of marriage —previously earnest, virtuous, and staid —invigorating it with danger, irreverence, and sex appeal. Taking their cue from Hammett&#x27;s humorous dialogue and comic elements, the movies moved even further from the traditional hard-boiled approach. In another departure from Hammett, the dog Asta — an integral character in both the book and movies — was a male wire fox terrier, rather than the novel&#x27;s female schnauzer.

Over time a child, Nick, Jr., was also introduced, and elements of the Charleses&#x27; backstory fleshed out. Nick was revealed to be the son of a medical doctor from the fictional small town of Sycamore Springs in upstate New York. The novel&#x27;s references to his being the child of an immigrant from Greece were ignored, and Nick was now the black sheep of a respectable WASP professional family who turned his back on the family profession of medicine because of his passion for detective work. 

Detail was also added to Nora&#x27;s background. She is shown to be the sole child of a deceased mining magnate from San Francisco modeled on the &quot;kings&quot; of the Comstock Lode. Now diversified into lumber, railroads, etc., Nora&#x27;s fortune is apparently vast and is managed for the couple by her father&#x27;s former partner who lives in an estate on Long Island&#x27;s North Shore &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. Nora is also shown to have a network of blue-blood relatives and friends in San Francisco and New York society, while Nick is a beloved celebrity among the criminal classes and those who associate with them (such as police, athletes, nightclub owners, etc.), particularly among San Francisco and New York&#x27;s Irish communities.

Hugely popular with audiences, the films employed the common murder mystery trope—familiar from English detective stories such as Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;—of assembling all of the characters for the climactic revelation of the culprit. The first film appeared the year after the repeal of Prohibition, and the series is also notable for the extensive and casual use of alcohol by the main characters.

===Titles===
* &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934)
* &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941)
* &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; (1945)
* &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947)

==Subsequent adaptations==
* Radio: The popularity of the film series spawned a radio program based on them, &quot;The Adventures of the Thin Man&quot;. It successfully ran from 1941 to 1950, starring Claudia Morgan as Nora, with Les Damon, Les Tremayne, David Gothard and Joseph Curtin all giving voice to Nick, depending on the season.
* Television (series):&quot; The Thin Man&quot; ran two seasons from 1957 to 1959 starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk as Nick and Nora. The series transplanted the couple to New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, updating the 1930s big band glamour to the 1950s Beat Generation. There were 72 episodes.
* Television (movie): In 1975, Craig Stevens and Jo Ann Pflug starred in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Nick and Nora&quot;, part of the Wide World of Mystery series of TV movies.
* Stage (musical): In 1991, a Broadway musical, &quot;Nick &amp; Nora&quot; with a book by Arthur Laurents, lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr., and music by Charles Strouse was based on the characters. Barry Bostwick played Nick, and Joanna Gleason played Nora. The chief innovation of this incarnation was to introduce strife and resentment into the relationship. After one of the longest preview periods in Broadway history, the show opened to poor reviews and closed after nine performances.
* Stage (play):
**In 2009, the City Literature Theatre, a Chicago repertory company, mounted a stage production of the original Hammett novel adapted by Terry McCabe.
**In 2018, Vertigo Theatre in Calgary, Canada premiered a new adaptation of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; by playwright Lucia Frangione. The Charleses were played by Curt McKinstry and Nadien Chu, respectively. A mostly loyal adaptation of Hammett&#x27;s novel, the character of Nora Charles was given a new backstory as the Chinese-American heiress of a silk import/export fortune in San Francisco. This added the layer of an interracial marriage between the main characters, and shone light on the systemic racism of pre-WWII America. Frangione said: &quot;An element that was in the original novel and the film was the fact that Nora and Nick were a married couple with no children who spent their Christmas with strangers. Both joy and sorrow hold a couple together, so as a writer I had to ask myself, &#x27;Why are they socially isolated?&#x27; Hammett and Hellman were outsiders because of race and politics. So, I decided to flesh out a story point that was already hinted at in the novel and film. Nora is a wealthy heiress from San Francisco, why couldn&#x27;t she be Chinese? I have always sought intelligent ways to diversify my casts. We live in a multi-racial society, that should be reflected on stage.&quot;
**The Thrilling Adventure Hour stage show often featured a segment called &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; in which Paul F. Tompkins and Paget Brewster portrayed paranormal mystery-solving couple Frank and Sadie Doyle, who were parodies of Nick and Nora.
* Film: 
**In 2011, it was announced that a film version, starring Johnny Depp as Nick Charles, was in development but it has since been shelved.
**Nick and Nora were spoofed in the 1976 comedy film &quot;Murder by Death&quot;. David Niven played detective Dick Charleston and Maggie Smith played his wife Dora Charleston.

<doc id="144862" wikidata="Q1190579" url="?curid=144862" title="John P. Marquand">
<text>John Phillips Marquand (November 10, 1893 – July 16, 1960) was an American writer. Originally best known for his Mr. Moto spy stories, he achieved popular success and critical respect for his satirical novels, winning a Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; in 1938. One of his abiding themes was the confining nature of life in America&#x27;s upper class and among those who aspired to join it. Marquand treated those whose lives were bound by these unwritten codes with a characteristic mix of respect and satire.

==Early life and education==
Marquand was born on November 10, 1893, in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Philip Marquand and his wife Margaret née Fuller. His mother was a great-niece of 19th-century transcendentalist and feminist Margaret Fuller. Marquand was also a cousin of Buckminster Fuller. He grew up in Newburyport, Massachusetts, where his forebears had lived, raised by his three maiden aunts, while his parents lived in a number of other cities as his father pursued his career.

Marquand attended Newburyport High School, where he won a scholarship that enabled him to attend Harvard College, where his family had a long tradition of attendance. As an impecunious public school graduate in the heyday of Harvard&#x27;s Gold Coast, however, he was seen as an unclubbable outsider.

After being turned down by the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;, Harvard&#x27;s student newspaper, Marquand succeeded in being elected to the editorial board of the humor magazine, the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;===
After graduating from Harvard in 1915, Marquand was hired by &quot;The Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, working initially as a reporter and later on the &quot;Transcript&#x27;s&quot; bi-weekly magazine section.

===World War I===
While he was a student at Harvard, Marquand joined Battery A of the Massachusetts National Guard, which, in 1916, was activated. In July 1916, Marquand was sent to the Mexican border. Later, like many of his classmates, he served in World War I, where he was engaged in combat in France.

===Writing career===

Marquand&#x27;s life and work reflected his ambivalence about American society and especially the power of its old-line elites. Being rebuffed by fashionable Harvard did not discourage his social aspirations. In 1922, he married Christina Sedgwick, niece of &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; editor Ellery Sedgwick. In 1925, Marquand published his first book, &quot;Lord Timothy Dexter&quot;, an exploration of the life and legend of 18th-century Newburyport eccentric Timothy Dexter (1763–1806).

By the mid-1930s, he was a prolific and successful writer of fiction for slick magazines like the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Some of these short stories were of an historical nature as had been Marquand&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;The Unspeakable Gentleman&quot; and &quot;The Black Cargo&quot;, which were later characterized by Marquand as &quot;costume fiction&quot;, to which he stated that an author &quot;can only approximate provided he has been steeped in the tradition&quot;. By the mid-1930s, Marquand abandoned &quot;costume fiction&quot;.

In the late 1930s, Marquand began producing a series of novels on the dilemmas of class, most of which centered on New England, and some of which were partially set in Clyde, Massachusetts, a fictional seaside community based strongly on Marquand&#x27;s home town of Newburyport.

The first of these novels, &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; (1937), a satire of Boston&#x27;s upper class, won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1938. Other Marquand novels exploring New England and class themes include &quot;Wickford Point&quot; (1939), &quot;H.M. Pulham, Esquire&quot; (1941), and &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1949). The last is especially notable for its satirical portrayal of Harvard anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner, whose Yankee City study attempted (and in Marquand&#x27;s view, dismally failed) to describe and analyze the manners and mores of Newburyport.

Marquand was a part-time war correspondent during World War II. The war&#x27;s huge impact on American citizens and families is an element in his later novels. Several characters in these novels are motivated by a sense of duty to aid the war effort, though they are past draft age and unsure of the value of their contribution.

For all of his ambivalence about America&#x27;s elite, Marquand ultimately succeeded in joining it and in embodying its characteristics. He forgave the upper crust classmates who snubbed him as a Harvard student, relationships he satirized in &quot;H.M. Pulham, Esq &quot;and &quot;The Late George Apley&quot;. He was invited to join all the prestigious social clubs in Boston, including Tavern and Somerset, and those in New York City, including the Century Association.

Through his second marriage to Adelaide Ferry Hooker, he became linked to the Rockefeller family. Her sister, Blanchette, was married to John D. Rockefeller III. He maintained luxury homes in Newburyport and in the Caribbean.

==Personal life==
Marquand was married twice and had five children. He married Christina Sedgwick in 1922, and they had two children: son John Jr and daughter Christina Jr. Marquand and Sedgwick divorced in 1935. The following year, Marquand married Adelaide Ferry Hooker, a descendant of Connecticut Colony founder Thomas Hooker. They had three children together, two sons and a daughter, before divorcing in 1958.

==Death==
On July 16, 1960, Marquand died in Newburyport, Massachusetts, of a heart attack in his sleep at the age of 66. He is buried in Sawyer Hill Burying Ground in Newburyport.

<text>Margaret Booth (January 16, 1898 – October 28, 2002) was an American film editor. In a career lasting seven decades, Booth was most associated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). 

Born in Los Angeles, Margaret was the younger sister of actor Elmer Booth, who starred in several films for D. W. Griffith. Elmer was killed in a train accident, and Griffith later employed Margaret as a negative cutter. Booth worked with Griffith&#x27;s studio for several years. She later joined Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s namesake studio, where she was mentored by film director John M. Stahl. In 1924, Mayer merged his studio with Metro Pictures and Goldwyn Pictures to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Stahl and Booth joined MGM, where she edited several of his films. Stahl later left MGM, while Booth stayed. She was named the studio&#x27;s first official film editor by Irving Thalberg, MGM&#x27;s then-production head. In 1935, Booth received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing on &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;. 

After Thalberg&#x27;s death, Mayer appointed Booth as the studio&#x27;s supervising film editor, a position she held for nearly three decades. In 1968, Booth retired from MGM, and was hired by Ray Stark as a supervising film editor for his studio Rastar Productions. In 1977, Booth was awarded an Academy Honorary Award for her decades-long contributions as a film editor. She received her last credit as an executive producer for &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1985). Booth became a centennial in 1998, and died in 2002 at the age of 104. 

==Early life==
Margaret Booth was born on January 16, 1898, in Los Angeles to Edward J. Booth, Sr. and Margaret A. Boland. Her older brother was Elmer Booth, who was an actor for D. W. Griffith and the breadwinner for the family. On June 16, 1915, Elmer was riding with actor George Siegmann in a car driven by Tod Browning. Due to the heavy fog that day, Browning did not see the rear lamp of an oncoming train. Browning&#x27;s car was hit by a train of the Salt Lake Railroad, killing Elmer instantly. Browning and Siegmann however survived but suffered serious injuries. At Elmer&#x27;s funeral, Griffith delivered an eulogy and approached Margaret with a job offer as a film joiner (also known as a negative cutter) to provide income for the family. Margaret never forgave Browning for her brother&#x27;s death.

==Career==
===1915–1921: Editing for D. W. Griffith===
By 1915, Booth had graduated from Los Angeles High School. Griffith hired Booth on a salary for ten dollars a week as one of several female editors for his studio. Booth remembered years later, &quot;...in the old days we had to cut negative by eye. We matched the print to the negative without any edge numbers. We had to match the action. Sometimes there&#x27;d be a tiny pinpoint on the negative, and then you knew you were right, but it was very tedious work.&quot; One of the films she worked on was &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921) starring Lillian Gish. After a few months, Booth worked for Paramount Pictures&#x27; editing department, assembling the tinted sections for release prints.

===1921–1938: Editing at MGM===
In 1921, Booth began working for Louis B. Mayer at his namesake film production studio. Mayer had hired John M. Stahl when Edward Small, who was Stahl&#x27;s publicity agent, inquired why there were no hired Jewish directors. Inside the editing room, Booth observed Stahl, and because he was a perfectionist, Stahl would shoot multiple takes of several scenes and leave outtake footage literally on the cutting room floor. At the end of the day, Booth assembled the outtakes and stayed overnight to practice her cutting techniques. One day, Stahl was frustrated when he couldn&#x27;t make a scene work. After he left, Booth took her own approach; when Stahl screened her work, he was impressed and hired her immediately as his editorial assistant. For Stahl, she edited &quot;The Gay Deceiver&quot; (1926), &quot;Lovers?&quot; (1927), and &quot;In Old Kentucky&quot; (1927).

Stahl personally mentored Booth on the craft of film editing, explaining the exact purpose for his editing decisions. Booth reflected, &quot;He taught the value of a scene. When a scene drops or doesn&#x27;t drop, and when it sustains. You have to feel this, intrusively, in your work.&quot; In 1924, Mayer merged with Metro Pictures and Goldwyn Pictures to form a new conglomerate film production studio known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Stahl stayed with MGM for several years, but when he left the studio in 1927, he asked Booth to join him but she declined. Booth stated, &quot;I went on to working at M-G-M, mostly with [Irving] Thalberg—the greatest man who was ever in pictures. M-G-M was like home to me.&quot; Her editing skills were appreciated by Thalberg, MGM&#x27;s head of production, that he asked her if she would consider directing. However, she was not interested. Regardless, according to film historian Cari Beauchamp, Thalberg was the first known person to call cutters &quot;film editors,&quot; starting with Booth. Her first official editing credit was for the 1929 part-talkie film &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot;. 

At MGM, Booth edited several films starring Greta Garbo, including &quot;Camille&quot; (1936). She also edited &quot;Wise Girls&quot; (1929), &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; (1934), and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936). Booth received her only competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing on &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935).

===1939–1968: Supervising editor of MGM===
In 1936, Thalberg had unexpectedly died and Mayer assumed the position as production head. Three years later, in 1939, Mayer appointed Booth to be the studio&#x27;s supervising film editor. Booth stated, &quot;They liked me because I was fast. I was always very fast cutting everything I did. And boy, was I tough.&quot; As the supervising editor, she did no actual film editing herself but instead hired the personnel and reviewed the dailies for each film, overseeing classics such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). In his 1995 book &quot;Making Movies&quot;, director Sidney Lumet called Booth &quot;a remarkable person. She was bright and tireless, and she loved movies. I don&#x27;t know if she had any other life.&quot; He told one story while filming &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965) in England, in which she arrived on location and asked to see a rough-cut version, promptly at eight during the following morning. A screening was arranged for her, with Lumet and Thelma Connell, the editor for &quot;The Hill&quot;, present. When the screening was over, she asked for two minutes of the film to be cut so it would be under two hours. Lumet pushed back and after two more screenings, Booth relented. Following the third screening, Lumet consoled a despondent Booth, who personally felt none of the new studio executives knew or care about filmmaking. She remained in her position until she retired in 1968.

In its 1982 article about Booth&#x27;s long tenureship, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; describes her as &quot;the final authority of every picture the studio made for 30 years.&quot;

===1969–1985: Editing for Ray Stark===
After leaving MGM, Booth was hired by Ray Stark as the supervising editor for his company, Rastar Productions. She supervised the editing for several films, including &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), and &quot;Annie&quot; (1982). She was last credited as an executive producer for &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1985) when she was 87.

In 1977, Booth was awarded an Academy Honorary Award denoting her for &quot;62 years of exceptionally distinguished service to the motion picture industry as a film editor.&quot; In 1983, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry. On her centennial birthday, in 1998, Booth was honored with a gala commemorating her seven-decade contributions to the film industry at the Sheraton Universal Hotel, hosted by the Motion Picture Editors Guild.

==Death and legacy==
On October 28, 2002, Booth, at age 104, died from complications after suffering a stroke. She is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood California. In their obituary for Booth, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated, &quot;All the filmmakers had to go through her in order to have a final editing of sound and vision approved,&quot; while describing her approach:

<doc id="144865" wikidata="Q232358" url="?curid=144865" title="Tendon">
<text>A tendon or sinew is a tough band of dense fibrous connective tissue that connects muscle to bone. It sends the mechanical forces of muscle contraction to the skeletal system, while withstanding tension.

Tendons, like ligaments, are made of collagen. The difference is that ligaments connect bone to bone, while tendons connect muscle to bone. There are about 4,000 tendons in the adult human body.

== Structure ==
A tendon is made of dense regular connective tissue, whose main cellular components are special fibroblasts called tendon cells (tenocytes). Tendon cells synthesize the tendon&#x27;s extracellular matrix, which abounds with densely-packed collagen fibers. The collagen fibers run parallel to each other and are grouped into fascicles. Each fascicle is bound by an endotendineum, which is a delicate loose connective tissue containing thin collagen fibrils and elastic fibers. A set of fascicles is bound by an epitenon, which is a sheath of dense irregular connective tissue. The whole tendon is enclosed by a fascia. The space between the fascia and the tendon tissue is filled with the paratenon, a fatty areolar tissue. Normal healthy tendons are anchored to bone by Sharpey&#x27;s fibres.

=== Extracellular matrix ===
The dry mass of normal tendons, which is 30–45% of their total mass, is made of:
* 60–85% collagen
** 60–80% collagen I
** 0–10% collagen III
** 2% collagen IV
** small amounts of collagens V, VI, and others
* 15–40% non-collagenous extracellular matrix components, including:
** 3% cartilage oligomeric matrix protein,
** 1–2% elastin,
** 1–5% proteoglycans,
** 0.2% inorganic components such as copper, manganese, and calcium.

Although most of a tendon&#x27;s collagen is type I collagen, many minor collagens are present that play vital roles in tendon development and function. These include type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones, type III collagen in the reticulin fibres of the vascular walls, type IX collagen, type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries, type V collagen in the vascular walls, and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone.

==== Ultrastructure and collagen synthesis ====
Collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell, cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteases, the tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is about 300 nm long and 1–2 nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50–500 nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles, which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50–300 μm, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100–500 μm.

The collagen in tendons are held together with proteoglycan (a compound consisting of a protein bonded to glycosaminoglycan groups, present especially in connective tissue) components including decorin and, in compressed regions of tendon, aggrecan, which are capable of binding to the collagen fibrils at specific locations. The proteoglycans are interwoven with the collagen fibrils their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains have multiple interactions with the surface of the fibrils showing that the proteoglycans are important structurally in the interconnection of the fibrils. The major GAG components of the tendon are dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which associate with collagen and are involved in the fibril assembly process during tendon development. Dermatan sulfate is thought to be responsible for forming associations between fibrils, while chondroitin sulfate is thought to be more involved with occupying volume between the fibrils to keep them separated and help withstand deformation. The dermatan sulfate side chains of decorin aggregate in solution, and this behavior can assist with the assembly of the collagen fibrils. When decorin molecules are bound to a collagen fibril, their dermatan sulfate chains may extend and associate with other dermatan sulfate chains on decorin that is bound to separate fibrils, therefore creating interfibrillar bridges and eventually causing parallel alignment of the fibrils.

=== Tenocytes ===
The tenocytes produce the collagen molecules, which aggregate end-to-end and side-to-side to produce collagen fibrils. Fibril bundles are organized to form fibres with the elongated tenocytes closely packed between them. There is a three-dimensional network of cell processes associated with collagen in the tendon. The cells communicate with each other through gap junctions, and this signalling gives them the ability to detect and respond to mechanical loading. These communications happen by two proteins essentially: connexin 43, present where the cells processes meet and in cell bodies connexin 32, present only where the processes meet.

Blood vessels may be visualized within the endotendon running parallel to collagen fibres, with occasional branching transverse anastomoses.

The internal tendon bulk is thought to contain no nerve fibres, but the epitenon and paratenon contain nerve endings, while Golgi tendon organs are present at the myotendinous junction between tendon and muscle.

Tendon length varies in all major groups and from person to person. Tendon length is, in practice, the deciding factor regarding actual and potential muscle size. For example, all other relevant biological factors being equal, a man with a shorter tendons and a longer biceps muscle will have greater potential for muscle mass than a man with a longer tendon and a shorter muscle. Successful bodybuilders will generally have shorter tendons. Conversely, in sports requiring athletes to excel in actions such as running or jumping, it is beneficial to have longer than average Achilles tendon and a shorter calf muscle.

Tendon length is determined by genetic predisposition, and has not been shown to either increase or decrease in response to environment, unlike muscles, which can be shortened by trauma, use imbalances and a lack of recovery and stretching. In addition tendons allow muscles to be at an optimal distance from the site where they actively engage in movement, passing through regions where space is premium, like the carpal tunnel.

== List of tendons ==
There are about 4,000 tendons in the human body, of which 55 are listed here:

==Functions==

Traditionally, tendons have been considered to be a mechanism by which muscles connect to bone as well as muscles itself, functioning to transmit forces. This connection allows tendons to passively modulate forces during locomotion, providing additional stability with no active work. However, over the past two decades, much research has focused on the elastic properties of some tendons and their ability to function as springs. Not all tendons are required to perform the same functional role, with some predominantly positioning limbs, such as the fingers when writing (positional tendons) and others acting as springs to make locomotion more efficient (energy storing tendons). Energy storing tendons can store and recover energy at high efficiency. For example, during a human stride, the Achilles tendon stretches as the ankle joint dorsiflexes. During the last portion of the stride, as the foot plantar-flexes (pointing the toes down), the stored elastic energy is released. Furthermore, because the tendon stretches, the muscle is able to function with less or even no change in length, allowing the muscle to generate more force.

The mechanical properties of the tendon are dependent on the collagen fiber diameter and orientation. The collagen fibrils are parallel to each other and closely packed, but show a wave-like appearance due to planar undulations, or crimps, on a scale of several micrometers. In tendons, the collagen fibres have some flexibility due to the absence of hydroxyproline and proline residues at specific locations in the amino acid sequence, which allows the formation of other conformations such as bends or internal loops in the triple helix and results in the development of crimps. The crimps in the collagen fibrils allow the tendons to have some flexibility as well as a low compressive stiffness. In addition, because the tendon is a multi-stranded structure made up of many partially independent fibrils and fascicles, it does not behave as a single rod, and this property also contributes to its flexibility.

The proteoglycan components of tendons also are important to the mechanical properties. While the collagen fibrils allow tendons to resist tensile stress, the proteoglycans allow them to resist compressive stress. These molecules are very hydrophilic, meaning that they can absorb a large amount of water and therefore have a high swelling ratio. Since they are noncovalently bound to the fibrils, they may reversibly associate and disassociate so that the bridges between fibrils can be broken and reformed. This process may be involved in allowing the fibril to elongate and decrease in diameter under tension. However, the proteoglycans may also have a role in the tensile properties of tendon. The structure of tendon is effectively a fibre composite material, built as a series of hierarchical levels. At each level of the hierarchy, the collagen units are bound together by either collagen crosslinks, or the proteoglycans, to create a structure highly resistant to tensile load. The elongation and the strain of the collagen fibrils alone have been shown to be much lower than the total elongation and strain of the entire tendon under the same amount of stress, demonstrating that the proteoglycan-rich matrix must also undergo deformation, and stiffening of the matrix occurs at high strain rates. This deformation of the non-collagenous matrix occurs at all levels of the tendon hierarchy, and by modulating the organisation and structure of this matrix, the different mechanical properties required by different tendons can be achieved. Energy storing tendons have been shown to utilise significant amounts of sliding between fascicles to enable the high strain characteristics they require, whilst positional tendons rely more heavily on sliding between collagen fibres and fibrils. However, recent data suggests that energy storing tendons may also contain fascicles which are twisted, or helical, in nature - an arrangement that would be highly beneficial for providing the spring-like behaviour required in these tendons.

===Mechanics===

Tendons are viscoelastic structures, which means they exhibit both elastic and viscous behaviour. When stretched, tendons exhibit typical &quot;soft tissue&quot; behavior. The force-extension, or stress-strain curve starts with a very low stiffness region, as the crimp structure straightens and the collagen fibres align suggesting negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio in the fibres of the tendon. More recently, tests carried out in vivo (through MRI) and ex vivo (through mechanical testing of various cadaveric tendon tissue) have shown that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and exhibit a negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio (auxetic) in some planes when stretched up to 2% along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion. After this &#x27;toe&#x27; region, the structure becomes significantly stiffer, and has a linear stress-strain curve until it begins to fail. The mechanical properties of tendons vary widely, as they are matched to the functional requirements of the tendon. The energy storing tendons tend to be more elastic, or less stiff, so they can more easily store energy, whilst the stiffer positional tendons tend to be a little more viscoelastic, and less elastic, so they can provide finer control of movement. A typical energy storing tendon will fail at around 12–15% strain, and a stress in the region of 100–150 MPa, although some tendons are notably more extensible than this, for example the superficial digital flexor in the horse, which stretches in excess of 20% when galloping. Positional tendons can fail at strains as low as 6–8%, but can have moduli in the region of 700–1000 MPa.

Several studies have demonstrated that tendons respond to changes in mechanical loading with growth and remodeling processes, much like bones. In particular, a study showed that disuse of the Achilles tendon in rats resulted in a decrease in the average thickness of the collagen fiber bundles comprising the tendon. In humans, an experiment in which people were subjected to a simulated micro-gravity environment found that tendon stiffness decreased significantly, even when subjects were required to perform restiveness exercises. These effects have implications in areas ranging from treatment of bedridden patients to the design of more effective exercises for astronauts.

==Clinical significance==

===Injury===

Tendons are subject to many types of injuries. There are various forms of tendinopathies or tendon injuries due to overuse. These types of injuries generally result in inflammation and degeneration or weakening of the tendons, which may eventually lead to tendon rupture. Tendinopathies can be caused by a number of factors relating to the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), and their classification has been difficult because their symptoms and histopathology often are similar.

Types of tendinopathy include:
* Tendinosis: non-inflammatory injury to the tendon at the cellular level. The degradation is caused by damage to collagen, cells, and the vascular components of the tendon, and is known to lead to rupture. Observations of tendons that have undergone spontaneous rupture have shown the presence of collagen fibrils that are not in the correct parallel orientation or are not uniform in length or diameter, along with rounded tenocytes, other cell abnormalities, and the ingrowth of blood vessels. Other forms of tendinosis that have not led to rupture have also shown the degeneration, disorientation, and thinning of the collagen fibrils, along with an increase in the amount of glycosaminoglycans between the fibrils.
* Tendinitis: degeneration with inflammation of the tendon as well as vascular disruption.
* Paratenonitis: inflammation of the paratenon, or paratendinous sheet located between the tendon and its sheath.

Tendinopathies may be caused by several intrinsic factors including age, body weight, and nutrition. The extrinsic factors are often related to sports and include excessive forces or loading, poor training techniques, and environmental conditions.

===Healing===
It was believed that tendons could not undergo matrix turnover and that tenocytes were not capable of repair. However, it has since been shown that, throughout the lifetime of a person, tenocytes in the tendon actively synthesize matrix components as well as enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade the matrix. Tendons are capable of healing and recovering from injuries in a process that is controlled by the tenocytes and their surrounding extracellular matrix.

The three main stages of tendon healing are inflammation, repair or proliferation, and remodeling, which can be further divided into consolidation and maturation. These stages can overlap with each other. In the first stage, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils are recruited to the injury site, along with erythrocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are recruited within the first 24 hours, and phagocytosis of necrotic materials at the injury site occurs. After the release of vasoactive and chemotactic factors, angiogenesis and the proliferation of tenocytes are initiated. Tenocytes then move into the site and start to synthesize collagen III. After a few days, the repair or proliferation stage begins. In this stage, the tenocytes are involved in the synthesis of large amounts of collagen and proteoglycans at the site of injury, and the levels of GAG and water are high. After about six weeks, the remodeling stage begins. The first part of this stage is consolidation, which lasts from about six to ten weeks after the injury. During this time, the synthesis of collagen and GAGs is decreased, and the cellularity is also decreased as the tissue becomes more fibrous as a result of increased production of collagen I and the fibrils become aligned in the direction of mechanical stress. The final maturation stage occurs after ten weeks, and during this time there is an increase in crosslinking of the collagen fibrils, which causes the tissue to become stiffer. Gradually, over about one year, the tissue will turn from fibrous to scar-like.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a very important role in the degradation and remodeling of the ECM during the healing process after a tendon injury. Certain MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and MMP-14 have collagenase activity, meaning that, unlike many other enzymes, they are capable of degrading collagen I fibrils. The degradation of the collagen fibrils by MMP-1 along with the presence of denatured collagen are factors that are believed to cause weakening of the tendon ECM and an increase in the potential for another rupture to occur. In response to repeated mechanical loading or injury, cytokines may be released by tenocytes and can induce the release of MMPs, causing degradation of the ECM and leading to recurring injury and chronic tendinopathies.

A variety of other molecules are involved in tendon repair and regeneration. There are five growth factors that have been shown to be significantly upregulated and active during tendon healing: insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). These growth factors all have different roles during the healing process. IGF-1 increases collagen and proteoglycan production during the first stage of inflammation, and PDGF is also present during the early stages after injury and promotes the synthesis of other growth factors along with the synthesis of DNA and the proliferation of tendon cells. The three isoforms of TGF-β (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3) are known to play a role in wound healing and scar formation. VEGF is well known to promote angiogenesis and to induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and VEGF mRNA has been shown to be expressed at the site of tendon injuries along with collagen I mRNA. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subgroup of TGF-β superfamily that can induce bone and cartilage formation as well as tissue differentiation, and BMP-12 specifically has been shown to influence formation and differentiation of tendon tissue and to promote fibrogenesis.

====Effects of activity on healing====
In animal models, extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of mechanical strain in the form of activity level on tendon injury and healing. While stretching can disrupt healing during the initial inflammatory phase, it has been shown that controlled movement of the tendons after about one week following an acute injury can help to promote the synthesis of collagen by the tenocytes, leading to increased tensile strength and diameter of the healed tendons and fewer adhesions than tendons that are immobilized. In chronic tendon injuries, mechanical loading has also been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis along with collagen realignment, all of which promote repair and remodeling. To further support the theory that movement and activity assist in tendon healing, it has been shown that immobilization of the tendons after injury often has a negative effect on healing. In rabbits, collagen fascicles that are immobilized have shown decreased tensile strength, and immobilization also results in lower amounts of water, proteoglycans, and collagen crosslinks in the tendons.

Several mechanotransduction mechanisms have been proposed as reasons for the response of tenocytes to mechanical force that enable them to alter their gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell phenotype, and eventually cause changes in tendon structure. A major factor is mechanical deformation of the extracellular matrix, which can affect the actin cytoskeleton and therefore affect cell shape, motility, and function. Mechanical forces can be transmitted by focal adhesion sites, integrins, and cell-cell junctions. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton can activate integrins, which mediate &quot;outside-in&quot; and &quot;inside-out&quot; signaling between the cell and the matrix. G-proteins, which induce intracellular signaling cascades, may also be important, and ion channels are activated by stretching to allow ions such as calcium, sodium, or potassium to enter the cell.

==Society and culture==
Sinew was widely used throughout pre-industrial eras as a tough, durable fiber. Some specific uses include using sinew as thread for sewing, attaching feathers to arrows (see fletch), lashing tool blades to shafts, etc. It is also recommended in survival guides as a material from which strong cordage can be made for items like traps or living structures. Tendon must be treated in specific ways to function usefully for these purposes. Inuit and other circumpolar people utilized sinew as the only cordage for all domestic purposes due to the lack of other suitable fiber sources in their ecological habitats. The elastic properties of particular sinews were also used in composite recurved bows favoured by the steppe nomads of Eurasia, and Native Americans. The first stone throwing artillery also used the elastic properties of sinew.

Sinew makes for an excellent cordage material for three reasons: It is extremely strong, it contains natural glues, and it shrinks as it dries, doing away with the need for knots.

=== Culinary uses ===

Tendon (in particular, beef tendon) is used as a food in some Asian cuisines (often served at yum cha or dim sum restaurants). One popular dish is &quot;suan bao niu jin&quot;, in which the tendon is marinated in garlic. It is also sometimes found in the Vietnamese noodle dish phở.

==Other animals==

In some organisms, notably birds, and ornithischian dinosaurs, portions of the tendon can become ossified. In this process, osteocytes infiltrate the tendon and lay down bone as they would in sesamoid bone such as the patella. In birds, tendon ossification primarily occurs in the hindlimb, while in ornithischian dinosaurs, ossified axial muscle tendons form a latticework along the neural and haemal spines on the tail, presumably for support.

<text>Mr. Moto is a fictional Japanese secret agent created by the American author John P. Marquand. He appeared in six novels by Marquand published between 1935 and 1957. Marquand initially created the character for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which was seeking stories with an Asian hero after the death of Charlie Chan&#x27;s creator Earl Derr Biggers.

In various other media, Mr. Moto has been portrayed as an international detective. These include eight motion pictures starring Peter Lorre between 1937 and 1939, 23 radio shows starring James Monks broadcast in 1951, a 1965 film starring Henry Silva, and a 2003 comic book produced by Moonstone Books, later reprinted as &quot;Welcome Back, Mr. Moto&quot;.

==Character in the novels==
In Marquand&#x27;s novels, the character calls himself I.A. Moto, and some other characters believe this to be a fairly obvious alias, since &quot;moto&quot; is usually the second part of a Japanese surname, as in Hashimoto. Though Mr. Moto is shrewd, tough and ruthless against his enemies, to most people in most situations he appears to be a harmless eccentric who sometimes calls himself stupid. The main characters in the novels are Westerners who encounter Mr. Moto in the course of their adventures in exotic lands and gradually come to realize what a formidable character he is.

In the first five novels, set in the era of expansionist Imperial Japan, Mr. Moto is an agent of the empire. In the final novel, set in the 1950s inside Japan, he is a senior intelligence official in the pro-Western Japanese government.

===Physical description===
He is physically described in &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot;:

Mr. Moto was a small man, delicate, almost fragile. … He was dressed formally in a morning coat and striped trousers. His black hair was carefully brushed in the Prussian style. He was smiling, showing a row of shiny gold-filled teeth, and as he smiled he drew in his breath with a polite, soft sibilant sound.
This basic description carries through most of the novels, with a slightly different description in &quot;Right You Are, Mr. Moto&quot;, set 20 years later than the other novels. In this novel he is described as &quot;middle aged&quot;, and his hair as being &quot;grayish and close-clipped.&quot; In two novels, Marquand describes Mr. Moto&#x27;s build as &quot;chunky&quot;.

He is often described as wearing formal evening clothes that are impeccably tailored. On occasion his sartorial style is somewhat misguided such as in &quot;Mr. Moto Is So Sorry&quot; when he appears in black-and-white checked sports clothes with green and red golf stockings. When his outfits are commented upon, Mr. Moto makes excuses. In &quot;Stopover: Tokyo&quot;, he is said to have the imposing dignity of his samurai forebears when dressed in traditional Japanese clothing.

==Speech==
In the prewar novels, Moto speaks a faintly comic English, with elaborate &#x27;Oriental&#x27;-style politeness, with misuse of the definite and indefinite articles. In &quot;Stopover: Tokyo&quot;, the final novel, he works directly with U.S. intelligence agents and speaks to them in perfect English.

===Personal life===
Mr. Moto rarely discusses his personal life but in &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot; he talks about his many talents.

Yes, I can do many, many things. I can mix drinks and wait on table, and I am a very good valet. I can navigate and manage small boats. I have studied at two foreign universities. I also know carpentry and surveying and five Chinese dialects. So very many things come in useful.
In &quot;Mr. Moto Is So Sorry&quot; he states that one of the foreign universities was in America where he studied anthropology. It is noted in this novel that he has enough knowledge of America to distinguish regional accents.

The novels generally involve a romance between the main character (often a disenfranchised expatriate American) and a mysterious woman. While Mr. Moto often despairs of the hero&#x27;s attempts at saving the girl, he notes in &quot;Mr. Moto Is So Sorry&quot; that he himself is not immune to their charms.
&quot;So often&quot;, he said, &quot;I have seen such gracious ladies disrupt political combinations.&quot; He sighed and still stared at the ceiling seemingly lost in memory. &quot;Such a lovely girl in Washington – I was so much younger then. She sold me the navy plans of a submarine. The price was thirty thousand yen. When the blueprints came, they were of a tugboat. Such a lovely lady. Such a lovely lady in Tokyo. She took me to see the goldfish in her garden, and there were the assassins behind the little trees. Not her fault, but theirs that I am still alive – they were such poor shots. I do not understand lovely ladies, but I still trust them sometimes.&quot;
===Politics===
While he is a devoted servant of the Emperor, he is often at odds with the Japanese military. He believes in the manifest destiny of the Japanese expansion into China, but unlike the military, wants to achieve this slowly and carefully. Millicent Bell in her biography of John P. Marquand notes how this may have influenced the audience:
There is political significance, too, in the calculated appeal to American readers of the ever resourceful Mr. Moto, the representative of Eastern subtlety combined with Western efficiency, who emerges as a gentleman of wit and charm. This characterization had to survive some anti-Japanese sentiment that followed Japan&#x27;s invasion of China in 1937. Up to 1939 it may have seemed possible, especially to those Americans unaware of or indifferent to the atrocities of the Japanese military in China, that Japan would be moderate and reasonable in its expansion in the Far East and that the Mr. Motos would defeat the Japanese military fanatics. Pearl Harbor ended American neutrality and American hopes for Japanese moderation, but not before Marquand&#x27;s Moto series had become one of the most popular fictions ever to be run in an American magazine.

==Character in the films==
Between 1937 and 1939 eight motion pictures were produced by 20th Century Fox starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentaro Moto.

Unlike in the novels, Moto is the central character, a detective with Interpol, wears glasses (and has no gold teeth), and is a devout Buddhist (and friendly with the Chinese monarchy). He is impeccably dressed in Western suits. The stories are action-oriented due to Moto&#x27;s skill with judo (only hinted at in the novels) and due to his tendency to wear disguises.

In early 1938, there was some press talk that Moto would be turned into a Korean due to controversy over Japanese foreign policy, but this did not happen. By April there was talk the series would soon wind up.

===Abilities===
In the film &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Last Warning&quot; a list is shown which describes him as:
* Age 35–40
* Jiu-jutsu and judo expert
* Uses various disguises
* International police
* Adept at stage illusion/magic
* Usually works alone
* Able to walk silently
* Known to use doubles

Throughout the films, other abilities have been noted:
* Ventriloquism
* Juggling
* Able to speak at least four languages (English, Mandarin, German, and Japanese)
* Devout Buddhist who knows traditional chants and religious rites
* Composes haiku
* Draws caricatures
* Plays the shamisen
* Knows how to cure a hangover

===Occupation===
The motion picture Mr. Moto is described as an agent for Interpol.

In the first film, &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot;, he reveals that he is the managing director of the Dai Nippon Trading Company and had decided to investigate the smuggling activities that were harming his business. He claims to be a detective &quot;only as a hobby.&quot; In the second film, &quot;Thank You, Mr. Moto&quot;, the definition of his occupation/hobby begins to get murky. He tells a woman that he is an importer whose hobby is detective work, but only after showing her his identification which indicates he is a Confidential Agent for the International Association of Importers. However, in a climactic chase sequence he flashes a badge at a guard and says that he is from the International Police (understood as Interpol).

In subsequent films Mr. Moto works for private organizations such as the Diamond Syndicate (&quot;Danger Island&quot;) as well as for world governments (&quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Last Warning&quot; and &quot;Mr. Moto Takes a Chance&quot;)-- but only when it is in Japan&#x27;s interests.

As a member of the International Police, he garners respect from local police around the world. In London, Shanghai, and San Francisco he is given full cooperation for his investigations. In &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Last Warning&quot; he works side by side with British Secret Service agents and in &quot;Mr. Moto Takes a Chance&quot; he is spying for an unknown government agency. He is known for his close relationship to the Chinese Royal Family.

===Personal life===
Mr. Moto&#x27;s personal life is rarely touched upon. In &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot; he tells Bob Hitchings that he went to Stanford University, graduating in 1921 as an honorary member. There, he set a pole vaulting record and was a member of the fraternity Alpha Omega.

In the movies, Mr. Moto travels a great deal and manages to have his cat, Chunkina, along for the journey. Besides his cat, the women in his life include Lela Liu (played by Lotus Long in the film &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot;), a hotel telephone operator whom he asks out on a date, and who proves to be an agent who helps him in his investigation. In &quot;Mysterious Mr. Moto&quot;, an agent, Lotus Liu (also played by Lotus Long, credited as Karen Sorrell), pretends to fall for his charms so they can be alone to compare notes in their investigation. Like his literary counterpart, Kentaro Moto believes that a &quot;Beautiful girl is only confusing to a man&quot;, but has been known to use a woman&#x27;s emotions to aid his cause. In &quot;Thank You, Mr. Moto&quot;, he tells the disillusioned Madame Tchernov, &quot;I am so grateful for your suspicious nature. It is not the first time a woman&#x27;s jealousy has been fatal to the man she loved.&quot;

Mr. Moto is charming and polite (even to rude or obnoxious people). He is respectful of other cultures, but sometimes makes wry comments. For instance, in &quot;Think Fast, Mr. Moto&quot;, he derails the drunken American&#x27;s party tricks with a little judo. After putting the tipsy Bob Hitchings to bed, he sadly shakes his head and says, &quot;Strange people these Americans.&quot;

Mr. Moto&#x27;s religion is never stated; but in &quot;Thank You, Mr. Moto&quot;, when his friend Prince Chung (played by Phillip Ahn) dies, it becomes clear Mr. Moto is a devout Buddhist, as he chants expertly before the statue of the Buddha while holding the prince in his arms.

The family crest or mon on Mr. Moto&#x27;s yukata, as seen in the films &quot;Thank You, Mr. Moto&quot; and &quot;Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation&quot;, is three bars in a circle. This is similar to the Maruno uchini mitsuhikiryō (丸の内に三引両), the mon of the Sakuma clan who served under Oda Nobunaga. This would imply that Moto is from a samurai family.

===Other films===
A film version of &quot;Stopover Tokyo&quot;, made in 1957, stars Robert Wagner as an American spy. This film eliminated Moto&#x27;s character altogether. It disregards the plot of Marquand&#x27;s novel, and was not a commercial or critical success.

In 1965 Mr. Moto&#x27;s character was revived in a low-budget Robert Lippert production filmed in England starring Henry Silva. In &quot;Mr. Moto Returns&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Return of Mr. Moto&quot;, Mr. I.A. Moto is a member of Interpol. The very tall Silva conveyed an almost James Bond-like playboy character; in the fight scenes it is clearly obvious that he is not proficient in martial arts. He speaks in a lazy &#x27;Beatnik&#x27; manner. Nowhere in the film is it mentioned that Moto is Japanese. He is referred to as an &quot;Oriental&quot; and, oddly, in the trailer, Moto is referred to as a &quot;swinging Chinese cat.&quot; It is only when disguised as a Japanese oil representative, Mr. Takura, that a stereotypical portrayal of a Japanese businessman is given.

In 1984 Mr. Moto&#x27;s character was rudely referred to in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; by a drunken racist played by Larry Drake. After Miyagi trains Daniel to learn balance, Miyagi takes him to his truck he notices Drake&#x27;s character and another drunk drinking beers and placing the empty bottles on the hood. Spouting racial slurs at Miyagi and referring to him as Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Pet Nip.&quot; When Miyagi politely asks them to remove their bottles, Drake&#x27;s character retorts &quot;Kindry do it yourself, Mr. Moto.&quot; Which Miyagi retaliates by chopping the necks off all the bottles, intimidating the two into cleaning up what&#x27;s left and leaving.

== Filmography ==
==Character in the radio program==
From May to October 1951, the NBC Radio Network produced and aired 23 half-hour episodes starring James Monks as Mr. I.A. Moto, International Secret Agent. Mr. Moto is an American of Japanese descent born in San Francisco but retaining his international connections.

The show focused on Mr. Moto&#x27;s fight against Communism although occasionally he solved more mundane mysteries such as murder and blackmail.

<text>Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name &quot;svn&quot;) is a version control system distributed as open source under the Apache License. Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

The open source community has used Subversion widely: for example, in projects such as Apache Software Foundation, FreeBSD, SourceForge, and from 2006 to 2019, GCC. CodePlex was previously a common host for Subversion repositories.

Subversion was created by CollabNet Inc. in 2000, and is now a top-level Apache project being built and used by a global community of contributors.

==History==
CollabNet founded the Subversion project in 2000 as an effort to write an open-source version-control system which operated much like CVS but which fixed the bugs and supplied some features missing in CVS. By 2001, Subversion had advanced sufficiently to host its own source code, and in February 2004, version 1.0 was released. In November 2009, Subversion was accepted into Apache Incubator: this marked the beginning of the process to become a standard top-level Apache project. It became a top-level Apache project on February 17, 2010.


Release dates are extracted from Apache Subversion&#x27;s file, which records all release history.

==Features==
* Commits as true atomic operations (interrupted commit operations in CVS would cause repository inconsistency or corruption).
* The system maintains versioning for directories and some specific file metadata (see Properties). Users can move or copy files and entire directory-trees very quickly, while retaining full revision history (as being implemented by a reference to the original object).
* Versioning of symbolic links.
* Native support for binary files, with space-efficient binary-diff storage.
* Apache HTTP Server as network server, WebDAV/Delta-V for protocol. There is also an independent server process called svnserve that uses a custom protocol over TCP/IP.
* Branching is implemented by a copy of a directory, thus it is a cheap operation, independent of file size.
* Natively client–server, layered library design.
* Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions.
* Parsable output, including XML log output.
* Open source licensed – Apache License since the 1.7 release; prior versions use a derivative of the Apache Software License 1.1.
* Internationalized program messages.
* File locking for unmergeable files (&quot;reserved checkouts&quot;).
* Path-based authorization.
* Language bindings for C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and Java.
* Full MIME support – users can view or change the MIME type of each file, with the software knowing which MIME types can have their differences from previous versions shown.
* Merge tracking – merges between branches will be tracked, this allows automatic merging between branches without telling Subversion what does and does not need to be merged.
* Changelists to organize commits into commit groups.

===Repository types===
Subversion offers two types of repository storage.

====Berkeley DB (deprecated)====
The original development of Subversion used the Berkeley DB package.
Subversion has some limitations with Berkeley DB usage when a program that accesses the database crashes or terminates forcibly. No data loss or corruption occurs, but the repository remains offline while Berkeley DB replays the journal and cleans up any outstanding locks. The safest way to use Subversion with a Berkeley DB repository involves a single server-process running as one user (instead of through a shared filesystem). The Berkeley DB backend was deprecated in version 1.8.

====FSFS====

In 2004, a new storage subsystem was developed and named FSFS.
It works faster than the Berkeley DB backend on directories with a large number of files and takes less disk space,
due to less logging.

Beginning with Subversion 1.2, FSFS became the default data store for new repositories.

The etymology of &quot;FSFS&quot; is based on Subversion&#x27;s use of the term &quot;filesystem&quot; for its repository storage system.
FSFS stores its contents directly within the operating system&#x27;s filesystem, rather than a structured system like Berkeley DB.
Thus, it is a &quot;[Subversion] FileSystem atop the FileSystem&quot;.

====FSX====
A new filesystem, called FSX, is under development to remove some limitations of FSFS. As of Version 1.9, it was not considered production-ready.

===Repository access===

Access to Subversion repositories can take place by:

# Local filesystem or network filesystem, accessed by client directly. This mode uses the access scheme.
# WebDAV/Delta-V (over http or https) using the module for Apache 2. This mode uses the access scheme or for secure connections using ssl.
# Custom &quot;svn&quot; protocol (default port 3690), using plain text or over TCP/IP. This mode uses either the access scheme for unencrypted transport or scheme for tunneling over ssh.

All three means can access both FSFS and Berkeley DB repositories.

Any 1.x version of a client can work with any 1.x server. Newer clients and servers have additional features and performance capabilities, but have fallback support for older clients/servers.

==Layers==
Internally, a Subversion system comprises several libraries arranged as layers. Each performs a specific task and allows developers to create their own tools at the desired level of complexity and specificity.

; Fs : The lowest level; it implements the versioned filesystem which stores the user data.
; Repos : Concerned with the repository built up around the filesystem. It has many helper functions and handles the various &quot;hooks&quot; that a repository may have, e.g., scripts that run when an action is performed. Together, Fs and Repos constitute the &quot;filesystem interface&quot;.
; mod_dav_svn : Provides WebDAV/Delta-V access through Apache 2.
; Ra : Handles &quot;repository access&quot;, both local and remote. From this point on, repositories are referred to using URLs, e.g.
:* for local access,
:* or for WebDAV access, or
:* or for the SVN protocol.
; Client, Wc : The highest level. It abstracts repository access and provides common client tasks, such as authenticating users or comparing versions. Subversion clients use the Wc library to manage the local working copy.

==Filesystem==

One can view the Subversion filesystem as &quot;two-dimensional&quot;. Two coordinates are used to unambiguously address filesystem items:
* Path (regular path of Unix-like OS filesystem)
* Revision
Each revision in a Subversion filesystem has its own &quot;root&quot;, which is used to access contents at that revision. Files are stored as links to the most recent change; thus a Subversion repository is quite compact. The system consumes storage space proportional to the number of changes made, not to the number of revisions.

The Subversion filesystem uses transactions to keep changes atomic. A transaction operates on a specified revision of the filesystem, not necessarily the latest. The transaction has its own &quot;root&quot;, on which changes are made. It is then either committed and becomes the latest revision, or is aborted. The transaction is actually a long-lived filesystem object; a client does not need to commit or abort a transaction itself, rather it can also begin a transaction, exit, and then can re-open the transaction and continue using it. Potentially, multiple clients can access the same transaction and work together on an atomic change, though no existing clients expose this capability.

==Properties==
One important feature of the Subversion filesystem is properties: simple &quot;name&quot;=&quot;value&quot; pairs of text. Most properties occur on filesystem entries (i.e., files and directories). These are versioned just like other changes to the filesystem. The Subversion client reserves the &#x27;svn:&#x27; prefix for built-in properties, but other names can be used to define custom properties.

; : Makes a file on Unix-hosted working copies executable, when supported by the filesystem.
; : Stores the Internet media type (&quot;MIME type&quot;) of a file. Affects the handling of diffs and merging.
; : A list of filename patterns to ignore in a directory. Similar to CVS&#x27;s codice_1 file.
; : A list of &quot;keywords&quot; to substitute into a file when changes are made. The file itself must also reference the keywords as or . This is used to maintain certain information (e.g., author, date of last change, revision number) in a file without human intervention.The keyword substitution mechanism originates from RCS and from CVS.
; : Makes the client convert end-of-line characters in text files. Used when the working copy is needed with a specific EOL style. &quot;native&quot; is commonly used, so that EOLs match the user&#x27;s OS EOL style. Repositories may require this property on all files to prevent inconsistent line endings, which can cause a problem in itself.
; : Allows parts of other repositories to be automatically checked out into a subdirectory.
; : Specifies that a file is to be checked out with file permissions set to read-only. This is designed for use with the locking mechanism. The read-only permission reminds one to obtain a lock before modifying the file: obtaining a lock makes the file writable, and releasing the lock makes it read-only again. Locks are only enforced during a commit operation. Locks can be used without setting this property. However, that is not recommended, because it introduces the risk of someone modifying a locked file; they will only discover it has been locked when their commit fails.
; : This property is not meant to be set or modified directly by users. it is only used for having symbolic links in the repository. When a symbolic link is added to the repository, a file containing the link target is created with this property set. When a Unix-like system checks out this file, the client converts it to a symbolic link.
; : Used to track merge data (revision numbers) in Subversion 1.5 (or later). This property is automatically maintained by the command, and it is not recommended to change its value manually.

Subversion also uses properties on revisions themselves. Like the above properties on filesystem entries, the names are completely arbitrary, with the Subversion client using certain properties prefixed with &#x27;svn:&#x27;. However, these properties are not versioned, and they can be changed later if allowed by a pre-revprop-change hook.

; : The date and time stamp of a revision.
; : The name of the user that submitted the change(s).
; : The user-supplied description of the change(s).

==Branching and tagging==
Subversion uses the inter-file branching model from Perforce to implement branches and tagging. A branch is a separate line of development. Tagging refers to labeling the repository at a certain point in time so that it can be easily found in the future. In Subversion, the only difference between branches and tags is how they are used.

A new branch or tag is set up by using the &quot;&quot; command, which should be used in place of the native operating system mechanism. The copied directory is linked to the original in the repository to preserve its history, and the copy takes very little extra space in the repository.

All the versions in each branch maintain the history of the file up to the point of the copy, plus any changes made since. One can &quot;merge&quot; changes back into the trunk or between branches.

==Limitations and problems==
A known problem in Subversion affects the implementation of the file and directory rename operation. , Subversion implements the renaming of files and directories as a &quot;copy&quot; to the new name followed by a &quot;delete&quot; of the old name. Only the names change, all data relating to the edit history remains the same, and Subversion will still use the old name in older revisions of the &quot;tree&quot;. However, Subversion may become confused when a move conflicts with edits made elsewhere, both for regular commits and when merging branches. The Subversion 1.5 release addressed some of these scenarios while others remained problematic. The Subversion 1.8 release addressed some of these problems by making moves a first-class operation on the client, but it is still treated as copy+delete in the repository.

, Subversion lacks some repository-administration and management features. For instance, someone may wish to edit the repository to permanently remove all historical records of certain data. Subversion does not have built-in support to achieve this simply.

Subversion stores additional copies of data on the local machine, which can become an issue with very large projects or files, or if developers work on multiple branches simultaneously. In versions prior to 1.7 these codice_2 directories on the client side could become corrupted by ill-advised user activity like global search/replace operations. Starting with version 1.7 Subversion uses a single centralized folder per working area.

Subversion does not store the modification times of files. As such, a file checked out of a Subversion repository will have the &#x27;current&#x27; date (instead of the modification time in the repository), and a file checked into the repository will have the date of the check-in (instead of the modification time of the file being checked in). This might not always be what is wanted.
To mitigate this, third-party tools exist that allow for preserving modification time and other filesystem meta-data.
However, giving checked out files a current date is important as well — this is how tools like make(1) will take notice of a changed file for rebuilding it.

Subversion uses a centralized revision control model. Ben Collins-Sussman, one of the designers of Subversion, believes a centralised model would help prevent &quot;insecure programmers&quot; from hiding their work from other team members during development. Some users of version control systems see the centralised model as detrimental; famously, Linus Torvalds attacked Subversion&#x27;s model and its developers.

Subversion often does not deal well with the filename normalization performed by the HFS+ filesystem. This can cause problems when files with accented characters in their names are added to the repository on a non-HFS+ filesystem and the repository is then used with HFS+.

===Subversion tags and branches===
Revision numbers are difficult to remember in any version-control system. For this reason, most systems offer symbolic &quot;tags&quot; as user-friendly references to them. Subversion does not have such a feature and what its documentation recommends to use instead is very different in nature. Instead of implementing tags as &quot;references&quot; to points in history, Subversion recommends making snapshot &quot;copies&quot; into a well-known subdirectory (&quot;&quot;) in the space of the repository tree. Only a few predefined &quot;references&quot; are available: , , and .

This history-to-space projection has multiple issues:

To address such issues, posters on the Subversion mailing lists have suggested a new feature called &quot;labels&quot; or &quot;aliases&quot;. SVN labels would more closely resemble the &quot;tags&quot; of other systems such as CVS or Git. The fact that Subversion has global revision numbers opens the way to a very simple label → revision implementation. Yet as of 2013, no progress has been made and symbolic tags are not in the list of the most wanted features.

==Development and implementation==
CollabNet has continued its involvement with Subversion, but the project runs as an independent open source community. In November 2009, the project was accepted into the Apache Incubator, aiming to become part of the Apache Software Foundation&#x27;s efforts. Since March 2010, the project is formally known as Apache Subversion, being a part of the Apache Top-Level Projects.

In October 2009, WANdisco announced the hiring of core Subversion committers as the company moved to become a major corporate sponsor of the project. This included Hyrum Wright, president of the Subversion Corporation and release manager for the Subversion project since early 2008, who joined the company to lead its open source team.

The Subversion open-source community does not provide binaries, but potential users can download binaries from volunteers. While the Subversion project does not include an official graphical user interface (GUI) for use with Subversion, third parties have developed a number of different GUIs, along with a wide variety of additional ancillary software.

Work announced in 2009 included SubversionJ (a Java API) and implementation of the Obliterate command, similar to that provided by Perforce. Both of these enhancements were sponsored by WANdisco.

The Subversion committers normally have at least one or two new features under active development at any one time. The 1.7 release of Subversion in October 2011 included a streamlined HTTP transport to improve performance and a rewritten working-copy library.

In 2002, a design contest was held to select the logo for Subversion. The original entries can be found here as well as the votes for each logo. The current logo received the most votes in the contest.

<text>Toponymy, toponymics, or toponomastics is the study of &quot;&quot; (proper names of places, also known as place names and geographic names), including their origins, meanings, usage, and types. &quot;Toponym&quot; is the general term for a proper name of any geographical feature, and full scope of the term also includes proper names of all cosmographical features.

In a more specific sense, the term &quot;toponymy&quot; refers to an inventory of toponyms, while the discipline researching such names is referred to as &quot;toponymics&quot; or &quot;toponomastics&quot;. Toponymy is a branch of onomastics, the study of proper names of all kinds. A person who studies toponymy is called &quot;toponymist&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;toponymy&quot; comes from / , &#x27;place&#x27;, and / , &#x27;name&#x27;.
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records &quot;toponymy&quot; (meaning &quot;place name&quot;) first appearing in English in 1876 in the context of geographical studies. Since then, &quot;toponym&quot; has come to replace the term &quot;place-name&quot; in professional discourse among geographers.

==Toponymic typology==
Toponyms can be divided in two principal groups:
* geonyms - proper names of all geographical features, on planet Earth.
* cosmonyms - proper names of cosmographical features, outside Earth.

Various types of geographical toponyms (geonyms) include, in alphabetical order: 
* agronyms - proper names of fields and plains.
* choronyms - proper names of regions or countries. 
* dromonyms - proper names of roads or any other transport routes by land, water or air.
* drymonyms - proper names of woods and forests.
* econyms - proper names of inhabited locations, like houses, villages, towns or cities, including:
** astionyms - proper names of towns and cities.
** comonyms - proper names of villages.
* hydronyms - proper names of various bodies of water, including:
** helonyms - proper names of swamps, marshes and bogs.
** limnonyms - proper names of lakes and ponds.
** oceanonyms - proper names of oceans.
** pelagonyms - proper names of seas.
** potamonyms - proper names of rivers and streams.
* insulonyms - proper names of islands.
* metatoponyms - proper names of places containing recursive elements (e.g. Red River Valley Road).
* oronyms - proper names of relief features, like mountains, hills and valleys, including:
** speleonyms - proper names of caves or some other subterranean features.
** petronyms - proper names of rock climbing routes.
* urbanonyms - proper names of urban elements (streets, squares etc.) in settlements, including:
** agoronyms - proper names of squares and marketplaces.
** hodonyms - proper names of streets and roads.

Various types of cosmographical toponyms (cosmonyms) include: 
* asteroidonyms - proper names of asteroids.
* astronyms - proper names of stars and constellations.
* cometonyms - proper names of comets.
* meteoronyms - proper names of meteors.
* planetonyms - proper names of planets and planetary systems.

==History==

Probably the first toponymists were the storytellers and poets who explained the origin of specific place names as part of their tales; sometimes place-names served as the basis for their etiological legends. The process of folk etymology usually took over, whereby a false meaning was extracted from a name based on its structure or sounds. Thus, for example, the toponym of Hellespont was explained by Greek poets as being named after Helle, daughter of Athamas, who drowned there as she crossed it with her brother Phrixus on a flying golden ram. The name, however, is probably derived from an older language, such as Pelasgian, which was unknown to those who explained its origin. In his &quot;Names on the Globe&quot;, George R. Stewart theorizes that &quot;Hellespont&quot; originally meant something like &#x27;narrow Pontus&#x27; or &#x27;entrance to Pontus&#x27;, &quot;Pontus&quot; being an ancient name for the region around the Black Sea, and by extension, for the sea itself.

Especially in the 19th century, the age of exploration, a lot of toponyms got a different name because of national pride. Thus the famous German cartographer Petermann thought that the naming of newly discovered physical features was one of the privileges of a map-editor, especially as he was fed up with forever encountering toponyms like &#x27;Victoria&#x27;, &#x27;Wellington&#x27;, &#x27;Smith&#x27;, &#x27;Jones&#x27;, etc. He writes: &quot;While constructing the new map to specify the detailed topographical portrayal and after consulting with and authorization of messr. Theodor von Heuglin and count Karl Graf von Waldburg-Zeil I have entered 118 names in the map: partly they are the names derived from celebrities of arctic explorations and discoveries, arctic travellers anyway as well as excellent friends, patrons, and participants of different nationalities in the newest northpolar expeditions, partly eminent German travellers in Africa, Australia, America ...&quot;.

Toponyms may have different names through time, due to changes and developments in languages, political developments and border adjustments to name but a few. More recently many postcolonial countries revert to their own nomenclature for toponyms that have been named by colonial powers.

== Toponomastics ==

A toponymist, through well-established local principles and procedures developed in cooperation and consultation with the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), applies the science of toponymy to establish officially recognized geographical names. A toponymist relies not only on maps and local histories, but interviews with local residents to determine names with established local usage. The exact application of a toponym, its specific language, its pronunciation, and its origins and meaning are all important facts to be recorded during name surveys.

Scholars have found that toponyms provide valuable insight into the historical geography of a particular region. In 1954, F. M. Powicke said of place-name study that it &quot;uses, enriches and tests the discoveries of archaeology and history and the rules of the philologists.&quot;

Toponyms not only illustrate ethnic settlement patterns, but they can also help identify discrete periods of immigration.

Toponymists are responsible for the active preservation of their region&#x27;s culture through its toponymy. They typically ensure the ongoing development of a geographical names database and associated publications, for recording and disseminating authoritative hard-copy and digital toponymic data. This data may be disseminated in a wide variety of formats, including hard-copy topographic maps as well as digital formats such as geographic information systems, Google Maps, or thesauri like the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names.

== Toponymic commemoration ==
In 2002, the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names acknowledged that while common, the practice of naming geographical places after living persons (toponymic commemoration) could be problematic. Therefore, the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names recommends that it be avoided and that national authorities should set their own guidelines as to the time required after a person&#x27;s death for the use of a commemorative name.

In the same vein, writers Pinchevski and Torgovnik (2002) consider the naming of streets as a political act in which holders of the legitimate monopoly to name aspire to engrave their ideological views in the social space. Similarly, the revisionist practice of
renaming streets, as both the celebration of triumph and the repudiation of the old regime is another issue of toponymy. Also, in the context of Slavic nationalism, the name of Saint Petersburg was changed to the more Slavic sounding &quot;Petrograd&quot; from 1914 to 1924, then to &quot;Leningrad&quot; following the death of Vladimir Lenin and back to &quot;Saint-Peterburg&quot; in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After 1830, in the wake of the Greek War of Independence and the establishment of an independent Greek state, Turkish, Slavic and Italian place names were Hellenized, as an effort of &quot;toponymic cleansing.&quot; This nationalization of place names can also manifest itself in a postcolonial context.

In Canada, there have been initiatives in recent years &quot;to restore traditional names to reflect the Indigenous culture wherever possible&quot;. Indigenous mapping is a process that can include restoring place names by Indigenous communities themselves.

Frictions sometimes arise between countries because of toponymy, as illustrated by the Macedonia naming dispute in which Greece has claimed the name &quot;Macedonia&quot;, the Sea of Japan naming dispute between Japan and Korea, as well as the Persian Gulf naming dispute. On 20 September 1996 a note on the internet reflected a query by a Canadian surfer, who said as follows: &#x27;One producer of maps labeled the water body 
&quot;Persian Gulf&quot; on a 1977 map of Iran, and then &quot;Arabian Gulf&quot;, also in 1977, in a map which focused on the Gulf States. I would gather that this is an indication of the &quot;politics of maps&quot;, but I would be interested to know if this was done to avoid upsetting users of the Iran map and users of the map showing Arab Gulf States&#x27;. This symbolizes a further aspect of the topic, namely the spilling over of the problem from the purely political to the economic sphere.

==Geographic names boards==
A geographic names board is an official body established by a government to decide on official names for geographical areas and features.

Most countries have such a body, which is commonly (but not always) known by this name. In some countries (especially those organised on a federal basis), subdivisions such as individual states or provinces have individual boards.

Individual geographic names boards include:
* Antarctic Place-names Commission
*Commission nationale de toponymie (National toponymy commission - France)
* Geographical Names Board of Canada
* Geographical Names Board of New South Wales
*New Zealand Geographic Board
* South African Geographical Names Council
* United States Board on Geographic Names

<doc id="144870" wikidata="Q389624" url="?curid=144870" title="Charlie Chan">
<text>Charlie Chan is a fictional Honolulu police detective created by author Earl Derr Biggers for a series of mystery novels. Biggers loosely based Chan on Hawaiian detective Chang Apana. The benevolent and heroic Chan was conceived as an alternative to Yellow Peril stereotypes and villains like Fu Manchu. Many stories feature Chan traveling the world beyond Hawaii as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes.

Chan first appeared in Biggers&#x27; novels and then was featured in a number of media. Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character, featured only as a supporting character, was first portrayed by East Asian actors, and the films met with little success. In 1931, for the first film centering on Chan, &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot;, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce 15 more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland&#x27;s death, American actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan; Toler made 22 Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler&#x27;s death, six films were made, starring Roland Winters.

Readers and moviegoers of America greeted Chan warmly. Chan was seen as an attractive character, portrayed as intelligent, heroic, benevolent, and honorable; this contrasted with the common depiction of Asians as evil or conniving which dominated Hollywood and national media in the early 20th century. However, in later decades critics increasingly took a more ambivalent view of the character. Despite his good qualities, Chan was also perceived as reinforcing condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. No Charlie Chan film has been produced since 1981.

The character has also been featured in several radio programs, two television shows, and comics.

== Books ==
The character of Charlie Chan was created by Earl Derr Biggers. In 1919, while visiting Hawaii, Biggers planned a detective novel to be called &quot;The House Without a Key&quot;. He did not begin to write that novel until four years later, however, when he was inspired to add a Chinese-American police officer to the plot after reading in a newspaper of Chang Apana and Lee Fook, two detectives on the Honolulu police force. Biggers, who disliked the Yellow Peril stereotypes he found when he came to California, explicitly conceived of the character as an alternative: &quot;Sinister and wicked Chinese are old stuff, but an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order has never been used.&quot;:

The &quot;amiable Chinese&quot; made his first appearance in &quot;The House Without a Key&quot; (1925). The character was not central to the novel and was not mentioned by name on the dust jacket of the first edition. In the novel, Chan is described as &quot;very fat indeed, yet he walked with the light dainty step of a woman&quot; and in &quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot; as being &quot; … an undistinguished figure in his Western clothes.&quot; According to critic Sandra Hawley, this description of Chan allows Biggers to portray the character as nonthreatening, the opposite of evil Chinese characters, such as Fu Manchu, while simultaneously emphasizing supposedly Chinese characteristics such as impassivity and stoicism.

Biggers wrote six novels in which Charlie Chan appears:
*&quot;The House Without a Key&quot; (1925)
*&quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot; (1926)
*&quot;Behind That Curtain&quot; (1928)
*&quot;The Black Camel&quot; (1929)
*&quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot; (1930)
*&quot;Keeper of the Keys&quot; (1932)

== Film, radio, stage and television adaptations ==

=== Films ===
The first film featuring Charlie Chan, as a supporting character, was &quot;The House Without a Key&quot; (1926), a ten-chapter serial produced by Pathé Studios, starring George Kuwa, a Japanese actor, as Chan. A year later Universal Pictures followed with &quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot;, starring Japanese actor Kamiyama Sojin as Chan, again as a supporting character. In both productions, Charlie Chan&#x27;s role was minimized. Contemporary reviews were unfavorable; in the words of one reviewer, speaking of &quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot;, Sojin plays &quot;the Chink sleuth as a Lon Chaney cook-waiter … because Chaney can&#x27;t stoop that low.&quot;

For the first film to center mainly on the character of Chan, Warner Oland, a white actor, was cast in the title role in 1931&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot;, and it was this film that gained popular success. Oland, a Swedish actor, had also played Fu Manchu in an earlier film. Oland, who claimed some Mongolian ancestry, played the character as more gentle and self-effacing than he had been in the books, perhaps in &quot;a deliberate attempt by the studio to downplay an uppity attitude in a Chinese detective.&quot; Oland starred in sixteen Chan films for Fox, often with Keye Luke, who played Chan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Lee Chan. Oland&#x27;s &quot;warmth and gentle humor&quot; helped make the character and films popular; the Oland Chan films were among Fox&#x27;s most successful. By attracting &quot;major audiences and box-office grosses on a par with A&#x27;s&quot; they &quot;kept Fox afloat&quot; during the Great Depression.

Oland died in 1938, and the Chan film &quot;Charlie Chan at the Ringside&quot; was rewritten with additional footage as &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Gamble&quot;, an entry in the Mr. Moto series, another contemporary series featuring an East Asian protagonist; Luke appeared as Lee Chan, not only in already shot footage but also in scenes with Moto actor Peter Lorre. Fox hired another white actor, Sidney Toler, to play Charlie Chan, and produced eleven Chan films through 1942. Toler&#x27;s Chan was less mild-mannered than Oland&#x27;s, a &quot;switch in attitude that added some of the vigor of the original books to the films.&quot; He is frequently accompanied, and irritated, by his Number Two Son, Jimmy Chan, played by Victor Sen Yung, who later portrayed &quot;Hop Sing&quot; in the long-running Western television series &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

When Fox decided to produce no further Chan films, Sidney Toler purchased the film rights from the author&#x27;s widow. He had hoped to film more Charlie Chan pictures independently, to be released through Fox, but Fox had already discontinued the series and had no interest in reviving it. Toler approached Philip N. Krasne, a Hollywood lawyer who financed film productions, and Krasne brokered a deal with Monogram Pictures. James S. Burkett produced the films for Monogram. The budget for each film was reduced from Fox&#x27;s average of $200,000 to $75,000. For the first time, Chan was portrayed on occasion as &quot;openly contemptuous of suspects and superiors.&quot; African American comedic actor Mantan Moreland played chauffeur Birmingham Brown in 13 films (1944–1949) which led to criticism of the Monogram films in the forties and since; some call his performances &quot;brilliant comic turns&quot;, while others describe Moreland&#x27;s roles as an offensive and embarrassing stereotype. Toler died in 1947 and was succeeded by Roland Winters for six films. Keye Luke, missing from the series after 1938&#x27;s Mr. Moto rework, returned as Charlie&#x27;s son in the last two entries.

==== Spanish-language adaptations ====

Three Spanish-language Charlie Chan films were made in the 1930s and 1950s. The first, &quot;Eran Trece&quot; (&quot;There Were Thirteen&quot;, 1931), is a multiple-language version of &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot; (1931). The two films were made concurrently and followed the same production schedule, with each scene filmed twice the same day, once in English and then in Spanish. The film followed essentially the same script as the Anglophonic version, with minor additions such as brief songs and skits and some changes to characters&#x27; names (for example, the character Elmer Benbow was renamed Frank Benbow). A Cuban production, &quot;La Serpiente Roja&quot; (The Red Snake), followed in 1937. In 1955, Producciones Cub-Mex produced a Mexican version of Charlie Chan called &quot;El Monstruo en la Sombra&quot; (Monster in the Shadow), starring Orlando Rodriguez as &quot;Chan Li Po&quot; (Charlie Chan in the original script). The film was inspired by &quot;La Serpiente Roja&quot; as well as the American Warner Oland films.

==== Chinese-language adaptations ====

During the 1930s and 1940s, five Chan films were produced in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In these films, Chan, played by Xu Xinyuan (徐莘园), owns his detective agency and is aided not by a son but by a daughter, Manna, played first by Gu Meijun (顾梅君) in the Shanghai productions and then by Bai Yan (白燕) in postwar Hong Kong.

Chinese audiences also saw the original American Charlie Chan films. They were by far the most popular American films in 1930s China and among Chinese expatriates; &quot;one of the reasons for this acceptance was that this was the first time Chinese audiences saw a positive Chinese character in an American film, a departure from the sinister East Asian stereotypes in earlier movies like &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot; (1924) and Harold Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Danger&quot; (1929), which incited riots that shut down the Shanghai theater showing it.&quot; Oland&#x27;s visit to China was reported extensively in Chinese newspapers, and the actor was respectfully called &quot;Mr. Chan&quot;.

==== Modern adaptations ====
In Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Murder by Death&quot;, Peter Sellers plays a Chinese detective called Sidney Wang, a parody of Chan.

In 1980, Jerry Sherlock began production on a comedy film to be called &quot;Charlie Chan and the Dragon Lady&quot;. A group calling itself C.A.N. (Coalition of Asians to Nix) was formed, protesting the fact that non-Chinese actors, Peter Ustinov and Angie Dickinson, had been cast in the primary roles. Others protested that the film script contained a number of stereotypes; Sherlock responded that the film was not a documentary. The film was released the following year as &quot;Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen&quot; and was an &quot;abysmal failure&quot;. An updated film version of the character was planned in the 1990s by Miramax. While this Charlie Chan was to be &quot;hip, slim, cerebral, sexy and... a martial-arts master,&quot; and portrayed by actor Russell Wong, nonetheless the film did not come to fruition. Actress Lucy Liu was slated to star in and executive-produce a new Charlie Chan film for Fox. The film was in preproduction by 2000; as of 2009, it was slated to be produced, but it also did not come to fruition.

===Radio===

On radio, Charlie Chan was heard in several different series on three networks (the NBC Blue Network, Mutual, and ABC) between 1932 and 1948 for the 20th Century Fox Radio Service. Walter Connolly initially portrayed Chan on Esso Oil&#x27;s &quot;Five Star Theater&quot;, which serialized adaptations of Biggers novels. Ed Begley, Sr. had the title role in N.B.C.&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Charlie Chan&quot; (1944–45), followed by Santos Ortega (1947–48). Leon Janney and Rodney Jacobs were heard as Lee Chan, Number One Son, and Dorian St. George was the announcer. &quot;Radio Life&quot; magazine described Begley&#x27;s Chan as &quot;a good radio match for Sidney Toler&#x27;s beloved film enactment.&quot;

=== Stage ===
Valentine Davies wrote a stage adaptation of novel &quot;Keeper of the Keys&quot; for Broadway in 1933, with William Harrigan as the lead. The production ran for 25 performances.

=== Television adaptations ===
* In 1956–57, &quot;The New Adventures of Charlie Chan&quot;, starring J. Carrol Naish in the title role, were made independently for TV syndication in 39 episodes, by Television Programs of America. The series was filmed in England. In this series, Chan is based in London rather than the United States. Ratings were poor, and the series was canceled.
* In the 1960s, Joey Forman played an obvious parody of Chan named &quot;Harry Hoo&quot; in two episodes of &quot;Get Smart&quot;.
* In the 1970s, Hanna-Barbera produced an animated series called &quot;The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan&quot;. Keye Luke, who had played Chan&#x27;s son Lee in many Chan films of the 1930s and late &#x27;40s, lent his voice to Charlie, employing a much-expanded vocabulary; Luke thus became the first actual Chinese person to portray Chan on screen. (The title character bears some resemblance to the Warner Oland depiction of Charlie Chan.) The series focused on Chan&#x27;s children, played initially by East Asian-American child actors before being recast, due to concerns that younger viewers would not understand the accented voices. Leslie Kumamota voiced Chan&#x27;s daughter Anne, before being replaced by Jodie Foster.
* &quot;The Return of Charlie Chan&quot;, a television film starring Ross Martin as Chan, was made in 1971 but did not air until 1979.

== Comics and games ==
A &quot;Charlie Chan&quot; comic strip, drawn by Alfred Andriola, was distributed by the McNaught Syndicate beginning October 24, 1938. Andriola was chosen by Biggers to draw the character. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the strip was dropped; the last strip ran on May 30, 1942. In 2019, The Library of American Comics reprinted one year of the strip (1938) in their &quot;LoAC Essentials&quot; line of books ().

Over decades, other Charlie Chan comic books have been published: Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created Prize Comics&#x27; &quot;Charlie Chan&quot; (1948), which ran for five issues. It was followed by a Charlton Comics title which continued the numbering (four issues, 1955). DC Comics published &quot;The New Adventures of Charlie Chan&quot;, a 1958 tie-in with the TV series; the DC series lasted for six issues. Dell Comics did the title for two issues in 1965. In the 1970s, Gold Key Comics published a short-lived series of Chan comics based on the Hanna-Barbera animated series. In March through August 1989 Eternity Comics/Malibu Graphics published &quot;Charlie Chan&quot; comic books numbers 1 - 6 reprinting daily strips from January 9, 1939 to November 18, 1939.

In addition, a board game, &quot;The Great Charlie Chan Detective Mystery Game&quot; (1937), and a &quot;Charlie Chan Card Game&quot; (1939), have been released.

== Modern interpretations and criticism ==

The character of Charlie Chan has been the subject of controversy. Some find the character to be a positive role model, while others argue that Chan is an offensive stereotype. Critic John Soister argues that Charlie Chan is both; when Biggers created the character, he offered a unique alternative to stereotypical evil Chinamen, a man who was at the same time &quot;sufficiently accommodating in personality... unthreatening in demeanor... and removed from his Asian homeland... to quell any underlying xenophobia.&quot;

Critic Michael Brodhead argues that &quot;Biggers&#x27;s sympathetic treatment of the Charlie Chan novels convinces the reader that the author consciously and forthrightly spoke out for the Chinese – a people to be not only accepted but admired. Biggers&#x27;s sympathetic treatment of the Chinese reflected and contributed to the greater acceptance of Chinese-Americans in the first third of [the twentieth] century.&quot; S. T. Karnick writes in the &quot;National Review&quot; that Chan is &quot;a brilliant detective with understandably limited facility in the English language [whose] powers of observation, logic, and personal rectitude and humility made him an exemplary, entirely honorable character.&quot; Ellery Queen called Biggers&#x27;s characterization of Charlie Chan &quot;a service to humanity and to inter-racial relations.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Chan &quot;might have been a stereotype, but he was a stereotype on the side of the angels.&quot; Keye Luke, an actor who played Chan&#x27;s son in a number of films, agreed; when asked if he thought that the character was demeaning to the race, he responded, &quot;Demeaning to the race? My God! You&#x27;ve got a &quot;Chinese hero!&quot;&quot; and &quot;[W]e were making the best damn murder mysteries in Hollywood.&quot;

Other critics, such as sociologist Yen Le Espiritu and Huang Guiyou, argue that Chan, while portrayed positively in some ways, is not on a par with white characters, but a &quot;benevolent Other&quot; who is &quot;one-dimensional&quot;. The films&#x27; use of white actors to portray East Asian characters indicates the character&#x27;s &quot;absolute Oriental Otherness;&quot; the films were only successful as &quot;the domain of white actors who impersonated heavily-accented masters of murder mysteries as well as purveyors of cryptic proverbs. Chan&#x27;s character &quot;embodies the stereotypes of Chinese Americans, particularly of males: smart, subservient, effeminate.&quot; Chan is representative of a model minority, the good stereotype that counters a bad stereotype: &quot;Each stereotypical image is filled with contradictions: the bloodthirsty Indian is tempered with the image of the noble savage; the &quot;bandido&quot; exists along with the loyal sidekick; and Fu Manchu is offset by Charlie Chan.&quot; However, Fu Manchu&#x27;s evil qualities are presented as inherently Chinese, while Charlie Chan&#x27;s good qualities are exceptional; &quot;Fu represents his race; his counterpart stands away from the other Asian Hawaiians.&quot;

Some argue that the character&#x27;s popularity is dependent on its contrast with stereotypes of the Yellow Peril or Japanese people in particular. American opinion of China and Chinese Americans grew more positive in the 1920s and &#x27;30s in contrast to the Japanese, who were increasingly viewed with suspicion. Sheng-mei Ma argues that the character is a psychological over-compensation to &quot;rampant paranoia over the racial other.&quot;

In June 2003, the Fox Movie Channel cancelled a planned Charlie Chan Festival, soon after beginning restoration for cablecasting, after a special-interest group protested. Fox reversed its decision two months later, and on 13 September 2003, the first film in the festival was aired on Fox. The films, when broadcast on the Fox Movie Channel, were followed by round-table discussions by prominent East Asians in the American entertainment industry, led by George Takei, most of whom were against the films. Collections such as Frank Chin&#x27;s &quot;Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers&quot; and Jessica Hagedorn&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Chan Is Dead&quot; are put forth as alternatives to the Charlie Chan stereotype and &quot;[articulate] cultural anger and exclusion as their animating force.&quot; Fox has released all of its extant Charlie Chan features on DVD, and Warner Bros. (the current proprietor of the Monogram library) has issued all of the Sidney Toler and Roland Winters Monogram features on DVD.

Modern critics, particularly Asian Americans, continue to have mixed feelings on Charlie Chan. Fletcher Chan, a defender of the works, argues that the Chan of Biggers&#x27;s novels is not subservient to white characters, citing &quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot; as an example; in this novel, Chan&#x27;s eyes blaze with anger at racist remarks and in the end, after exposing the murderer, Chan remarks &quot;Perhaps listening to a &#x27;Chinaman&#x27; is no disgrace.&quot; In the films, both &quot;Charlie Chan in London&quot; (1934) and &quot;Charlie Chan in Paris&quot; (1935) &quot;contain scenes in which Chan coolly and wittily dispatches other characters&#x27; racist remarks.&quot; Yunte Huang manifests an ambivalent attitude, stating that in the US, Chan &quot;epitomizes the racist heritage and the creative genius of this nation&#x27;s culture.&quot; Huang also suggests that critics of Charlie Chan may have themselves, at times, &quot;caricatured&quot; Chan himself.

Chan&#x27;s character has also come under fire for &quot;nuggets of fortune cookie Confucius&quot; and the &quot;counterfeit proverbs&quot; which became so widespread in popular culture. The Biggers novels did not introduce the &quot;Confucius say&quot; proverbs, which were added in the films, but one novel features Chan remarking: &quot;As all those who know me have learned to their distress, Chinese have proverbs to fit every possible situation.&quot; Huang Yunte gives as examples &quot;Tongue often hang man quicker than rope,&quot; &quot;Mind, like parachute, only function when open,&quot; and &quot;Man who flirt with dynamite sometime fly with angels.&quot; He argues, however, that these &quot;colorful aphorisms&quot; display &quot;amazing linguistic acrobatic skills.&quot; Like the &quot;signifying monkey&quot; of African American folklore, Huang continues, Chan &quot;imparts as much insult as wisdom.&quot;

<text>Earl Derr Biggers (August 26, 1884 – April 5, 1933) was an American novelist and playwright. His novels featuring the fictional Chinese American detective Charlie Chan were adapted into popular films made in the United States and China.

==Biography==
The son of Robert J. and Emma E. (Derr) Biggers, Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren, Ohio, and graduated from Harvard University in 1907, where he was a member of &quot;The Lampoon&quot;. He worked briefly as a journalist for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in 1907, and then for the &quot;Boston Traveller&quot; until 1912, before turning to fiction. Many of his plays and novels were made into movies.

His first novel, &quot;Seven Keys to Baldpate&quot;, was published in 1913, and George M. Cohan quickly adapted the novel as a hit Broadway stage play of the same name. Cohan starred in the 1917 film version, one of seven film versions of the play, and a 1935 revival. The novel was also adapted into two films with different titles, &quot;House of the Long Shadows&quot; and &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, but they had essentially equivalent plots.

On the day that his first novel was accepted for publication, Biggers proposed to Eleanor Ladd, his girlfriend and fellow writer at the Boston Traveller, and they married in 1914; one year later, his son Robert was born.

A decade later, Biggers had even greater success with his series of Charlie Chan detective novels. The popularity of Charlie Chan extended even to China, where audiences in Shanghai appreciated the Hollywood films. Chinese companies made films starring this fictional character. Derr Biggers publicly acknowledged the real-life detective Chang Apana as the inspiration for the character of Charlie Chan in his letter to the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; of June 28, 1932. (The letter was published in the 11 September 1932 issue of the &quot;Advertiser.&quot;) 

Biggers lived in San Marino, California, and died in a Pasadena, California hospital after suffering a heart attack in Palm Springs, California. He was 48.

<text>The North Walsham and Dilham Canal is a waterway in the English county of Norfolk. It was authorised by Parliament in 1812, but work on the construction of a canal which ran parallel to a branch of the River Ant did not start until 1825. It included six locks, which were sized to accommodate wherries, and was officially opened in August 1826. It was long and ran from two bone mills at Antingham to a junction with the River Ant at Smallburgh. It carried offal for the bone mills and agricultural products, as it proved cheaper to land coal on the beach at Mundesley and cart it overland than to use the canal.

The venture was not a commercial success, and it was sold to various millers, who owned watermills along its length. The section above Swafield locks was abandoned in 1893, and from 1922 it was owned by the North Walsham Canal Company, set up by Edward Cubitt and George Walker, who were mill owners. The last commercial use of the canal was in 1934, and it avoided nationalisation in 1948. With the dawning of the leisure age, the canal was seen as an easy one to restore, but work to do so did not start until 2000, when the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) started to run working parties for volunteers. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed, and jointly run working parties with the EAWA. In 2009, part of the canal was sold to the Old Canal Company, who have worked to restore two locks and the pounds in between, in order to run Bacton Wood Mill as a watermill. Rewatering was interrupted by the Environment Agency issuing a stop notice in April 2012, but negotiations continue.

The canal served six mills, located along its banks, including the two bone mills at Antingham. There has been a mill at Bacton Wood since the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, and much of the present building dates from 1747. It was the home of Sir William Cubitt, who invented the self-regulating windmill sail and the prison treadmill. Since the millpond at Ebridge has been cleared and rewatered by volunteers, there has been a significant increase in the types of wildlife observed at the location. The area through which the canal flows is at risk of flooding, and this is mitigated by the actions of the Broads Internal Drainage Board, who manage drains and ditches in the upper regions, and have two pumping stations which pump water into the canal at its lower end.

==History==

The River Ant was navigable to Dilham prior to 1810, when consideration was given to extending navigation northwards along the course of the river. Plans were drawn up by William Youard and John Millington in 1811 and it was one of Millington&#x27;s two plan that formed the basis of a bill presented to Parliament in early 1812. It was opposed by the inhabitants of Worstead and Dilham, who feared that their businesses would collapse if boats could reach North Walsham, but the navigation was nevertheless authorised by an act of Parliament, the (52 Geo. 3. c. lxix), dated 5 May 1812, which created the Company of Proprietors of the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Navigation. They had powers to raise £30,000 by the issuing of shares, and a further £10,000 if required, either from shares or by mortgage. Work on the construction of the canal did not start until 1825, with some of the delays caused by a claim for damages made by Issac Harris Lewis, who owned his own staithe at Dilham and felt that the new canal would damage his trade. His case was heard in April 1825 and he was awarded £1,500 in compensation. Work began in the same month, employing 100 men from Bedfordshire.

The canal was designed by John Millington, who acted as engineer for the project, although the actual construction was carried out by Thomas Hughes, who had previously worked on the construction of the Caledonian Canal, the Dingwall Canal and the Union Canal, all in Scotland. Millington came from Hammersmith in London. The North Walsham and Dilham Canal was his only canal-building venture. Later in his career he went to the United States of America and wrote &quot;Elements of Civil Engineering&quot; which includes much information on canal building.

Although the line of the canal ran broadly parallel to a branch of the River Ant, it did not occupy the river bed, and so was technically a canal and not a river navigation. The route required six locks to raise the level by along its length. The locks were sized for wherries, which were . Vessels were able to reach Cubitt&#x27;s Mill by 14 June 1826 and the canal was formally opened on 29 August 1826. The water supply for the canal came from the ponds at Antingham, but the link into the ponds could only be used by small lighters, as it was not deep enough to be used by wherries. Consequently, they used a basin next to Antingham Mills. Tolls on all cargoes using the canal were collected at Tonnage Bridge, where there was once a wharf and a cottage.

===Operation===
The main use of the canal was to carry offal to the two Antingham Bone Mills, although other cargoes were carried such as manure, flour, grain, coal and farm produce. A profitable trade in coal did not develop, as the tolls were too high and it was cheaper for coal to be brought down the coast from the north east and landed on the beach near Bacton or Mundesley, from where it would reach North Walsham by cart. Later, the railways handled most of the coal traffic. Most of the vessels using the canal were wherries, which had a draught of and were capable of carrying between 18 and 20 tons. Some wherries were of a slip-keel design, where the keel of a loaded boat could be unbolted from the bottom of the vessel while it was afloat, in order to negotiate the shallow waters of the canal. Once unloaded, the keel would be replaced, to allow more sail to be used. While detached, the keels were towed behind the boat, to prevent them from drying out and warping. A smaller 12-ton wherry regularly carried vegetables between Antingham and Great Yarmouth and was known as the cabbage wherry.

===Decline===
The canal was not a financial success, and in 1866 the company obtained an act of Parliament, the (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxxi) that would allow them to sell the canal providing three-quarters of the shareholders agreed. In 1885, they decided to use this power, as Edward Press, the owner of Bacton Wood mill, and a trader with a fleet of wherries, wished to purchase it. The sale was completed on 16 March 1886, on the understanding that the £600 price would be distributed to the shareholders. Holders of 446 of the original 586 shares were traced, but after paying money on 55 shares, James Turner, the London solicitor handling the sale, absconded with the rest of the fund. The proprietors felt morally bound to refund the money themselves, but did not do so immediately, as none of the shareholders made a claim. Eventually in 1896, five of them, including Press who had bought the canal, contributed £110 17s 7d (£110.88) to a fund which was distributed as a dividend to those who had not been paid.

In 1887, Walter Rye was appointed as the clerk and noticed a number of irregularities in the way the company ran. Edward Press was the general manager, although he was disqualified from the post as he profited from the canal, and there was no treasurer, despite the fact that the enabling act required one to be appointed. There was also no way to wind up the company. Rye&#x27;s concerns were ignored, as nothing changed, and Press continued to run the canal. In 1893, the upper from Swafield lock to Antingham were abandoned, but traffic figures for 1898 show that 6,386 tons arrived at wharves on the canal, 5,000 tons were loaded for shipping, and 400 tons were carried within the confines of the canal. Trade declined steadily but Press was an early advocate of canal tourism. He published an advert in the 1888 volume, &quot;Handbook of the Rivers and Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk&quot;, which described the various wherries which could be hired. The boats came with two crew members, and contained a ladies cabin and a gentlemen&#x27;s cabin, which could also be used as a day saloon. Press died on 2 July 1906, and a director of the General Estates Company called Mr Percy bought the canal at an auction held on 11 September 1907, for £2,550.

Heavy flooding in August 1912 washed away several staithes, and resulted in a breach of the canal bank above Bacton Wood Lock. The canal was bought by the mill owners Edward Cubitt and George Walker in 1921, who expected that a new drainage board was to be created, which would take over the running of the canal. This did not occur, however, and so the two millers set up the North Walsham Canal Co Ltd, which bought the canal in January 1922 for the £1,500 they had paid. Cubitt and Walker dredged the canal from Wayford Bridge up to Bacton Wood in 1927, but at the same time dewatered the upper section above Swafield Lock. Decline continued and the wherry &quot;Ella&quot; made the final trading journey on the canal from Bacton Staithe in 1934. Because the canal was moribund, it was not nationalized in 1948 when most other British canals were, and continued to belong to the North Walsham Canal Company. The company sold around of the dry canal bed above Swafield Locks in 1948, and it reverted to farmland. In order to protect the water supply to Ebridge mill, which was still water powered, the Ebridge to Bacton Wood section was dredged in 1957. Three years later, a culvert near Royston bridge became blocked. Rather than repair it, the culvert was demolished, and the water from the canal was diverted, to rejoin the waterway below Bacton Wood lock.

==Restoration==

Robert Aickman and Teddy Edwards from the newly formed Inland Waterways Association visited the canal in 1953. In 1972, David Hutchings, who led the restoration of the Stratford Canal, stated that the North Walsham and Dilham should be one of the easiest to restore, since none of the locks had been demolished, and none of the bridges had been lowered. However, no immediate action was taken, and the channel gradually silted up. Tonnage Bridge collapsed in 1980, and a local landowner wanted to rebuild it. The newly formed Broads Authority was supportive, and in order to allow the work to proceed, the landowner bought the of canal below Honing Lock in October 1981. The purchase price was £2,050, and the bridge was rebuilt in traditional style, partly funded by a grant from the Broads Authority.

In 1993, the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) decided to step up its efforts to get the waterway restored, and an engineering study of the locks and channel restoration was carried out, which found the concept to be feasible. They then commissioned and paid for a full environmental study, and North Norfolk District Council voiced their support in October 1999, although they did not envisage powered boats using the waterway. The EAWA organised working parties for volunteers from December 2000, and worked on clearing vegetation and repairs at Briggate, Bacton Wood and Honing. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed. The aims of the Trust are to &quot;protect, conserve and improve the route of the canal and its branches for the benefit of the community and the environment.&quot; It does this by working with the owners of the canal, local land owners, the East Anglian Waterways Association, local authorities and other interested parties. Since its formation, working parties have been joint ventures between the Trust and the EAWA.

Some of the route, consisting of the pound above Bacton Wood lock, the lock itself, the pound below it and Ebridge Lock, were sold to the Old Canal Company in 2009, following lengthy negotiations lasting some nine years. The aim of the owner, Laurence Ashton, was to rewater the section, which would in turn allow him to run Bacton Wood mill as a water mill. Having carried out extensive repair work at Ebridge Lock, a stop notice was issued by the Environment Agency in April 2012, and in November a public enquiry upheld the position. Ashton and his Old Canal Company have since restored Bacton Wood lock, with help from volunteers, and the top gates have been fitted, complete with metal balance beams salvaged from the old gates, and refurbished paddle gear. Bacton Mill quay has also been restored. At Royston Bridge, another quay has been restored. This bridge is the only one that has been lowered, and the canal has been culverted. This was done when heavy vehicles needed to reach Bacton Gas Terminal, but the gas is now piped and works traffic is reduced, so reinstatement of the bridge is possible. There is water in the channel up to the first of the Swafield locks, and Michael Starling, who owns this section, is also carrying out restoration work with a view to boats reaching Swafield.

The canal is only navigable by powered boats for the first from the Smallburgh end, up to Honing lock. However, the dredger &quot;Weasel&quot;, which was formerly owned by British Waterways, was bought by the Old Canal Company in 2010 and has dredged large sections of their canal.

The residents of North Walsham made ten mosaics for the Millennium celebrations, one of which shows a Norfolk wherry.

Most canal restoration schemes work by restoring the canal to navigation stage by stage, repairing the locks and bridges as they go. In 2023 however, the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust produced a new light craft vision to outline their proposals for further restoration. This involves returning the entire canal to unpowered craft status, with facilities to allow porterage where locks or other obstacles have yet to be restored. North Norfolk Council were sufficiently impressed by the vision that they agreed to fund three-quarters of the cost, and made a grant of £43,500, with the rest of the cost provided by the Trust. They obtained pontoons to help with weed clearance and to provide platforms for porterage in late 2023, and are initially concentrating on the section from the start of the navigation to Honing Lock, together with the section from Ebridge Lock to Bacton Wood Mill.

==Watermills==
The canal served six watermills during its working life. At its northern end were two bone mills at Antingham. Antingham Upper Mill was situated at the southern end of Antingham Ponds, and was a small mill attached to a cottage. There was a small channel connecting it to the Lower Mill, and several boats were used to carry goods between the mills.

The Lower Mill was built in 1834 by Edward Harbord, 3rd Baron Suffield, whose estate adjoined the new canal and who had had a staithe built on the canal in 1829. It is probable that Harbord was a shareholder in the canal project, as he had made extension of the canal to Antingham a condition of his support to encourage economic development in the area. Bones for grinding into fertiliser were delivered by wherry to a staithe which was long and wide. The staithe was midway between the two mills. After the coming of the railways, bones were also delivered to North Walsham railway station. The ground product was sold to Fisons for use in fertilisers. Although the canal was not used after 1893, the mill continued in use until the 1920s, and the buildings were demolished after the Second World War. The Lower Mill was much larger, and was built after the canal opened. It had two storeys and was long. The channel between the two mills was filled in around 1905, and the mill was not powered by water after that time. It was then powered by a Crossley gas engine, which used anthracite and coke, some of which was made from coal on the site. Milling ceased in 1935 or 1936, and the mill was demolished in 1958.

Swafield Mill was a three-storey building, with a brick base, weatherboarding on the middle storey, and the upper storey built into the pantiled roof. Water was taken from the River Ant, and was used to drive two sets of stones and two flour mills in 1831. By 1967, only the brick base remained, as the mill pond had been filled in. However, the mill house, which was constructed in the mid-eighteenth century, remains and is grade II listed. It is built of brick with three storeys and three bays, with a roof of black glazed pantiles.
There has been a mill at Bacton Wood since the Domesday Book was produced in 1086. The present building was reconstructed in 1747, and extensively modified in 1825, in anticipation of the canal opening, and the increase in trade that that might bring. It was made of white rendered brick, with a roof of slates, although the adjoining mill house had a pantiled roof, but was subsequently reroofed in slate. The cast iron waterwheel was in diameter and wide, providing enough power to turn three sets of stones. The water supply was not always adequate in the summer, and a Dodman steam plant was installed in the late nineteenth century. Its boiler exploded around 1910, and an hot bulb engine manufactured by Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons replaced it. The mill was last used commercially in 1944, by which time it was powered by a diesel engine. It was sold for conversion to a house in 1967. The Hornsby engine was sold to enthusiasts when the mill was restored in 1984, and the mill was bought by Laurence Ashton in 1994, who is hoping to run it using water power once his Old Canal Company has rewatered the canal. There are four sets of stones on the milling floor. Sir William Cubitt, who invented the self-regulating windmill sail in 1807 and the prison treadmill in 1818, lived in the mill house during his childhood.

The earliest records of a mill at Ebridge date to 1537, when it was let by the Bishop of Norwich to William Hogan. The present mill was built of red brick with a slate roof, and has five storeys. It was bought by Cubitt and Walker in 1869, and was run by Cubitt and Walker Ltd until 1998. It was powered by an oil engine and by water in 1937. Most of the original machinery was dismantled in 1966, when a new provender mill was built alongside the brick building, and it was powered by electricity in 1968. The waterwheel was removed in 1972. The mill was sold to W L Duffield and Son in 1998, who moved the business to Saxlingham Thorpe, and closed Ebridge Mill. After years of negotiation, work began on converting the mill into homes in January 2015. The end of the mill building, which was covered with asbestos sheets, and the grain store, which was added to the end of the mill in the 1950s, were demolished. The granary building is being converted into three homes, and the mill building into another three, which will retain many of the original features. The restoration includes refurbishment of the mill race.

Briggate Mill is sometimes known as Worstead Mill, since it is in Worstead. It had a brick base, with two timber-framed weatherboarded storeys above, but was re-clad in corrugated iron when the weatherboarding deteriorated. The waterwheel was in diameter and wide, and was configured as a breastshot wheel. A steam roller mill was added in 1890, and the mill was subsequently converted to use electric power. The waterwheel had been removed by 1955, and the mill ceased to be used commercially in 1969, when Cubitt and Walker moved the business to Ebridge Mill. After being sold, the buildings were destroyed by fire on 7 August 1975, in what proved to be an attempt to defraud an insurance company. After a trial lasting 83 days, four men were sent to jail for the crime. Ownership of the mill pond, which lies on the opposite side of the road to the mill site and dried up in the 1970s, is uncertain. The residents of Briggate tried to get the land around the mill registered as a village green, but a public enquiry in 2010 ruled against this. Residents assisted the EAWA and Trust working parties to clear part of the mill pond, which was rewatered in 2011. It is expected to become a haven for wildlife.

==Water management==
The canal is defined as a main river, which gives the Environment Agency powers to carry out flood defence works on it. The corridor through which the canal runs is susceptible to flooding, and there is a network of drains to mitigate this risk, which have been maintained by the Broads Internal Drainage Board (IDB) since 2006. Prior to that, they were managed by the Smallburgh Internal Drainage Board, constituted under the Land Drainage Act 1930. Five IDBs, including the Smallburgh IDB, merged to form the Broads IDB in 2005, and the following year merged with two boards responsible for the lower Yare.

Flood risk in the upper end of the canal corridor is managed by drains feeding into the canal by gravity. In the lower reaches, around Tonnage Bridge and Wayford Bridge, there is no gradient for the water to flow into the canal, and so water is pumped from the drains by pumping stations. The Broads IDB maintain two pumping stations on the lower canal. Tonnage Bridge East Ruston Pump is located on the east bank of the canal, just below Tonnage Bridge, while Wayford Bridge Pump is on the south bank of Tylers Cut, just to the west of the junction with the main canal.

==Route==

At its southern end, the canal starts at Wayford Bridge, which carries the A149 road. It heads north-westwards, and soon reaches the junction with Dilham Dyke, which heads west. On the southern bank is the tower of Dilham Dyke drainage mill and the modern pumping station. Private dykes continue to the west, and Tylers Cut turns to the north west to reach moorings at Dilham Staithe and the Broadlands Arts Centre. Public navigation stops at Brickworks Bridge, but there is a short private dyke beyond. Returning to the junction, the canal heads north to reach Tonnage Bridge. There has been no towpath thus far, but a public footpath follows the left bank as the canal sweeps round to the west, passing the former branch to East Ruston, and then turns north west to reach the derelict Honing Lock.

From the head of the lock, a footpath leads to the Weavers Way, a long-distance footpath which follows the course of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway at this point. Near the grade II listed railway bridge, constructed in 1881 of steel and brick, a footpath has been constructed around Honing Staithe, which has been cleared and rewatered. The path was formally opened by Norman Lamb, Member of Parliament (MP) for North Norfolk on 28 September 2008. Continuing to the west and then the north west, the canal reaches Briggate Lock, which can be viewed from Briggate Bridge. The mill is to the south of the bridge, while the mill pond and lock are to the north. A little further north, the railway crossed the canal. The brick piers are still there, but the bridge has been replaced by a wooden footbridge, which carries the Weavers Way.

The canal continues broadly northwards to reach Ebridge lock and mill, passing the former dyke to the hamlet of Meeting House Hill on its western bank. Although there was no public access to this stretch in 2014, there are plans for a footpath between the two locks to be created. Above Ebridge lock, the mill pond has been dredged and the banks cleared, to create a large expanse of open water. Wildlife has benefitted, with sightings of water voles, Eurasian otters, reed warblers, dragonflies, kingfishers, wood sandpipers and a marsh harrier being recorded. A canalside footpath provides access to the water.

Continuing to the north west, the canal reaches Spa Common, to the east of North Walsham, where a narrow, humpbacked, grade II listed bridge carries Anchor Road over the waterway. The mill lies to the north of the bridge, awaiting a water supply. There is a footpath along the left bank of the channel most of the way to Royston Bridge, the only bridge to be culverted. To the north of the bridge is the Mike Thurston Water Activities Centre, where young people camp and learn water skills. There is a footpath along the route of the canal from the culvert to Pigneys Wood. The canal was then crossed by the railway from to . The piers remain, and a bowstring bridge carries pipes across the gap, but the footpath which follows the trackbed descends to the level of the canal and crosses it on a wooden footbridge. The route continues westwards, past the two Swafield locks, the lower one of which is still watered, and is crossed by another grade II listed bridge at Bradfield, before reaching the terminus, just below Antingham ponds.

<doc id="144873" wikidata="Q7825071" url="?curid=144873" title="Toponymy of England">
<text>The toponymy of England derives from a variety of linguistic origins. Many English toponyms have been corrupted and broken down over the years, due to language changes which have caused the original meanings to be lost. In some cases, words used in these place-names are derived from languages that are extinct, and of which there are no known definitions. Place-names may also be compounds composed of elements derived from two or more languages from different periods. The majority of the toponyms predate the radical changes in the English language triggered by the Norman Conquest, and some Celtic names even predate the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in the first millennium AD.

The place-names of England, as in most other regions, typically have meanings which were significant to the settlers of a locality (though these were not necessarily the first settlers). Sometimes these meanings have remained clear to speakers of modern English (for instance Newcastle and Sevenoaks); more often, however, elucidating them requires the study of older languages. As the names lost their original meanings either due to the introduction of a new language or linguistic drift, they gradually changed, or were appended with newer elements. An example is Breedon on the Hill in Leicestershire, whose name seems to have grown by the accretion of elements from three different languages at different times in its history, all emphasising the hill.

==Origins==

The place-names of England have diverse origins, largely due to historical changes in language and culture. These affected different regions at different times and to different extents. The exact nature of these linguistic/cultural changes is often controversial, but the general consensus is as follows.

The British Isles were inhabited during the Stone and Bronze Ages by peoples whose languages are unknown. During the Iron Age, the population of Great Britain shared a culture with the Celtic peoples inhabiting western Europe. Land use patterns do not appreciably change from the Bronze Age, suggesting that the population remained &quot;in situ&quot;. The evidence from this period, mainly in the form of place-names and personal names, makes it clear that a Celtic language, called Common Brittonic, was spoken across what came to be England by the Late Iron Age. At what point these languages spread to, or indeed developed in, the area is open to debate, with the majority of estimates falling at some point in the Bronze Age.

The principal substrate of British toponyms is thus Celtic in origin, and more specifically Brittonic (&#x27;British&#x27;), ancestral to modern Welsh and more distantly related to the Goidelic languages of Ireland and Scotland. The oldest place-names in England appear to be the names of rivers, many of which are interpreted as being Brittonic in origin. In the areas of England in which Brittonic languages were not replaced until relatively recently (Cumbria, Cornwall) many settlement names are still essentially Brittonic.

After the Roman conquest, many Latinate place-names appear, particularly associated with military settlements. Often, these were simply a Latinisation of existing names, including &quot;Verulamium&quot; for &quot;Verlamion&quot; (St Albans) and &quot;Derventio&quot; for &quot;Derwent&quot; (Malton). After the collapse of Roman Britain, few of these place-names survived. These settlements often continued to be inhabited so known by later names; many are marked as Roman strongholds by the suffix &quot;chester/cester/caster&quot; (an Old English borrowing from the Latin = camp), seldom drawing on the Roman/Romano-Celtic name. The influence of Latin on British place-names is thus generally only slight.

Following the end of the Roman Empire, several Germanic tribes living along the north sea coast began to migrate to Britain, variously displacing, intermarrying with, or ruling over local populations. The language of these settlers (which would become Old English) came to be spoken over much of lowland Britain. Due to this replacement of tongue and population growth, most settlement names in modern England are discernibly Old English in origin. A large proportion of them contain personal names from the settlers and their descendants.

Some English place-names commemorate non-Christian religions, referring instead to the old Germanic religion: see List of non-Christian religious place-names in Britain.

A few centuries later, around AD 850–1050, the north and east of England were settled by Danish and Norwegian &#x27;Vikings&#x27;. Many toponyms in these areas are thus of Old Norse origin. Since Old Norse had many similarities to Old English, there are also many hybrid English/Norse place-names in the Danelaw, the part of England that was under Danish rule for a time. Norse toponyms also frequently contain personal names, suggesting that they were named for a local chieftain.

After the Norman invasion of England in 1066, some Norman French influences can be detected in place-names, notably the simplification of to in &quot;Cerne&quot; and &quot;-cester&quot;, and suffixes of names of feudal lords as in Stoke Mandeville, or Church/Kirk/Bishop(s) (prefixed) or Episcopi/Abbot(t)s (rarely prefixed) in many cases of belonging to the church. The toponymy of England has remained relatively stable since the early Norman period, though the names have been generally simplified, harmonised to modern sounds and &#x27;weathered&#x27; to modern forms.

==Languages==
Many languages have shaped and informed the nomenclature of England: various Celtic languages (including Brythonic, Goidelic (Old Irish), Welsh and Cornish (in the South West), Latin, Anglo-Saxon, Old Norse, Norman French and others.

===Pre-Celtic===
As the first written records of travellers to Britain date to the end of the first millennium BC, the languages of Britain prior to the arrival of Celtic-speakers are unknown. It is certain that some form of pre-Indo-European &#x27;Old European&#x27; language, or more probably, languages, were spoken on the island prior to the arrival of people peoples speaking Indo-European languages in Europe. These languages have left no record, and so identifying their possible traces in British toponymy is described by Richard Coates as &quot;looking for needles in a haystack even though we are unsure exactly what needles look like and suspect that the haystack contains a few things which look a bit like what needles might look like.&quot;

Theo Vennemann suggests that, prior to the arrival of Indo-European languages, Europeans may have spoken languages related to Basque and the Afroasiatic languages. Coates suggests that some British island and River names may derive from these languages, giving the English examples of Thanet, Scilly, Humber and Severn. There is also evidence that a pre-Celtic, but Indo-European, language provides the etymologies of various English rivers, as part of the theorised Old European hydronymy. Kitson suggests that the Derwents, the Thames, the Don and the Avons may all have a pre-Celtic origin.

===Celtic===

The main language spoken in Britain in the Iron Age is known as Common Brittonic, from which descend the modern languages of Cornish, Welsh and Breton. Cumbric, a now-extinct fourth descendant, was spoken in parts of northern England and lowland Scotland until the 11th century.

Brittonic place-names, or names with Brittonic elements, are extremely few in the south and east of England. Moving north and west, however, they increase substantially in frequency (for example, &quot;Crewkerne&quot; in Somerset and &quot;Morecambe&quot; in Lancashire). Cornish toponyms are overwhelmingly Celtic in origin. In Cumbria, Celtic place-names are mostly associated with natural features rather than settlements, such as the mountains &quot;Blencathra&quot; and &quot;Helvellyn&quot;.

===Latin===
Very few Roman names survived the end of Roman Britain in their original form, though many Roman settlements were reoccupied. These were generally renamed, although usually with the suffix &quot;caster&quot;/&quot;chester&quot;, from the Latin (camp). A number of Latin names survived through Celtic, such as &quot;Carlisle&quot; (cf. for ), &quot;Porthleven&quot; (compare with for &#x27;harbour&#x27;) and some associated with Christianity such as &quot;Eccles&quot; (compare with Latin from Greek , &#x27;church&#x27;). Several places contain the element &quot;street&quot;, derived from the Latin (paved road); these are generally on the course of a Roman road, e.g. &quot;Chester-le-Street&quot;, &quot;Stratton-on-the-Fosse.&quot; However, this word was almost certainly borrowed into the Germanic languages prior to the migration of the Anglo-Saxons into Britain, and it may have been used natively by Germanic-speaking settlers.

Other Latin elements in British place-names were adopted in the medieval period as affectations. This includes the use of and instead of the more usual &quot;Great/Little&quot;; e.g. &quot;Chew Magna&quot;, &quot;Linstead Magna&quot; and &quot;Linstead Parva&quot;. Some Latin elements are more recent still: &quot;Bognor Regis&quot;, for example, received its honorific suffix (meaning &#x27;of the King&#x27;) from George V after he convalesced there.

===English===
Old English was the West Germanic language brought to England and Southeastern Scotland by Germanic tribes such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. Old English is typically divided into the Northumbrian, Mercian, West Saxon and Kentish dialects. The language evolved into Middle English, which was used from about 100 years after the Norman Conquest until the end of the Middle Ages. Modern English is derived directly from Middle English. 

The overwhelming majority of place-names in England are of Old English origin, particularly in the southeast. Many derive from the name of a particular Anglo-Saxon settler.
These suffixes are sometimes combined, as in &quot;Birmingham&quot; and &quot;Southampton&quot;.

===Scandinavian languages===
Old Norse, a North Germanic language from which both Danish and Norwegian are derived, was spoken by the Scandinavian settlers who occupied many places in the north of the British Isles during the Viking era and the splitting of England by the establishment of the Danelaw. In England, the Danes generally settled in East Anglia, East Midlands (Five Boroughs of the Danelaw, Danish Mercia) and Yorkshire (Jorvik), whilst the Norwegians settled in the northwest. The regional distribution of Norse-derived toponyms reflect these settlement patterns.

Although the languages of the Danes and Norwegians were very similar, differences between the two can be found in place-names. For instance &quot;-by&quot; and &quot;torp&quot; are much more common in place-names of Denmark whilst &quot;toft/taft&quot; and &quot;bister/ster/bost&quot; are more common in names of Norway; all these elements essentially mean &#x27;settlement/dwelling&#x27;.

===Norman French===
Due to the Norman conquest, some place-names gained an additive, mainly a suffix, giving the names of their new owners: for example Grays Thurrock which is the rare prefix version and typical Stoke Mandeville; Stanton Lacy; Newport Pagnell. The influence often disambiguates place-names with Norman French conjunctions, such as Hartlepool (said Hart-le-pool), Chapel-en-le-Frith, Chester-le-Street. Further disambiguation occurred then and/or became the dominant form centuries later, such as Henley-in-Arden and Henley-on-Thames.

==Processes and patterns in British toponymy==
For a general list of toponymic processes, see Place name origins.

*Back-formation: the process whereby names are derived from one another in the opposite direction to that which would be expected; for example, a river with an obsolete/forgotten name being renamed after a town on its banks, even though the river existed before the town did. The river running through Rochdale became known as the &#x27;Roch&#x27; through this process. Cambridge, perhaps uniquely, illustrates both normal and back-formation. Originally &quot;Grontabricc&quot;, a bridge on the Granta, the name evolved through &quot;Cantebruge&quot; and then &quot;Cambrugge&quot;, from which the river was renamed Cam.
*Element order: In Germanic languages, and thus in Old English and Old Norse place-names, the substantive element is generally at the end of the name, preceded by its modifier(s); &#x27;Badecca&#x27;s water source&#x27; (Bakewell). In Celtic place-names, the order is usually the reverse, with the thing being described (hill, valley, farm etc.) as the first element: e.g. &quot;Tregonebris&quot; &#x27;settlement (of) Cunebris&#x27; and &quot;Aberdeen&quot; &#x27;mouth (of the) Dee&#x27;. An exception is &quot;Malvern&quot; &#x27;bald hill&#x27;.
*Translation: The general similarity of Old Norse and Old English meant that place-names in the Danelaw were often simply &#x27;Norsified&#x27;. For instance, Askrigg in Yorkshire, &#x27;ash ridge&#x27;; whilst the first element is indubitably the Norse (pronounced &quot;ask&quot;), &quot;ask-&quot; could easily represent a &quot;Norsification&quot; of the Old English element (pronounced &quot;ash&quot;). In this case both and mean the same: &#x27;ash&#x27; (tree).
*False analogy: Sometimes, however, the place-names were changed to match Norse pronunciation habits without reference to the original meaning. Thus Skipton should be &#x27;Shipton&#x27; (Old English &#x27;sheep farm&#x27;). However, since &quot;sh&quot; in Old English was usually cognate with &quot;sk&quot; in Old Norse, the name became changed by false analogy to Skipton, in this way losing its meaning to the Norse speakers (since the Old Norse for sheep was entirely different from the Old English), as well as rendering it obscure or unrecognizable in English.

==Problems==

*Interpreting some names can be difficult if the reason for the name is no longer evident. Some names originally referred to a specific natural feature, such as a river, ford or hill, that can no longer be identified. For example, Whichford (Warwickshire) means &quot;the ford on (of) the Hwicce&quot;, but the location of the ford is lost.
*The elements (valley) and (hill) from Old English are sometimes confused now that their meanings are forgotten or obscure; for example Croydon is in a valley and Willesden is on a hill. Their expected spellings might therefore be &quot;Croyden&quot; and &quot;Willesdon&quot;.
*Another problematic element is &quot;-ey&quot;, as in Romsey. This commonly means &#x27;island&#x27;, from the Old English . However, &quot;-ey&quot; can also be derived from the Old English , meaning &#x27;enclosure&#x27;, as in Hornsey.
*The elements &quot;wich&quot; and &quot;wick&quot; can have a variety of meanings. Generally &quot;wich/wick/wyke&quot; indicates a farm or settlement (e.g. Keswick = &#x27;Cheese-farm&#x27;). However, some of the sites are of Roman, or shortly post-Roman origin, in which the &quot;wich&quot; is related to the Latin (&#x27;place&#x27;). These &quot;wics&quot; seem to have been trading posts. On the coast, &quot;wick&quot; is often of Norse origin, meaning &#x27;bay&#x27; or &#x27;inlet&#x27; (e.g. Lerwick).

==Toponymy by region==
Most English place-names are Old English. Personal names often appear within the place-names, presumably the names of landowners at the time of the naming. In the north and east, there are many place-names of Norse origin; similarly, these contain many personal names. In general, the Old English and Norse place-names tend to be rather mundane in origin, the most common types being [personal name + settlement/farm/place] or [type of farm + farm/settlement]; most names ending in &quot;wich&quot;, &quot;ton&quot;, &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;thorpe&quot;, &quot;stoke&quot;/&quot;stock&quot; are of these types.

In Cumbria, there remain a number of place-names from Cumbric, the former Brythonic language of this region, examples including Carlisle, Helvellyn and Blencathra.
Most old Roman settlements, whether actually inhabited or not, were given the title of &quot;chester/caster&quot; in Old English (from the Latin for &#x27;camp&#x27;); the specific names for each may only have little relation to the Roman names (e.g. modern Chester was actually called Deva by the Romans). Modern Winchester was , the &quot;Win-&quot; element deriving from &quot;Venta&quot; in a similar way to the names &quot;Caerwent&quot; and &quot;Gwent&quot; from &quot;Venta Silurum&quot; in south Wales.

In Cornwall, most place-names are Cornish in origin: e.g. &quot;Penzance&quot; (holy headland). In eastern Cornwall, the names show a stronger English influence. Place-names of Cornish origin are also found in the South Hams, North Devon and West Somerset. Brythonic but non-Cornish place-names, sometimes showing Cornish or Welsh influence, are found in North Somerset and parts of Dorset.

In Northern England, particularly Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, names record significant Scandinavian influence. For example, the names &quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;Greenhow&quot; (both in North Yorkshire) reflect the Old Norse word meaning a hill or mound.

<text>Erle Stanley Gardner (July 17, 1889 – March 11, 1970) was an American author and lawyer, best known for the Perry Mason series of legal detective stories. Gardner also wrote numerous other novels and shorter pieces as well as a series of nonfiction books, mostly narrations of his travels through Baja California and other regions in Mexico.

The best-selling American author of the 20th century at the time of his death, Gardner also published under numerous pseudonyms, including A. A. Fair, Carl Franklin Ruth, Carleton Kendrake, Charles M. Green, Charles J. Kenny, Edward Leaming, Grant Holiday, Kyle Corning, Les Tillray, Robert Parr, Stephen Caldwell, and once as the Perry Mason character [[Della Street]] (&quot;The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts&quot;). Three stories were published anonymously: &quot;A Fair Trial&quot;, &quot;Part Music and Part Tears&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Run Away from Yourself&quot;, also known as &quot;The Jazz Baby&quot;.

==Life and work==

Gardner was born in Malden, Massachusetts, the son of Grace Adelma (Waugh) and Charles Walter Gardner. Gardner graduated from Palo Alto High School in California in 1909 and enrolled at Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana. He was suspended after approximately one month when his interest in boxing became a distraction. He returned to California, pursued his legal education on his own, and passed the California State Bar examination in 1911.

Gardner started his legal career by working as a typist at a law firm in California for three years. Once he was admitted to the Bar, he started working as a trial lawyer by defending impoverished people, in particular Chinese and Mexican immigrants. This experience led to his founding the Court of Last Resort in the 1940s. The Court of Last Resort, dedicated to helping people who were imprisoned unfairly or couldn&#x27;t get a fair trial, was the first of several organizations that advocate for the wrongly convicted, which among others include The Innocence Project, Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, and Centurion.

In 1912, Gardner wed Natalie Frances Talbert. They had a daughter, Grace. He opened his first law office in Merced in 1917, but closed it after accepting a position at a sales agency. In 1921, he returned to law as a member of the Ventura firm Sheridan, Orr, Drapeau, and Gardner, where he remained until the publication of his first Perry Mason novel in 1933.

Gardner enjoyed litigation and the development of trial strategy but was otherwise bored by legal practice. In his spare time, he began writing for pulp magazines. His first story, &quot;The Police in the House&quot;, was published in June 1921 in &quot;Breezy&quot; magazine. He created many series characters for the pulps, including the ingenious Lester Leith, a parody of the &quot;gentleman thief&quot; in the tradition of A. J. Raffles; and Ken Corning, crusading lawyer, crime sleuth, and archetype for his most successful creation, Perry Mason. 

==Perry Mason==
The Perry Mason character was inspired by Earl Rogers, a trial attorney who appeared in 77 murder trials but lost only three. He was recognized for the extensive use of demonstratives, e.g., visuals, charts and diagrams, during trial before it became common practice. Rogers is famous for his defense of, and attorney-client disagreement with, Clarence Darrow, a fellow attorney who was charged with attempted jury bribery in 1912.

While the Perry Mason novels seldom delved deeply into characters&#x27; lives, the novels were rich in plot detail which was reality-based and drawn from his own experience. In his early years writing for the pulp magazine market, Gardner set himself a quota of 1,200,000 words a year. Early on, he typed stories himself, using two fingers, but later dictated them to a team of secretaries.

Much of the first Perry Mason novel,&quot;The Case of the Velvet Claws,&quot; published in 1933, is set at the historic Pierpont Inn near Gardner&#x27;s old law office in Ventura, California. In 1937, Gardner moved to Temecula, California, where he lived for the rest of his life. With the success of the &quot;Mason&quot; series, more than 80 novels, Gardner gradually reduced his contributions to the pulp magazines until the medium died in the 1950s. 

Warner Bros. produced a series of Perry Mason feature films in the 1930s, casting a succession of actors in the Mason role: Warren William in the first four, then Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods in one film each. Warners dropped the series in 1937 but Gardner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Case of the Dangerous Dowager&quot; went unfilmed until 1940: the movie version, &quot;Granny Get Your Gun&quot;, retained the Perry Mason plotline but the Mason character was removed from the film entirely.

The radio program &quot;Perry Mason&quot; ran from 1943 to 1955. In 1954, CBS proposed transforming &quot;Perry Mason&quot; into a TV soap opera. When Gardner opposed the idea, CBS created &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, featuring John Larkin—who voiced Mason on the radio show—as a thinly veiled imitation of the Mason character.

In 1957, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; became a long-running CBS-TV courtroom drama series, starring Raymond Burr in the title role. Burr had auditioned for the role of the district attorney Hamilton Burger, but asked to read for the Mason role. Burr&#x27;s performance as Mason was so intense and persuasive that Gardner, watching the screen test in a projection room, pointed at the screen and stated, &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s&quot; Perry Mason.&quot; Gardner made an uncredited appearance as a judge in &quot;The Case of the Final Fade-Out&quot; (1966), the last episode of the series.

==Gardner&#x27;s other works==
Beginning in 1937 with the novel &quot;The D. A. Calls It Murder&quot;, Gardner wrote a companion series reversing the format of the Mason books. The protagonist was the resolute district attorney Doug Selby, battling in court against devious attorney Alphonse Baker Carr. Prosecutor Selby is portrayed as a courageous and imaginative crime solver; his antagonist Carr is a wily shyster whose clients are invariably &quot;as guilty as hell.&quot;

In 1939, under the pen name A. A. Fair, Gardner launched a series of novels about the private detective firm Cool and Lam.

After World War II Gardner also published a few short stories for the &quot;glossies&quot; (magazines) such as &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Sports Afield&quot;, and &quot;Look&quot;, but most of his postwar magazine contributions were nonfiction articles on travel, Western history, and forensic science. Gardner&#x27;s readership was a broad and international one, including the English novelist Evelyn Waugh, who in 1949 called Gardner the best living American writer. He also created characters for various radio programs, including &quot;Christopher London&quot; (1950), starring Glenn Ford, and &quot;A Life in Your Hands&quot; (1949–1952).

==Personal interests and causes==
Gardner had a lifelong fascination with Baja California and wrote a series of nonfiction travel accounts describing his extensive explorations of the peninsula by boat, truck, airplane, and helicopter.

Gardner devoted thousands of hours to the Court of Last Resort, in collaboration with his many friends in the forensic, legal, and investigative communities. The project sought to review and, when appropriate, reverse miscarriages of justice against criminal defendants who had been convicted because of poor legal representation, abuse, misinterpretation of forensic evidence, or careless or malicious actions of police or prosecutors. The resulting 1952 book earned Gardner his only Edgar Award, in the Best Fact Crime category, and was later made into a TV series, &quot;The Court of Last Resort&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1912, Gardner wed Natalie Frances Talbert (July 16, 1885 – February 26, 1968). Their only child, Natalie Grace Gardner (January 25, 1913 — February 29, 2004), was born in Ventura, California. Gardner and his wife separated in the early 1930s, but did not divorce, and in fact their marriage lasted 56 years, until Natalie&#x27;s death in 1968. After that, Gardner married his secretary, Agnes &quot;Jean&quot; Bethell (née Walter; May 19, 1902 – December 5, 2002), the daughter of Ida Mary Elizabeth Walter (née Itrich; December 24, 1880 – March 3, 1961).

Through his daughter, Gardner had two grandchildren: Valerie Joan Naso (née McKittrick; August 19, 1941 – November 12, 2007) and Alan G. McKittrick.

Gardner&#x27;s widow died in 2002, aged 100, in San Diego. She was a member of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. She was survived by her brother, Norman Walter.

==Death==
Gardner died of cancer, diagnosed in the late 1960s, on March 11, 1970, at his ranch in Temecula. At the time of his death, he was the best-selling American writer of the 20th century. His death followed by five days that of William Hopper, who played private detective Paul Drake in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV series. Gardner was cremated and his ashes scattered over his beloved Baja California peninsula. The ranch, known as Rancho del Paisano at the time, was sold after his death, then resold in 2001 to the Pechanga tribe, renamed Great Oak Ranch, and eventually absorbed into the Pechanga reservation.

==Legacy==
The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds Gardner&#x27;s manuscripts, art collection, and personal effects. From 1972 to 2010, the Ransom Center featured a full-scale reproduction of Gardner&#x27;s study that displayed original furnishings, personal memorabilia, and artifacts. The space and a companion exhibition were dismantled, but a panoramic view of the study is available online.

In 2003, a new school in the Temecula Valley Unified School District was named Erle Stanley Gardner Middle School.

In December 2016, Hard Case Crime published &quot;The Knife Slipped&quot;, a Bertha Cool–Donald Lam mystery, which had been lost for 75 years. Written in 1939 as the second entry in the Cool and Lam series, the book was rejected at the time by Gardner&#x27;s publisher. Published for the first time in 2016 as a trade paperback and ebook, the work garnered respectful reviews. In 2017, Hard Case Crime followed the publication of &quot;The Knife Slipped&quot; with a reissued edition of &quot;Turn On the Heat&quot;, the book Gardner wrote to replace &quot;The Knife Slipped&quot;, and published a new edition of &quot;The Count of Nine&quot; in October 2018.

==Works==
==In popular culture==
An unspecified article that Gardner wrote for &quot;True&quot; magazine is referred to by William S. Burroughs in his 1959 novel, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.

Gardner&#x27;s name is well-known among avid crossword puzzle solvers, because his first name contains an unusual series of common letters, starting and ending with the most common letter of the English alphabet, and because few other famous people have that name. As of January 2012, he is noted for having the highest ratio (5.31) of mentions in the &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle to mentions in the rest of the newspaper among all other people since 1993.

In 2001, Huell Howser Productions, in association with KCET, Los Angeles, featured Gardner&#x27;s Temecula Rancho del Paisano in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot;. The 30-minute program is available as a VHS tape.

<text>Michael Hammer is a fictional character created by the American author Mickey Spillane. Hammer debuted in the 1947 book &quot;I, the Jury&quot;. Hammer is a no-holds-barred private investigator whose love for his secretary Velda is outweighed only by his willingness to kill a killer. Hammer&#x27;s best friend is Pat Chambers, Captain of NYPD Homicide. Hammer was a World War II army veteran who spent two years fighting jungle warfare in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II against Japan.

==Creation==

In 1942, when he was a comic book writer, Spillane created the private detective Mike Lancer published in &quot;Green Hornet Comics&quot; #10 (December, 1942) by Harvey Comics.

In 1946, Spillane worked with illustrator Mike Roy and Edwin Robbins to create the private-eye character Mike Danger for proposed comic-book or comic-strip publication. Unable to sell the project as a comic, he reworked the story as the novel &quot;I, the Jury&quot;, converting Mike Danger to Mike Hammer and supporting character Holly to Velda. &quot;Mike Hammer originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,&quot; Spillane said in a 1984 interview. Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane&#x27;s knowledge, as well as one featuring Mike Lancer (1942). These were published with other material in &quot;Byline: Mickey Spillane,&quot; edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen &amp; Landru publishers, 2004).

==Character==
While pulp detectives such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe are hard-boiled and cynical, Hammer is in many ways the archetypal &quot;hard man&quot;: brutally violent, and fueled by a genuine rage against violent crime that never afflicts Raymond Chandler&#x27;s or Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s heroes. In &quot;The Big Kill&quot;, Hammer describes himself to a bargirl as a misanthrope. Spillane admitted to pulp writer Carroll John Daly, generally regarded as the inventor of the hard-boiled private eye figure, that Hammer was also loosely modeled on Race Williams, Daly&#x27;s most frequently used detective character.

While other hardboiled heroes bend and manipulate the law, Hammer often views it as an impediment to justice, the one virtue he holds in absolute esteem. Hammer nevertheless has a strong respect for the majority of police, realizing they have a difficult job and their hands are frequently tied by the law when trying to stop criminals.

Hammer is also patriotic and anti-communist. The novels are peppered with remarks by Hammer supporting American troops in Korea, and in &quot;Survival...Zero&quot; Vietnam. In &quot;One Lonely Night&quot;, where Hammer attends a communist meeting in a park, his reaction to the speaker&#x27;s propaganda is a sarcastic &quot;Yeah.&quot;

So far as violence is concerned, the Hammer novels leave little to the imagination. Written in the first person, Hammer describes his violent encounters with relish. In all but a few novels, Hammer&#x27;s victims are often left vomiting after a blow to the stomach or groin.

Hammer is an ageless character. Spillane said of his character: &quot;See, heroes never die. John Wayne isn&#x27;t dead, Elvis isn&#x27;t dead. Otherwise you don&#x27;t have a hero. You can&#x27;t kill a hero. That&#x27;s why I never let him get older.&quot;

The &quot;Washington Times&quot; obituary of Spillane said of Hammer, &quot;In a manner similar to Clint Eastwood&#x27;s Dirty Harry, Hammer was a cynical loner contemptuous of the &#x27;tedious process&#x27; of the legal system, choosing instead to enforce the law on his own terms.&quot;

== In other media ==
Several films and radio and television series have been based on the books in the Hammer series. The actor most closely identified with the character has been Stacy Keach, who portrayed Hammer in a CBS television series, &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot;, which ran from 1984–1987 and had a syndicated revival in 1997–1998. (An earlier syndicated version, originally aired in 1957–1958, starred Darren McGavin as Hammer.) Spillane himself played Hammer in a 1963 motion picture adaptation of &quot;The Girl Hunters&quot;. Spillane himself favoured ex-Marine and former Newburgh, New York police officer Jack Stang, on whom he based the character, to play him. Stang appeared with Spillane in the 1954 film &quot;Ring of Fear&quot; and in the film adaptation of &quot;I, the Jury&quot;.

*&quot;I, the Jury&quot; (United Artists, 1953), filmed in 3-D starring Biff Elliot as Mike Hammer.
*&quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (United Artists, 1955), Robert Aldrich was the director, Ralph Meeker was cast as Hammer, while Maxine Cooper portrayed Hammer&#x27;s sexy secretary/companion Velda.

*&quot;The Girl Hunters&quot; (Colorama Features, 1963), Mickey Spillane was given the rare opportunity to portray his own creation in this film.

*&quot;I, the Jury&quot; (20th Century Fox, 1982), Armand Assante plays a brutal, energetic Hammer opposite Laurene Landon&#x27;s sexy, athletic Velda in this hard R-rated 80s adaptation written by Larry Cohen and directed by Richard T. Heffron. Considered by the majority of Spillane fans (including Spillane co-author Max Allan Collins) to be the most authentic adaptation of the &quot;psychotic&quot; early Hammer novels.

Mike Hammer&quot; and written by Spillane, Ed Robbins and Joe Gill, with art by Ed Robbins. Collections of the strip were published in the 1980s.

<text>Frank Morrison Spillane (; March 9, 1918July 17, 2006), better known as Mickey Spillane, was an American crime novelist, called the &quot;king of pulp fiction&quot;. His stories often feature his signature detective character, Mike Hammer. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. Spillane was also an occasional actor, once even playing Hammer himself in the 1965 film &quot;The Girl Hunters&quot;.

==Early life==
Frank Morrison Spillane was born March 9, 1918, in Brooklyn, New York, and primarily raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Spillane was the only child of his Irish bartender father, John Joseph Spillane, and his Scottish mother, Catherine Anne. During his late adolescence, his family returned to Brooklyn, where he graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1936. He started writing while in high school, briefly attended Fort Hays State College in Kansas and worked a variety of jobs, including summers as a lifeguard at Breezy Point, Queens, and a period as a trampoline artist for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.

During World War II, Spillane enlisted in the Army Air Corps, becoming a fighter pilot and a flight instructor.
He was first stationed at the air base in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married first wife Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. He also met two younger writers, Earle Basinsky and Charlie Wells, who would become his protégés; each published two hardboiled-noir novels in the Spillane style in the early 1950s.

==Career==
===Comic books===
Spillane claims that he started being published as an author of slicks where he was credited under house names, then went &quot;lower&quot; to the pulps, then went lower still as a writer for comic books. While working as a salesman in Gimbels department store basement in 1940, he met tie salesman Joe Gill, who later found a lifetime career in scripting for Charlton Comics. Gill told Spillane to meet his brother, Ray Gill, who wrote for Funnies Inc., an outfit that packaged comic books for different publishers.

Spillane soon began writing an eight-page story every day. He concocted adventures for major 1940s comic book characters, including Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman, and Captain America. In the early 1940s, working for Funnies, Inc., he wrote two-page text stories which were syndicated to various comic book publishers, including Timely Comics. At one point, Spillane estimated he wrote fifty of these &quot;short-short stories,&quot; which were intended to fulfill a postal regulation requiring comic books to have at least two pages of text to qualify for a second-class mailing permit.

While most comic books writers toiled anonymously, Spillane&#x27;s byline appeared on most of his prose &quot;filler&quot; stories. 26 stories were collected in &quot;Primal Spillane: Early Stories 1941–1942&quot; (Gryphon Books, 2003). A new, expanded edition of &quot;Primal Spillane&quot; was released by Bold Venture Press in 2018, the new volume contained an additional fifteen stories, including the previously unpublished &quot;A Turn of the Tide&quot;.

===Novels===

Spillane joined the United States Army Air Corps on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the mid-1940s he was stationed as a flight instructor in Greenwood, Mississippi, where he met and married Mary Ann Pearce in 1945. The couple wanted to buy a country house in the town of Newburgh, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, so Spillane decided to boost his bank account by writing a novel. He wrote &quot;I, the Jury&quot; in just 9 days. At the suggestion of Ray Gill, he sent it to E. P. Dutton.

With the combined total of the 1947 hardcover and the Signet paperback (December 1948), &quot;I, the Jury&quot; sold 6-1/2 million copies in the United States alone. &quot;I, the Jury&quot; introduced Spillane&#x27;s most famous character, hardboiled detective Mike Hammer. Although tame by some standards, his novels featured more sex than competing titles, and the violence was more overt than the usual detective story. Covers tended to feature scantily dressed women or women who appeared as if they were about to undress. In the beginning, Mike Hammer&#x27;s chief nemeses consisted of gangsters, but by the early &#x27;50s, this broadened to communists and deviants.

In December 1942 an early version of Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer character, called Mike Lancer, appeared in Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Green Hornet Comics&quot; #10. In 1946, Spillane submitted in a script for a detective-themed comic book. &quot;Mike Hammer originally started out to be a comic book. I was gonna have a Mike Danger comic book,&quot; Spillane said in a 1984 interview. Two Mike Danger comic-book stories were published in 1954 without Spillane&#x27;s knowledge. These were published with other material in &quot;Byline: Mickey Spillane,&quot; edited by Max Allan Collins and Lynn F. Myers, Jr. (Crippen &amp; Landru publishers, 2004).

The Mike Hammer series proved hugely successful during the 1950s and 1960s, but the books were excoriated by the literary establishment. Malcolm Cowley of &quot;The New Republic&quot; called Spillane &quot;a dangerous paranoid, , and &quot; and even his own editors sometimes found his novels distasteful. Spillane for his part was unmoved by critics, saying &quot;You can sell a lot more peanuts than caviar&quot; and &quot;The literary world is made of second rate writers writing about other second rate writers.&quot; Attractively low prices (25 cents for a paperback copy, later raised to 50 cents) helped sales, and the 1956 informative guide &quot;Sixty Years of Best Sellers&quot; found that the six novels Spillane had written up to that point were among the top ten best selling American fiction titles of all time.

The Signet paperbacks displayed dramatic front cover illustrations. Lou Kimmel created the cover paintings for &quot;My Gun Is Quick&quot;, &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot;, &quot;One Lonely Night&quot;, and &quot;The Long Wait&quot;. The cover art for &quot;Kiss Me, Deadly&quot; was by James Meese.

===Acting===

Spillane portrayed himself as a detective in &quot;Ring of Fear&quot; (1954), and rewrote the film without credit for John Wayne&#x27;s and Robert Fellows&#x27;s Wayne-Fellows Productions. The film was directed by screenwriter James Edward Grant. Several Hammer novels were made into movies, including &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955). In &quot;The Girl Hunters&quot; (1963) filmed in England, Spillane himself appeared as Hammer, one of the few occasions in film history in which an author of a popular literary hero has portrayed his own character. Spillane was scheduled to film &quot;The Snake&quot; as a follow-up, but the film was never made.

On October 25, 1956, Spillane appeared on &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, with interest on his Mike Hammer novels. In January 1974, he appeared with Jack Cassidy in the television series &quot;Columbo&quot; starring Peter Falk in the episode &quot;Publish or Perish&quot;. He portrayed a writer who is murdered. In 1995 and 1997, he appeared in the low budget films Mommy and its sequel, Mommy 2: Mommy&#x27;s Day.

In 1969, Spillane formed a production company with Robert Fellows who had produced &quot;The Girl Hunters&quot; to produce many of his books, but Fellows died soon after and only &quot;The Delta Factor&quot; was produced.

During the 1980s, he appeared in Miller Lite beer commercials. In the 1990s, Spillane licensed one of his characters to Tekno Comix for use in a science-fiction adventure series, &quot;Mike Danger&quot;. In his introduction to the series, Spillane said he had conceived of the character decades earlier but never used him.

==Reception==
Early reaction to Spillane&#x27;s work was generally hostile. Malcolm Cowley dismissed the Mike Hammer character as &quot;a homicidal paranoiac.&quot; John G. Cawelti called Spillane&#x27;s writing &quot;atrocious,&quot; and Julian Symons called Spillane&#x27;s work &quot;nauseating.&quot; By contrast, Ayn Rand publicly praised Spillane&#x27;s work at a time when critics were almost uniformly hostile. She considered him an underrated if uneven stylist and found congenial the black-and-white morality of the Hammer stories. However, Rand condemned the political views expressed by Spillane in his Tiger Mann novel &quot;Day of the Guns&quot;, describing the book&#x27;s cynical protagonist and his &quot;semi-governmental gang&quot; as being &quot;shocking and rationally indefensible&quot;, as Rand opposed the use of force unlimited by any framework of rights.

Spillane&#x27;s work was later praised by Max Allan Collins, William L. DeAndrea, and Robert L. Gale. DeAndrea argued that although Spillane&#x27;s characters were stereotypes, Spillane had a &quot;flair for fast-action writing,&quot; that his work broke new ground for American crime fiction, and that Spillane&#x27;s prose &quot;is lean and spare and authentically tough, something that writers like Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald never achieved.&quot;

German painter Markus Lüpertz claimed that Spillane&#x27;s writing influenced his own work, saying that Spillane ranks as one of the major poets of the 20th century. American comic book writer Frank Miller has mentioned Spillane as an influence for his own hardboiled style. Avant-Garde musician John Zorn composed a piece influenced by Spillane&#x27;s writing titled &quot;Spillane&quot;.

==Awards and accolades==
In 1983, Spillane received the lifetime achievement award from the Private Eye Writers of America. He also received an Edgar Allan Poe Grand Master Award in 1995.

==In popular culture==

Walt Kelly wrote two parodies of Hammer&#x27;s work which satirized his spare, disjointed style, overblown first-person narration, and teetering, barely controlled paranoia: &quot;The Bloody Drip&quot; and &quot;The Bloody Drip Writhes Again&quot;, both starring Albert the Alligator as the detective Meat Hamburg. They were published in the following &quot;Pogo&quot; collections:
* &quot;The Bloody Drip&quot; by Mucky Spleen (1953, Uncle Pogo&#x27;s So-So Stories)
* &quot;Gore Blimey: The Bloody Drip Writhes Again&quot; (1955, The Pogo Peek-a-Book)

Spillane was also parodied several times in &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;. The April 1959 issue carried a piece called &quot;If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy&quot; (the comic strip &quot;Nancy&quot;, by Ernie Bushmiller).
The television series &quot;MASH&quot; had an episode devoted to Mickey Spillane and his books.

In the 1955 film &quot;Marty&quot;, on a discussion about one of Mickey Spillane&#x27;s book, Leo says, &quot;That Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.&quot;

In the film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, Gny. Sgt. Hartman, after providing Pvt. Joker with his Marine Corps assignment as a military journalist, asks him, &quot;Do you think you&#x27;re Mickey Spillane? Do you think you are some kind of f**king writer?”

In 1987, New York avant-garde jazz musician John Zorn published &quot;Spillane&quot;, an album composed of three &quot;file-card pieces&quot;, as well as a work for voice, string quartet and turntables. Zorn wrote &quot;Spillane&quot; on a series of index cards, each containing an outline or instruction for the musicians that was intended to evoke scenes from one of Spillane&#x27;s novels.

==Personal life==
In 1945, Mickey met and married Mary Ann Pearce. They had four children, Caroline, Kathy, Michael, and Ward. Their marriage ended in 1962.

In November 1965, he married his second wife, nightclub singer Sherri Malinou. The marriage ended in divorce (and a lawsuit) in 1983.

Spillane shared his waterfront house in Murrells Inlet with his third wife, Jane Rogers Johnson, and her two daughters, Jennifer and Margaret Johnson. They married in October 1983.

In the 1960s, Spillane became a friend of the novelist Ayn Rand. Despite their apparent differences, Rand admired Spillane&#x27;s literary style, and Spillane became, as he described it, a &quot;fan&quot; of Rand&#x27;s work. Later in his life, Spillane became an active Jehovah&#x27;s Witness.

In 1989, Hurricane Hugo ravaged his Murrells Inlet house to such a degree it had to be almost entirely reconstructed. A television interview showed Spillane standing in the ruins of his house.

==Death and legacy==
Spillane died on July 17, 2006, at his home in Murrells Inlet, of pancreatic cancer. After his death, his friend and literary executor, Max Allan Collins, began editing and completing Spillane&#x27;s unpublished typescripts, beginning with a non-series novel, &quot;Dead Street&quot; (2007).

In July 2011, the community of Murrells Inlet named U.S. 17 Business the &quot;Mickey Spillane Waterfront 17 Highway&quot;. The proposal first passed the Georgetown County Council in 2006 while Spillane was still alive, but the South Carolina General Assembly rejected the plan.

<text>Glynis Margaret Payne Johns (5 October 1923 – 4 January 2024) was a British actress. In a career spanning eight decades on stage and screen, Johns appeared in more than 60 films and 30 plays. She received various accolades throughout her career, including a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award, as well as nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Laurence Olivier Award. She was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood and classical years of British cinema.

Johns was born in Pretoria, South Africa, the daughter of Welsh actor Mervyn Johns. She appeared on stage from a young age and was typecast as a stage dancer from early adolescence, making her screen debut in &quot;South Riding&quot; (1938). She rose to prominence in the 1940s following her role as Anna in the war drama film &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), for which she won a National Board of Review Award for Best Acting, and starring roles in &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948) and &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot; (1949). Following &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; (1951), a joint British-American production, Johns took on increasingly more roles in the United States and elsewhere. She made her television and Broadway debuts in 1952 and took on starring roles in such films as &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; (1953), &quot;The Weak and the Wicked&quot; (1954), &quot;Mad About Men&quot; (1954), &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1955), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;The Cabinet of Caligari&quot; (1962), &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; (1962), and &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1972). On television, she starred in her own sitcom &quot;Glynis&quot; (1963).

Renowned for the breathy quality of her husky voice, Johns sang songs written specifically for her both on screen and stage, most notably &quot;Sister Suffragette&quot;, written by the Sherman Brothers for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), in which she played Winifred Banks and for which she received a Laurel Award, and &quot;Send In the Clowns&quot;, composed by Stephen Sondheim for Broadway&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1973), in which she originated the role of Desiree Armfeldt and for which she received a Tony Award and Drama Desk Award.

==Early life and education==

Johns was born into a theatrical family. Her mother was Alyce Steele-Wareham, an Australian-born concert pianist who had studied in London and Vienna. Originally of English descent, Alyce&#x27;s family found fame as performing actors, singers and musicians, touring Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with their musical programmes; her grandmother, Elizabeth Steele-Payne, was one of the first accomplished women violinists of her time. Johns&#x27; father was Welsh actor Mervyn Johns, who became a star of British films during the Second World War and worked regularly at Ealing Studios. Through him, she was a cousin of British judge John Geoffrey Jones. Alyce and Mervyn met while studying in London, he at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and she at the Royal Academy of Music. They married on 17 November 1922 in St Giles, London, and began touring with her family&#x27;s theatre company. Glynis Margaret Payne Johns was born on 5 October 1923, while her parents were touring Pretoria, capital of the then Union of South Africa (a dominion of the British Empire and later the British Commonwealth of Nations). She was named &quot;Margaret&quot; &quot;Payne&quot; after her grandmothers Margaret Anne Samuel and Elizabeth Steele-Payne.

The family returned to England just a few months after she was born. Aged five, she joined the London Ballet School; by six, she was hailed in Britain as a dancing wonder; by 10, she was working as a Ballet instructor; and by 11, she had earned a degree to teach. Hoping to study with the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet at age 12, she was enrolled instead at Clifton High School in Bristol, balancing academia with the two hours a day she spent at the Cone School of Dancing (which later merged with the Ripman School to form Tring Park School for the Performing Arts). As a dance student, Johns amassed some 25 gold medals. Aside from her Clifton education, she also attended South Hampstead High School in London, where she was a contemporary of Angela Lansbury.

==Career==
===1923–1939: Career beginnings===

Johns made her theatrical debut in October 1923 at just three weeks old, carried onto the London stage by her grandmother, Elizabeth Steele-Payne, a violinist-impresario who had inherited the production&#x27;s company from her father. She thus became the fourth generation in her mother&#x27;s family to appear on stage.

In 1931 at the age of eight, Johns was cast as Sonia Kuman in Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Judgement Day&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in London. She played alongside theatre actors Sir Lewis Casson, Ronald Adam, and George Woodbridge, who played Judge Vlora, Judge Tsankov, and Judge Sturdza, respectively. As a child ballerina in 1935, Johns played Ursula in &quot;Buckie&#x27;s Bears&quot;; this production lasted from 27 December 1935 to 11 January 1936 at the Garrick Theatre. Her proficiency in dance led her to be cast in several children&#x27;s plays throughout the 1930s, notably during the Christmas holidays. She was spotted by a manager and subsequently cast in her first major stage production, as Napoleon&#x27;s daughter in the 1936 short play &quot;St Helena&quot; at The Old Vic; she was in productions of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; and &quot;The Melody That Got Lost&quot; the same year. Following this, she was recast as Sonia Kuman in Elmer Rice&#x27;s 1937 production of &quot;Judgement Day&quot; (this time at London&#x27;s Strand Theatre), J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1937 play &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot;, and Esther McCracken&#x27;s 1938 play &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot;, in which she played the bridesmaid Miranda Bute at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, London.

Johns made her screen debut in 1938 at the age of 15 with Victor Saville&#x27;s film adaptation of the Winifred Holtby novel &quot;South Riding&quot;, in which she played Midge Carne, the daughter of aspiring politician Robert Carne (played by Ralph Richardson). She had small roles in David Evans&#x27; 1938 crime film &quot;Murder in the Family&quot; and two Brian Desmond Hurst films - his 1938 black-and-white crime film &quot;Prison Without Bars&quot; and 1939 thriller &quot;On the Night of the Fire&quot; (in which she was again cast alongside Ralph Richardson).

===1940–1949: British film and theatre===

Johns averaged one and a half films a year throughout the 1940s, starting in 1940 with &quot;Under Your Hat&quot;, in which she played Winnie, a supporting character to Jack Hulbert&#x27;s Jack Millett and Cicely Courtneidge&#x27;s Kay Millett in this musical comedy spy film. Johns&#x27; scene in the 1941 British historical drama &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; as Miss Sheridan did not make the final cut, though her role in the 1941 British and Canadian World War II drama film &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, in which she replaced Elisabeth Bergner as Anna, earned her a National Board of Review Award for Best Acting and international acclaim. She continued with supporting roles as Romanian resistance fighter Paula Palacek in the 1943 British spy film, &quot;The Adventures of Tartu&quot;; supernatural innkeeper Gwyneth (alongside her father Mervyn Johns&#x27; Rhys) in the 1944 British drama film, &quot;The Halfway House&quot;; and the fun-loving cousin of Deborah Kerr&#x27;s Dizzy Clayton in the 1945 British drama film, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, in which she was part of a very talented cast including Roger Moore, and for which &quot;Radio Times&#x27; &quot;Robyn Karney said she was &quot;excellent&quot;. In a starring role, Johns played Millie in the 1946 British comedy film &quot;This Man Is Mine&quot; and war widow Judy in the 1947 British drama film &quot;Frieda&quot;. David Parkinson noted that Johns &quot;seemed to epitomise modern British womanhood&quot;. Conversely, she was cast as Mabel Chiltern in &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1947), Alexander Korda&#x27;s adaptation of the 1895 play by Oscar Wilde, in which Johns helps Lord Arthur Goring (Michael Wilding) prevent Laura Cheveley (Paulette Goddard) from destroying the reputation of her politician brother, Sir Robert Chilton (Hugh Williams).

For her role as playful Cornish mermaid Miranda Trewella in Ken Annakin&#x27;s 1948 black and white comedy film &quot;Miranda&quot;, in which she causes havoc in a London household, David L. Vineyard on MysteryFile wrote, &quot;Johns is a revelation: long platinum hair, Khirghiz eyes, and that breathless voice, perfect for this sexy romp,&quot; and ScreenOnline&#x27;s Matthew Coniam wrote, &quot;Miranda ... is played ideally by Glynis Johns ... a strikingly unusual actress facially reminiscent of Gloria Grahame, with a melodic, purring voice.&quot; As Miranda, Johns wore a tail made specially by The Dunlop Rubber Company and commissioned by producer Betty Box. The cast also included Griffith Jones, Googie Withers, and David Tomlinson, with whom Johns was later reunited in &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951) and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964). Given the weight of her tail, Tomlinson recalled his alarm at having to carry her around. The following year, she had a brief cameo in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, a gleefully scattershot comedy in which she again played the flirtatious mermaid Miranda.

Johns starred in two more films that year. She was cast in Thornton Freeland&#x27;s comedy &quot;Dear Mr. Prohack&quot;, a modern version of Arnold Bennett&#x27;s 1922 novel, &quot;Mr Prohack&quot;, as adapted in the play by Edward Knoblock. In it, Johns plays Mimi Warburton, the private secretary and love interest of Charles Prohack, played by Dirk Bogarde. That same year, Bogarde began a relationship with Johns&#x27; ex-husband Anthony Forwood. The cast included &quot;a winning gallery of &quot;femmes fatales&quot;&quot;. About Johns playing a character very unlike herself, author John Reid wrote, &quot;Glynis Johns ... is so much better at playing a scheming minx than an honest woman.&quot; In &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot; (1949), she played Joan Burns, a &quot;capable &quot;femme fatale&quot;&quot;. Of this role, Fint on Letterboxd wrote, &quot;Glynis is as winningly winsome as ever, her husky tones approximating a British Jean Arthur.&quot;

On stage, Johns reprised her role as Miranda Bute in Richard Bird&#x27;s play &quot;Quiet Weekend&quot;, which ran from 22 July 1941 to 29 January 1944 at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London. During the Blitz, she was recast in &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, which she played at the Phoenix Theatre in London despite the dangers posed by German bombers. Following this, she appeared in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre in 1943, &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot; in 1944, and &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; in 1946.

===1950–1959: Established actor ===

In the 1950s, Johns enjoyed more film roles than any earlier decade. Her successes in &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948), &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot; (1949) and in other movies made her a household name, both in Britain and the United States; director Ken Annakin was an early admirer of her work.

Johns remained in &quot;noir territory&quot; with Sidney Gilliat&#x27;s 1950 drama thriller film &quot;State Secret&quot;, appearing alongside Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Jack Hawkins; as Lisa Robinson, she was Fairbanks&#x27;s love interest; the two cause havoc in a fictitious Eastern European country and ultimately flee to the US to start their new life together. Johns supported Richard Todd in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; the following year and having previously declined parts in Hollywood productions, because of her loving devotion to British cinema, appeared in the Hollywood-financed &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, in which an expert&#x27;s misgivings about a plane&#x27;s air-worthiness are ignored. As unflappable stewardess Marjorie Corder, Johns appeared alongside James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich in this Henry Koster adaptation of the Nevil Shute novel &quot;No Highway&quot;. Following this, she co-starred with David Niven in &quot;Appointment with Venus&quot; (1951) for director Ralph Thomas, which recreates a wartime mission to rescue a pedigree cow from the Nazi-occupied island of Amorel and in which Johns plays Channel-Islander Nicola Fallaize. She was one of several names in the 1951 anthology film &quot;Encore&quot;, appearing as gambler Stella Cotman, who visits Monte Carlo alongside Terence Morgan&#x27;s Syd Cotman in the segment &quot;Gigolo and Gigolette&quot;. Now very much in demand, Johns guest starred as May Jones in John Boulting&#x27;s Technicolour biographical drama film &quot;The Magic Box&quot; of the same year. As May, Johns is introduced to cinema pioneer Robert Donat&#x27;s William Friese-Greene by Richard Attenborough&#x27;s Jack Carter. In &quot;The Card&quot; (1952), a &quot;droll&quot; adaptation of Arnold Bennett&#x27;s eponymous novel, she was Alec Guinness&#x27; main love interest, dance teacher Ruth Earp, about which &quot;The New York Times&#x27; &quot;Bosley Crowther wrote, &quot;Miss Johns&#x27; self-propelling young lady is a bundle of feminine guile.&quot; [&#x27;The Blue Lamp&#x27; (1950) is included in Glynis Johns&#x27; filmography. This is incorrect. She is not listed in the cast, either credited or uncredited.]

Johns made her television debut in 1952 with Fletcher Markle&#x27;s Emmy Award-winning series &quot;Little Women&quot;. She appeared in just one episode: season four&#x27;s &quot;Lilly, the Queen of the Movies&quot; as Lily Snape. Her television credits of the 1950s include brief appearances in the Hollywood anthology series &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (in the 1953 episode &quot;Two For Tea&quot;), Errol Flynn&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The Errol Flynn Theatre&quot; (in the 1956 episodes &quot;The Sealed Room&quot; as Lou McNamara, and &quot;The Girl in Blue Jeans&quot; as the Girl - Susan Tracey), CBS&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; (in the 1957 episode &quot;The Dead Are Silent&quot;), and ABC&#x27;s variety and drama series &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; (in the 1958 episode &quot;Face of Fear&quot; as Christine Nolan).

Johns was reunited with Richard Todd for two swashbucklers made for Walt Disney: &quot;The Sword and the Rose&quot; (1953), directed by Ken Annakin, and &quot;Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue&quot; (1953). At the same time, she made &quot;Personal Affair&quot;, a British drama film starring Gene Tierney and directed by Anthony Pelissier, in which Johns plays teenager Barbara Vining, who pursues her Latin teacher, Leo Genn&#x27;s Kay Barlow. The following year, Johns had the starring role in J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Weak and the Wicked&quot; alongside Diana Dors and Rachel Roberts, playing an upper-class prisoner, Jean Raymond, who was framed by her friend and for which Johns was widely praised. Johns did another for Annakin, &quot;The Seekers&quot; (1954), then co-starred with Robert Newton in &quot;The Beachcomber&quot; (1954). She played the Christian missionary in both films, appearing respectively as Marion Southey, the fiancé to Jack Hawkins&#x27; Philip Wayne who seeks to establish Christianity in 19th century New Zealand, and Martha Jones, who seeks to introduce it to the Welcome Islands. For both, she was paid £12,500 a picture.

In 1954, Johns was one of five judges to oversee the finals of the National Bathing Beauty Contest in Morecambe, England, where Pat Butler was declared the winner. Sitting beside newspaper editor Charles Eade, Johns was the youngest and only woman judge.

Ralph Thomas&#x27;s 1954 Technicolor comedy film &quot;Mad About Men&quot; starred Johns alongside actors Donald Sinden and Anne Crawford in this sequel to &quot;Miranda&quot;. Johns starred as Jo Luton in Roy Boulting&#x27;s 1955 comedy &quot;Josephine and Men&quot;, a romantic comedy film in which Jack Buchanan&#x27;s Uncle Charles Luton examines his niece&#x27;s relationships, and supported Danny Kaye in the musical-comedy medieval romance costume drama film &quot;The Court Jester&quot; of the same year, playing Jean with &quot;cunning precision&quot;. Despite having the highest budget of any comedy made at the time, &quot;The Court Jester&quot; was badly received at the box office. When the episode &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Orders&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; aired in 2004, Johns made a surprise guest appearance when a clip of &quot;The Court Jester&quot; was shown on screen.

Annakin used Johns again in &quot;Loser Takes All&quot; (1956), in which she plays a newlywed who loses patience with her gambling husband played by Rossano Brazzi, She was one of the many actors who made cameos in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), appearing alongside Hermione Gingold in the closing scenes. Alongside Cameron Mitchell, Johns starred in the 1957 Technicolor melodrama film &quot;All Mine to Give&quot;, based on the novel by Dale Eunson and his wife Katherine Albert. Johns returned to Britain to make &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1958) with Lana Turner and starred as Kitty Brady in &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; (1959).

In the West End, Johns starred in two 1950 productions: &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; at the Fortune Theatre and &quot;The Way Things Go&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre. She made her Broadway debut in 1952 when given the title role in five productions of the Enid Bagnold comedy &quot;Gertie&quot;. Johns returned to the United States in 1956 to again play the title role, this time in a Broadway revival production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot;.

===1960–1969: &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and other roles ===

In 1960, Johns starred as Clarissa Hailsham-Brown in Godfrey Grayson&#x27;s mystery film &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, a screen adaptation of the eponymous 1954 play by Agatha Christie, and for which American author Matthew Bunson wrote, &quot;Despite its very modest budget, &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; was able to attract the considerable talents of Glynis Johns.&quot; Johns had a supporting role in &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), for which &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Glynis Johns is a vivacious delight&quot;, with &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Bosley Crowther adding that her role as the Australian landlady Mrs. Firth (which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress) was &quot;played richly&quot; and with effervescence. In 1962, Johns starred as a nun on Dr. Kildare, helping a sick roommate decide on surgery while having medical issues herself. Johns starred in the remake of &quot;The Cabinet of Caligari&quot; (1962) as the easily offended and oft-frightened Jane Lindstrom, and she was one of four stars in the 1962 Technicolor drama film &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;. While filming her first scene in the &quot;Chapman Report&quot; with director George Cukor, he kicked her in the shin. Though a &quot;subtle kick&quot;, it was described as an &quot;unprovoked attack&quot; and by Johns as &quot;so unexpected that I did a terrible sort of double take.&quot; On the set, tensions were high, though Cukor and she later laughed about it, and he noted she was &quot;wonderful in the picture.&quot; The following year, Johns supported Jackie Gleason in George Marshall&#x27;s adaptation of the eponymous Corinne Griffith memoir &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot;, a role described by Jeffrey Kauffman as &quot;neatly understated&quot;.

&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) is considered Walt Disney&#x27;s crowning live-action achievement, and is the only one of his films to earn a Best Picture nomination during his lifetime. In the film, Johns plays Winifred Banks, the wife of George Banks, mother of Jane and Michael, and member of Emmeline Pankhurst&#x27;s &quot;Votes for Women&quot; suffrage movement, to which she is completely dedicated. When first approached by Walt Disney, Johns thought it was to play the title role of Mary Poppins (played by Julie Andrews), not Mrs. Banks. To ensure she accepted, he explained the mishap over lunch and arranged for the Sherman Brothers to write her a musical number - the song &quot;Sister Suffragette&quot;, a prosuffrage protest song pastiche, was written in 1964 with her in mind. &quot;Johns is endearing as the mother,&quot; wrote &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s James Powers in 1964, &quot;happy as a lark at getting chained to a lamp post for the cause ... she comes in strongly as a singing actor.&quot; The role earned her the Laurel Award for Best Female Supporting Performance.

The following year, Johns was cast in Henry Koster&#x27;s DeLuxe Color family comedy &quot;Dear Brigitte&quot; as the aesthete Vina, wife of James Stewart, with whom she had first acted 14 years earlier in &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;. She appeared in various character roles in the 1968 American comedy film &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Stand There!&quot;, written by Charles Williams, and the 1969 British comedy film &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot;, directed by Peter Coe.

Johns was cast in 1961 in the ABC/Warner Bros. crime drama &quot;The Roaring 20s&quot;. She portrayed Kitty O&#x27;Moyne, an Irish immigrant who falls overboard into the harbour as she arrives in the United States. Johns guest-starred in the CBS anthology series &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot; in the episode &quot;A Game for Alternate Mondays&quot; of the 1962–63 television season, playing widow Leah Marquand, with Leslye Hunter as her daughter Isabella. On 5 August 1963, &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot; premiered the episode &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; as the pilot of her eponymous CBS television series &quot;Glynis&quot;. The original working title for the series was &quot;The Glynis Johns Show&quot;; in it, Johns played the neophyte mystery writer and amateur sleuth Glynis Granvile. In the autumn of that year, &quot;Glynis&quot; officially premiered, starring Johns and Keith Andes as her husband, Keith Granville, a criminal defence attorney. Due to pressure from NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian&quot; and Bill Cullen&#x27;s &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; game show on ABC, the programme was cancelled after 13 episodes. In 1965, when CBS reran the series as a summer replacement for &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Glynis&quot; ranked number six in the Nielsen ratings. Johns remained busy on screen, appearing as Steffi Bernard in the episode &quot;Who Killed Marty Kelso?&quot; of ABC&#x27;s detective series &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; opposite Gene Barry. In 1967, she appeared in four episodes of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series as villainess Lady Penelope Peasoup, one-half of the evil duo with Rudy Vallée as her brother Lord Marmaduke Ffogg.

On stage, Johns played an invalid gentlewoman in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot; in 1963. She returned to London&#x27;s West End in 1966 to star alongside Keith Michell in &quot;The King&#x27;s Mare&quot; at the Garrick Theatre, in which she played Anne of Cleves and Michell King Henry VIII. Commenting on the production, S. Stanley Gordon wrote, &quot;The heavens must have blessed us, for we received the wonderful news that... London theatre&#x27;s favourite daughter, Glynis Johns, had agreed to come to London to star in our play.&quot; The play was written by screenwriter novelists Jean Canolle and Anita Loos. From 1969 and into the 1970s, Johns turned increasingly to stage work, appearing first in &quot;A Talent to Amuse&quot; (1969).

===1970–1979: &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; and acclaim ===
In the 1970s, Johns&#x27; career focus was on the stage. Following her appearance in earlier Cowardian productions, Johns starred in two more Coward plays in the early 1970s; from 27 January 1970 to September 1970, she was in &quot;Come As You Are&quot; at London&#x27;s New Theatre and Strand Theatre, and from 6 March 1972 to 12 March 1972, she was in &quot;Marquise&quot; at the Bristol Hippodrome in England.

In 1972 and 1973, Johns narrated several fairy tales and other children&#x27;s classics for Caedmon Records, the record label imprints of HarperCollins Publishers. These included Peter Pan and Snow White. Some were released years later.

In 1973, Johns was in the original cast of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, written by Stephen Sondheim, which premiered on 25 February at the Shubert Theatre in New York City. The song &quot;Send In the Clowns&quot; was written with her in mind. Commenting on director Harold Prince in a 1973 interview, she says he &quot;has eyes in the back of his head and a real driving force, a life force. And with it goes a great deal of loge. He calls us &#x27;crew&#x27; and himself &#x27;captain&#x27;, and he&#x27;s heartbroken when opening night is over, simply because he doesn&#x27;t want to be away from us. I think he falls in love with his company.&quot; For her role as Desiree Armfeldt, she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Sondheim referred to her vocal qualities as a &quot;rumpled bed&quot;; as Anthony Tommasini put it in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Stephen Sondheim composed his most famous song, &#x27;Send In the Clowns,&#x27; for an actress with virtually no voice, Glynis Johns, and few genuine singers have performed it as effectively.&quot;

Following this, Johns starred in Joseph Hardy&#x27;s production of &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; at the Center Theatre Group, Los Angeles, from 1 April 1975 to 10 May 1975, with Michael York. From 17 March 1976, she starred in Peter Dews&#x27; production of &quot;13 Rue de l&#x27;Amour&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in London with film and stage actor Louis Jourdan. This production was held at the Theatre Royal in Norwich; it closed on 8 May 1976. From 1977 to March 1978, Johns starred as Alma Rattenbury in &quot;Cause Célèbre&quot;, touring Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London and Leicester Haymarket Theatre among other locations. She was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a New Play and won a Variety Club Award for Best Actress in recognition; it was described as a &quot;riveting play&quot;, due in part to its cast: &quot;Glynis Johns was superb as Alma Rattenbury, and Lee Montague and Bernard Archard were fantastic as the opposing barristers.&quot;

Johns&#x27; film roles of the 1970s included playing Myfanwy Price in Andrew Sinclair&#x27;s 1972 drama film &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; opposite Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Eleanor Critchit in Roy Ward Baker&#x27;s 1973 anthology horror film &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (in the segment &quot;The Neat Job&quot;, a tale of marital discord), Swallow in the 1974 short-film adaptation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, and Mrs. Amworth in the 1977 British-Canadian horror anthology film &quot;Three Dangerous Ladies&quot;, a reprisal of the role. Of her original performance as Mrs. Amworth in the eponymous 1975 short film, Ian Holloway on Wyrd Britain wrote, &quot;the titular lady&quot; is &quot;played with flamboyant aplomb by the fabulous Glynis Johns.&quot;

===1980–1999: Final roles ===
Johns appeared in Noël Coward&#x27;s comic play &quot;Hay Fever&quot; as Judith Bliss from 4 August 1981 to 10 October 1981 at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford and the Theatre Royal in Nottingham. This was her fourth role in a Noël Coward production. From 20 November 1989 to 20 May 1990, she starred as Lady Catherine Champion-Cheney in W Somerset Maugham&#x27;s Broadway romance &quot;The Circle&quot; at the Ambassador Theatre in New York City.

Johns&#x27; screen work of the 1980s took second place to her work on stage. In 1982, she was cast as Laura Fitzpatrick Morgan in the American-British biographical television film &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last&quot; with Lucy Gutteridge in the leading role of Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt. Johns had a starring role in &quot;Nukie&quot; (1987), a South African science-fiction film in which she played the decisive Sister Anne alongside actors Anthony Morrison, Steve Railsback, and Ronald France. In 1988, Johns provided the voice for Miss Grimwood, proprietor of Miss Grimwood&#x27;s Finishing School for Girls, in &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School&quot;. The plot follows the characters as Miss Grimwood hires them as her gym teachers; once there, however, they find it is actually a school for the daughters of paranormal beings. The same year, Johns starred in &quot;Zelly and Me&quot;, an American drama film written, directed and produced by Tina Rathborne. In it, Johns plays Co-Co, the wealthy grandmother of protagonist Phoebe (played by Alexandra Johnes) and an egoist with a deeply competitive streak.

During the first season of NBC&#x27;s hit sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, Johns guest-starred as Diane Chambers&#x27; mother, Helen Chambers, an eccentric dowager, who due to a stipulation in Diane&#x27;s late father&#x27;s will, will lose all her money unless Diane is married by the next day. In 1985, Johns played Bridget O&#x27;Hara in the episode &quot;Sing a Song of Murder&quot; of CBS&#x27;s crime drama television series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, working again with Angela Lansbury. From 1988 to 1989, she played Trudie Pepper, a senior citizen living in an Arizona retirement community, in the television sitcom &quot;Coming of Age&quot;, also on CBS.

Following earlier work in the 1970s, Johns narrated two more albums for Caedmon Records: &quot;The Light Princess&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Bargain for Frances and Other Frances Stories&quot; in 1984.

In 1991, Johns returned to &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; aged 68, this time playing Madame Armfeldt, the mother of her original character Desiree, with Gordon Davidson directing at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Los Angeles. Following this, she starred as Myrtle Bledsoe in the premiere of Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;A Coffin in Egypt&quot; from June to July 1998 at the Bay Street Theatre in New York City.

On screen, Johns had the main part of Darjeeling alongside Honor Blackman and Derek Jacobi on the American children&#x27;s television anthology series &quot;ABC Weekend Specials&quot; (in the short &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, which aired on 5 November 1994).

Johns appeared in just three films in the 1990s, as the grandmother in each. She played the camera-toting grandmother in the 1995 Sandra Bullock hit &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; and the waspish Grandma Rose in Ted Demme&#x27;s 1994 black comedy film &quot;The Ref&quot;. Of this role, Caution Spoilers&#x27; Sarah noted, &quot;Glynis Johns as the awful Rose is terrific&quot;; her character was often at odds with her son Lloyd Chasseur, played by Kevin Spacey. In 1998, Johns was named a Disney legend in the film category. Her last film appearance was as the grandmother of Molly Shannon&#x27;s Mary Gallagher in the 1999 film &quot;Superstar&quot;.

==Public image==

In September 1946, when she was still fairly new to the profession, Powell and Pressburger hailed Johns as &quot;one of the most sought-after of all young British stars&quot;. She was voted by British exhibitors as the 10th-most popular box-office star in 1951 and 1952. By the time of &quot;Loser Takes All&quot; (1956), Johns was a top box-office draw.

A devotee of British cinema, Johns said in 1946, &quot;I would sooner play in a good British picture than in the majority of American pictures I have seen,&quot; She found her stardom in 1940s Britain (wherein her &quot;glistening blue eyes and perfect comic timing made her British cinema&#x27;s most sought-after female lead&quot;) and was already a star by the time she was in &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, a joint British and American production produced in 1951, and her first role in American cinema. Johns became an indelible part of the cinema histories of both Britain and America, maintaining her British and American careers simultaneously. Following &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, she took on increasingly more roles in America and elsewhere; most of her television credits were American, including her eponymous 1963 sitcom &quot;Glynis&quot;, though her film and theatre credits (with several notable exceptions) were British.

In &quot;Finishing the Hat&quot; (2010), Stephen Sondheim wrote, &quot;[Johns was] perhaps the only major British stage actress not associated with Shakespeare&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Johns was married four times. She met her first husband, Anthony Forwood, while rehearsing for &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot; (1941). A year after they met, Forwood asked her on a date and they were married within a month on 29 August 1942 in Westminster, London. The couple&#x27;s only child, actor Gareth Forwood, was born on 14 October 1945. Following a lengthy court proceeding, she was granted a divorce on 25 June 1948 &quot;because of adultery by her husband.&quot;

Johns began dating producer Antony Darnborough after working together on &quot;Encore&quot; (1951). He proposed to her at Windsor&#x27;s Sunningdale Golf Club in June 1951. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; later said that &quot;theirs was to have been one of the most glittering show-business weddings,&quot; but it never took place. &quot;Gertie&quot; (1951) took her to Broadway and their wedding was postponed; in December 1951, it was called off. The former couple remained &quot;good friends&quot; and she appeared in his 1953 television drama &quot;Personal Affair&quot;.

On 1 February 1952 in Manhattan, Johns married David Foster, a Royal Navy officer and later president of Colgate-Palmolive. They divorced on 17 May 1956 on the ground of his adultery with an unnamed woman. He did not contest the charge.

Johns married Cecil Henderson, a businessman, on 10 October 1960 in Westminster, London. They divorced on 21 June 1962. He cited adultery and she did not contest the charge.

Johns&#x27; fourth and last husband was the writer and United States Air Force Captain Elliott Arnold. They announced their engagement on 25 June 1964 and were married on 1 October in Los Angeles, California. They divorced on 4 January 1973.

In a 1973 interview with Robert Berkvist, Johns described – in her experience – the compatibility of theatre and marriage: &quot;Acting is my highest form of intelligence, the time when I use the best part of my brain. I was always told, by my married friends, for example, that I could apply that intelligence to something else, some other aspect of living, but I can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t have the same flair in other things.&quot; On the subject of a fifth marriage, she reflected, &quot;I&#x27;d tread very softly in that area. Very softly. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t rush into anything again, and I&#x27;d have to have an awful lot in common with anyone I&#x27;d consider marrying next time. Why so many marriages? It was absolute conservatism on my part. I was brought up to feel that if you wanted to have an affair with a man, well, you married him. I have friends who, if they&#x27;d followed that rule, would have collected an awful lot of pieces of paper by now.&quot;

Following the death of her mother, Alyce Steele-Wareham, on 1 September 1971 in Westminster, Johns&#x27; father Mervyn Johns married actress Diana Churchill on 4 December 1976 in Hillingdon, London. Johns&#x27; grandson, Thomas Forwood, is a French writer and film director.

===Health and voice===
Following her marriage to David Foster in 1952, she became overweight. Talking to Lydia Lane, she describes this ordeal: &quot;I was relaxed, happy, with little to do and I suppose I simply didn&#x27;t burn up as much energy as usual. My appetite stayed the same and I gained a few pounds at a time until one day I discovered I was 14 pounds overweight.&quot; Her solution was simple: &quot;I&#x27;m convinced that weight is a mental problem,&quot; she said. &quot;I counted calories for a while, but nothing happened until I became really disturbed about it. From that moment on, I began to lose weight and in three weeks, I was back to normal. The point I am trying to make is that dieting alone is not enough. It must be accompanied by a strong will and determination to lose [weight].&quot;

Johns previously had severe migraines. In a 1955 interview, she admitted, &quot;Only recently have I learned how to relax. And since I have, the migraine headaches, which have plagued me for years, have disappeared. I&#x27;ve finally learned to be still inside. Someone told me once, &#x27;When you let God in on your problems, you can let go and relax,&#x27; and I&#x27;ve found that it works.&quot;

A few days before Johns was due to play Desiree Armfeldt at the opening night of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; in 1973, she was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment of an intestinal infection. The debut was postponed by a week and Tammy Grimes was thought to be a likely successor. Though her doctor was &quot;aghast&quot;, Johns rejoined the show after just two days: &quot;I was not going to have anybody else sing my songs,&quot; she said.

Johns suffered from stage fright throughout most of her career. In a 2023 interview, her grandson Thomas said, &quot;Of course, she came across as supremely confident, but in private, she suffered quite crippling stage fright that she never really got over – only managed – so that makes her career even more remarkable.&quot;

Johns&#x27; voice has been described by a press agent as &quot;like the sound of a brook burbling over a pebbled bed.&quot; In &quot;Finishing the Hat&quot; (2010), Stephen Sondheim wrote that she had a &quot;small but silvery voice that was musical and smokily pure&quot;.

===Later years and death===
Johns was predeceased by all four of her husbands. The first to die was her third husband, Cecil Henderson, in 1978, followed by her fourth husband, Elliott Arnold, in 1980, her first husband, Anthony Forwood, in 1988, and her second husband, David Foster, in 2010. Her then 62-year-old son, Gareth Forwood, died in 2007 from a heart attack during cancer treatment.

With the death of Olivia de Havilland in 2020, Johns became the oldest living Academy Award nominee in any acting category. In 2021, with the death of Betty White, she became the oldest living Disney Legend.

Johns retired to the US, where she later resided at the Belmont Village Hollywood Heights, a senior-living community, located near the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

Johns died in Los Angeles at an assisted-living home, on 4 January 2024, at age 100 from natural causes. In April, her ashes were transported to Wales to be buried at Jerusalem Independent Chapel in Burry Port, alongside the remains of her father. The song &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot; was played at the service.

==Advocacy==
Chris Bryant, Labour MP for Rhondda, described Johns as &quot;a lifetime ambassador for the creative arts in the UK and particularly Wales.&quot; In 1971, Johns told BBC Cymru Wales that a national theatre in Wales would be a positive addition to the country, because &quot;Welsh people ... have a love for their art and are not mercenary about it.&quot;

<text>Joan Mary Waller Greenwood (4 March 1921 – 28 February 1987) was an English actress. Her husky voice, coupled with her slow, precise elocution, was her trademark. She played Sibella in the 1949 film &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, and also appeared in &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot;, &quot;Young Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (both 1951), &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952), &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1958), &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963) and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1987).

Greenwood worked mainly on the stage, where she had a long career, appearing with Donald Wolfit&#x27;s theatre company in the years following the Second World War. Her appearances in Ealing comedies are among her memorable screen roles: in &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (1949); as the seductive Sibella in the black comedy &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949); and in &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951). She opened &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot; in the West End in 1952, and played Gwendolen in a film version of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; released in the same year.

She had leading roles in &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1958) and then in &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), an adaptation of a Jules Verne novel; and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963).

In 1960, Greenwood appeared as the titular character in a production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse. Starring opposite her as Judge Brack was the actor André Morell. They fell in love and flew in secret to Jamaica, where they were married; they remained together until his death in 1978.

== Early life and education==
Greenwood was born in 1921 in Chelsea, London. Her parents were Ida (née Waller) and Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood (1887–1949), a portrait artist. She went to school at St Catherine&#x27;s School, Bramley, leaving when she was 15. She originally wanted to be a ballet dancer but then decided to act, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

== Career ==
Greenwood worked for two years in repertory. Her fluency in French saw her cast in London in a production of &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; when she was 18. Greenwood appeared in &quot;Little Ladyship&quot; (1939) on TV and in the short &quot;John Smith Wakes Up&quot; (1941). Her first feature was &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Family&quot; followed by &quot;He Found a Star&quot; (both 1941).

She joined the Oxford Playhouse Repertory Company, and whilst there played leading parts in a number of well-known plays, such as &quot;School for Scandal&quot;, &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. She went back to the London stage and appeared in productions of &quot;Little Ladyship&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, and &quot;The Women&quot;. While appearing in the latter she was seen by Leslie Howard who cast her in a notable role in &quot;The Gentle Sex&quot; (1943), which was a hit.

Greenwood had a supporting part in &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1945) and &quot;They Knew Mr. Knight&quot; (1946).

She appeared in the role of Wendy in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and as Elie Dunn in &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;. She played Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, Celia in &quot;Volpone&quot; and Sabina in &quot;The Young Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;.

===Rank Organisation===
Sydney Box offered her a seven-year contract with the Rank Organisation, starting with the female lead in &quot;A Girl in a Million&quot; (1946). Box was so taken with her performance he changed the title to refer to her.

She had a good role in &quot;The Man Within&quot;, billed after Michael Redgrave and Jean Kent, then co-starred alongside John Mills in &quot;The October Man&quot; and with Margaret Lockwood in &quot;The White Unicorn&quot; (all 1947).

===Stardom===
Greenwood was cast in the lead role of &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (1948), as Sophia Dorothea of Celle, alongside Stewart Granger, but it was an expensive box-office failure. She did &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1949) for TV; then played Lady Caroline Lamb in &quot;The Bad Lord Byron&quot; (1949), a notorious flop.

More successful was &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (1949), which kicked off the Ealing comedy cycle. It was directed by Alexander Mackendrick, and Greenwood was top-billed along with Basil Radford. She did another for Ealing, &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949), with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness, directed by Robert Hamer. Both films became regarded as comedy classics.

Greenwood was Richard Todd&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (1951), at British Lion. She went to France to co-star with Bourvil in &quot;Mr. Peek-a-Boo&quot; (1951). She did another for Ealing with Mackendrick and Guinness, &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot;, then &quot;Young Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (both 1951) and did &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952) again, this time as a feature film. She appeared on TV shows such as &quot;BBC Sunday-Night Theatre&quot;.

Greenwood then appeared in &quot;Lovers, Happy Lovers!&quot; (1954), a French film shot at the Elstree Studios of Associated British and on location across London, with Gérard Philipe. She did &quot;The King and Mrs. Candle&quot; for American TV, and made her third film with Guinness and second with Hamer, &quot;Father Brown&quot; (both 1954). She did &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in Copenhagen, then was in &quot;The Confidential Clerk&quot; by T.S. Eliot which had a short run on Broadway in 1954. 

In Hollywood, she was the female lead in &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1955) at MGM, replacing original choice Merle Oberon.

===Later career===
In 1956, Greenwood starred in &quot;The Grass is Greener&quot; in the West End. In the late 1950s she worked increasingly on TV, in versions of &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, &quot;Ann Veronica&quot;, &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and &quot;The Grass is Greener&quot;. She had a support role in &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1958), &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961) and the female lead in &quot;The Amorous Mr. Prawn&quot; (1962). She married Andre Morell in 1960.

Greenwood had a flashy support role in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; (1964). She appeared as Olga, alongside Spike Milligan in Frank Dunlop&#x27;s production of the play &quot;Oblomov&quot;, based on the novel by Russian writer Ivan Goncharov. The play opened at London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre on 6 October 1964. Greenwood was described as &quot;a model of generosity and tolerance...the only person in the cast who could not be &#x27;corpsed&#x27; by Milligan; although he tried very hard. She looked beautiful, and played the part of Oblomov&#x27;s unfortunate lady with total integrity. &#x27;She never left the script&#x27;, says Milligan with a guilty smile of something between irritation and admiration. &#x27;I just couldn&#x27;t make her crack up. All the rest of us did. She never lost her dignity for a moment.&#x27;&quot;

She was in the play &quot;Those That Play the Clowns&quot; (1966) which had a short run on Broadway. Greenwood dubbed the voice of The Black Queen in &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968) when the voice of actress Anita Pallenberg was judged unsuitable for the role. She was in &quot;The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens&quot; (1970) and &quot;Girl Stroke Boy&quot; (1971).

Later roles included &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977), &quot;The Water Babies&quot; (1978), &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1978), &quot;Bognor&quot; (1981), &quot;Triangle&quot; (1982), and &quot;Ellis Island&quot; (1985). 

She took over from Dame Celia Johnson on stage in &quot;The Understanding&quot; (1982) after Johnson&#x27;s death.

She played Lady Carlton, a quirky romance novelist and the landlady to the main characters, in the British sitcom &quot;Girls on Top&quot; (1985–86). She was in &quot;Miss Marple: At Bertram&#x27;s Hotel&quot; (1987). Her last film was &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1988), released posthumously. Her last TV series was &quot;Melba&quot; (1988).

She appeared on stage in a sketch with Robert Morley two weeks before her death.

== Personal life and death==
Greenwood married André Morell in 1960. Their son Jason Morell is an actor, writer and film/theatre director. On 28 February 1987, nine years after her husband&#x27;s death, Greenwood died from acute bronchitis and asthma at her home in London.

<doc id="144893" wikidata="Q216852" url="?curid=144893" title="Thyroxine">
<text>Thyroxine, also known as T4, is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is the primary form of thyroid hormone found in the blood and acts as a prohormone of the more active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine and its active metabolites are essential for regulating metabolic rate, supporting heart and muscle function, promoting brain development, and maintaining bone health.

== Regulation ==

Thyroxine has a half-life of approximately one week and hence maintains relatively stable blood levels. Its production and release are controlled through a complex feedback loop involving the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. This regulatory system ensures that optimal hormone levels are maintained.

== Biosynthesis ==

Thyroxine biosynthesis is a multi-step process that occurs in follicular cell within the thyroid gland. The synthesis of thyroxine requires adequate iodine supply and appropriate hormonal control.

The process begins with the active uptake of iodide from the bloodstream by thyroid follicular cells through the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) located in the basolateral membrane. Once inside the cell, iodide is transported to the follicular lumen, where it undergoes oxidation by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide generated by the NADPH oxidase DUOX2. The oxidized iodine then iodinates tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin (Tg), a glycoprotein synthesized by thyroid cells and stored in the follicular lumen. This process, known as organification, results in the formation of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) residues within the Tg molecule.

The final step in thyroxine synthesis involves the free radical mediated coupling of two DIT residues, catalyzed by TPO, to form T4 while still attached to the Tg backbone. When thyroid hormone is needed, Tg is internalized by thyrocytes, and proteolytic enzymes in lysosomes cleave the T4 from Tg, allowing for its release into the bloodstream. This intricate biosynthetic pathway is tightly regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland, which influences virtually every stage of thyroid hormone production.

<doc id="144896" wikidata="Q2110619" url="?curid=144896" title="Federal Marriage Amendment">
<text>The Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), also referred to by proponents as the Marriage Protection Amendment, was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would legally define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. The FMA would also prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to same-sex couples.

An amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the support of two thirds of each house of Congress and ratification by three fourths of the states. The last congressional vote on the proposed amendment occurred in the House of Representatives on July 18, 2006, when the motion failed 236 to 187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The Senate has only voted on cloture motions with regard to the proposed amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the proposal and the 67 votes required to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification. President George W. Bush endorsed this proposal and made it part of his campaign during the 2004 and 2006 election cycles.

==Background and current law==

===Role of states===
In the United States, civil marriage is governed by state law. Each state is free to set the conditions for a valid marriage, subject to limits set by the state&#x27;s own constitution and the U.S. Constitution. Traditionally, a marriage was considered valid if the requirements of the marriage law of the state where the marriage took place were fulfilled. (First Restatement of Conflicts on Marriage and Legitimacy s.121 (1934)). However, a state can refuse to recognize a marriage if the marriage violates a strong public policy of the state, even if the marriage was legal in the state where it was performed. (Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 283(2) (1971).) States historically exercised this &quot;public policy exception&quot; by refusing to recognize out-of-state polygamous marriages, underage marriages, incestuous marriages, and interracial marriages. Following the &quot;Windsor&quot; decision in 2013, nearly all courts that have addressed the issue have held that states with laws defining marriage as a one-man, one-woman union cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that were legally performed elsewhere and must permit all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, the right to marry.

Same-sex marriage is currently legal in all US States. In 2003 and 2008 respectively, the Massachusetts and California supreme courts ruled in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; and &quot;In Re Marriage Cases&quot; that the states&#x27; constitutions required the state to permit same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts decision could be reversed by an amendment to the state constitution; to date, no such amendment has successfully been passed in Massachusetts. On June 2, the &quot;California Marriage Protection Act&quot;, commonly referred to as Prop 8 qualified for the 2008 General Election ballot. Voted into law on November 4, 2008, it amended the California Constitution to provide that &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California&quot;. Prop 8 was later found to be unconstitutional and same-sex marriage was allowed to resume. Thirty states passed state constitutional amendments defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. On June 26, 2015, all amendments banning same-sex marriage were invalidated by the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;.

===Federal statutes regulating marriage===
Although individual U.S. states have the primary regulatory power with regard to marriage, the United States Congress has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, was followed by a series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level judicial ruling prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii&#x27;s constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, even if those unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint federal income tax returns even if they filed joint state income tax returns. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; on June 26, 2013 and repealed by the Respect for Marriage Act on December 13, 2022.

===The United States Constitution and federal courts===
Federal courts have interpreted the U.S. Constitution to place some limits on states&#x27; ability to restrict access to marriage. In &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, the United States Supreme Court overturned state marriage laws that barred interracial marriages on the basis that marriage is a &quot;basic civil right...&quot; and that &quot;...the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.&quot; The Supreme Court struck down a 1992 Colorado constitutional amendment that barred legislative and judicial remedies to protect homosexuals from discrimination solely on the basis of their sexual orientation in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;.

In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed, &quot;for want of a substantial question,&quot; an appeal by two men who unsuccessfully challenged Minnesota&#x27;s marriage statutes in state court. Because the case, &quot;Baker v. Nelson,&quot; came to the Court through mandatory appellate review (not &quot;certiorari&quot;), the summary dismissal established &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot; as a binding precedent.

In 2010, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Proposition 8, passed two years earlier by a majority of voters, was unconstitutional. As in Judge Baitaillon&#x27;s decision about the Nebraska law, Judge Vaughn Walker stated in his ruling that moral opposition to same-sex marriage is not sufficient reason to make a law valid. Judge Walker ruled the law violated the 14th Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection clause, as well as the Due Process Clause. The proponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decision on February 7, 2012. On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, vacated the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling for lack of jurisdiction. Two days later the Ninth Circuit dissolved its stay of the district court&#x27;s ruling, allowing same-sex marriage to resume in California. In 2015 the Supreme Court held in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that the government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriage.

==Legislative history==
The Federal Marriage Amendment has been introduced in the United States Congress many different times: in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2015; none of which were successful.

===2002===

The original proposed Federal Marriage Amendment was written by the Alliance for Marriage under Matthew Daniels with the assistance of former Solicitor General and failed Supreme Court nominee Judge Robert Bork, Professor Robert P. George of Princeton University, and Professor Gerard V. Bradley of Notre Dame Law School. It was introduced in the 107th United States Congress in the House of Representatives on May 15, 2002, by Representative Ronnie Shows (D-Miss.) with 22 cosponsors, and read:

The bill was designated H.J.Res 93 and was immediately referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On July 18, 2002, it was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, which took no action on it.

===2003===
The amendment was introduced again by Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-Colo.) on May 21, 2003, with the same wording proposed in 2002. The bill was designated H.J.Res.56 in the House and was immediately referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On June 25, 2003, it was referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, where hearings were held on May 13, 2004. On November 23, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) objected that the amendment would interrupt Massachusetts&#x27; scheduled experiment with same-sex marriage, then scheduled to begin in May 2004. Musgrave countered that the Massachusetts marriages were court-ordered. She said: &quot;If we&#x27;re going to redefine marriage, let&#x27;s let the American people, through their elected representatives, decide—not activist judges. Let the people of Massachusetts decide.&quot;

The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) on November 25, 2003, and designated S.J.Res.26. The amendment changed the language of the proposed amendment, substituting &quot;marriage&quot; for &quot;marital status&quot; and specifying that it applied to &quot;any union other than the union of a man and a woman&quot; rather than &quot;unmarried couples or groups&quot;. The changes were intended to make it clear that state legislatures could still recognize civil unions if the amendment were to pass. &quot;This new language makes the intent of the legislation even clearer: to protect marriage in this country as the union between a man and a woman, and to reinforce the authority of state legislatures to determine benefits issues related to civil unions or domestic partnerships,&quot; said Sen. Wayne Allard. It was immediately referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

===2004===
When the 2003 version of the FMA failed to advance in the Congress, Senator Allard re-introduced the Amendment on May 22, 2004, with a revised second sentence. Rep. Musgrave re-introduced the Amendment in the House on September 23, 2004, with the same revision.

The 2004 version of the Federal Marriage Amendment stated:

The bill was designated S.J.Res.30 in the Senate and was immediately referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. When the bill became stuck in committee, Senator Allard re-introduced the Amendment in the Senate on July 7, 2004, where it was designated S.J.Res.40. The bill was subject to a filibuster: on July 9, 12, 13 and 14, the motion was made to proceed to consideration of the measure. On July 14, 2004, a cloture motion to force a direct vote on the FMA was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 50 nay votes to 48 yea votes. The 48 votes in support of the cloture motion were 12 votes short of the 60-vote supermajority (three-fifths) needed to end debate and force a vote on the Amendment itself. Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina skipped the filibuster vote. On July 15, 2004, the motion to proceed to consideration of the Amendment was withdrawn in the Senate. Six Republicans voted with a majority of Democrats against cloture in the Senate.

The bill was designated H.J.Res.106 in the House and was immediately referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On September 28, 2004, rules were recommended by the House Rules Committee with regards to debate and voting on the proposed Amendment. The rules were passed on September 30. The resolution was immediately considered. Passage of the proposed Amendment failed 227 yea votes to 186 nay votes, where 290 yea votes (two-thirds) are required for passage of a proposed Constitutional amendment.

===2005/2006===
On January 24, 2005, Senator Allard introduced the Marriage Protection Amendment, which was the 2004 version of the Federal Marriage Amendment verbatim, with 21 Republican co-sponsors. In 2006, Rep. Musgrave introduced the Marriage Protection Amendment in the House. This version had the same language as the 2004 proposal, except that the word &quot;solely&quot; in the first sentence was replaced by the word &quot;only&quot;.

The bill was designated S.J.Res.1 in the Senate and was immediately referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. On November 9, 2005, the Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights approved the bill for consideration by the full Judiciary Committee. On May 18, 2006, the Judiciary Committee reported to the Senate and the bill was placed on the legislative calendar. The motion to proceed to the measure was first made on June 5, 2006. A cloture motion on the motion to proceed was then presented in Senate. On June 6 and 7, the motion to proceed to the measure was again considered in the Senate. On June 7, a cloture motion to force a direct vote on the Marriage Protection Amendment was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 48 nay votes to 49 yea votes, with the vote mostly following party lines with Democrats opposing and Republicans in favor. The 49 votes in support of the cloture motion were 11 votes short of the 60-vote supermajority (three-fifths) needed to end debate and force a vote on the Amendment itself. Eight Republican Senators opposed or did not vote; four Democratic Senators favored or did not vote. The only Senators who changed their position from the 2004 vote to the 2006 vote were Senators Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), both of whom voted Yea in 2004 and Nay in 2006.

The bill was designated H.J.Res.88 in the House and was immediately referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On July 17, 2006, rules were recommended by the House Rules Committee with regards to debate and voting on the proposed Amendment. The rules were passed on July 18. The resolution was immediately considered. Passage of the proposed Amendment failed 236 yea votes to 187 nay votes, where 290 yea votes (two-thirds) are required for passage. The motion to reconsider was immediately laid on the table and agreed to without objection. Twenty-seven Republican Representatives opposed the FMA; thirty-four Democrats voted in favor of the FMA and one Independent voted against the FMA in the vote on July 18, 2006, in the House.

===2008===
On May 22, 2008, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) and 91 co-sponsors introduced H.J.Res.89, which proposed the enactment of FMA. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and eight other senators introduced similar legislation with S.J.Res.43 on June 25.

===2013===
U.S. Representative Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) reintroduced the FMA () on June 28, 2013, in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;. The bill, which had 58 cosponsors, never made it out of committee.

===2015===
Huelskamp again introduced the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2015, during the 114th Congress, as . The amendment garnered 37 cosponsors, all Republicans. It never made it out of committee.

==Political considerations==

===Bush administration&#x27;s stance===
In 2003, the White House declined to take a stand on the amendment, although Press Secretary Ari Fleischer relayed that President George W. Bush believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2004, President Bush alluded to the recent court decision in Massachusetts ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages beginning in May: &quot;Activist judges ... have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives... If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.&quot; On February 24, after the same Massachusetts court reiterated that it was insisting on marriage and that civil unions were insufficient, Bush expressed support for this amendment for the first time. In August, Vice President Dick Cheney neither endorsed nor condemned the FMA, arguing that same-sex marriage is an issue for the states to decide. In 2009, Cheney stated his support for same-sex marriage on a state-by-state basis.

On January 25, 2005, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bush told a privately invited group of African-American community and religious leaders that he remained committed to amending the Constitution to &quot;ban same-sex marriage&quot;. Over the course of the next two days, it was revealed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; that the Bush administration had paid columnists to promote its views. The Department of Health and Human Services paid Maggie Gallagher $21,500, and Mike McManus $49,000, to write syndicated news columns endorsing the FMA. Additionally, Gallagher also received $20,000 in 2002 and 2003 to write a report on government initiatives to strengthen marriage. McManus leads a group called &quot;Marriage Savers&quot; promoting marriage as defined between a man and a woman.

===Influence on 2004 presidential election===
By the time Americans went to the polls, John Kerry opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment and affirmatively supported civil unions, while George W. Bush supported the Federal Marriage Amendment but was not opposed to states enacting their own civil union legislation.

Previously, on February 24, 2004, Bush called for an amendment which would have outlawed same-sex marriage, and which would have disallowed states from recognizing or enforcing same-sex civil unions. Bush&#x27;s statement included a requirement that any amendment &quot;leav[e] the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage.&quot; The White House partly clarified Bush&#x27;s position in a February 24, 2004 press conference with White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who stated that by calling on the FMA to permit states the possibility of creating other &quot;legal arrangements,&quot; Bush specifically meant to permit states the chance of enacting civil unions. (McClellan also stated, however, that Bush did not personally support civil unions.) Similarly, at the February 25, 2004 press conference, McClellan stated that the White House intended to work with Congress to develop language for the FMA that permitted states to enact civil unions. Although Bush frequently spoke about FMA on the campaign from February and November 2004, he avoided mention of the phrase &quot;civil unions&quot; until an ABC News interview of October 26, 2004, aired one week before the election.

The FMA&#x27;s Republican co-sponsors, Senator Wayne Allard (R-CO) and Representative Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO), announced new language for the proposed amendment on March 23, 2004, replacing the second sentence of the amendment with &quot;Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.&quot; Both Allard and Musgrave called the change purely &quot;technical.&quot;

Opponents of the FMA claim polling of the public has shown a cautious response, with many polls indicating opposition, even in states such as Arizona and Colorado which were thought of as socially conservative at the time. They cite Pew Research Center exit polls from the 2004 elections finding that 25% of polled voters support same-sex marriage and another 35% support civil unions.

On the other hand, of the 11 states in which amendments defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came out for the first time to cast their ballots for Bush. Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.

However, Roberta Combs, President of the Christian Coalition of America claims, &quot;Christian evangelicals made the major difference once again this year.&quot; In the 2000 presidential election, there was some speculation that many evangelicals did not go to the polls and vote because of the October surprise of George W. Bush&#x27;s drunk-driving arrest record. In a dozen swing states that decided the presidential election, moral values tied with the economy and jobs as the top issue in the campaign, according to Associated Press exit polls.

==Arguments against==
:&quot;This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see Same-sex marriage#Controversies&quot;

The first sentence of H.J. Res. 56 would provide an official definition of legal marriage in the United States. Proponents claim that this is a reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage. To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution. The Federal Marriage Amendment discriminates against the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community.

===Federalism===
Opponents of the FMA argued it would violate the states&#x27; rights to regulate marriage by federalizing the issue, which they said should be left to the states. Many used the federalism argument, including Senator John Kerry, Senator John McCain, and Representative Ron Paul, who opposed the FMA for several reasons, one of which that regulating marriage is not a proper role of the federal government. The author Jonathan Rauch wrote that &quot;the proposed amendment strips power not from judges but from states,&quot; since the amendment would not allow any state to create same-sex marriage even by the rules of its own state-level democracy. &quot;That conservatives would contemplate so striking a repudiation of federalism,&quot; Rauch wrote, &quot;is a sign of the panic that same-sex marriage inspires on the right.&quot; Furthermore, constitutionally defining marriage would have reversed the choices already made in states and territories including Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Iowa, and the District of Columbia.

===Unmarried heterosexual couples===
It is argued that the 2003 version of the FMA would have severely affected the ability of heterosexual unmarried couples to seek some degree of legal protection and/or provisions.

Opponents of the FMA argue that it may complicate efforts to enforce laws against domestic abuse in heterosexual relationships involving unmarried couples. They note that two Ohio courts ruled that Ohio&#x27;s similar amendment made the state&#x27;s domestic violence laws unconstitutional as applied to unmarried couples, because they created a &quot;quasi-marital relationship&quot;. (The decisions were later reversed.)

Supporters of the FMA asserted that this argument was a scare tactic and that the FMA would not prevent laws against domestic abuse from being applied to unmarried couples. In Ohio, 8 of the 10 Ohio Courts that addressed the effect of the State Amendment on Domestic Violence Laws found no conflict. Additionally several Attorneys General of other states issued legal opinions finding that no such conflict would exist. With the final ruling of the Supreme Court of Ohio, which held that the DV Statute was not in-conflict, no State faces any contention between marriage Statutes and Domestic Violence Laws.

===Separation of church and state===
Some religious groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding on the grounds of the ideology of other religious groups restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term that should not be defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.

===Unnecessary and ineffective===
Opponents of the FMA have claimed that life for those in a heterosexual marriage are not materially affected by a constitutional marriage definition or legalization of same-sex marriage. They stated that the FMA was totally unnecessary because federal and state laws, combined with the state of the relevant constitutional doctrines at the time, already made court-ordered nationwide same-sex marriage unlikely for the foreseeable future. It was claimed therefore, that such an amendment was a solution in search of a problem. It was claimed that neither federal nor state courts were likely to order same-sex marriage under the traditional interpretation of the Constitution&#x27;s Full Faith and Credit Clause. Nor, for the foreseeable future, it was claimed, were courts likely to mandate same-sex marriage under substantive federal constitutional doctrines, such as the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. This claim ultimately became untrue, as the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that denying the right of marriage to same-sex couples was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause in its landmark 2015 ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;.

===Institution of Marriage Amendment===
The Concerned Women for America (CWA), an anti-feminist group, were concerned about the wording of the 2004 Federal Marriage Amendment. CWA criticized the language in the amendment because the second sentence is open to differing interpretations, and its drafters acknowledged that it was specifically worded so state legislators could create civil unions and domestic partnerships, because the CWA opposes any legal recognition of same-sex couples. CWA preferred the Institution of Marriage Amendment crafted by Home School Legal Defense Association president Michael Farris. That amendment, which has not been introduced by any member of Congress, states:

==Arguments in favor==
:&quot;This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see Same-sex marriage#Controversies&quot;

===Restriction of perceived judicial overreach===
Proponents of FMA argued that same-sex marriage advocates wanted to disregard federalism and use the judicial system to make same-sex marriage legal nationwide, and that only the Federal Marriage Amendment could forestall that.

Proponents of the FMA initially argued that if it were not for judicial overreach, there would be no need for an FMA; states&#x27; rights would not be violated since no state legislatures had recognized same-sex marriage. However, by the end of 2012, a number of states had enacted same-sex marriage both through the actions of their state legislatures (Vermont, New Hampshire, New York), and through popular vote (Maine, Maryland, Washington).

Prior to these legislative enactments and popular vote outcomes, proponents of the FMA argues that the federalism proposed by the opponents of a constitutional amendment was a contrivance for permitting federal courts to force same-sex marriage upon the whole nation, no matter what the people of the individual states desire. Proponents supported this claim with &quot;Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning&quot;, in which a district court struck down Nebraska&#x27;s marriage amendment, even though it had been passed by a margin of seventy percent (although the amendment was later reinstated). Opponents of the FMA argued that no federal court has ever ordered a state to permit same-sex marriage. However, on February 7, 2012, a federal appeals court in a 2-to-1 decision threw out California&#x27;s voter-approved restriction on same-sex marriage (Proposition 8) saying that it violated the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.

===Uniform application of Full Faith and Credit===
Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, with certain exceptions, a state is obligated to honor the judgments and declarations of other states. While some assert that a &quot;license&quot; could be construed as a &quot;judgment&quot;, the majority of legal scholars disagree. However, it is pointed out that a judgment for divorce is required to be honored because judgments are required to be enforced by out-of-state jurisdictions, regardless of whether those judgments are against the public policy of the out state forum (see &quot;Williams v. North Carolina&quot;, 317 U.S. 287 (1942) (the case also stated that there is no &quot;authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state&quot;)). Because of the intricacies of family law and the mobility of married couples, the recognition of marriages in other states varies. The need for clarification on state uniformity in this issue requires a constitutional amendment at the federal level, particularly considering there will be a flood of marriages in out-of-state jurisdictions for purposes of obtaining a same-sex marriage license.

===Opposite-sex marriage as necessary for child-rearing===
FMA proponents argued that opposite-sex marriage has been given special legal protections, as the basis for child-rearing, and to legitimize lines of inheritance.

==Legislative activity==

===Federal level===
===Article V convention initiated by state legislatures===
On April 2, 2014, the Alabama House of Representatives adopted a joint resolution calling for an Article V convention to draft an amendment to the federal Constitution to define marriage as the union of only one man and only one woman in all jurisdictions of the United States.

==Public opinion==

===Nationwide polling===

Polling on the subject has fluctuated widely, with opposition for such an amendment increasing steadily for more than a decade. Beginning in 2010 polls have found majority support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage. A Gallup poll conducted in May 2014 found that 55% of Americans support allowing marriage for same-sex couples, the largest percentage ever measured by the organization. The same poll found only 42% opposed, and 4% had no opinion on the issue.

A 2012 Fox News poll found that 38% of American voters support a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, while 53% oppose. A 2012 United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection poll found that only 24% of Americans agreed that Congress should &quot;pass a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in every state regardless of state law.&quot;

A 2011 AP-NCC poll found that 48% of Americans said they would favor such an amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, with about 40% strongly favoring such a change. However, 55% believe the issue should be handled at the state level.

A 2006 APR poll found that 33% of Americans favored amending the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, while 49% felt each state should make its own laws on marriage, and 18% were unsure. In May 2006, a Gallup poll found that 50% of Americans would favor amending the federal Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, while 47% were opposed, and 3% were undecided or did not respond. An ABC News poll that year found that 42% of Americans supported amending the U.S. Constitution, banning same-sex marriage.

A 2003 Wirthlin poll found that 57% of Americans supported a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.

===State polling===

Public opinion varies widely between different states. Only two states, Mississippi and Alabama, had public opinion generally more opposed to same sex marriage than in favor in 2017, with only Alabama having an absolute majority, 51%, opposed; in Mississippi, there was plurality opposition. In Louisiana, Tennessee, North Carolina, and West Virginia, there was plurality support; in all other states, there was absolute majority support. The lowest approval of same sex marriage was 41% in Alabama. The highest was 80% in Vermont and Massachusetts.

<text>The Capitolium or Capitoline Hill ( ; ; ), between the Forum and the Campus Martius, is one of the Seven Hills of Rome.

The hill was earlier known as &quot;Mons Saturnius&quot;, dedicated to the god Saturn. The word &quot;Capitolium&quot; first referred to the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus which was located on the hill, however the meaning evolved to refer to the whole hill and even other temples of Jupiter on other hills. In an etymological myth, ancient sources connect the name to &quot;caput&quot; (&quot;head&quot;, &quot;summit&quot;) because of a tale that stated that when the foundations for the temple were being laid, a man&#x27;s head was found. The &quot;Capitolium&quot; was regarded by the Romans as indestructible, and was adopted as a symbol of eternity.

The word &quot;Capitolium&quot; is a precursor to the English word &quot;&quot;, and Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. is widely assumed to be named after the Capitoline Hill.

==Ancient history==
At this hill, the Sabines, creeping to the Citadel, were let in by the Roman maiden Tarpeia. For this treachery, Tarpeia was the first to be punished by being flung from a steep cliff overlooking the Roman Forum. This cliff was later named the Tarpeian Rock after the Vestal Virgin, and became a frequent execution site. The Sabines, who immigrated to Rome following the Rape of the Sabine Women, settled on the Capitoline. 

The Vulcanal (Shrine of Vulcan), an 8th-century BC sacred precinct, occupied much of the eastern lower slopes of the Capitoline, at the head of what later became the Roman Forum. The summit was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, started by Rome&#x27;s fifth king, Tarquinius Priscus (&quot;r.&quot; 616–579 BC), and completed by the seventh and last king, Tarquinius Superbus (535–496 BC). It was considered one of the largest and the most beautiful temples in the city, although little now remains. The city legend starts with the recovery of a human skull (the word for head in Latin is &quot;caput&quot;) when foundation trenches were being dug for the Temple of Jupiter at Tarquin&#x27;s order. Recent excavations on the Capitoline uncovered an early cemetery under the Temple of Jupiter.

There are several important temples built on Capitoline hill: the temple of Juno Moneta, the temple of Virtus, and the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus is the most important of the temples. It was built in 509 BC and was nearly as large as the Parthenon. The hill and the temple of Jupiter became the symbols of Rome, the capital of the world. The Temple of Saturn was built at the foot of Capitoline Hill in the western end of the Forum Romanum.

When the Senones Gauls, who settled in central-east Italy, raided Rome in 390 BC, after the battle of River Allia, the Capitoline Hill was the one section of Rome to evade capture by the barbarians, due to its being fortified by the Roman defenders. According to legend, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus was alerted to the Gallic attack by the sacred Roman geese of Juno. 

When Julius Caesar suffered an accident during his triumph, clearly indicating the wrath of Jupiter for his actions in the Civil Wars, he approached the hill and Jupiter&#x27;s temple on his knees as a way of averting the unlucky omen. Nevertheless, he was murdered six months later, and Brutus and his other assassins locked themselves inside the temple afterward. Vespasian&#x27;s brother and nephew were besieged in the temple during the Year of Four Emperors (69). During this incident the temple was destroyed by fire. 

The Tabularium, located underground beneath the piazza and hilltop, occupies a building of the same name built in the 1st century BC to hold Roman records of state. The Tabularium looks out from the rear onto the Roman Forum. The main attraction of the Tabularium, besides the structure itself, is the Temple of Veiovis.
During the lengthy period of ancient Rome, the Capitoline Hill was the geographical and ceremonial center. However, by the Renaissance era, the former center was an untidy conglomeration of dilapidated buildings and the site of executions of criminals.

==Medieval history==
The church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli is adjacent to the square, located near where the ancient &quot;arx&quot;, or citadel, atop the hill it once stood. At its base are the remains of a Roman &quot;insula&quot;, with more than four storeys visible from the street.

In the Middle Ages, the hill&#x27;s sacred function was obscured by its other role as the center of the civic government of Rome, revived as a commune in the 12th century. Rome&#x27;s government was now firmly under papal control, but the Capitoline was the scene of movements of urban resistance, such as the dramatic scenes of Cola di Rienzo&#x27;s revived republic.

In 1144, a revolt by the citizens against the authority of the Pope and nobles led to a senator taking up his official residence on the Capitoline Hill. The senator&#x27;s new palazzo turned its back on the ancient forum, beginning the change in orientation on the hill that Michelangelo later accentuated. A small piazza was laid out in front of the senator&#x27;s palazzo, intended for communal purposes. In the middle of the 14th century, the guilds&#x27; court of justice was constructed on the southern end of the piazza. This later housed the Conservatori in the 15th century. As a result, the piazza was already surrounded by buildings by the 16th century.

==Michelangelo==

The existing design of the Piazza del Campidoglio and the surrounding palazzi was created by Renaissance artist and architect Michelangelo Buonarroti in 1536–1546. At the height of his fame, he was commissioned by the Farnese Pope Paul III, who wanted a symbol of the new Rome to impress Charles V, who was expected in 1538. This offered him the opportunity to build a monumental civic plaza for a major city as well as to reestablish the grandeur of Rome.

Michelangelo&#x27;s first designs for the piazza and remodeling of the surrounding palazzi date from 1536. His plan was formidably extensive. He accentuated the reversal of the classical orientation of the Capitoline, in a symbolic gesture turning Rome&#x27;s civic center to face away from the Roman Forum and instead in the direction of Papal Rome and the Christian church in the form of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. This full half circle turn can also be seen as Michelangelo&#x27;s desire to address the new, developing section of the city rather than the ancient ruins of the past. 

An equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was to stand in the middle of the piazza set in a paved oval field. Michelangelo was commissioned to provide a setting for the statue and to bring order to an irregular hilltop already encumbered by two crumbling medieval buildings set at an acute angle to one another. The Palazzo del Senatore was to be restored with a double outer stairway, and the campanile moved to the center axis of the palazzo. 

The Palazzo dei Conservatori was to be restored, and a new building, the so-called Palazzo Nuovo, built at the same angle on the north side of the piazza to offset the Conservatori, creating a trapezoidal piazza. A wall and balustrade were to be built at the front of the square, giving it a firm delineation on the side facing the city. A flight of steps was to lead up to the enclosed piazza from below, further accentuating the central axis.

The sequence, cordonata, piazza, and the central palazzo are the first urban introduction of the &quot;cult of the axis&quot; that was to occupy Italian garden plans and reach fruition in France.

Executing the design was slow: Little was actually completed in Michelangelo&#x27;s lifetime. The &quot;Cordonata Capitolina&quot; was not in place when Emperor Charles arrived, and the imperial party had to scramble up the slope from the Forum to view the works in progress. Work continued faithfully to his designs and the Campidoglio was completed in the 17th century, except for the paving design, which was finished three centuries later.

===Piazza===

The bird&#x27;s-eye view of the engraving by Étienne Dupérac shows Michelangelo&#x27;s solution to the problems of the space in the Piazza del Campidoglio. Even with their new facades centering them on the new palazzo at the rear, the space was a trapezoid, and the facades did not face each other squarely. Worse still, the whole site sloped, to the left in the engraving. Michelangelo&#x27;s solution was radical.

The three remodelled palazzi enclose a harmonious trapezoidal space, approached by the ramped staircase called the cordonata. The stepped ramp of the cordonata was intended, like a slow-moving escalator, to lift its visitors toward the sky and deposit them on the threshold of municipal authority. The oval shape combined with the diamond pattern within it was a play on the previous Renaissance geometries of the circle and square. The travertine design set into the paving is perfectly level: Around its perimeter, low steps arise and die away into the paving as the slope requires.

Its centre springs slightly, so that one senses that he/she is standing on the exposed segment of a gigantic egg all but buried at the centre of the city at the centre of the world, as Michelangelo&#x27;s historian Charles de Tolnay pointed out. An interlaced twelve-pointed star makes a subtle reference to the constellations, revolving around this space called &quot;Caput mundi&quot;, Latin for &quot;head of the world.&quot; This paving design was never executed by the popes, who may have detected a subtext of less-than-Christian import, but Benito Mussolini ordered the paving completed to Michelangelo&#x27;s design in 1940.

Michelangelo looked at the center to find a solution to the Capitoline disorder. The statue provided a center and a focus. The buildings defined the space, and it is this space, as much as the buildings, that is the impressive achievement of the Capitoline complex. It is a giant outdoor room, a plaza enclosed and protected but open to the sky and accessible through five symmetrical openings. Axiality and symmetry govern all parts of the Campidoglio. The aspect of the piazza that makes this most immediately apparent is the central statue, with the paving pattern directing the visitors&#x27; eyes to its base. Michelangelo also gave the medieval Palazzo del Senatore a central campanile, a renovated façade, and a grand divided external staircase. He designed a new façade for the colonnaded Palazzo dei Conservatori and projected an identical structure, the Palazzo Nuovo, for the opposite side of the piazza. On the narrow side of the trapezoidal plan, he extended the central axis with a magnificent stair to link the hilltop with the city below.
====Marcus Aurelius====

In the middle, and not to Michelangelo&#x27;s liking, stood the original equestrian statue of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Michelangelo provided an unassuming pedestal for it. The sculpture was held in regard because it was thought to depict Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor. The bronze now in position is a modern copy; the original is in the Palazzo dei Conservatori nearby.

===Palazzi===

Michelangelo provided new fronts to the two official buildings of Rome&#x27;s civic government, the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Palazzo Senatorio, and Palazzo Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed the Palazzo Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to the ragged ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death under the supervision of Tommaso dei Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the segmental pediments over their windows, which give a slight spring to the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.

====Palazzo Caffarelli Clementino====
Adjacent and now serving as an annex to the Palazzo dei Conservatori is Palazzo Caffarelli Clementino; here, short-term exhibitions are held. The palazzo was built between 1576 and 1583 by Gregory Canonico for Gian Pietro Caffarelli II. The remaining ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus were destroyed in order to construct the palace. Until the cessation of World War I, the palazzo served as the German Embassy to Rome. Following the war, it was claimed by the Comune di Roma, which demolished a large section of the palazzo&#x27;s east wing to create the Caffarelli Terrace.

====Palazzo dei Conservatori====
The Palazzo dei Conservatori (&quot;Palazzo of the Conservators&quot;) was built in the Middle Ages for the local magistrates (named &quot;Conservatori of Rome&quot;) on top of a sixth-century BC temple dedicated to Jupiter &quot;Maximus Capitolinus&quot;. Michelangelo&#x27;s renovation of it incorporated the first use of a giant order that spanned two storeys, here with a range of Corinthian pilasters and subsidiary Ionic columns flanking the ground-floor loggia openings and the second-floor windows. Michelangelo&#x27;s new portico is a reinvention of older ideas. The portico contains entablatures and a flat, coffered ceiling.

The entablatures rest on columns set at the front of each bay, while matching half-columns stand against the back wall. Each pilaster forms a compound unit with the pier and column on either side of it. Colossal pilasters set on large bases join the portico and the upper story. All of the windows are capped with segmental pediments. A balustrade fringing the roof emphasizes the emphatic horizontality of the whole against which the vertical lines of the orders rise in majestic contrast. The verticality of the colossal order creates the feeling of a self-contained space while the horizontality of the entablatures and balustrades emphasize the longitudinal axis of the piazza. The palazzo&#x27;s facade was updated by Michelangelo in the 1530s and again later numerous times.

In Rome, the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori sheltered offices of various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, unless they were of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, such as that of the conservatori. It was a natural place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the Campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.

====Palazzo Senatorio====

Built during the 13th and 14th centuries, the Palazzo Senatorio (&quot;Senatorial palace&quot;) stands atop the Tabularium, which had once housed the archives of ancient Rome. Peperino blocks from the Tabularium were re-used in the left side of the palazzo and a corner of the bell tower. It now houses the Roman city hall, after having been converted into a residence by Giovanni Battista Piranesi for the Senator Abbondio Rezzonico in the 18th century. 

Its double ramp of stairs was designed by Michelangelo. This double stairway to the palazzo replaced the old flight of steps and two-storied loggia, which had stood on the right side of the palazzo. The staircase cannot be seen solely in terms of the building to which it belongs but must be set in the context of the piazza as a whole. The steps, beginning at the center of each wing, move gently upward until they reach the inner corner, level off and recede to the main surface of the façade. They then continue an unbroken stateliness toward each other, converging on the central doorway of the second story. 

This interruption of the diagonal line and the brief inward change of direction both absorbs the central axis and links the two sides. The fountain in front of the staircase features the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile as well as Dea Roma. The upper part of the facade was designed by Michelangelo with colossal corinthian pilasters harmonizing with the two other buildings. Its bell-tower was designed by Martino Longhi the Elder and built between 1578 and 1582. Its current facade was built by Giacomo della Porta and Girolamo Rainaldi.

====Palazzo Nuovo====
To close off the piazza&#x27;s symmetry and cover up the tower of the Aracoeli, the Palazzo Nuovo was constructed in 1603, finished in 1654, and opened to the public in 1734. Its facade duplicates to that of Palazzo dei Conservatori. In other words, it is an identical copy made using Michelangelo&#x27;s blueprint when he redesigned the Palazzo dei Conservatori a century earlier.

===Balustrade===
A balustrade, punctuated by sculptures atop the giant pilasters, capped the composition, one of the most influential of Michelangelo&#x27;s designs. The two massive ancient statues of Castor and Pollux that decorate the balustrades are not the same as those posed by Michelangelo, which now are in front of the Palazzo del Quirinale.

===Cordonata===

Next to the older and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair, the cordonata, gradually ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.

On the grassy incline to the northwest of the cordonata is the Monument to Cola di Rienzo installed in 1886.

== Influence ==
Influenced by Roman architecture and Roman republican times, the word &quot;Capitolium&quot; still lives in the English word &quot;&quot;. The Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. is widely assumed to be named after the Capitoline Hill.

<doc id="144904" wikidata="Q7328862" url="?curid=144904" title="Visual thinking">
<text>Visual thinking, also called visual or spatial learning or picture thinking, is the phenomenon of thinking through visual processing. Visual thinking has been described as seeing words as a series of pictures. It is common in approximately 60–65% of the general population. &quot;Real picture thinkers&quot;, those who use visual thinking almost to the exclusion of other kinds of thinking, make up a smaller percentage of the population. Research by child development theorist Linda Kreger Silverman suggests that less than 30% of the population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking, another 45% uses both visual/spatial thinking and thinking in the form of words, and 25% thinks exclusively in words. According to Kreger Silverman, of the 30% of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be true &quot;picture thinkers&quot;.

==Non-verbal thought==
Thinking in mental images is one of a number of other recognized forms of non-verbal thought processes, such as kinesthetic, musical, and mathematical thinking.

===Learning styles===
The acknowledgement and application of different cognitive and learning styles, including visual, kinesthetic, musical, mathematical, and verbal thinking styles, are a common part of many current teacher training courses. Those who think in pictures have generally claimed to be best at visual learning.

Empirical research shows that there is no evidence that identifying a student&#x27;s &quot;learning style&quot; produces better outcomes. There is significant evidence that the widespread &quot;meshing hypothesis&quot;, the assumption that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student&#x27;s learning style, is not fully studied in proper detail. “Of those that did use an appropriate method” of research, “several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis”.

===Linguistics===
A common assumption is that people think in language, and that language and thought influence each other. Linguistics studies how language is used and acquired.

The strong version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis in linguistics states that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories alone limit and determine cognitive categories. Although Whorf himself framed linguistic relativity in terms of &quot;habits of mind&quot; rather than determinism, the revolutionary nature of his hypothesis was met with much misinterpretation and criticism. In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay rejected the strong hypothesis using a color terminology study.

Steven Pinker notes that we are not born with language, so that it is not likely that we are engineered to think in words alone.

===Multiple intelligences===
Gardner&#x27;s multiple intelligences theory recognises various forms of intelligence, namely spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic. Gardner&#x27;s theory is discussed and cited in many of David A Sousa&#x27;s &#x27;How the Brain learns&#x27; series of books, including &#x27;How the Gifted Brain learns&#x27; and &#x27;How the Special Needs Brain Learns&#x27;. Areas of competence may be reinforcing, but also mutually exclusive. In today&#x27;s society the link between IQ and education has weakened, but the idea of educated and intelligent has become synonymous, interchangeable and reinforced by verbalizers being better able to internalize information, advocate systems and design jobs that monetarily reward strengths, a cycle that is self-perpetuating.

===Split-brain research===
According to Roger Sperry the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere perform different tasks. The left and right hemisphere may be simultaneously conscious in different, even mutually conflicting, mental experiences that run in parallel. The right [non-verbal] hemisphere perceives, thinks, remembers, reasons, wills and emotes, all at a characteristically human level.

Research which builds on Sperry&#x27;s split brain research is reinforced by anecdotal evidence, which supports the premise that different architectures lend themselves to one of the channels, at the expense of the others.

===Spatial-temporal reasoning and spatial visualization ability===
Spatial-temporal reasoning is the ability to visualize special patterns and mentally manipulate them over a time-ordered sequence of spatial transformations. Spatial visualization ability is the ability to manipulate mentally two- and three-dimensional figures.

Spatial-temporal reasoning is prominent among visual thinkers as well as among kinesthetic learners (those who learn through movement, physical patterning and doing) and logical thinkers (mathematical thinkers who think in patterns and systems) who may not be strong visual thinkers at all.

===Problem solving===
Visual thinking is also referenced in problem-solving. Inspired by Albert Einstein&#x27;s visualized thought experiments, &quot;Image Streaming&quot; uses active visualization to rapidly explore a problem and generate multiple solution options. The technique was developed and formalized in the 1980s by Win Wenger. It involves visualizing and describing vivid mental images in detail while speaking out loud about the image and its various components.

===Photographic memory===
Eidetic memory (photographic memory) may co-occur in visual thinkers as much as in any type of thinking style as it is a memory function associated with having vision rather than a thinking style. Eidetic memory can still occur in those with visual agnosia, who, unlike visual thinkers, may be limited in the use of visualization skills for mental reasoning.

Psychologist E.R Jaensch states that eidetic memory as part of visual thinking has to do with eidetic images fading between the line of the after image and the memory image. A fine relationship may exist between the after image and the memory image, which causes visual thinkers from not seeing the eidetic image but rather drawing upon perception and useful information. Individuals diagnosed with agnosia, may not be able to perform mental reasoning.

== Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) in teaching==
VTS allows teachers to teach reading with the use of complex visuals, rather than the print and individual text forms used in the past.

==Concurrency with dyslexia and autism==

===Dyslexia===
Research suggests that dyslexia is a symptom of a predominant visual/spatial learning. Morgan used the term &#x27;word blindness,&#x27; in 1896. Hinselwood expanded on &#x27;word blindness&#x27; to describe the reversing of letters and similar phenomena in the 1900s. Orton suggested that individuals have difficulty associating the visual with the verbal form of words, in 1925. Further studies, using technologies (PET and MRI), and wider and varied user groups in various languages, support the earlier findings. Visual-spatial symptoms (dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, Auditory processing disorder and the like) arise in non-visual and non-spatial environments and situations; hence, visual/spatial learning is aggravated by an education system based upon information presented in written text instead of presented via multimedia and hands-on experience.

===Autism===
Visual thinking has been argued by Temple Grandin to be an origin for delayed speech in people with autism. It has been suggested that visual thinking has some necessary connection with autism. Functional imaging studies on people with autism have supported the hypothesis that they have a cognitive style that favors the use of visuospatial coding strategies. However, the existence of people with both Aphantasia and autism brings this theory into question.

==Art and design education==

Concepts related to visual thinking have played an important role in art and design education over the past several decades, but this has not always been the case. In Ancient Greece, Plato tended to place an emphasis on music to aid cognition in the education of heroes because of its mathematical tendencies and &quot;harmonies of the cosmos&quot;. On the other hand, visual images, paintings in particular, caused the reliances on &quot;illusionary images&quot; However, in the Western world, children begin primary school with abstract thought and shapes, but as we grow older, according to Rudolf Arnheim, &quot;arts are reduced to a desirable supplement&quot; The general world trend in the late twentieth century caused an emphases towards scientific, mathematical, and quantitative approach to education, and art education is often refuted because it is based on perception. It is qualitative and subjective which makes it difficult to measure and evaluate.

However, fundamentals in visual thinking lay the ground work for many design disciplines such as art and architecture. Two of the most influential aspects of visual composition in these disciplines are patterns and color. Patterns are not only prevalent in many different aspects of everyday life, but it is also telling about our interpretation of the world. In addition, there are now studied approaches to how color should be used in design where &quot;the functional aesthetics of colour can be reduced to a small number of guidelines and lists the main properties needed to make design decisions leading to visual clarity&quot;.

At the same time, techniques in art and design can open up pathways to stimulate the thought process and problem solving. Sketches offer an unrestrained way to get thoughts down on paper through the &quot;abstract representations of ideas and idea structures&quot;. In this way, sketching not only helps to generate ideas, but also to reflect and edit them as well. It is also an effective means of communication, especially for architects and engineers, for translating ideas from designer to client. Despite all the advantages of integrating art and visuals into education, it is a difficult skill to master. Those who can are well versed in visual analysis. It takes a lot of practice to have sketches evolve from &quot;meaningless scribbles&quot; to a complex &quot;thinking tool&quot;.

<doc id="144913" wikidata="Q805385" url="?curid=144913" title="Bally Astrocade">
<text>The Bally Astrocade (also known as Bally Arcade and initially as Bally ABA-1000) is a second-generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, at that time the videogame division of Bally. It was originally announced as the &quot;Bally Home Library Computer&quot; in October 1977 and initially made available for mail order in December 1977. But due to production delays, the units were first released to stores in April 1978 and its branding changed to &quot;Bally Professional Arcade&quot;. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.

== History ==

=== Nutting and Midway ===
In the late 1970s, Midway contracted Dave Nutting Associates to design a video display chip that could be used in all of their videogame systems, from standup arcade games, to a home computer system. The system Nutting delivered was used in most of Midway&#x27;s classic arcade games of the era, including &quot;Gorf&quot; and &quot;Wizard of Wor&quot;. The chipset supported what was at that time relatively high resolution of 320×204 in four colours per line, although to access this mode required memory that could be accessed at a faster rate than the common 2 MHz dynamic RAM of the era.

=== Console use ===
Originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer, it was released in 1977 but available only through mail order. Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until 1978, and by this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade. In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure (unlike the Atari VCS). In 1979, Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division, including development and production of the game console.

At about the same time, a third-party group had been unsuccessfully attempting to bring their own console design to market as the Astrovision. A corporate buyer from Montgomery Ward who was in charge of the Bally system put the two groups in contact, and a deal was eventually arranged. In 1981 they re-released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free, this time known as the Bally Computer System, with the name changing again, in 1982, to Astrocade. It sold under this name until the video game crash of 1983, and then disappeared around 1985.

Midway had long been planning to release an expansion system for the unit, known as the ZGRASS-100. The system was being developed by a group of computer artists at the University of Illinois at Chicago known as the &#x27;Circle Graphics Habitat&#x27;, along with programmers at Nutting. Midway felt that such a system, in an external box, would make the Astrocade more interesting to the market. However it was still not ready for release when Bally sold off the division. A small handful may have been produced as the ZGRASS-32 after the machine was re-released by Astrovision.

The system, combined into a single box, would eventually be released as the Datamax UV-1. Aimed at the home computer market while being designed, the machine was now re-targeted as a system for outputting high-quality graphics to videotape. These were offered for sale some time between 1980 and 1982, but it is unknown how many were built.

== Description ==

The basic system was powered by a Zilog Z80 driving the display chip with a RAM buffer in between the two. The display chip had two modes, a low-resolution mode at 160 × 102, and a high-resolution mode at 320 × 204, both with 2-bits per pixel for four colors. This sort of color/resolution was normally beyond the capabilities of RAM of the era, which could not read out the data fast enough to keep up with the TV display. The system used page mode addressing allowing them to read one &quot;line&quot; at a time at very high speed into a buffer inside the display chip. The line could then be read out to the screen at a more leisurely rate, while also interfering less with the CPU, which was also trying to use the same memory.

On the Astrocade the pins needed to use this &quot;trick&quot; were not connected. Thus the Astrocade system was left with just the lower resolution 160 × 102 mode. In this mode the system used up 160 × 102 × 2bits = 4080 bytes of memory to hold the screen. Since the machine had only 4kiB (4096 bytes) of RAM, this left very little room for program functions such as keeping score and game options. The rest of the program would have to be placed in ROM.

The Astrocade used color registers, or &quot;color indirection&quot;, so the four colors could be picked from a palette of 256 colors. Color animation was possible by changing the values of the registers, and using a horizontal blank interrupt they could be changed from line to line. An additional set of four color registers could be &quot;swapped in&quot; at any point along the line, allowing the creation of two screen &quot;halves&quot;, split vertically. Originally intended to allow creation of a score area on the side of the screen, programmers also used this feature to emulate 8 color modes.

Unlike the VCS, the Astrocade did not include hardware sprite support. It did, however, include a blitter-like system and software to drive it. Memory above 0x4000 was dedicated to the display, and memory below that to the ROM. If a program wrote to the ROM space (normally impossible, it is &quot;read only&quot; after all) the video chip would take the data, apply a function to it, and then copy the result into the corresponding location in the RAM. Which function to use was stored in a register in the display chip, and included common instructions like XOR and bit-shift. This allowed the Astrocade to support any number of sprite-like objects independent of hardware, with the downside that it was up to the software to re-draw them when they moved.

The Astrocade was one of the early cartridge-based systems, using cartridges known as &quot;Videocades&quot; that were designed to be as close in size and shape as possible to a cassette tape. The unit also included two games built into the ROM, &quot;Gunfight&quot; and &quot;Checkmate&quot;, along with the simple but useful Calculator and a &quot;doodle&quot; program called Scribbling. Most cartridges included two games, and when they were inserted the machine would reset and display a menu starting with the programs on the cartridge and then listing the four built-in programs. 

The Astrocade featured a relatively complex input device incorporating several types of control mechanisms: the controller was shaped as a pistol-style grip with trigger switch on the front; a small 4-switch/8-way joystick was placed on top of the grip, and the shaft of the joystick connected to a potentiometer, meaning that the stick could be rotated to double as a paddle controller.

On the front of the unit was a 24-key &quot;hex-pad&quot; keyboard used for selecting games and options as well as operating the calculator. On the back were a number of ports, including connectors for power, the controllers, and an expansion port. One oddity was that the top rear of the unit was empty, and could be opened to store up to 15 cartridges. The system&#x27;s ability to be upgraded from a video game console to personal computer along with its library of nearly 30 games in 1982 are some reasons that made it more versatile than its main competitors, and was listed by Jeff Rovin as one of the seven major video game suppliers.

== Astro BASIC ==
The Astrocade also included a BASIC programming language cartridge, written by Jamie Fenton, who expanded Li-Chen Wang&#x27;s Palo Alto Tiny BASIC. First published as Bally BASIC in 1978. 

Developing a BASIC interpreter on the system was difficult, because the display alone used up almost all the available RAM. The solution to this problem was to store the BASIC program code in the video RAM.

This was accomplished by interleaving every bit of the program along with the display itself; BASIC used all the even-numbered bits, and the display the odd-numbered bits. The interpreter would read out two bytes, drop all the odd-numbered bits, and assemble the results into a single byte of code. This was rendered invisible by setting two of the colors to be the same as the other two, such that colors codice_1 and codice_2 would be the same (white), so the presence, or lack, of a bit for BASIC had no effect on the screen. Additional memory was scavenged by using fewer lines vertically, only 88 instead of the full 102. This managed to squeeze out 1760 bytes of RAM for BASIC programs. The downside was that most of the graphics system&#x27;s power was unavailable.

Programs were entered via the calculator keypad, with a plastic overlay displaying letters, symbols, and BASIC keywords. These were selected through a set of 4 colored shift keys. For example; typing &quot;WORD&quot;(gold) shift then the &quot;+&quot; key would result in codice_3.

A simple line editor was supported. After typing the line number corresponding to an existing program, each press of the PAUSE key would load the next character from memory.

An Astro BASIC program that later became commercialized is &quot;Artillery Duel&quot;. John Perkins wrote the game first and submitted it to &quot;The Arcadian&quot; fanzine, from which it was adapted for the Astro BASIC manual. Perkins subsequently developed the Astrocade cartridge of the game.

=== Language features ===
Astro BASIC supported the following keywords:
* Commands: codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7
* Statements: codice_8, codice_9
* Structure: codice_3, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13 (but no codice_14 and no codice_15), codice_16
* Graphics: codice_17, codice_18, codice_19
* Tape Commands: codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23
* Functions: codice_24, codice_25, codice_26 (specified joystick&#x27;s horizontal position), codice_27 (joystick vertical position), codice_28 (knob status), codice_29 (pixel on or off), codice_30, codice_31 (trigger status)
* Built-in variables
** (read only): codice_32 (key press), codice_33 (remainder of last division), codice_34 (memory size), codice_35 (last LINE position)
** (write only): codice_36 (scroll mode), codice_37 (display ASCII character)
** (read/write): codice_38 (background color), codice_39 codice_40 (cursor position), codice_41 (foreground color), codice_42 (note time),
* Math: + - × ÷
* Relational operators: &lt; &gt; = # [not equal] [the language did not support: &lt;= =&gt; &lt;&gt;]
* Logical operators: × [AND] + [OR]

A period codice_43 at the start of the line was equivalent to codice_44 in other BASIC implementations. Certain commands were handled by the keypad instead of by keywords: the RESET button was equivalent to codice_45 in other interpreters. 

The language supported 26 integer variables codice_46 to codice_47, and two pre-defined arrays, codice_48 - which was stored starting after the program, ascending - and codice_49 - which was stored from the top of memory, descending. The language lacked a codice_50 statement for dimensioning the arrays, the size of which was determined by available memory (codice_34) not used by the program listing (2 bytes per item). Ports were accessed via the array codice_52, and memory was accessed via the array codice_53, rather than using PEEK and POKE. While the language lacked strings, codice_32 would provide the ASCII value of a key press, which could be output to codice_55, meaning that characters could be read in from the keyboard, stored in an array, and then output.

The character display was 11 lines of 26 characters across. The resolution for the graphic commands is 88x160, with X ranging from -80 to 79 and Y ranging from -44 to 43.

Music could be produced in four ways:
# The codice_8 command, as a side effect, produced a unique tone for each character or keyword displayed.
# The codice_57 variable converted numbers into notes.
# Ports 16 through 23 accessed a music synthesizer.
# The sound-synthesizer variables codice_58 (master oscillator), codice_59 (Noise Mode), codice_60 (Noise Volume), codice_61 (Tone A), codice_62 (Tone B), codice_63 (Tone C), codice_64 (Voice A volume), codice_65 (Voice B volume), codice_66 (Voice C volume), codice_67 (Vibrato Frequency), codice_68 (VibRato). (Added to Astro BASIC but not in Bally BASIC.)

=== Sample code ===
The following sample program from the manual demonstrates the joystick input and graphics functions. &quot;Try your skill... The first player&#x27;s knob moves the phaser left or right and the trigger shoots... Player two controls the target while player one shoots.&quot; 

This listing illustrates how keywords, which were tokenized, were always displayed with a following space.

== ZGRASS ==
The ZGRASS unit sat under the Astrocade and turned it into a &quot;real&quot; computer, including a full keyboard, a math co-processor (FPU), 32k of RAM, and a new 32k ROM containing the GRASS programming language (sometimes referred to as GRAFIX on this machine). The unit also added I/O ports for a cassette and floppy disk, allowing it to be used with CP/M.

== Reception ==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Bally Professional Astrocade&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting that &quot;Our favorite cartridges are the classic Gunfight, Red Baron air war, and Demolition Derby.&quot;

Danny Goodman of &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; stated in 1983 that Astrocade &quot;has one of the best graphics and sound packages of any home video game&quot;.

== Specifications ==

=== Circuit board and cartridges ===
* CPU: Zilog Z80, 1.789 MHz
* RAM: 4 kB (up to 64 kB with external modules in the expansion port)
* ROM: 8 kB
* Cart ROM: 8 kB
* Expansion: 64 kB total
* Ports: 4 controller, 1 expansion, 1 light pen

=== Audio ===

*Sound chip model: 0066-117XX, also known as the Music Processor, or a custom I/O chip since the sound chip also performs I/O functions.
*Channel capabilities: There are 3 square wave channels, all with a pitch accuracy of 8-bits (256 possible frequencies from which to choose), which can all play square waves. The chip also has a noise generator, which can be independent from the other 3 square wave channels, or it can add its value to the master oscillator that drives the 3 square wave channels. The master oscillator can be set to different frequencies, which means that the frequency range can be changed for the 3 square wave channels.
*Volume control: Each channel has independent 4-bit volume control.
*Miscellaneous features concerning sound: There are hardware registers for vibrato, with two bits for the vibrato speed and 6 bits for vibrato depth. This means that it wouldn&#x27;t be necessary for vibrato to be done entirely with software.

=== Video ===
*Resolution: True 160×102 / Basic 160×88 / Expanded RAM 320×204
*Colors: True 8* / Basic 2
**The bitmap structure of the Bally actually only allows for 4 color settings. However, through the use of 2 color palettes and a left/right boundary control byte you could have the left section of screen (this could be the play field) use 1 set of colors while the right side (this could show information such as lives and score) used an entirely different set of colors, thus 8 total colors were possible.
*Graphic type: Bitmap, 2 bit per pixel bit map.

<text>Battle of the Planets is an American adaptation of the Japanese anime series &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; (1972). Of the 105 original &quot;Gatchaman&quot; episodes, 85 were used in the &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; adaptation, produced by Sandy Frank Entertainment. The adaptation was generally faithful to the plot and character development of the original &quot;Gatchaman&quot; series, but significant additions and reductions were made in order to increase appeal to the North American television market of the late 1970s, as well as avoid controversy from parents; these included the removal of elements of graphic violence and profanity.

It was the most successful anime series in the United States during the 1970s, airing on 100 network affiliates during after-school hours by 1979. As of June 2013, Sentai Filmworks have licensed the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; franchise. An oft-delayed CGI film based on the franchise, &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, last slated for a 2011 release from Warner Bros., was officially canceled in June 2011. However, a live-action &quot;Gatchaman&quot; feature film was released in Japan in August 2013. As of 2018, the series has been made available for streaming on Hidive.

==History==
In April 1977, TV producer Sandy Frank attended the MIP-TV conference in Cannes. It was here Frank first encountered the Japanese animation &quot;Gatchaman&quot; from producer Tatsunoko Production run by the Yoshida brothers. Frank committed to a Western release after seeing how successful the film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was in May 1977.

&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; is the title of the American adaptation of this series created by Frank. New footage was authorized and Frank hired writers to add dialogue to fit the look of the animation, without reference to original scripts. Of the 105 original &quot;Gatchaman&quot; episodes, the adaptation used 85.

==Plot==
&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; cast five young people as G-Force, consisting of Mark, Jason, Princess, Keyop, and Tiny. G-Force protects Earth from the planet Spectra and other attacks from beyond space. The most prominent field commander of the Spectra forces was a villainous, masked individual known as Zoltar. Zoltar would receive his orders directly from a being he would refer to as the &quot;Luminous One&quot;. The Luminous One would appear as a ghost-like, disembodied, floating head. Who, or what, this being actually was, is never explained in any detail throughout the series.

The main ship of the G-Force team was called the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which could carry, transport, and deploy four smaller vehicles, each operated by one team member. The four vehicles included a futuristic race car with various hidden weapons driven by Jason; this vehicle was concealed within the Phoenix&#x27;s nosecone. The &quot;galacti-cycle&quot;, a futuristic motorcycle Princess rode, was stored within the left-wing capsule of the Phoenix. Keyop&#x27;s &quot;Space Bubble&quot;, an all-terrain, tank-like vehicle capable of VTOL as well as being a submersible craft, was held in the right storage capsule of the Phoenix. And lastly, a futuristic jet fighter Mark pilots was stored in the top rear section of the Phoenix command island structure, and which used its tail fin to make up the center tail fin of the Phoenix. The fifth crew member, Tiny, was assigned to pilot the &quot;Phoenix&quot; rather than one of the detachable craft.

A regularly featured plot device was the transformation of the Phoenix into a flaming bird-shaped craft able to handle virtually any exceptional situation for a brief period by essentially turning itself into pure energy called the Fiery Phoenix. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; primary weapon was a supply of rockets called &quot;TBX missiles&quot; in the series. It also occasionally flaunted a powerful solar-powered energy blaster, although the team had the misfortune of choosing very cloudy days to use it.

The G-Force team themselves would use a combination of martial arts skills, ninja-like weapons, and their &quot;cerebonic&quot; powers to dispatch hordes of enemy soldiers and overcome other obstacles. Their bird-like costumes include wing-like capes that could fan out and function nearly identically to parachutes and/or wingsuits, enabling the G-Force members to drift or glide down to safety from heights that would otherwise prove fatal.

The G-Force members stay in contact through a wrist-band communicator device which also serves as a way for them to change or &quot;transmute&quot; instantly from their civilian clothes into their G-Force uniforms, and back again. Other weapons seen displayed by various team members include Mark&#x27;s sonic boomerang, a bird-shaped boomerang with razor-sharp wings; Jason&#x27;s and Tiny&#x27;s multi-purpose gadget guns, which can be outfitted with grappling hook and line, drill bits, etc.; and Keyop&#x27;s and Princess&#x27;s yo-yo bombs, which could be used as bolas, darts, and explosive devices. Other weapons include feathers with a sharpened steel quill that could be used as deadly throwing darts and mini-grenades shaped like ball bearings with spike studs.

=== Key changes in the adaptation ===
The &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; adaptation differs significantly from &quot;Gatchaman&quot;. The difference is due to heavy editing made to make the show appealing to the audience in the United States by removing controversial elements (i.e. graphic violence, profanity, and a gender changing mutant) while adding elements reminiscent of the feature film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was popular at the time. In fact, the name &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; was an attempt to associate itself with the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. While the original &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was earthbound, dark-toned, and environmentally themed, the adaptation morphed it into a less violent outer space show with robot characters, although some environmental themes were kept, and this is also why the other planets to which G-Force traveled on missions looked very much like Earth. Setting, violence, objectionable language, and certain character fatalities were altered or eliminated by cutting scenes, dubbing, and explanatory voice-overs (for instance, claiming that the city had been evacuated before a battle scene that would show the incidental destruction of buildings and houses, as well as explaining away the destruction of the Earth armies and air forces as being robot tanks and fighter planes).

One of the most notable changes in the &quot;BotP&quot; adaptation involves the character Keyop (Jinpei in &quot;Gatchaman&quot;), who picked up a bizarre verbal tic of stuttering, chirping, and burbling every time he started to speak. There was a longstanding fan rumor that this was done because the original character spoke using much profanity and that Keyop&#x27;s excess mouth motion would cover up deleting the words. This was not true, as demonstrated by the existence of an unedited &quot;Gatchaman&quot; version released by ADV Films in the US, in which Jinpei rarely, if ever, used profanity. The in-story explanation for Keyop&#x27;s unique manner of speech is that he is an artificial life form with a speech impediment because of slightly defective genetic engineering.

The main villain, known as Zoltar in &quot;BotP&quot;, had an unusual background due to the gender changing mutant nature of the original Berg Katse character. In an episode where Katse&#x27;s female half was featured (&quot;BotP&quot; title: &quot;The Galaxy Girls&quot;), she was introduced as a separate character, Zoltar&#x27;s sister, for &quot;BotP&quot;. (A hint of her actual nature was retained in the name she used when masquerading as a human, Mala Latroz—&quot;Latroz&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Zoltar&quot;.)

To compensate for the other differences, a robot named 7-Zark-7—who watched over G-Force from their base, Center Neptune—performed explanatory voiceovers and light comic relief, which not only padded the time lost from editing but also filled in the gaps in the storyline. This device bears the influence of contemporary &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, with 7-Zark-7 having a visual appearance not dissimilar from R2-D2, and a somewhat camp personality in the style of C-3PO. Notionally, 7-Zark-7 ran the undersea monitoring station Center Neptune, from where he received information regarding incoming threats to Earth and relayed that information to G-Force. Zark and other added characters, such as 1-Rover-1, Zark&#x27;s robotic dog (who could hover from one side of the control room to the other by spinning his tail like a propeller, Muttley-style) and Susan (the early-warning computer whose sultry feminine voice often sent Zark into ecstasy) added to the cartoon&#x27;s youth appeal. Some additional footage was also animated showing G-Force members Mark and Princess (using their &quot;Gatchaman&quot; model sheets) interacting with Zark, as well putting an image of Mark on a video screen in the control room, helping his addition blend more smoothly into the existing &quot;Gatchaman&quot; footage (although there is a clear difference in quality between the Zark and the &quot;Gatchaman&quot; animation).

;Team variations in different versions

;Character variations across different versions
;Other notable changes

‡The original Japanese-language version of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; contains a small amount of English.

== Other media ==
=== Subsequent variations ===

In 1986, &quot;Gatchaman&quot; was re-worked in the US as &quot;G-Force: Guardians of Space&quot; by Turner, with a good deal of the original content edited out of &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; put back into the show. It followed the plot of the original &quot;Gatchaman&quot; much more faithfully than &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; because of this. Missing was Hoyt Curtin&#x27;s original score. New voice acting was used.

Two soundtrack albums and several DVDs have been released.

The two Japanese follow-up series, &quot;Gatchaman II&quot; and &quot;Gatchaman Fighter&quot;, were combined into 65 episodes and released as the Saban-produced show &quot;Eagle Riders&quot;. All 65 episodes aired in Australia, but in the United States, only 13 episodes were aired.

=== TV movie ===
A TV movie called &quot;Battle of the Planets: The Movie&quot; was made by Gallerie International Films and Sandy Frank Film Syndication. David Bret Egen was the voice of 7-Zark-7. Several episodes were compiled to create a new storyline that contained violence as well as deaths. It was considered for an uncut remake of &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;, but was scrapped when plans changed, as Frank began focusing efforts on arranging an uncut dub of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; instead.

=== Comic books ===

&quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; was also released in comic book form, originally by Gold Key Comics, but later revamped by Top Cow Productions. Among the Top Cow comic books was &quot;Battle of the Planets: Princess&quot;, written by David Wohl with art by Wilson Tortosa, released in 2002. A &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; comic strip ran in the British &quot;TV Comic&quot;. The &quot;TV Comic&quot; issues which feature the &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; strip run from #1530 (17 April 1981) to #1671 (30 December 1983). &quot;TV Comic&quot; also reprinted some of the Gold Key stories for two &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; holiday specials and one &quot;TV Comic&quot; holiday special. There was also a &quot;Battle of the Planets Annual&quot; which reprinted some of the Gold Key stories.

==Voice cast==
Apart from the pilot episode, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; featured a generic end credits sequence which only credited the regular cast, Alan Young, Casey Kasem, Janet Waldo, Ronnie Schell, Keye Luke and Alan Dinehart. But in addition to the regulars, several uncredited &#x27;guest&#x27; performers voiced secondary characters in many of the episodes. These included Takayo Fischer, William Woodson (who was also the announcer for the opening titles, episode previews and trailers), Frank Maxwell, Edward Andrews, Wendy Young (daughter of Alan Young), and David Jolliffe (who also voiced Jason in the pilot). The pilot episode featured a different end credits sequence which also credited Jolliffe, William Woodson and Alan Oppenheimer. It is unclear which character Oppenheimer voiced in the episode (it may have been Gorok, the episode&#x27;s villain; or it may have been Chief Anderson, who was cut from the final version of the episode), and he never worked on the series again.

Regular Cast:
*Alan Young as 7-Zark-7, Keyop, additional voices
*Casey Kasem as Mark, additional voices
*Ronnie Schell as Jason (regular voice), Tiny (episode 1), additional voices
*Keye Luke as Zoltar, the Spirit, Cronos, additional voices

==Legacy==
===Scrapped reboot===
An animated reboot, with the working subtitle &quot;Phoenix Ninjas&quot;, was planned to have been produced by Nelvana, d-rights and Tatsunoko. Aimed at the 6-11 male demographic, the project was conceived when d-rights expressed interest in Nelvana rebooting the franchise following the success of the second generation of &quot;&quot;. No new information on the project has surfaced since 2016 and it appears to be scrapped as Nelvana&#x27;s parent company Corus Entertainment removed the press release from their official website.

===Live-action film===
It was announced at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con that Joe and Anthony Russo are producing a live-action &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; film through their production company, AGBO, with the possibility of directing. On July 22, 2021, it was announced the duo have brought Daniel Casey to write the script. In a video interview with AP Entertainment on July 1, 2022, Joe Russo said they are still working on the movie.

<text>Ashton is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The commercial center of Ashton lies at the junction of Route 108 (Ashton Road) and New Hampshire Avenue (Route 650). Ashton MD is the home of many devious tales such as &quot;The Dark Knight of Ashton&quot;, named after an infamous character in Ashton Lore, along with being home to Business Speaks Podcast Co-Host, Evan Keem. The etymology of Ashton is unclear, as some longtime residents claim that it comes from reference to a large ash tree that stood at the junction of routes 108 and 650. Others have stated that it is a portmanteau of the names of two Thomas family homes, Ashland and Clifton, each located one mile from the junction.

The United States Census Bureau combines Ashton with the nearby community of Sandy Spring to form the census-designated place of Ashton-Sandy Spring, and all census data are tabulated for this combined entity.

==Development==

The &quot;Ashton Master Plan&quot; (1998) contains a vision &quot;to preserve the character of Sandy Spring/Ashton as an historic rural community.&quot; However, this goal is in conflict with the trend towards development of the area. The plan itself notes that &quot;reliance on a zoning strategy that permitted large-lot, low-density development pattern and clustering around the village centers has not been as effective in maintaining the rural character, as originally envisioned.&quot; In 2020, significant development efforts have begun pursuant to the Ashton Village Center Sector Plan.

Several projects are underway: (see Development Projects in Montgomery County, MD)
* CVS Ashton (2014) - complete
* Ashton Market (2019) - in progress
* Olive Branch Community Church - in progress

<text>Sandy Spring is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States.

==Geography==
Sandy Spring&#x27;s boundaries are roughly defined as Brooke Road and Dr. Bird Road to the north and west, Ednor Road to the south, and New Hampshire Avenue to the east.

The United States Census Bureau combines Sandy Spring with the nearby community of Ashton to form the census-designated place of Ashton-Sandy Spring, and all census data are tabulated for this combined entity.

==History==
The community was founded by Quakers who arrived in the early 18th century searching for land where they could grow tobacco and corn.

One of the very early land owners in the Sandy Spring area was Richard Snowden, who patented (purchased) the &quot;Snowden&#x27;s Manor&quot; in 1715. Snowden gradually enlarged his property with additional land purchases over the next few decades until it was surveyed at over as &quot;Snowden&#x27;s Manor Enlarged&quot; in 1743.

Another important early landowner, Major John Bradford, had patented over in the Sandy Spring area, including &quot;Charley Forest&quot; in 1716, &quot;Charley Forest Enlarged&quot;, &quot;Higham&quot;, and &quot;Discovery.&quot; Bradford sold off large parts of these properties, but Snowden&#x27;s son-in-law, James Brooke, later bought up the original Charley Forest land as well as other land in the area, eventually owning over by the 1760s.

The Quakers built their current brick meeting house in 1817, replacing a 1770 frame meeting house. Quakers first began worshiping in the area circa 1753. The site is near a fresh-water spring that gave its name to the community. The location of this meeting house in the village of Sandy Spring helped to define the geographic extent of the greater Sandy Spring neighborhood of the time, comprising those areas from which members of the Meeting could travel to and from the meeting house by horse or carriage in one day, arriving home before sunset. The greater Sandy Spring neighborhood thus includes the current communities of Brookeville, Olney, Norbeck, Ednor, Brighton, and other communities within a six-mile radius of the meeting house.

In the late 19th century the community started a local school called the Sherwood Academy. This school was turned over to the Government of Montgomery County in 1906 to become Sherwood High School, the county&#x27;s third public high school. A Quaker school, Sandy Spring Friends School, was established in 1961. In 1967 a Quaker retirement community, Friends House, was founded next to the school. 
The Sandy Spring Library opened behind the Sandy Spring Store in 1842. The Farmer&#x27;s Club of Sandy Spring was established in 1844 to discuss preferable methods of farming.

A 1901 Department of Labor study documented hundreds of residents who trace their lineage 125 years to free black families.

===Benjamin Hallowell===
Benjamin Hallowell (educator) (1799–1887) was a prominent Quaker in 19th century Sandy Spring. As an educator, he taught at Fair Hill in Olney, then taught in Virginia. He lived at Rockland in Olney. His farm is now the Hallowell housing development. He briefly served as the first president of the Maryland Agricultural College (later to become the University of Maryland.) He was integral in forming the Sandy Spring Farmer&#x27;s Club and the Mutual Fire Insurance Company.

===Dr. Bird===
Dr Jacob Wheeler Bird was born in Anne Arundel County in 1885. He attended St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, and he earned his medical degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore in 1907.

In 1909, Dr. Bird moved to Sandy Spring to set up his medical practice on the road now named for him, Dr. Bird Road. He also established the first hospital located in Montgomery County, now called Montgomery General Hospital.

During his fifty-year medical career, Dr. Bird made house calls to his patients, at first in a horse-drawn buggy and later an automobile. He founded Montgomery General Hospital in February 1920.

Dr. Bird and his wife died in an automobile accident in Alabama on October 25, 1959.

===Sandy Spring Museum===

An insurance salesman and auctioneer named Delmas Wood started the Sandy Spring Museum in 1980 because he thought Sandy Spring&#x27;s history was gradually being lost as older residents died. Wood wanted a place to preserve antique furniture, farm equipment, photographs, paintings, and documents of the Sandy Spring area. Florence Virginia Barrett Lehman also helped found the museum.

The museum was originally located in the basement of a Sandy Spring National Bank branch in Olney. In October 1986, it moved to Tall Timbers, a brick four-story Colonial house that had been the home of Gladys Brooke Tumbleson, who had died earlier that year. Tumbleson descended from the Brooke family, for which nearby Brookeville was named. Tumbleson sold the building to the museum for less than market value.

Helen Bentley donated of land on Bentley Road in Sandy Spring to the museum in 1994. The museum&#x27;s new building on opened in 1997, providing more room for the museum&#x27;s exhibits.

In 2007, an addition opened, providing a research library and a collections storage facility for the museum.

<doc id="144921" wikidata="Q754478" url="?curid=144921" title="Chevy Chase, Maryland">
<text>Chevy Chase () is the colloquial name of an area that includes a town, several incorporated villages, and an unincorporated census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland; and one adjoining neighborhood in northwest Washington, D.C. Most of these derive from a late-19th-century effort to create a new suburb that its developer dubbed Chevy Chase after a colonial land patent. 

Primarily residential, Chevy Chase adjoins Friendship Heights, a popular shopping district. It is the home of the Chevy Chase Club and Columbia Country Club, private clubs whose members include many prominent politicians and Washingtonians.

The name is derived from &quot;Cheivy Chace&quot;, the name of the land patented to Colonel Joseph Belt from Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, on July 10, 1725. It has historic associations with a 1388 &quot;chevauchée&quot;, a French word describing a border raid, fought by Lord Percy of England and Earl Douglas of Scotland over hunting grounds, or a &quot;chace&quot;, in the Cheviot Hills of Northumberland and Otterburn. The battle was memorialized in &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot;.

==Elements==
The area known as Chevy Chase includes several entities in southern Montgomery County:

* The Town of Chevy Chase, an incorporated town
* Chevy Chase, a census-designated place
* The incorporated villages of: 
** Chevy Chase Village
** Chevy Chase Section Three
** Chevy Chase Section Five
** Martin&#x27;s Additions 
** North Chevy Chase 

It also includes the neighborhood of Chevy Chase in northwest Washington, D.C. 

The United States Postal Service also uses &quot;Chevy Chase&quot; for some postal addresses that lie outside these areas: the town of Somerset, the Village of Friendship Heights, and the part of the Rock Creek Forest neighborhood that lies east of Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive and west of Grubb Road.

==History==

===19th century===
In the 1880s, Senator Francis G. Newlands of Nevada and his partners began acquiring farmland in unincorporated areas of Maryland and just inside the District of Columbia, for the purpose of developing a residential streetcar suburb for Washington, D.C., during the expansion of the Washington streetcars system. Newlands and his partners founded The Chevy Chase Land Company in 1890, and its holdings of more than eventually extended along the present-day Connecticut Avenue from Florida Avenue north to Jones Bridge Road. 

Newlands, an avowed white supremacist, and his development company took steps to ensure that residents of its new suburbs would be wealthy and white; for example, &quot;requiring, in the deed to the land, that only a single-family detached house costing a large amount of money could be constructed. The Chevy Chase Land Company did not include explicit bars against non-white people, known as racial covenants, but the mandated cost of the house made it impractical for all but the wealthiest non-white people to buy the land.&quot; Houses were required to cost $5,000 and up on Connecticut Avenue and $3,000 and up on side streets. The company banned commerce from the residential neighborhoods. 

Leon E. Dessez was Chevy Chase&#x27;s first resident. He and Lindley Johnson of Philadelphia designed the first four houses in the area.

Toward the northern end of its holdings, the Land Company dammed Coquelin Run, a stream that crossed its land, to create the manmade Chevy Chase Lake. The body of water furnished water to the coal-fired generators that powered the streetcars of the Land Company&#x27;s Rock Creek Railway. The streetcar soon became vital to the community; it connected workers to the city, and even ran errands for residents. 

The lake was also the centerpiece of the Land Company&#x27;s Chevy Chase Lake trolley park, a venue for boating, swimming, and other activities meant to draw city dwellers to the new suburb. Similar considerations led the Land Company to build a hotel at 7100 Connecticut Avenue; it opened it in 1894 as the Chevy Chase Spring Hotel and was later renamed the Chevy Chase Inn. &quot;The hotel failed to attract sufficient patrons, especially during the winter months,&quot; wrote the Chevy Chase Historical Society, and in 1895, the Land Company leased the property for a year to the Young Ladies Seminary. 

Part of the original Cheivy Chace patent had been sold to Abraham Bradley, who built an estate known as the Bradley Farm. In 1892, Newlands and other members of the Metropolitan Club of Washington, D.C., founded a hunt club called Chevy Chase Hunt, which would later become Chevy Chase Club. In 1894, the club located itself on the former Bradley Farm property under a lease from its owners. The club introduced a six-hole golf course to its members in 1895, and purchased the 9.36-acre Bradley Farm tract in 1897.

===20th century===
In 1906, the Chevy Chase Land Company blocked a proposed subdivision called Belmont after they learned its Black developers aimed to sell house lots to other African Americans. In subsequent litigation, the company and its affiliates argued that those developers had committed fraud by proposing &quot;to sell lots...to negroes.&quot;

By the 1920s, restrictive covenants were added to Chevy Chase real estate deeds. Some prohibited both the sale or rental of homes to &quot;a Negro or one of the African race.&quot; Others prohibited sales or rentals to &quot;any persons of the Semetic [&quot;sic&quot;] race&quot;—i.e., Jews. 

By World War II, such restrictive language had largely disappeared from real estate transactions, and all were voided by the 1948 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;.

In 1964, Arthur Krock wrote an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; alleging that the Chevy Chase Country Club barred &quot;Negroes&quot; and &quot;one ethnic group of Caucasians&quot; from membership. In response, Club president Randall H. Hagnar denied that the club excluded Black or Jewish people; he said that no members were African-Americans but that several were Jewish.

In 1903, Lea M. Bouligny bought the old Chevy Chase Inn and founded the Chevy Chase College and Seminary. The name was changed to Chevy Chase Junior College in 1927. The National 4-H Club Foundation purchased the property in 1951, turning it into the group&#x27;s Youth Conference Center. For decades, the center hosted the National 4-H Conference, an event for 4-Hers throughout the nation to attend, and the annual National Science Bowl in late April or early May.

=== 21st century ===
The National 4-H Club Foundation sold the center in 2021 for $40 million; as of 2022, it is to be replaced by a senior living development.

==Education==
Chevy Chase is served by the Montgomery County Public Schools. Residents of Chevy Chase are zoned to Somerset, Chevy Chase or North Chevy Chase Elementary School, which feed into Silver Creek Middle School, Westland Middle School and Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Private schools in Chevy Chase include Concord Hill School, Oneness-Family School, and Blessed Sacrament School.

Rochambeau French International School formerly had a campus in Chevy Chase.
