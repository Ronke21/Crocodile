<text>In politics, a national assembly is either a unicameral legislature, the lower house of a bicameral legislature, or both houses of a bicameral legislature together. In the English language it generally means &quot;an assembly composed of the representatives of the nation.&quot; The population base represented by this name is manifestly the nation as a whole, as opposed to a geographically select population, such as that represented by a provincial assembly. The powers of a National Assembly vary according to the type of government. It may possess all the powers of government, generally governing by committee, or it may function solely within the legislative branch of the government.

The name also must be distinguished from the concept. Conceptually such an institution may appear under variety of names, especially if &quot;national assembly&quot; is being used to translate foreign names of the same concept into English. Also, the degree to which the National Assembly speaks for the nation is a variable. To achieve a quorum, the ancient Athenian Assembly employed Scythian police to arrest citizens at random from the street. On the other hand, the early Parliaments of Europe were mainly of an aristocratic composition. The word had its origins and inspirations from the National Assembly that was responsible for drafting a constitution during the French Revolution.

The exact words, &quot;national assembly,&quot; have been used prolifically in the international community of nations since the 18th and 19th centuries, considered the Age of Revolution in western Europe. Nations that formed republics in this age subsequently formed empires. Extensive cross-cultural influences brought much of their language and institutions to the provinces. When these empires collapsed finally, the emancipated countries formed states and other institutions on the model of the former imperial nations. Some examples of international influences are as follows:

In Germany, a Nationalversammlung was elected following the revolutions of 1848–1849 and 1918–1919, to be replaced by a permanent parliament (Reichstag) later. The legislature of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal was known as the National Assembly. The national assembly was also defined in the Republic of China constitution. This is different from the Legislative Yuan by the ROC constitution. In 2005, Taiwan revised the constitution and the national assembly was abolished. Examples have multiplied greatly under the policy of self-determination adopted by the western nations. Many more are to be found in the articles listed below.

== Origin of the expression ==
Perhaps the best known National Assembly was that established during the French Revolution in 1789, known as the &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;. Consequently, the name is particularly common in Francophone countries. It was also the name of the legislature during France&#x27;s Second Republic and the Third Republic, and since 1946 has been the lower house of the French parliament, first under the Fourth Republic, and from 1958, the Fifth Republic.

The expression, however, did not originate in 1789. It was already in use in the French language of the times. Louis XIII of France (1601–1643), &quot;par la grace de Dieu Roy de France &amp; de Navarre&quot;, in a &quot;Declaration&quot; of April 14, 1627, concerning the sovereignty of his kingdom, prohibits ministers of foreign countries from any jurisdiction in France, citing, as precedent, his &quot;Lettres de Declaration&quot; of April 17, 1623, forbidding religious officials from treating with foreign countries. He describes his &quot;Declaration&quot; as &quot;ordonné qu&#x27;en Assemblées Provinciales &amp; Nationales des nosdites sujets&quot;. This was the &quot;registration&quot; that the Parlement of Paris refused to perform for Louis XVI of France in 1787–1788. When the Estates-General of 1789 formed the National Assembly of 1789, they did not believe they were instituting anything new. In the Assembly of Notables of 1787, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette had used National Assembly and Estates General synonymously when he suggested that France needed a national assembly to solve its financial problems.

National Assembly is also found in some Commonwealth countries. Its use there is not a translation of &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;, as the phrase is equally embedded in the English language. For example, at the end of the First English Civil War, an Act of Parliament, 1648, &quot;Concerning the Members of the Classical and Congregational Presbyteries, in the several counties of the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales,&quot; establishes a national congregational church in England and Wales, corresponding to the presbyteries of Scotland. The language is: &quot;The National Assembly shall be constituted of members chosen by and sent from the several Provincial Assemblies.&quot; This National Assembly appears to have no direct link to any French words, although the concept is the same.

<text>Access, the successor to ENGLISH, is an English-like query language used in the Pick operating system.

The original name ENGLISH is something of a misnomer, as PICK&#x27;s flexible dictionary structure meant that file and attribute names could be given aliases in any natural language. For instance the command SORT could be given the alias TRIEZ, the file CUSTOMER the alias CLIENT, the attribute BALANCE the alias BILAN and the particle BY the alias PAR. This would allow the database to be interrogated using the French-language command string &quot;TRIEZ CLIENT PAR BILAN&quot;, resulting in a list of customers by balance.

==Etomology==
The &quot;Access&quot; query (or enquiry) language is known by different names on different implementations of Pick: with &quot;English&quot;, &quot;Info/Access&quot;, &quot;Inform&quot; and &quot;Recall&quot; all being used.

<doc id="140574" wikidata="Q338229" url="?curid=140574" title="BS2000">
<text>BS2000 is an operating system for IBM 390-compatible mainframe computers developed in the 1970s by Siemens (Data Processing Department EDV) and from early 2000s onward by Fujitsu Technology Solutions.

Unlike other mainframe systems, BS2000 provides exactly the same user and programming interface in all operating modes (batch, interactive and online transaction processing) and regardless of whether it is running natively or as a guest system in a virtual machine. This uniformity of the user interface and the entire BS2000 software configuration makes administration and automation particularly easy.

Currently, it is mainly used in Germany - making up to 83% of its total user base - (63% of all SE/S Servers are installed at the German Travel Association (DRV) and German Tax Authority) as well as in the United Kingdom (8%), Belgium (4.8%) and other European countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherland, Spain, Switzerland) (4.2%). 

==History==
BS2000 has its roots in the Time Sharing Operating System (TSOS) first developed by RCA for the /46 model of the Spectra/70 series, a computer family of the late 1960s related in its architecture to IBM&#x27;s /360 series. It was an early operating system which used virtual addressing and a segregated address space for the programs of different users.
From the outset TSOS also allowed data peripherals to be accessed only via record- or block-oriented file interfaces, thereby preventing the necessity to implement device dependencies in user programs. The same operating system was also sold to Sperry Univac when it bought most of RCA&#x27;s computer division. Univac&#x27;s &quot;fork&quot; of TSOS would become VS/9, which used many of the same concepts.

===1970s===
In 1973, BS2000 V1.0 was a port of the TSOS operating system to models of the Siemens system 7.700
In June 1975, Siemens shipped the enhanced BS2000 V2.0 version of the TSOS operating system for the models of the Siemens 7.700 mainframe series for the first time under the name BS2000. This first version supported disk paging and three different operating modes in the same system: interactive dialog, batch, and transaction mode, a precursor of online transaction processing.
In 1977, the TRANSDATA communication system used computer networking.

In 1978, multiprocessor technology was introduced. The operating system had the ability to cope with a processor failure. At the same time the new technology considerably extended the performance range of the system.
In 1979, a transaction processing monitor, the &quot;Universal Transaction Monitor&quot; (UTM), was introduced, providing support for online transaction processing as an additional operating mode.

===1980s===
In 1980, Siemens introduced the system 7.500 hardware family, ranging from desk size models for use in office environments to large models with water cooling.
In 1987, BS2000 V9.0 was ported to the /370 architecture supported 2GB address spaces, 512 processes and the XS channel system (Dynamic Channel Subsystem).
BS2000 was subdivided into subsystems decoupled from one another.

===1990s===
With the advent of the VM2000 virtual machine in 1990, multiple BS2000 systems, of the same or different versions, can run in parallel on the same computer. The hierarchical storage management system (HSMS) swapped out infrequently used data to cheaper storage media. When the data is needed again, it is restored to high-speed access media. The ROBAR tape archiving system supported robot systems.
In 1991, the Security evaluation to F2/Q3 was completed.
From 1992 through 1995, BS2000/OSD V1.0 was made open to application software and was renamed BS2000/OSD (Open Server Dimension). Full support of the XPG4 standard was achieved in 1995 after the porting of the POSIX interfaces in 1992.
In 1996, BS2000/OSD was ported to the MIPS architecture. Although the operating system ran on different hardware architectures (S servers with /390 architecture and SR2000 servers for the MIPS architecture), applications produced for /390 can be used on computers based on MIPS architecture without recompilation due an emulation layer for legacy code.
In 1997, WebTransactions allowed applications to use the Internet.
In 1999, BS2000/OSD was the first operating system to be awarded Internet Branding by The Open Group.

===2000s===
In 2002, BS2000/OSD was ported to the SPARC architecture, leading to the Fujitsu Siemens Computers&#x27; SX server line. 
In 2004, support for storage area networks based on Fibre Channel technology was introduced.
In 2006, BS2000/OSD V7.0 introduced support for new server generations, Unicode support, and improved SAN integration.
In 2008, BS2000/OSD was ported to the x86 architecture, and the SQ server line was introduced.

===2010s===
In 2012, BS2000/OSD version 9.0 was released.

Pilot release of version 10.0 started in November 2014, and it was released in May 2015.

Pilot release of version 11.0 started in March 2017, and it was released in July 2017.

===2020s===
Pilot release of version DX V1.0(v21.0) started in March 2021, and it was released in July 2021.

Pilot release of version DX V1.0B(v21.0B) started in September 2023, and it was released in November 2023.

<text>Tutchone is an Athabaskan language spoken by the Northern and Southern Tutchone First Nations in central and southern regions of Yukon Territory, Canada. Tutchone belongs to the Northern Athabaskan linguistic subfamily and has two primary varieties, Southern and Northern. Although they are sometimes considered separate languages, Northern and Southern Tutchone speakers are generally able to understand each other in conversation, albeit with moderate difficulty.

Southern Tutchone is spoken in the Yukon communities of Aishihik, Burwash Landing, Champagne, Haines Junction, Kloo Lake, Klukshu, Lake Laberge, and Whitehorse.

Northern Tutchone is spoken in the Yukon communities of Mayo, Pelly Crossing, Stewart Crossing, Carmacks, and Beaver Creek.

== Revitalization efforts ==
Tutchone is considered to be an endangered language, as its speaker population is shifting rapidly to English. In a 2011 census, Northern Tutchone was reported to have 210 speakers, and Southern Tutchone 140 speakers.

===Literacy and documentation===

The Yukon Native Language Center (YNLC) describes information in regards to Southern Tutchone documentation and literacy, starting from the 1970s such as stories and songs, as well as a basic noun dictionary and language lessons. After 1984, there have been additional literacy workshops. One example is the Southern Tutchone textbook and audio, made by Margaret Workman, a native Southern Tutchone speaker. This information, along with other multimedia Southern Tutchone language learning and documentation resources, is currently available through the YNLC. In addition, in 1994 the Ta&#x27;an Kwach&#x27;an Council took part in an oral history and language preservation project, in which traditions, genealogy, and more information was documented.

===Education===

Tutchone language classes have been taught in Yukon schools since the early 1980s. Southern Tutchone language classes are included in the curriculum for students grades K-12 in schools at Kluane Lake, and three elementary schools in Whitehorse have language programs for Southern Tutchone. The St. Elias Community School in Haines Junction also offers Southern Tutchone language classes to students from K-12: one teacher handles K-4, another grades 5-12. In addition, the Yukon Native Language Center provides support for schools in regards to language learning, such the &quot;Dakeyi – Our Country&quot; program which is focused on high school students. In 2009, kindergarten classes in Haines Junction began learning Southern Tuchone in a bi-cultural program.

===Community engagement===

There have been ongoing community collaborations across the Yukon in regards to Southern Tutchone, with varied camps, workshops, and programs. For example, in 1995 and 1996, the Kluane First Nations participated in the sessions of &quot;Working Together to Pass it on&quot;, a workshop meant to promote language activities and usage at home and the community. In addition, the Southern Tutchone Tribal Council held its first language conference &quot;Kakwaddhin – Marking the Trail&quot; in 1996, in order to review language programs and draft long and short term strategic plans. This led to successful programs, including the &quot;Following your Grandfather trail&quot; camp in Klukshu in 1997. Nowadays there are varied programs offered in the Yukon to continue the language revitalization efforts, such as the Southern Tutchone Language Immersion program for adults. In 2018, The Champagne and Aishihik First Nation began a two-year Southern Tutchone immersion program, for adults with prior knowledge to the language. The program is under development and is the first of its kind in the Yukon Territory.

== In popular culture ==
Jerry Alfred&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (Grandfather song), sung in Northern Tuchone, won a Juno Award in the Best Aboriginal Album category in 1996.

Since 2011 the Adäka Cultural Festival, an annual multi-disciplinary arts and culture festival, has been held in Whitehorse. Celebrating First Nations arts and culture, with a specific focus on Yukon First Nations, , in the Southern Tutchone language, means &#x27;coming into the light&#x27;.

<text>The Vienna Development Method (VDM) is one of the longest-established formal methods for the development of computer-based systems. Originating in work done at the IBM Laboratory Vienna in the 1970s, it has grown to include a group of techniques and tools based on a formal specification language—the VDM Specification Language (VDM-SL). It has an extended form, VDM++, which supports the modeling of object-oriented and concurrent systems. Support for VDM includes commercial and academic tools for analyzing models, including support for testing and proving properties of models and generating program code from validated VDM models. There is a history of industrial usage of VDM and its tools and a growing body of research in the formalism has led to notable contributions to the engineering of critical systems, compilers, concurrent systems and in logic for computer science.

==Philosophy==
Computing systems may be modeled in VDM-SL at a higher level of abstraction than is achievable using programming languages, allowing the analysis of designs and identification of key features, including defects, at an early stage of system development. Models that have been validated can be transformed into detailed system designs through a refinement process. The language has a formal semantics, enabling proof of the properties of models to a high level of assurance. It also has an executable subset, so that models may be analyzed by testing and can be executed through graphical user interfaces, so that models can be evaluated by experts who are not necessarily familiar with the modeling language itself.

==History==
The origins of VDM-SL lie in the IBM Laboratory in Vienna where the first version of the language was called the Vienna Definition Language (VDL). The VDL was essentially used for giving operational semantics descriptions in contrast to the VDM – Meta-IV which provided denotational semantics

«Towards the end of 1972 the Vienna group again turned their attention to the problem of systematically developing a compiler from a language definition. The overall approach adopted has been termed the &quot;Vienna Development Method&quot;... The meta-language actually adopted (&quot;Meta-IV&quot;) is used to define major portions of PL/1 (as given in ECMA 74 – interestingly a &quot;formal standards document written as an abstract interpreter&quot;) in BEKIČ 74.»
There is no connection between Meta-IV, and Schorre&#x27;s META II language, or its successor Tree Meta; these were compiler-compiler systems rather than being suitable for formal problem descriptions.

So Meta-IV was &quot;used to define major portions of&quot; the PL/I programming language. Other programming languages retrospectively described, or partially described, using Meta-IV and VDM-SL include the BASIC programming language, FORTRAN, the APL programming language, ALGOL 60, the Ada programming language and the Pascal programming language. Meta-IV evolved into several variants, generally described as the Danish, English and Irish Schools.

The &quot;English School&quot; derived from work by Cliff Jones on the aspects of VDM not specifically related to language definition and compiler design (Jones 1980, 1990). It stresses modelling persistent state through the use of data types constructed from a rich collection of base types. Functionality is typically described through operations which may have side-effects on the state and which are mostly specified implicitly using a precondition and postcondition. The &quot;Danish School&quot; (Bjørner &quot;et al.&quot; 1982) has tended to stress a constructive approach with explicit operational specification used to a greater extent. Work in the Danish school led to the first European validated Ada compiler.

An ISO Standard for the language was released in 1996 (ISO, 1996).

==VDM features==
The VDM-SL and VDM++ syntax and semantics are described at length in the VDMTools language manuals and in the available texts. The ISO Standard contains a formal definition of the language&#x27;s semantics. In the remainder of this article, the ISO-defined interchange (ASCII) syntax is used. Some texts prefer a more concise mathematical syntax.

A VDM-SL model is a system description given in terms of the functionality performed on data. It consists of a series of definitions of data types and functions or operations performed upon them.

===Basic types: numeric, character, token and quote types===
VDM-SL includes basic types modelling numbers and characters as follows:

Data types are defined to represent the main data of the modelled system. Each type definition introduces a new type name and gives a representation in terms of the basic types or in terms of types already introduced. For example, a type modelling user identifiers for a log-in management system might be defined as follows:

types
UserId = nat

For manipulating values belonging to data types, operators are defined on the values. Thus, natural number addition, subtraction etc. are provided, as are Boolean operators such as equality and inequality. The language does not fix a maximum or minimum representable number or a precision for real numbers. Such constraints are defined where they are required in each model by means of data type invariants—Boolean expressions denoting conditions that must be respected by all elements of the defined type. For example, a requirement that user identifiers must be no greater than 9999 would be expressed as follows (where codice_1 is the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; Boolean operator on natural numbers):

UserId = nat
inv uid == uid &lt;= 9999
Since invariants can be arbitrarily complex logical expressions, and membership of a defined type is limited to only those values satisfying the invariant, type correctness in VDM-SL is not automatically decidable in all situations.

The other basic types include char for characters. In some cases, the representation of a type is not relevant to the model&#x27;s purpose and would only add complexity. In such cases, the members of the type may be represented as structureless tokens. Values of token types can only be compared for equality – no other operators are defined on them. Where specific named values are required, these are introduced as quote types. Each quote type consists of one named value of the same name as the type itself. Values of quote types (known as quote literals) may only be compared for equality.

For example, in modelling a traffic signal controller, it may be convenient to define values to represent the colours of the traffic signal as quote types:

&lt;Red&gt;, &lt;Amber&gt;, &lt;FlashingAmber&gt;, &lt;Green&gt;
===Type constructors: union, product and composite types===
The basic types alone are of limited value. New, more structured data types are built using type constructors.
The most basic type constructor forms the union of two predefined types. The type codice_2 contains all elements of the type A and all of the type codice_3. In the traffic signal controller example, the type modelling the colour of a traffic signal could be defined as follows:

SignalColour = &lt;Red&gt; | &lt;Amber&gt; | &lt;FlashingAmber&gt; | &lt;Green&gt;
Enumerated types in VDM-SL are defined as shown above as unions on quote types.

Cartesian product types may also be defined in VDM-SL. The type codice_4 is the type composed of all tuples of values, the first element of which is from the type codice_5 and the second from the type codice_6 and so on. The composite or record type is a Cartesian product with labels for the fields. The type

T :: f1:A1
 f2:A2
 fn:An

is the Cartesian product with fields labelled codice_7. An element of type codice_8 can be composed from its constituent parts by a constructor, written codice_9. Conversely, given an element of type codice_8, the field names can be used to select the named component. For example, the type

Date :: day:nat1
 month:nat1
 year:nat
inv mk_Date(d,m,y) == d&lt;=31 and m&lt;=12

models a simple date type. The value codice_11 corresponds to 1 April 2001. Given a date codice_12, the expression codice_13 is a natural number representing the month. Restrictions on days per month and leap years could be incorporated into the invariant if desired. Combining these:

mk_Date(1,4,2001).month = 4
===Collections===
Collection types model groups of values. Sets are finite unordered collections in which duplication between values is suppressed. Sequences are finite ordered collections (lists) in which duplication may occur and mappings represent finite correspondences between two sets of values.

==== Sets ====
The set type constructor (written codice_14 where codice_8 is a predefined type) constructs the type composed of all finite sets of values drawn from the type codice_8. For example, the type definition

UGroup = set of UserId

defines a type codice_17 composed of all finite sets of codice_18 values. Various operators are defined on sets for constructing their union, intersections, determining proper and non-strict subset relationships etc.

==== Sequences ====
The finite sequence type constructor (written codice_19 where codice_8 is a predefined type) constructs the type composed of all finite lists of values drawn from the type codice_8. For example, the type definition

String = seq of char

Defines a type codice_22 composed of all finite strings of characters. Various operators are defined on sequences for constructing concatenation, selection of elements and subsequences etc. Many of these operators are partial in the sense that they are not defined for certain applications. For example, selecting the 5th element of a sequence that contains only three elements is undefined.

The order and repetition of items in a sequence is significant, so codice_23 is not equal to codice_24, and codice_25 is not equal to codice_26.

==== Maps ====
A finite mapping is a correspondence between two sets, the domain and range, with the domain indexing elements of the range. It is therefore similar to a finite function. The mapping type constructor in VDM-SL (written codice_27 where codice_28 and codice_29 are predefined types) constructs the type composed of all finite mappings from sets of codice_28 values to sets of codice_29 values. For example, the type definition

Birthdays = map String to Date

Defines a type codice_32 which maps character strings to codice_33. Again, operators are defined on mappings for indexing into the mapping, merging mappings, overwriting extracting sub-mappings.

===Structuring===
The main difference between the VDM-SL and VDM++ notations are the way in which structuring is dealt with. In VDM-SL there is a conventional modular extension whereas VDM++ has a traditional object-oriented structuring mechanism with classes and inheritance.

====Structuring in VDM-SL====
In the ISO standard for VDM-SL there is an informative annex that contains different structuring principles. These all follow traditional information hiding principles with modules and they can be explained as:
* Module naming: Each module is syntactically started with the keyword codice_34 followed by the name of the module. At the end of a module the keyword codice_35 is written followed again by the name of the module.
* Importing: It is possible to import definitions that has been exported from other modules. This is done in an &quot;imports section&quot; that is started off with the keyword codice_36 and followed by a sequence of imports from different modules. Each of these module imports are started with the keyword codice_37 followed by the name of the module and a module signature. The &quot;module signature&quot; can either simply be the keyword codice_38 indicating the import of all definitions exported from that module, or it can be a sequence of import signatures. The import signatures are specific for types, values, functions and operations and each of these are started with the corresponding keyword. In addition these import signatures name the constructs that there is a desire to get access to. In addition optional type information can be present and finally it is possible to &quot;rename&quot; each of the constructs upon import. For types one needs also to use the keyword codice_39 if one wish to get access to the &quot;internal structure&quot; of a particular type.
* Exporting: The definitions from a module that one wish other modules to have access to are exported using the keyword codice_40 followed by an exports module signature. The &quot;exports module signature&quot; can either simply consist of the keyword codice_38 or as a sequence of export signatures. Such &quot;export signatures&quot; are specific for types, values, functions and operations and each of these are started with the corresponding keyword. In case one wish to export the internal structure of a type the keyword codice_39 must be used.
* More exotic features: In earlier versions of the VDM-SL, tools there was also support for parameterized modules and instantiations of such modules. However, these features were taken out of VDMTools around 2000 because they were hardly ever used in industrial applications and there was a substantial number of tool challenges with these features.

====Structuring in VDM++====
In VDM++ structuring are done using classes and multiple inheritance. The key concepts are:
* Class: Each class is syntactically started with the keyword codice_43 followed by the name of the class. At the end of a class the keyword codice_35 is written followed again by the name of the class.
* Inheritance: In case a class inherits constructs from other classes the class name in the class heading can be followed by the keywords codice_45 followed by a comma-separated list of names of superclasses.
* Access modifiers: Information hiding in VDM++ is done in the same way as in most object oriented languages using access modifiers. In VDM++ definitions are per default private but in front of all definitions it is possible to use one of the access modifier keywords: codice_46, codice_47 and codice_48.

==Modelling functionality==
===Functional modelling===
In VDM-SL, functions are defined over the data types defined in a model. Support for abstraction requires that it should be possible to characterize the result that a function should compute without having to say how it should be computed. The main mechanism for doing this is the &quot;implicit function definition&quot; in which, instead of a formula computing a result, a logical predicate over the input and result variables, termed a &quot;postcondition&quot;, gives the result&#x27;s properties. For example, a function codice_49 for calculating a square root of a natural number might be defined as follows:

SQRT(x:nat)r:real
post r*r = x

Here the postcondition does not define a method for calculating the result codice_50 but states what properties can be assumed to hold of it. Note that this defines a function that returns a valid square root; there is no requirement that it should be the positive or negative root. The specification above would be satisfied, for example, by a function that returned the negative root of 4 but the positive root of all other valid inputs. Note that functions in VDM-SL are required to be &quot;deterministic&quot; so that a function satisfying the example specification above must always return the same result for the same input.

A more constrained function specification is arrived at by strengthening the postcondition. For example, the following definition constrains the function to return the positive root.

SQRT(x:nat)r:real
post r*r = x and r&gt;=0

All function specifications may be restricted by &quot;preconditions&quot; which are logical predicates over the input variables only and which describe constraints that are assumed to be satisfied when the function is executed. For example, a square root calculating function that works only on positive real numbers might be specified as follows:

SQRTP(x:real)r:real
pre x &gt;=0
post r*r = x and r&gt;=0

The precondition and postcondition together form a &quot;contract&quot; that to be satisfied by any program claiming to implement the function. The precondition records the assumptions under which the function guarantees to return a result satisfying the postcondition. If a function is called on inputs that do not satisfy its precondition, the outcome is undefined (indeed, termination is not even guaranteed).

VDM-SL also supports the definition of executable functions in the manner of a functional programming language. In an &quot;explicit&quot; function definition, the result is defined by means of an expression over the inputs. For example, a function that produces a list of the squares of a list of numbers might be defined as follows:

SqList: seq of nat -&gt; seq of nat
SqList(s) == if s = [] then [] else [(hd s)**2] ^ SqList(tl s)

This recursive definition consists of a function signature giving the types of the input and result and a function body. An implicit definition of the same function might take the following form:

SqListImp(s:seq of nat)r:seq of nat
post len r = len s and
 forall i in set inds s &amp; r(i) = s(i)**2

The explicit definition is in a simple sense an implementation of the implicitly specified function. The correctness of an explicit function definition with respect to an implicit specification may be defined as follows.

Given an implicit specification:

f(p:T_p)r:T_r
pre pre-f(p)
post post-f(p, r)

and an explicit function:

f:T_p -&gt; T_r

we say it satisfies the specification iff:

forall p in set T_p &amp; pre-f(p) =&gt; f(p):T_r and post-f(p, f(p))

So, &quot;codice_51 is a correct implementation&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;codice_51 satisfies the specification&quot;.

===State-based modelling===
In VDM-SL, functions do not have side-effects such as changing the state of a persistent global variable. This is a useful ability in many programming languages, so a similar concept exists; instead of functions, &quot;operations&quot; are used to change state variables (also known as &quot;globals&quot;).

For example, if we have a state consisting of a single variable codice_53, we could define this in VDM-SL as:

 state Register of
 someStateRegister : nat
 end

In VDM++ this would instead be defined as:

 instance variables
 someStateRegister : nat

An operation to load a value into this variable might be specified as:

 LOAD(i:nat)
 ext wr someStateRegister:nat
 post someStateRegister = i

The &quot;externals&quot; clause (codice_54) specifies which parts of the state can be accessed by the operation; codice_55 indicating read-only access and codice_56 being read/write access.

Sometimes it is important to refer to the value of a state before it was modified; for example, an operation to add a value to the variable may be specified as:

 ADD(i:nat)
 ext wr someStateRegister : nat
 post someStateRegister = someStateRegister~ + i

Where the codice_57 symbol on the state variable in the postcondition indicates the value of the state variable before execution of the operation.

==Examples==
===The &quot;max&quot; function===
This is an example of an implicit function definition. The function returns the largest element from a set of positive integers:

 max(s:set of nat)r:nat
 pre card s &gt; 0
 post r in set s and
 forall r&#x27; in set s &amp; r&#x27; &lt;= r

The postcondition characterizes the result rather than defining an algorithm for obtaining it. The precondition is needed because no function could return an r in set s when the set is empty.

===Natural number multiplication===

 multp(i,j:nat)r:nat
 pre true
 post r = i*j

Applying the proof obligation codice_58 to an explicit definition of codice_59:

 multp(i,j) ==
 if i=0
 then 0
 else if is-even(i)
 then 2*multp(i/2,j)
 else j+multp(i-1,j)

Then the proof obligation becomes:

 forall i, j : nat &amp; multp(i,j):nat and multp(i, j) = i*j

This can be shown correct by:
# Proving that the recursion ends (this in turn requires proving that the numbers become smaller at each step)
# Mathematical induction

===Queue abstract data type===
This is a classical example illustrating the use of implicit operation specification in a state-based model of a well-known data structure. The queue is modelled as a sequence composed of elements of a type codice_60. The representation is codice_60 is immaterial and so is defined as a token type.

 types

 Qelt = token;
 Queue = seq of Qelt;

 state TheQueue of
 q : Queue
 end

 operations

 ENQUEUE(e:Qelt)
 ext wr q:Queue
 post q = q~ ^ [e];

 DEQUEUE()e:Qelt
 ext wr q:Queue
 pre q &lt;&gt; []
 post q~ = [e]^q;

 IS-EMPTY()r:bool
 ext rd q:Queue
 post r &lt;=&gt; (len q = 0)

===Bank system example===
As a very simple example of a VDM-SL model, consider a system for maintaining details of customer bank account. Customers are modelled by customer numbers (&quot;CustNum&quot;), accounts are modelled by account numbers (&quot;AccNum&quot;). The representations of customer numbers are held to be immaterial and so are modelled by a token type. Balances and overdrafts are modelled by numeric types.

 AccNum = token;
 CustNum = token;
 Balance = int;
 Overdraft = nat;

 AccData :: owner : CustNum
 balance : Balance

 state Bank of
 accountMap : map AccNum to AccData
 overdraftMap : map CustNum to Overdraft
 inv mk_Bank(accountMap,overdraftMap) == for all a in set rng accountMap &amp; a.owner in set dom overdraftMap and
 a.balance &gt;= -overdraftMap(a.owner)

With operations:
&quot;NEWC&quot; allocates a new customer number:

 operations
 NEWC(od : Overdraft)r : CustNum

&quot;NEWAC&quot; allocates a new account number and sets the balance to zero:

 NEWAC(cu : CustNum)r : AccNum

&quot;ACINF&quot; returns all the balances of all the accounts of a customer, as a map of account number to balance:

 ACINF(cu : CustNum)r : map AccNum to Balance
 ext rd accountMap : map AccNum to AccData
 post r = {an |-&gt; accountMap(an).balance | an in set dom accountMap &amp; accountMap(an).owner = cu}

==Tool support==
A number of different tools support VDM:
* VDMTools was the leading commercial tools for VDM and VDM++, owned, marketed, maintained and developed by CSK Systems, building on earlier versions developed by the Danish Company IFAD. The manuals and a practical tutorial are available. All licenses are available, free of charge, for the full version of the tool. The full version includes automatic code generation for Java and C++, dynamic link library and CORBA support.
* Overture is a community-based open source initiative aimed at providing freely available tool support for all VDM dialects (VDM-SL, VDM++ and VDM-RT) originally on top of the Eclipse platform but subsequently on top of the Visual Studio Code platform. Its aim is to develop a framework for interoperable tools that will be useful for industrial application, research and education.
* vdm-mode is a collection of Emacs packages for writing VDM specifications using VDM-SL, VDM++ and VDM-RT. It supports syntax highlighting and editing, on-the-fly syntax checking, template completion and interpreter support.
* SpecBox: from Adelard provides syntax checking, some simple semantic checking, and generation of a LaTeX file enabling specifications to be printed in mathematical notation. This tool is freely available but it is not being further maintained.
* LaTeX and LaTeX2e macros are available to support the presentation of VDM models in the ISO Standard Language&#x27;s mathematical syntax. They have been developed and are maintained by the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Documentation and the macros are available online.

==Industrial experience==
VDM has been applied widely in a variety of application domains. The most well-known of these applications are:
* Ada and CHILL compilers: The first European validated Ada compiler was developed by Dansk Datamatik Center using VDM. Likewise the semantics of CHILL and Modula-2 were described in their standards using VDM.
* ConForm: An experiment at British Aerospace comparing the conventional development of a trusted gateway with a development using VDM.
* Dust-Expert: A project carried out by Adelard in the UK for a safety related application determining that the safety is appropriate in the layout of industrial plants.
* The development of VDMTools: Most components of the VDMTools tool suite are themselves developed using VDM. This development has been made at IFAD in Denmark and CSK in Japan.
* TradeOne: Certain key components of the TradeOne back-office system developed by CSK systems for the Japanese stock exchange were developed using VDM. Comparative measurements exist for developer productivity and defect density of the VDM-developed components versus the conventionally developed code.
* FeliCa Networks have reported the development of an operating system for an integrated circuit for cellular telephone applications.

==Refinement==
Use of VDM starts with a very abstract model and develops this into an implementation. Each step involves &quot;data reification&quot;, then &quot;operation decomposition&quot;.

Data reification develops the abstract data types into more concrete data structures, while operation decomposition develops the (abstract) implicit specifications of operations and functions into algorithms that can be directly implemented in a computer language of choice.

:formula_1

===Data reification===
Data reification (stepwise refinement) involves finding a more concrete representation of the abstract data types used in a specification. There may be several steps before an implementation is reached. Each reification step for an abstract data representation codice_62 involves proposing a new representation codice_63. In order to show that the new representation is accurate, a &quot;retrieve function&quot; is defined that relates codice_63 to codice_62, i.e. codice_66. The correctness of a data reification depends on proving &quot;adequacy&quot;, i.e.

 forall a:ABS_REP &amp; exists r:NEW_REP &amp; a = retr(r)

Since the data representation has changed, it is necessary to update the operations and functions so that they operate on codice_63. The new operations and functions should be shown to preserve any data type invariants on the new representation. In order to prove that the new operations and functions model those found in the original specification, it is necessary to discharge two proof obligations:
* Domain rule:

 forall r: NEW_REP &amp; pre-OPA(retr(r)) =&gt; pre-OPR(r)

* Modelling rule:

 forall ~r,r:NEW_REP &amp; pre-OPA(retr(~r)) and post-OPR(~r,r) =&gt; post-OPA(retr(~r,), retr(r))
====Example data reification====
In a business security system, workers are given ID cards; these are fed into card readers on entry to and exit from the factory.
Operations required:
* codice_68 initialises the system, assumes that the factory is empty
* codice_69 records that a worker is entering the factory; the workers&#x27; details are read from the ID card)
* codice_70 records that a worker is exiting the factory
* codice_71 checks to see if a specified worker is in the factory or not

Formally, this would be:

 types

 Person = token;
 Workers = set of Person;

 state AWCCS of
 pres: Workers
 end

 operations

 INIT()
 ext wr pres: Workers
 post pres = {};

 ENTER(p : Person)
 ext wr pres : Workers
 pre p not in set pres
 post pres = pres~ union {p};

 EXIT(p : Person)
 ext wr pres : Workers
 pre p in set pres
 post pres = pres~\{p};

 IS-PRESENT(p : Person) r : bool
 ext rd pres : Workers
 post r &lt;=&gt; p in set pres~

As most programming languages have a concept comparable to a set (often in the form of an array), the first step from the specification is to represent the data in terms of a sequence. These sequences must not allow repetition, as we do not want the same worker to appear twice, so we must add an invariant to the new data type. In this case, ordering is not important, so codice_72 is the same as codice_73.

The Vienna Development Method is valuable for model-based systems. It is not appropriate if the system is time-based. For such cases, the calculus of communicating systems (CCS) is more useful.

<doc id="140585" wikidata="Q5061640" url="?curid=140585" title="Western Pennsylvania English">
<text>Western Pennsylvania English, known more narrowly as Pittsburgh English or popularly as Pittsburghese, is a dialect of American English native primarily to the western half of Pennsylvania, centered on the city of Pittsburgh, but potentially appearing in some speakers as far north as Erie County, as far east as Harrisburg, as far south as Clarksburg, West Virginia, and as far west as Youngstown, Ohio. Commonly associated with the working class of Pittsburgh, users of the dialect are colloquially known as &quot;Yinzers&quot;.

==Overview==
Scots-Irish, Pennsylvania Dutch, Polish, Ukrainian and Croatian immigrants to the area all provided certain loanwords to the dialect (see &quot;Vocabulary&quot; below). Many of the sounds and words found in the dialect are popularly thought to be unique to Pittsburgh, but that is a misconception since the dialect resides throughout the greater part of western Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas. Central Pennsylvania, currently an intersection of several dialect regions, was identified in 1949 by Hans Kurath as a subregion between western and eastern Pennsylvania, but some scholars in the 20th century onwards have identified it within the western Pennsylvania dialect region. Since Kurath&#x27;s study, one of western Pennsylvania&#x27;s defining features, the cot–caught merger, has expanded into central Pennsylvania, moving eastward until being blocked at Harrisburg. Perhaps the only feature whose distribution is restricted almost exclusively to the immediate vicinity of Pittsburgh is monophthongization in which words such as &quot;house&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;found&quot;, and &quot;sauerkraut&quot; are sometimes pronounced with an &quot;ah&quot; sound, instead of the more standard pronunciation of &quot;ow&quot;, rendering eye spellings such as &quot;hahs&quot;, &quot;dahn&quot;, &quot;fahnd&quot;, and &quot;sahrkraht&quot;.

Speakers of Pittsburgh English are sometimes called &quot;Yinzers&quot; in reference to their use of the second-person plural pronoun &quot;yinz.&quot; The word &quot;yinzer&quot; is sometimes heard as pejorative, indicating a lack of sophistication, but the term is now used in a variety of ways. Older men are more likely to use the accent than women &quot;possibly because of a stronger interest in displaying local identity...&quot;

==Phonology==

A defining feature of Western Pennsylvania English is the cot–caught merger, in which (as in &quot;ah&quot;) and (as in &quot;aw&quot;) merge to a rounded (phonetically ). As in most other American dialects, the father–bother merger also occurs. Therefore, &quot;cot&quot; and &quot;caught&quot; are both pronounced ; &quot;Don&quot; and &quot;dawn&quot; are both . While the merger of the low back vowels is also widespread elsewhere in the United States, the rounded realizations of the merged vowel around is less common, except in Canada, California and Northeastern New England.

 has a stylistic variant, which is open central unrounded , as in the sarcastic pronunciation of &quot;I apologize&quot; as . It may also occur before , as in &quot;start&quot; or &quot;car&quot; , but a more common pronunciation is back and rounded: etc. The vowel in &quot;hoarse&quot; is the same as the one in &quot;horse&quot;, phonetically : but phonemically due to the cot-caught merger: .

 is backer and more open than found in Midland American English, being closer to . This makes an unrounded counterpart of , with pairs such as &quot;nut&quot; vs. &quot;not&quot; or &quot;cut&quot; vs. &quot;cot&quot; contrasting mainly by roundedness. This is also found in contemporary Standard Southern British English, where &quot;nut&quot; also differs from &quot;not&quot; by rounding (though &quot;nought&quot; has a contrastive vowel instead: , which falls together with in Pittsburgh). Earlier reports give as the norm for in Pittsburgh. The remaining checked vowels , , and are all within the General American norm.

The vowel often has an unrounded central or fronted starting point in Pittsburgh: . Outside of the city itself, is more common. is sometimes also fronted, to (more usual value: ). As in other American dialects, and are narrow diphthongs . is also within GenAm norm: .

The vowel alone undergoes Canadian raising to before voiceless consonants, as in &quot;ice&quot; . In 1971, the Journal of the International Phonetic Association published a description of the dialect, whose author Bruce Lee Johnson notes that the auxiliary verb &quot;might&quot; is typically pronounced with nasalization, as . Elsewhere in the article, this allophone is transcribed , following its usual transcription on Wikipedia.

The vowel typically begins front in the mouth . A less common variant has a central starting point, , matching the starting point of (). It is monophthongized to in some environments (sounding instead like &quot;ah&quot;), namely: before nasal consonants (&quot;downtown&quot; and &quot;found&quot; ), liquid consonants (&quot;fowl&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;) and obstruents (&quot;house&quot; , &quot;out&quot;, &quot;cloudy&quot;). The monophthongization does not occur, however, in word-final positions (&quot;how&quot;, &quot;now&quot;), and the diphthong then remains . That is one of the few features, if not the only one, restricted almost exclusively to western Pennsylvania in North America, but it can sometimes be found in other accents of the English-speaking world, such as Cockney and South African English. The sound may be the result of contact from Slavic languages during the early 20th century. Monophthongization also occurs for the sound , as in &quot;eye&quot;, before liquid consonants, so that &quot;tile&quot; is pronounced ; &quot;pile&quot; is pronounced ; and &quot;iron&quot; is pronounced . That phenomenon allows &quot;tire&quot; to merge with the sound of &quot;tar&quot;: .

The vowel (phonemically an sequence) is phonetically close-mid .

Johnson notes a tendency to diphthongize to not only before nasals (as in GenAm) but also before all voiced consonants (as in &quot;bad&quot; ) and voiceless fricatives (as in &quot;grass&quot; ). This has since been reversed and now is confined to the environment of a following nasal, matching the GenAm allophony.

An epenthetic (intruding) sound may occur after vowels in a few words, such as &quot;water&quot; pronounced as , and &quot;wash&quot; as .

A number of vowel mergers occur uniquely in Western Pennsylvania English before the consonant . The pair of vowels and may merge before the consonant, cause both &quot;steel&quot; and &quot;still&quot; to be pronounced as something like . Similarly, , , and may merge before , so that &quot;pool&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;, and &quot;pole&quot; may merge to something like . On the merger, Labov, Ash and Boberg (2006) note &quot;the stereotype of merger of is based only on a close approximation of some forms, and does not represent the underlying norms of the dialect.&quot; The merger is found in western Pennsylvania, as well as parts of the southern United States, including Alabama, Texas and the west (McElhinny 1999). On the other hand, the merger is consistently found only in western Pennsylvania. The merger towards may also appear before : &quot;eagle&quot; then sounds to outsiders like &quot;iggle&quot;.

&quot;L&quot;-vocalization is also common in the Western Pennsylvania dialect; an then sounds like a or a cross between a vowel and a &quot;dark&quot; at the end of a syllable. For example, &quot;well&quot; is pronounced as ; &quot;milk&quot; as or ; &quot;role&quot; as ; and &quot;cold&quot; as . The phenomenon is also common in African-American English.

The word &quot;mirror&quot; can be pronounced as the single-syllable &quot;mere&quot;.

Western Pennsylvania English speakers may use falling intonation at the end of questions, for example, in &quot;Are you painting your garage?&quot; (with pitch rising in intonation up to just before the last syllable and then falling precipitously). Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes–no questions for which they already are quite sure of the answer. A speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what is already thought: yes, the person spoken to is painting their garage. It is most common in areas of heavy German settlement, especially southeastern Pennsylvania, hence its nickname, the &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch question&quot;, but it is also found elsewhere in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh. It is of German origin.

==Grammar==
*&quot;All&quot; to mean &quot;all gone&quot;: When referring to consumable products, the word &quot;all&quot; has a secondary meaning: &quot;all gone&quot;. For example, the phrase &quot;the butter&#x27;s all&quot; would be understood as &quot;the butter is all gone.&quot; This likely derives from German.
*&quot;Positive &quot;anymore&quot;&quot;: In addition to the normal negative use of &quot;anymore&quot; it can also, as in the greater Midland U.S. dialect, be used in a positive sense to mean &quot;these days&quot; or &quot;nowadays&quot;. An example is &quot;I wear these shoes a lot anymore&quot;. While in Standard English &quot;anymore&quot; must be used as a negative polarity item (NPI), some speakers in Pittsburgh and throughout the Midland area do not have this restriction. This is somewhat common in both the Midland regions (Montgomery 1989) and in northern Maryland (Frederick, Hagerstown, and Westminster), likely of Scots-Irish origin.
*Reversed usage of &quot;leave&quot; and &quot;let&quot;: Examples of this include &quot;Leave him go outside&quot; and &quot;Let the book on the table&quot;. &quot;Leave&quot; is used in some contexts in which, in standard English, &quot;let&quot; would be used; and vice versa. Used in Southwestern Pennsylvania and elsewhere, this is either Pennsylvania Dutch or Scots-Irish.
*&quot;&quot;Need&quot;, &quot;want&quot;, or &quot;like&quot; + past participle&quot;: Examples of this include &quot;The car needs washed&quot;, &quot;The cat wants petted&quot;, and &quot;Babies like cuddled&quot;. More common constructions are &quot;The grass needs cutting&quot; or &quot;The grass needs to be cut&quot; or &quot;Babies like cuddling&quot; or &quot;Babies like to be cuddled&quot;; &quot;The car needs washing&quot; or &quot;The car needs to be washed&quot;; and &quot;The cat wants petting&quot; or &quot;The cat wants to be petted.&quot; Found predominantly in the North Midland region, this is especially common in southwestern Pennsylvania. &quot;Need&quot; + past participle is the most common construction, followed by &quot;want&quot; + past participle, and then &quot;like&quot; + past participle. The forms are &quot;implicationally related&quot; to one another (Murray and Simon 2002). This means the existence of a less common construction from the list in a given location entails the existence of the more common ones there, but not vice versa. The constructions &quot;&quot;like&quot; + past participle&quot; and &quot;&quot;need&quot; + past participle&quot; are Scots-Irish. While Adams argues that &quot;&quot;want&quot; + past participle&quot; could be from Scots-Irish or German, it seems likely that this construction is Scots-Irish, as Murray and Simon claim. &quot;like&quot; and &quot;need&quot; + past participle are Scots-Irish, the distributions of all three constructions are implicationally related, the area where they are predominantly found is most heavily influenced by Scots-Irish, and a related construction, &quot;&quot;want&quot; + directional adverb&quot;, as in &quot;The cat wants out&quot;, is Scots-Irish.
*&quot;Punctual &quot;whenever&quot;&quot;: &quot;Whenever&quot; is often used to mean &quot;at the time that.&quot; An example is &quot;My mother, whenever she passed away, she had pneumonia.&quot; A &quot;punctual&quot; descriptor refers to the use of the word for &quot;a onetime momentary event rather than in its two common uses for a recurrent event or a conditional one&quot;. This Scots-Irish usage is found in the Midlands and the South.

==Notable examples of lifelong speakers==

* Kurt Angle
* Myron Cope - Cope&#x27;s colorful vocabulary added dozens of words to the dialect, including his most famous, &quot;Yoi!&quot;
* Billy Gardell - Although he grew up some of the time away from the city, Gardell sports a heavy Pittsburgh accent.
* John Kasich
* Michael Keaton
* Billy Mays
* Pat McAfee
* Arnold Palmer
* Trent Reznor
* Fred Rogers - Rogers&#x27; accent is an example of the softer variation of the accent that was spoken by the middle class of the era that he grew up in.
* Art Rooney
* Dan Rooney

<text>A specification language is a formal language in computer science used during systems analysis, requirements analysis, and systems design to describe a system at a much higher level than a programming language, which is used to produce the executable code for a system.
==Overview==
Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the &quot;what&quot;, not the &quot;how&quot;. It is considered an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail.

A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as algebraic or model-theoretic structures that include a collection of sets of data values together with functions over those sets. This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties.

In the &quot;property-oriented&quot; approach to specification (taken e.g. by CASL), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical axioms, usually in a logical system in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy—often just by their interrelationship.
This is in contrast to so-called model-oriented specification in frameworks like VDM and Z, which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour.

Specifications must be subject to a process of &quot;refinement&quot; (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, Hartmann pipelines, when properly applied, may be considered a dataflow specification which &quot;is&quot; directly executable. Another example is the actor model which has no specific application content and must be &quot;specialized&quot; to be executable.

An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of proofs of program correctness (&quot;see theorem prover&quot;).

<text>The assignment problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. In its most general form, the problem is as follows:
:The problem instance has a number of &quot;agents&quot; and a number of &quot;tasks&quot;. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some &quot;cost&quot; that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform as many tasks as possible by assigning at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent, in such a way that the &quot;total cost&quot; of the assignment is minimized.

Alternatively, describing the problem using graph theory:
:The assignment problem consists of finding, in a weighted bipartite graph, a matching of maximum size, in which the sum of weights of the edges is minimum.

If the numbers of agents and tasks are equal, then the problem is called balanced assignment, and the graph-theoretic version is called minimum-cost perfect matching. Otherwise, it is called unbalanced assignment. 

If the total cost of the assignment for all tasks is equal to the sum of the costs for each agent (or the sum of the costs for each task, which is the same thing in this case), then the problem is called linear assignment. Commonly, when speaking of the &quot;assignment problem&quot; without any additional qualification, then the &quot;linear balanced assignment problem&quot; is meant.

==Examples==
Suppose that a taxi firm has three taxis (the agents) available, and three customers (the tasks) wishing to be picked up as soon as possible. The firm prides itself on speedy pickups, so for each taxi the &quot;cost&quot; of picking up a particular customer will depend on the time taken for the taxi to reach the pickup point. This is a &quot;balanced assignment&quot; problem. Its solution is whichever combination of taxis and customers results in the least total cost.

Now, suppose that there are &quot;four&quot; taxis available, but still only three customers. This is an &quot;unbalanced assignment&quot; problem. One way to solve it is to invent a fourth dummy task, perhaps called &quot;sitting still doing nothing&quot;, with a cost of 0 for the taxi assigned to it. This reduces the problem to a balanced assignment problem, which can then be solved in the usual way and still give the best solution to the problem.

Similar adjustments can be done in order to allow more tasks than agents, tasks to which multiple agents must be assigned (for instance, a group of more customers than will fit in one taxi), or maximizing profit rather than minimizing cost.

==Formal definition==
The formal definition of the assignment problem (or linear assignment problem) is

:Given two sets, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, together with a weight function &quot;C&quot; : &quot;A&quot; × &quot;T&quot; → R. Find a bijection &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;T&quot; such that the cost function:
::formula_1
:is minimized.

Usually the weight function is viewed as a square real-valued matrix &quot;C&quot;, so that the cost function is written down as:

:formula_2

The problem is &quot;linear&quot; because the cost function to be optimized as well as all the constraints contain only linear terms.

==Algorithms==
A naive solution for the assignment problem is to check all the assignments and calculate the cost of each one. This may be very inefficient since, with &quot;n&quot; agents and &quot;n&quot; tasks, there are &quot;n&quot;! (factorial of &quot;n&quot;) different assignments. 

Another naive solution is to greedily assign the pair with the smallest cost first, and remove the vertices; then, among the remaining vertices, assign the pair with the smallest cost; and so on. This algorithm may yield a non-optimal solution. For example, suppose there are two tasks and two agents with costs as follows:

* Alice: Task 1 = 1, Task 2 = 2.
* George: Task 1 = 5, Task 2 = 8.

The greedy algorithm would assign Task 1 to Alice and Task 2 to George, for a total cost of 9; but the reverse assignment has a total cost of 7.

Fortunately, there are many algorithms for finding the optimal assignment in time polynomial in &quot;n&quot;. The assignment problem is a special case of the transportation problem, which is a special case of the minimum cost flow problem, which in turn is a special case of a linear program. While it is possible to solve any of these problems using the simplex algorithm, or in worst-case polynomial time using the ellipsoid method, each specialization has a smaller solution space and thus more efficient algorithms designed to take advantage of its special structure.

=== Balanced assignment ===
In the balanced assignment problem, both parts of the bipartite graph have the same number of vertices, denoted by &quot;n&quot;.

One of the first polynomial-time algorithms for balanced assignment was the Hungarian algorithm. It is a &quot;global&quot; algorithm – it is based on improving a matching along augmenting paths (alternating paths between unmatched vertices). Its run-time complexity, when using Fibonacci heaps, is formula_3, where &quot;m&quot; is a number of edges. This is currently the fastest run-time of a strongly polynomial algorithm for this problem. If all weights are integers, then the run-time can be improved to formula_4, but the resulting algorithm is only weakly-polynomial. If the weights are integers, and all weights are at most &quot;C&quot; (where &quot;C&quot;&gt;1 is some integer), then the problem can be solved in formula_5 weakly-polynomial time in a method called &quot;weight scaling&quot;.

In addition to the global methods, there are &quot;local methods&quot; which are based on finding local updates (rather than full augmenting paths). These methods have worse asymptotic runtime guarantees, but they often work better in practice. These algorithms are called auction algorithms, push-relabel algorithms, or preflow-push algorithms. Some of these algorithms were shown to be equivalent.

Some of the local methods assume that the graph admits a &quot;perfect matching&quot;; if this is not the case, then some of these methods might run forever. A simple technical way to solve this problem is to extend the input graph to a &quot;complete bipartite graph,&quot; by adding artificial edges with very large weights. These weights should exceed the weights of all existing matchings, to prevent appearance of artificial edges in the possible solution.

As shown by Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani, the problem of minimum weight perfect matching is converted to finding minors in the adjacency matrix of a graph. Using the isolation lemma, a minimum weight perfect matching in a graph can be found with probability at least . For a graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices, it requires formula_6 time.

=== Unbalanced assignment ===
In the unbalanced assignment problem, the larger part of the bipartite graph has &quot;n&quot; vertices and the smaller part has &quot;r&quot;&lt;&quot;n&quot; vertices. There is also a constant &quot;s&quot; which is at most the cardinality of a maximum matching in the graph. The goal is to find a minimum-cost matching of size exactly &quot;s&quot;. The most common case is the case in which the graph admits a one-sided-perfect matching (i.e., a matching of size &quot;r&quot;), and &quot;s&quot;=&quot;r&quot;.

Unbalanced assignment can be reduced to a balanced assignment. The naive reduction is to add formula_7 new vertices to the smaller part and connect them to the larger part using edges of cost 0. However, this requires formula_8 new edges. A more efficient reduction is called the &quot;doubling technique&quot;. Here, a new graph &quot;G&#x27;&quot; is built from two copies of the original graph &quot;G&quot;: a forward copy &quot;Gf&quot; and a backward copy &quot;Gb.&quot; The backward copy is &quot;flipped&quot;, so that, in each side of &quot;G&quot;&#x27;, there are now &quot;n&quot;+&quot;r&quot; vertices. Between the copies, we need to add two kinds of linking edges:

* Large-to-large: from each vertex in the larger part of &quot;Gf&quot;, add a zero-cost edge to the corresponding vertex in &quot;Gb&quot;.
* Small-to-small: if the original graph does not have a one-sided-perfect matching, then from each vertex in the smaller part of &quot;Gf&quot;, add a very-high-cost edge to the corresponding vertex in &quot;Gb&quot;.

All in all, at most formula_9 new edges are required. The resulting graph always has a perfect matching of size formula_9. A minimum-cost perfect matching in this graph must consist of minimum-cost maximum-cardinality matchings in &quot;Gf&quot; and &quot;Gb.&quot; The main problem with this doubling technique is that there is no speed gain when formula_11.

Instead of using reduction, the unbalanced assignment problem can be solved by directly generalizing existing algorithms for balanced assignment. The Hungarian algorithm can be generalized to solve the problem in formula_12 strongly-polynomial time. In particular, if &quot;s&quot;=&quot;r&quot; then the runtime is formula_13. If the weights are integers, then Thorup&#x27;s method can be used to get a runtime of formula_14.

=== Solution by linear programming ===
The assignment problem can be solved by presenting it as a linear program. For convenience we will present the maximization problem. Each edge , where &quot;i&quot; is in A and &quot;j&quot; is in T, has a weight formula_15. For each edge we have a variable formula_16. The variable is 1 if the edge is contained in the matching and 0 otherwise, so we set the domain constraints: 
formula_17 formula_18

The total weight of the matching is: formula_19. The goal is to find a maximum-weight perfect matching.

To guarantee that the variables indeed represent a perfect matching, we add constraints saying that each vertex is adjacent to exactly one edge in the matching, i.e., 
formula_20.

All in all we have the following LP:

formula_21formula_22formula_17formula_18This is an integer linear program. However, we can solve it without the integrality constraints (i.e., drop the last constraint), using standard methods for solving continuous linear programs. While this formulation allows also fractional variable values, in this special case, the LP always has an optimal solution where the variables take integer values. This is because the constraint matrix of the fractional LP is totally unimodular – it satisfies the four conditions of Hoffman and Gale.

=== Other methods and approximation algorithms===

Other approaches for the assignment problem exist and are reviewed by Duan and Pettie (see Table II). Their work proposes an approximation algorithm for the assignment problem (and the more general maximum weight matching problem), which runs in linear time for any fixed error bound.

== Many-to-many assignment ==
In the basic assignment problem, each agent is assigned to at most one task and each task is assigned to at most one agent. In the many-to-many assignment problem, each agent &quot;i&quot; may take up to &quot;ci&quot; tasks (&quot;ci&quot; is called the agent&#x27;s &quot;capacity&quot;), and each task &quot;j&quot; may be taken by up to &quot;dj&quot; agents simultaneously (&quot;dj&quot; is called the task&#x27;s &quot;capacity&quot;). If the sums of capacities in both sides are equal (formula_25), then the problem is &quot;balanced&quot;, and the goal is to find a perfect matching (assign exactly &quot;ci&quot; tasks to each agent &quot;i&quot; and exactly &quot;dj&quot; agents to each task &quot;j&quot;) such that the total cost is as small as possible. 

The problem can be solved by reduction to the minimum cost network flow problem. Construct a flow network with the following layers: 

* Layer 1: One source-node s.
* Layer 2: a node for each agent. There is an arc from s to each agent &quot;i&quot;, with cost 0 and capacity &quot;ci&quot; .
* Level 3: a node for each task. There is an arc from each agent &quot;i&quot; to each task &quot;j&quot;, with the corresponding cost, and capacity 1.
* Level 4: One sink-node t. There is an arc from each task to t, with cost 0 and capacity &quot;dj&quot;.

An integral maximum flow of minimum cost can be found in polynomial time; see network flow problem. Every integral maximum flow in this network corresponds to a matching in which at most &quot;ci&quot; tasks are assigned to each agent &quot;i&quot; and at most &quot;dj&quot; agents are assigned to each task &quot;j&quot; (in the balanced case, exactly &quot;ci&quot; tasks are assigned to &quot;i&quot; and exactly &quot;dj&quot; agents are assigned to &quot;j&quot;). A min-cost maximum flow corresponds to a min-cost assignment.

==Generalization==
When phrased as a graph theory problem, the assignment problem can be extended from bipartite graphs to arbitrary graphs. The corresponding problem, of finding a matching in a weighted graph where the sum of weights is maximized, is called the maximum weight matching problem.

Another generalization of the assignment problem is extending the number of sets to be matched from two to many. So that rather than matching agents to tasks, the problem is extended to matching agents to tasks to time intervals to locations. This results in Multidimensional assignment problem (MAP).

<text>The World Customs Organization (WCO) is an intergovernmental organization headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. Notable projects include its collaboration with the WTO on trade facilitation and the implementation of the SAFE Framework of Standards to secure global supply chains. The WCO works on customs-related matters including the development of international conventions, instruments, and tools on topics such as commodity classification, valuation, rules of origin, collection of customs revenue, supply chain security, international trade facilitation, customs enforcement activities, combating counterfeiting in support of intellectual property rights (IPR), illegal drug enforcement, combating counterfeiting of medicinal drugs, illegal weapons trading, integrity promotion, and delivering sustainable capacity building to assist with customs reforms and modernization. The WCO maintains the international Harmonized System (HS) goods nomenclature, and administers the technical aspects of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements on Customs Valuation and Rules of Origin. The WCO oversees the implementation of new technologies, artificial intelligence, to improve the efficiency of customs operations. Furthermore, the WCO is involved in addressing emerging issues, such as the digitalization of customs systems.

==History==
On 23 August 1947 the Committee for European Economic Cooperation created a European Customs Union Study Group (ECUSG) to examine economic and technical issues of inter-European Customs Union concerning the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In total, six ECUSG meetings were held in four years from November 1947 to June 1950. This work of ECUSG led to the adoption in 1950 of the Convention establishing the Customs Co-operation Council (CCC), which was signed in Brussels. On 26 January 1953 the CCC&#x27;s inaugural session took place with the participation of 17 founding members. CCC membership subsequently expanded to cover all regions of the globe. In 1994, the organization adopted its current name, the World Customs Organization. Today, WCO members are responsible for customs controls in 186 countries representing more than 98 percent of all international trade.

One of the major turning points in the WCO’s history was its expansion beyond Europe, which allowed it to become a truly global organization. This expansion was fueled by the recognition of the need for standardized customs procedures across different regions of the world, particularly in the post-colonial period when many new nations were emerging. The WCO played a crucial role in helping these nations establish efficient customs administrations. In the 21st century, the WCO has emphasized digitalization and the harmonization of customs systems to address the challenges of global e-commerce and cross-border trade.

==Vision and objectives==
The WCO is internationally acknowledged as the global center of customs expertise and plays a leading role in the discussion, development, promotion and implementation of modern customs systems and procedures. The WCO has supported the modernization of customs procedures in over 180 countries through initiatives like the Revised Kyoto Convention and the Harmonized System. It is responsive to the needs of its members and its strategic environment, and its instruments and best-practice approaches are recognized as the basis for sound customs administration throughout the world.

The WCO&#x27;s primary objective is to enhance the efficiency effectiveness other members customs administrations, thereby assisting them to contribute successfully to national development goals, particularly revenue collection, national security, trade facilitation, community protection, and collection of trade statistics.
==Instruments==
In order to achieve its objectives, the WCO has adopted a number of customs instruments, including but not limited to the following:
== Online tools ==
The World Customs Organization (WCO) released a new online platform, WCO Trade Tools, that encompasses the Harmonized System, preferential Rules of Origin and Valuation. It includes the 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 and 2022 editions of the HS, around 400 Free Trade Agreements with their preferential Rules of Origin/ and Product Specific rules, and the set list of Valuation texts, including those of the Technical Committee on Customs Valuation.

==Administration==
The WCO Secretariat is headed by a Secretary General, who is elected by the WCO membership to a five-year term. Ian Saunders from the United States was elected WCO Secretary General in June 2023 and took office on 1 January 2024. 
The WCO is governed by the council, which brings together all members of the organization once a year, in a meeting chaired by an elected chairperson. Additional strategic and management guidance is provided by the Policy and Finance committees.
There are several other WCO committees, including the Harmonized System Committee, the Permanent Technical Committee, the Technical Committee on Customs Valuation, Technical Committee on Rules of Origin, the Capacity Building Committee, and the SAFE Working Group.

Under the leadership of recent Secretaries General, the WCO has increasingly embraced digital transformation in customs practices, focusing on the adoption of technology to streamline border processes. These initiatives, such as the implementation of artificial intelligence in customs operations, have placed the WCO at the forefront of modern customs administration, ensuring that its members are well-equipped to face the challenges of an increasingly interconnected global economy.

<doc id="140599" wikidata="Q768312" url="?curid=140599" title="Basidium">
<text>A basidium (: basidia) is a microscopic spore-producing structure found on the hymenophore of reproductive bodies of basidiomycete fungi. The presence of basidia is one of the main characteristic features of the group. These bodies are also called tertiary mycelia, which are highly coiled versions of secondary mycelia. A basidium usually bears four sexual spores called basidiospores. Occasionally the number may be two or even eight. Each reproductive spore is produced at the tip of a narrow prong or horn called a sterigma (), and is forcefully expelled at full growth.

The word &quot;basidium&quot; literally means &quot;little pedestal&quot;. This is the way the basidium supports the spores. However, some biologists suggest that the structure looks more like a club. A partially grown basidium is known as a basidiole.

==Structure==
Most basidiomycota have single celled basidia (holobasidia), but some have ones with many cells (a phragmobasidia). For instance, rust fungi in the order &quot;Puccinales&quot; have phragmobasidia with four cells that are separated by walls along their cross section. Some jelly fungi in the order Tremellales also have phragmobasidia with four cells that are separated by walls and are shaped like a cross. Sometimes the basidium develops from a probasidium, which is not elongated like a typical hypha. The basidium may be stalked or attached directly to the hyphae.

The basidium is normally club-shaped: narrow at the stem and wide near its outer end. It is widest in the middle hemispherical dome at its apex, and its base is about half the size of the widest diameter at the highest point. Basidia with a short and narrow base are shaped like an inverted egg, and occur in genera such as &quot;Paullicorticium&quot;, &quot;Oliveonia&quot;, and &quot;Tulasnella&quot;. Basidia with a wide base are often shaped like a barrel.

==How basidiospores are expelled==
In most basidiomycota, the basidiospores are forcibly expelled. The propulsive force is derived from a sudden change in the center of gravity of the discharged spore. Important factors in forcible discharge include Buller&#x27;s drop, a drop of fluid that builds up at the nearer tip (hilar appendage) of each basidiospore; the offset attachment of the spore to the extending narrow prong, and the presence of hygroscopic regions on the basidiospore surface. Basidiospore discharge can only succeed after sufficient water vapor has condensed on the spore.

When a basidiospore matures, sugars present in the cell wall begin to serve as condensation loci for water vapour in the air. Two separate regions of condensation are critical. At the pointed tip of the spore (the hilum) closest to the supporting basidium, Buller&#x27;s drop builds up as a large, almost spherical water droplet.

At the same time, condensation occurs in a thin film on the stalk-facing part of the spore. When these two bodies of water combine, the release of surface tension and the sudden change in the center of gravity suddenly expels the basidiospore. Remarkably, the initial acceleration of the spore is estimated to be about 10,000 .

===Evolutionary loss of expulsion by force===
Some basidiomycetes do not have a means to forcibly expel their basidiospores, although they still form them. In each of these groups, spore dispersal occurs through other means of expulsion.

For example:
* Members of the order Phallales (stinkhorns) rely on insect vectors for dispersal.
* The dry spores of the Lycoperdales (puffballs) and Sclerodermataceae (earth balls and kin) are dispersed when the basidiocarps are disturbed.
* Species of the Nidulariales (bird&#x27;s nest fungi) use a splash cup mechanism.

In these cases the basidiospore typically lacks a hilar appendage, and expulsion by force does not occur. Each example is thought to represent an independent evolutionary loss of the forcible discharge that comes before all basidiomycetes.

<text>Boyoma Falls (, , ), formerly known as Stanley Falls (French: &quot;Chutes Stanley&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Stanleywatervallen&quot;), is a series of seven cataracts, each no more than high, extending over more than along a curve of the Lualaba River between the river port towns of Ubundu and Kisangani (also known as Boyoma) in the Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The seven cataracts have a total drop of . They form the largest waterfall by volume of annual flow rate in the world, exceeding both the Niagara Falls and the Iguazu Falls.

The two major cataracts are the first below Ubundu, forming a narrow and crooked stream that is hardly accessible, and the last that can be seen and visited from Kisangani. At the bottom of the rapids, the Lualaba is known as the Congo River. A 1m-gauge portage railway bypasses the series of rapids, connecting Kisangani and Ubundu.

The last of the seven cataracts of the Boyoma Falls is also known as the Wagenia Falls (, ), referring to the local Wagenya fishermen, who have developed a special technique to fish in the river. They build systems of wooden tripods across the rapids fixed in holes carved in the rock by the water current. These serve as anchors for baskets that entrap large fish. The baskets are lowered in the rapids to “sieve” the waters for fish. It is a very selective fishing method, as these baskets are quite big, and only large fish are entrapped.

The falls were formerly named after Henry Morton Stanley, who explored the region and noted the fishing technique of the Wagenya. According to Stanley, &quot;...by taking advantage of the rocks, the natives have been enabled to fix upright heavy poles, 6 inches in diameter, to each of which they attach enormous fish-baskets by means of rattan-cane cable. There are probably sixty or seventy baskets laid in the river on each side, every day; and though some may be brought up empty, in general they seem to be tolerably successful, for out of half-a-dozen baskets...twenty-eight large fish were collected...&quot;

<doc id="140607" wikidata="Q20034" url="?curid=140607" title="Lasagna">
<text>Lasagna (, ; ), also known as lasagne (), is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (&quot;al forno&quot;). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.

==Etymology==
In ancient Rome, there was a dish similar to a traditional lasagna called or &quot;&quot; (Latin for &#x27;container&#x27; or &#x27;pot&#x27;) described in the book &quot;De re coquinaria&quot; by Marcus Gavius Apicius, but the word could have a more ancient origin. The first theory is that &quot;lasagna&quot; comes from Greek λάγανον (&quot;laganon&quot;), a flat sheet of pasta dough cut into strips. The word λαγάνα (&quot;lagana&quot;) is still used in Greek to mean a flat thin type of unleavened bread baked for the Clean Monday holiday.

Another theory is that the word lasagna comes from the Greek λάσανα (&quot;lasana&quot;) or λάσανον (&quot;lasanon&quot;) meaning &#x27;trivet&#x27;, &#x27;stand for a pot&#x27; or &#x27;chamber pot&#x27;. The Romans borrowed the word as &quot;lasanum&quot;, meaning &#x27;cooking pot&#x27;. The Italians used the word to refer to the cookware in which lasagna is made. Later the food took on the name of the serving dish.

Another proposed link or reference is the 14th-century English dish &quot;loseyn&quot; as described in &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;, a cookbook prepared by &quot;the chief Master Cooks of King Richard II&quot;, which included English recipes as well as dishes influenced by Spanish, French, Italian, and Arab cuisines. This dish has similarities to modern lasagna in both its recipe, which features a layering of ingredients between pasta sheets, and its name. An important difference is the lack of tomatoes, which did not arrive in Europe until after Columbus reached the Americas in 1492. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, while the earliest cookbook found with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, but the author had obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.

As with most other types of pasta, the Italian word is a plural form: &quot;lasagne&quot; meaning more than one sheet of &quot;lasagna&quot;, although, in many other languages, a derivative of the singular word &quot;lasagna&quot; is used for the popular baked pasta dish. When referring to the baked dish, regional usage in Italy favours the plural form &quot;lasagne&quot; in the north of the country and the singular &quot;lasagna&quot; in the south. The former plural usage has influenced the usual spelling found in British English, while the southern Italian singular usage has influenced the spelling often used in American English. Both &quot;lasagna&quot; and &quot;lasagne&quot; are used as singular non-count (uncountable) nouns in English.

==Origins and history==
Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the &quot;Memoriali Bolognesi&quot; (&#x27;Bolognese Memorials&#x27;), in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th century in the &quot;Liber de Coquina&quot; (&quot;The Book of Cookery&quot;). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagna, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets, boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the &quot;Liber de Coquina&quot; recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.

==Variations==

===Pasta===
Mass-produced lasagne with a ruffled edge is called &quot;lasagna riccia&quot;, &quot;doppio festone&quot;, &quot;sciabò&quot;, and &quot;sciablò&quot;. In the Veneto, factory-produced &quot;lasagne&quot; are called &quot;bardele&quot; or &quot;lasagnoni&quot;. Narrower &quot;lasagne&quot; are &quot;mezze lasagne&quot;, and if with a ruffled edge, &quot;mezze lasagne ricche&quot;. Similar pastas are the narrower &quot;lasagnette&quot; and its longer cousin, the &quot;lasagnotte&quot; (&quot;cappellasci&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] in Liguria), as well as the &quot;sagne&quot; of Salento (the &quot;heel&quot; of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;), and &quot;lagana&quot; in the remainder of Apulia.

===Dish===

The lasagna of Naples, &quot;lasagne di Carnevale&quot;, is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with Neapolitan ragù, a meat sauce.

&quot;Lasagne al forno&quot;, layered with a thicker ragù and béchamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are traditionally green (the colour is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough) and served with ragù (a thick sauce made with onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes), béchamel sauce, and Parmesan cheese.

In other regions, lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork, veal or chicken), and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, and mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are baked (&quot;al forno&quot;).

Traditionally, pasta dough prepared in southern Italy used semolina and water; in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, flour and eggs were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is durum wheat, industrial lasagne are made from durum wheat semolina.

<text>Randolph Adolphus Turpin (7 June 1928 – 17 May 1966), better known as Randy Turpin, was a British boxer active in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1951 he became world middleweight champion when he defeated Sugar Ray Robinson. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2001.

His life story was a classic tale of, from rags to riches and back again. In which he managed to fight his way out of poverty and become a wealthy man. However, he was unable to hold on to the money he earned and ended up living in impoverished circumstances, whilst being hounded by the Inland Revenue for unpaid tax.

==Early life==
Randolph Turpin was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, to a black father, Lionel, who had been born in British Guiana (now known as Guyana) in 1896. He came to England to fight in the First World War. He met Randolph&#x27;s mother after coming out of hospital following treatment for his injuries sustained towards the end of the war. During his service, he fought at the battle of the Somme. He died within a year of Randolph&#x27;s birth, having never really recovered from the lung damage caused by a gas attack. This left Randolph&#x27;s mother Beatrice (née Whitehouse, 1904–1974), to raise five children on her own.

Being a widow with five children to look after, Beatrice struggled to make ends meet on a small war pension and had to work from morning to night as a domestic cleaner to earn money. As a result, she sent two of her children to live with relatives. 
However, she remarried in 1931 to a man named Ernest Manley, who became stepfather to the children and the family were reunited. Beatrice was the daughter of a former bare-knuckle fighter and was by all accounts a feisty woman who would tell her children to stand up for themselves when they were subjected to abuse.

Randolph was the youngest of the five children. Lionel Jr (commonly known as Dick Turpin) was the eldest followed by Joan, John (commonly known as Jackie), Kathleen and Randolph. Although he was born in Leamington, he actually grew up and went to school in the nearby town of Warwick. He nearly drowned when he was a child, when he became trapped underwater whilst swimming. The accident resulted in a burst eardrum which left him partially deaf in one ear, due to this disability, some people assumed he was &#x27;aloof&#x27;.[8] He also nearly died from double pneumonia and bronchitis.

Contrary to popular belief, his nickname the &#x27;Leamington Licker&#x27; did not come from the fact that he was a professional boxer. It originated from his childhood, when Randolph, Jackie and Joan were all born in June: Randolph on the 7th, Jackie on the 13th and Joan on the 19th. When the month of June came around, because Randolph&#x27;s birthday came first, he thought that made him the eldest of the three. Joan told tell him that he was the littlest. He got angry and screamed &quot;I&#x27;m not the lickerest&quot; (he couldn&#x27;t pronounce the word &#x27;littlest&#x27; properly). Following a bit of goading, Randolph charged at her with both fists flailing. As a result, &#x27;Licker&#x27; became the family nickname for him.

==Amateur career==
He started boxing exhibition bouts during the interval, at local boxing shows when his brother Dick was fighting. Then at the boxing booth when the fair was in town, with his brother Jackie. In a double act called &#x27;Alexander and Moses&#x27;, where they fought for nobbins (money thrown into the ring by the spectators).

His amateur boxing career commenced at the Leamington Boys Club and continued when he joined the Royal Navy. He actually lost his first amateur contest by decision but then went on to only lose another two contests in a total of 100 fights.

He won three national junior titles and won the senior ABA championship in 1945 at welterweight and in 1946 at middleweight. In 1945 he won both the junior and senior ABA titles in the same season. The only person to have completed such a feat and the first black boxer to win a senior ABA championship. The rules have been changed over the years and junior boxers can no longer enter the senior championships; meaning that no one will be able to match his feat. He also fought for Great Britain in the annual televised match against the US in 1946, scoring a first-round knockout in his contest.

==Professional career==
He was approached by many top professional managers but decided to turn professional with George Middleton, a local man who managed his brother Dick.

He made his professional debut in London on 17 September 1946 stopping Gordon Griffiths. He scored another 14 victories before drawing over six rounds with Mark Hart in 1947. He suffered two defeats in 1948: the first a points decision to Albert Finch over eight rounds and the second a stoppage defeat to Jean Stock. Turpin was knocked down four times and retired on his stool at the end of round five.

It was said that the two defeats were as a result of marital problems that he was experiencing at that time. On the day of the Stock fight he had been notified that his wife had been given custody of their son and he had told his brother Dick that he didn&#x27;t feel like fighting and wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if he lost. After the Stock fight he took a five-month break from the sport to try and sort his personal life out.

He had embarked on a weight training regime designed by a man called Arthur Batty and built up his physical strength. Weight training was frowned upon in boxing circles because it was thought that it made fighters muscle-bound and inflexible in their movements. Turpin proved to be the exception to this rule and many of his future opponents including Sugar Ray Robinson would comment on his immense physical strength. Turpin developed a knockout punch with either hand and became a formidable force for any fighter to deal with.

He went on a winning streak where he avenged the two defeats that he had suffered and, in the process, picked up the British Middleweight Title and the vacant European Middleweight Title. Incidentally his brother Dick had been the first non-white fighter to win a British Title when he had beaten Vince Hawkins in 1948 for the British Middleweight Title, following the removal of the colour bar that had been in place since 1911.

In 1951 Sugar Ray Robinson, who is considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time, embarked on a European tour. The final leg of his tour was a fight for the world title with Randolph Turpin in London. Few people gave Turpin a chance of winning against Robinson and in fact many people thought that it was a mismatch and that Turpin could be badly hurt. Robinson had been unbeaten as an amateur and had only lost one fight out of a total of 132 as a professional, and that was to Jake LaMotta. He had subsequently avenged the loss to LaMotta, beating him a total of five times.

On 10 July 1951 a crowd of 18,000 turned up at Earls Court to watch Turpin fight Robinson. Many people listened to the fight on the wireless to see if Turpin could beat Robinson. Turpin was not overawed by the occasion and took the fight to Robinson from the first bell. Robinson had trouble dealing with Turpin&#x27;s awkward style of fighting and was manhandled by Turpin in the clinches. By the 15th round Turpin was ahead on points and only had to survive the round to win. At the end of the fight Turpin&#x27;s glove was raised by the referee in victory. He was the first British fighter to hold the world middleweight title since Bob Fitzsimmons in 1891. He had become an overnight sporting hero. Two days later he was given a civic reception before a crowd of 10,000 people in his home town of Leamington with the mayors of both Leamington and Warwick present.

Boxing in the 1950s was a mainstream sport alongside football and cricket and with the advent of television it was increasing in popularity. Britain was still recovering from the impact of the war and was a bleak place to live for a lot of people, with rationing of food still in place. As such, the victory of a British fighter over an American fighter who was already being regarded as a superstar in the sport of boxing, was something for the whole nation to cheer about.

In order to get the fight with Robinson, Turpin had to sign a contract that contained a 90-day return clause. Meaning that if he won, he had to give Robinson a return fight within 90 days of the original fight. The return fight took place on 12 September 1951 at the Polo Grounds, New York before a crowd of 61,370 people.

Turpin again gave Robinson a hard fight and it was fairly even going into the 10th round. Robinson sustained a bad cut and in desperation went for a knockout. He managed to knock Turpin down with a big right-hand punch. Turpin got up at the count of seven and was then trapped against the ropes and taking a sustained beating when the referee Ruby Goldstein stopped the fight. Some people said that the stoppage was premature but by today&#x27;s standards it was not. Turpin&#x27;s reign had lasted only 64 days.

In a article, written in April 1952, quoted Randolph as wanting to retire in &#x27;one or two years&#x27; and go into business with Leslie T. Salts (owner of Gwrych Castle), and teach youngsters across Britain to fight in the &#x27;ideal surroundings&#x27; of Gwrych, instead of the school of hard knocks he experienced as a youth. He planned on building a gymnasium at the castle for young boxers to train in.

During his time at Gwrych, he picked up on a few Welsh words from dating Gwyneth Price and he would sign his autographs with &#x27;Hên lwc&#x27; (Old luck), &#x27;Pob lwc&#x27; (Every luck) and &#x27;Lwc Dda&#x27; (Good luck), although it is not known how proficient he was at speaking it.

Turpin fought Don Cockell in 1952 for the British and Commonwealth Light Heavyweight Titles. He stopped Cockell in the 11th round. Cockell would later go on to give Rocky Marciano a good fight for the heavyweight title.

Turpin regained the European Middleweight Title in 1953 with a points victory over Charles Humez, and was recognised as world champion in Europe. However, Turpin&#x27;s world title was not recognised in America. Following the retirement of Sugar Ray Robinson Turpin was nominated to fight for the vacant World Middleweight Title against Carl &#x27;Bobo&#x27; Olsen.

The fight against Olson took place at Madison Square Gardens in 1953. Turpin had not trained properly for the fight (the reason became apparent after the fight). He won the first three rounds but then faded badly and was outpointed over 15 rounds having been floored in the ninth and tenth rounds. Turpin spent much of the fight trapped on the ropes taking punches at close quarters to the head and body. After the fight Turpin was urinating blood indicating that he had suffered damage to his kidneys from Olson&#x27;s sustained body punches.

The Olson fight was the turning point in Turpin&#x27;s career. He was never the same fighter after the punishment he absorbed in that fight and thereafter became a diminished fighting force. In addition, he was having trouble making the middleweight weight limit of 11st 6lbs (160lbs).

Turpin suffered a first round stoppage loss to Tiberio Mitri who was not known as a big puncher. In Rome in 1954 when he was caught by a left hook and half punched and half pushed to the canvas. He fell heavily and hit the back of his head on the ring floor, staggering to his feet only to collapse into the ropes before again regaining his feet. The referee decided he was in no fit state to continue and stopped the fight.

Mitri had exploited a flaw in Turpin&#x27;s boxing technique whereby he dropped his right hand which was supposed to protect his chin, leaving him exposed to a left hook. In his younger days his reflexes had been fast enough to prevent such a thing from happening. But as he aged his reflexes began to slow and his punch resistance diminished. In addition, he was suffering from eye problems. His eyes had become misaligned and his peripheral vision was starting to deteriorate. The British Board of Boxing control (BBBC) made Turpin have a full medical, but decided that he was fit enough to continue his career.

Following a nine-month break, Turpin returned as a light heavyweight 12st 7lbs (175lbs), but could no longer be considered a true world title contender in this weight division. Although there was talk of matching him against Archie Moore for the world title. He was fighting bigger men, who were just as strong as he was and could absorb his punches whilst punching, as hard as he did. Thus, taking away some of the advantages he had enjoyed whilst boxing as a middleweight.

He still dominated at a domestic level and in 1955 he beat Alex Buxton to take the British and Commonwealth Light Heavyweight Titles. However, in October of that year he was knocked out by the unheralded Canadian dock worker Gordon Wallace. Suffering four knockdowns in the process and announced his retirement.

He came out of retirement in 1956 and scored two wins before losing on points to Hans Stretz in Germany. In November of that year he beat Alex Buxton again for the British Light Heavyweight Title.

The BBBC stopped a proposed fight between Turpin and Willie Pastrano from going ahead because they thought that it was not in the best interests of boxing. In other words, they thought that Turpin might get hurt, which would damage the image of boxing.

He had his final fight in 1958 when he was badly knocked out by Yolande Pompey. Turpin was knocked flat on his back by a right-hand punch to the side of the head. He gamely tried to get up four times but each time stumbled whilst trying to regain his feet and fell back onto the canvas before being counted out. He had knocked Pompey down in the first round but instead of trying to finish him off had touched gloves in a gesture of sportsmanship, which may well have cost him the fight.

The BBBC stopped him acting as a sparring partner for Terry Downes in 1961. Because of their fears concerning the cumulative effect on his physical health of the punishment he had absorbed during the course of his boxing career. He had two unlicensed fights (not licensed by the BBBC) in 1963 and 1964 against opponents who were making their professional debuts and he stopped both of them.

==Personal life==

After leaving school Randolph worked as a labourer on building sites. In 1945 he decided to join the Royal Navy&#x27;s , a boy&#x27;s training establishment where he was training to become a cook. He was known to serve &#x27;cold and lumpy breakfast porridge&#x27;, according to accounts of a fellow crew member. In 1986 John Douglas recalled; &quot;As a member of the boxing team, and later lightweight champ of the Home Fleet, I was selected to sort out the chef. I thought it was going to be easy, but he was one of the few who treated us as humans, he was also pleasant, with a ready smile. So, I let him off.&quot;

However, as he was talented at boxing, he was allowed to spend most of his time training for upcoming contests because of the Kudos his winning of national titles brought to them. He stayed in the Navy until 1948.

He was charged in 1945 with trying to commit suicide following a lovers&#x27; tiff with his then girlfriend Mary Stack, after swallowing liniment. Attempted suicide was at that time a criminal offence. However, the incident was investigated and was determined to be accidental.

He married his first wife Mary (née Stack, 1928–2019) in 1947. However, the marriage was not a happy one. The problems between them stemmed from the fact that they were both teenagers when they married and as such were still immature. She believed that he was cheating on her with other women behind her back. In addition, he had a controlling personality and was short-tempered. She stated that he was not averse to using his fists, to settle arguments between them.

She accused him of domestic abuse in 1948. The incident had occurred after he had stayed out all night and she had asked him when he got home, where he had been. He initially said that he had stayed at a friend’s house. She didn’t believe him and thought that he had spent the night with another woman. He had then told her that it was none of her business what he got up to in his own time. She stating that he had attacked her. Hitting her with a broom handle with such force that it broke. When she had cried out &quot;Don&#x27;t hit me anymore. I am expecting a baby.&quot; He had said &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll soon fix that&quot; and kicked her in the stomach whilst she was lying on the floor, where he had knocked her. Turpin denied her allegations but did admit to slapping her face when she had sworn at him and called him names. The charges against him were dismissed at the end of the court case. They had a son together called Randolph Turpin Jr but were eventually divorced in 1953. Following the divorce Turpin became estranged from his son.

Turpin met Adele Daniels when training in America for the return fight with Robinson. They started a relationship and he promised to marry her and bring her to England. He lost touch with her when he went back home but they rekindled their relationship when he returned to America for the Olson fight. Following the fight, she accused him of rape and assault. Turpin was arrested but she dropped the charges during the course of the subsequent trial and settled for an out of court payment. Turpin denied her allegations and stated that she was trying to get her revenge on him for reneging on his promise to marry her. 
The incident led to Randolph falling out with his brother Dick whom he blamed for telling Daniels what had happened in his first marriage.

Turpin developed a reputation for being a playboy and womaniser during his peak years and was named in a divorce action, where a husband alleged that Turpin had committed adultery with his wife.

Turpin met his second wife Gwyneth (née Price, 1925–1992) the daughter of a Welsh farmer whilst training for the Robinson fight at Gwrych Castle in Wales. They married in Wellington, Telford in 1953 and had four daughters, Gwyneth, Annette, Charmaine and Carmen.

He had a keen interest in reading American comic books, when he wasn&#x27;t busy training, he would often be found reading them on the grounds of Gwrych Castle in the evenings and when he was done, he&#x27;d fold them into his pocket, he was also interested in reading poetry.

==Business dealings and bankruptcy==

Turpin bought The Great Ormes Head hotel with his business partner Leslie Salts. The business never made money and It became a drain on his resources and was eventually sold at a loss in 1961, prior to Turpin being made bankrupt. He had been advised not to go ahead with the investment by his manager because he didn&#x27;t believe that Salts was trustworthy.

Turpin had been free and easy with his money when in his prime. His attitude towards money was that it was for spending and that as he had earned it, he could spend it as he pleased. However, he took this philosophy too far and failed to keep track of his spending. In addition, he became a soft touch for anyone with a hard luck story and gave money away or lent it to people whom he considered to be his friends. Turpin once said &quot;I am really a most illiterate man about money.&quot; During the course of his career he is estimated from records kept by his manager, to have grossed in the region of £300,000. Which would be the equivalent of £7,000,000 in today&#x27;s money when re-valued by the rate of inflation.

Prior to the second Robinson fight the system had been that an accountant dealt with the financial matters and his manager countersigned cheques for Randolph to withdraw money from his boxing earnings. However, after the second Robinson fight. He said that he wanted to take control of his own finances and his manager obliged. His manager said that he tried to impress upon Randolph that boxing was a short career and that he should put some money away, so that he would have something to fall back on when his career was over. However, he wouldn&#x27;t take notice and continued spending money at a prodigious rate.

His problems with the Inland Revenue (HMRC) started after the second Robinson fight. He had been paid in cash for his share of the film rights for televising the fight. He didn’t declare this amount to HMRC and gave the money to one of his contacts for safe keeping. When he went back to the person to get his money, they wouldn’t give it to him. Furthermore, they reported him to HMRC for tax evasion. He couldn’t take legal action against the person to recover his money because he had not declared it as income for tax purposes.

As a result, in the years following the second Robinson fight. When he submitted his accounts and paid tax on the amount of earnings stated in them, less allowable expenses. The revenue started treating him as if he had understated his income and would issue an assessment based on what they estimated he had actually earned. Turpin kept appealing the assessments forwarded to him by the Inland Revenue (HMRC) in the belief that he had already paid all the tax due to them. HMRC assessed him on what they estimated he owed them over the period and sent him a tax bill for £100,000 for unpaid tax, penalty charges and interest, for the years where he had not made the additional tax payments. They said that he would have to appear at a commissioners hearing to finally settle the matter, as it had been dragging on for too many years.

Turpin had not kept good financial records and didn’t have receipts for a lot of the expenses that he had claimed against his income. Because he didn’t trust banks and paid for most things in cash. Meaning that there was no audit trail. He also claimed to have never received much of the money that he was said to have earned.

The tax bill was eventually reduced to an amount of £17,126 following an emotional appeal by his accountant Max Mitchell at the commissioners hearing, in which he said: &quot;As time goes on the punching power of a boxer is enfeebled. The longer he pursues his profession his brain through constant pummelling is numbed. His eyes are affected, deafness overtakes him and in effect he is lucky that in the prime of his manhood he doesn&#x27;t turn into a two-legged vegetable. And yet no allowance is given to a boxer by the Inland Revenue for the inevitable remorseless wasting away he undergoes because of the exacting nature of his profession. Is that fair? Therefore, I claim that my client&#x27;s expenses should be allowed although estimated, in view of the tax advantages allowed to industrialists.&quot;

However, by this time Turpin only had assets worth £1,204 left, and was declared bankrupt for an amount of £15,922 in 1962. Under the bankruptcy laws of that time Turpin was ordered to pay two pounds a week towards clearing his debt and was discharged from bankruptcy in 1965.

He had purchased a transport café in Leamington prior to being made bankrupt which was in his wife&#x27;s name. The building was under threat of compulsory purchase by the council when he bought it. However, he still went ahead, despite people telling him not to do so. For the first year, the cafe was partly managed by Arthur Adams who had previously worked for six years as a barman at Turpin and Salts&#x27; Great Orme&#x27;s Summit Hotel complex until he returned to Llandudno. Randolph put up a plaque behind the counter which said &quot;That which seldom comes back to him who waits is the money he lends to his friends.&quot; He worked at a scrapyard owned by his manager and then started to make a living as a wrestler.

He wrestled for a number of years but again made the mistake of not putting money aside to pay the tax bill on his wrestling earnings. At the bankruptcy hearing Turpin said that he didn&#x27;t have anyone looking after his financial affairs (an accountant) in relation to his wrestling earnings and added that he had not received any claims from the revenue on his earnings. At that the assistant receiver said &quot;You might be coming in here again then?&quot; Turpin replied &quot;No Sir, I don&#x27;t think that is possible.&quot;

To begin with he was billed as a boxer versus a wrestler and was paid over £100 for this type of contest. However, as time went on the novelty of seeing a former world boxing champion in the wrestling ring wore off. He was forced to actually start wrestling and accept in the region of £25 for a contest.

Apparently, he was amateurish at wrestling but received many bookings on the back of his name. He had only received rudimentary instructions on how to wrestle from his friend George Kidd and he was only doing it because he needed the money. To earn sufficient money, he started going on wrestling tours throughout the country and to kill the boredom in the evenings would go out drinking with his new wrestling friends. At his bankruptcy hearing he had said &quot;When you go out with the wrestling boys you can spend up to £10 to £15 a night.&quot; This illustrated his attitude. He was in dire financial straits, but would still stand his round on a night out with his friends.

Turpin stated that he received more injuries from wrestling than he ever did during his boxing career. Particularly to his back and legs as a result of being thrown around the ring by men who were more skilful than him in the art of wrestling.

==Death==

Three days before his death, Turpin had received a final demand from HMRC for £800 unpaid tax on his wrestling earnings. However, he had already spent the money he had earned from wrestling so he faced the prospect of being made bankrupt for a second time. Also, the council had decided to go ahead with the compulsory purchase of the property where he lived, to turn it into a car park. He had stopped wrestling and the café now provided his only source of income and the flat above it his home.

Since retiring from boxing, he had suffered from depression because of his money troubles. In addition, his personal doctor stated that he thought Turpin had become punch-drunk from all the blows that he had taken to the head during his boxing career. This had led to him becoming morose in his later years. He had become bitter about his boxing career, believing that he had been exploited by having to pay the tax on money that he had never received. Whenever strangers tried to talk to him about his time in the ring he would change the subject.

He was found dead from gunshot wounds in the flat above the transport café on 17 May 1966. He had a wound to the head (the bullet lodged against his skull and did not enter his brain) and a second wound to his heart which had killed him. His daughter Carmen, who was 17 months old at the time, also had two bullet wounds and it was assumed that he had shot her before taking his own life. His daughter was rushed to hospital and managed to make a full recovery. From all accounts, Turpin had been a doting father to his daughters.

His death was ruled suicide at the inquest. However, his family believed that he had been murdered and that it had been made to look like suicide, because he had left a typed letter written in 1964 stating that attempts had been made on his life to prevent him from getting money that he was owed and from talking to the authorities about business deals in the world of boxing. He stated that he was not scared of death but that they had now started threatening to harm his wife and children. He implied that the boxing promoter Jack Solomons was involved, although there is no evidence to back up this allegation. He had also been badly beaten up by four men. He had brushed it off at the time, stating that it must have just been some of the fans who had taken a disliking to him following one of his wrestling contests.

He had drifted apart from his brothers and sisters because they did not get on with his wife Gwyneth, and in a suicide note left pinned to the door of the room where he was found, he had told her not to give anything to them and that she should go back to Wales because that was the place where they had been happiest.

His death came less than a year after that of Freddie Mills, who was Britain&#x27;s other post-war boxing world champion. He had also died under mysterious circumstances and was also ruled to have taken his own life, although some claimed he had been murdered by gangsters.

==Memorial==
Due to the circumstances behind his death Turpin became somewhat of a forgotten hero. Turpin was inducted as a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York in 2001. There is a statue of him in Market Square, Warwick.

At his funeral, the Reverend Eugene Haselden said &quot;At the height of his career Randolph was surrounded by those who regarded themselves as friends and well-wishers. But he was deserted by many as he lost his position and money. The fickleness of his friends and the incompetent advice must have weighed so heavily upon him that he was forced to desperation. Randolph was a simple man, a naïve man and he needed friends to protect him from the spongers. To our shame he was let down. The tragedy is not his failure alone, but the failure of our whole society.&quot;

Following his comeback after the loss to Gordon Wallace. Turpin wrote a poem titled &#x27;The comeback road&#x27; the final verse of which is as follows:
&quot;So we leave this game which was hard and cruel.
And down at the show on a ringside stool.
We’ll watch the next man, just one more fool.&quot;

<text>Belzec (English: or , Polish: ) was a Nazi German extermination camp in occupied Poland. It was built by the SS for the purpose of implementing the secretive Operation Reinhard, the plan to murder all Polish Jews, a major part of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;, the overall Nazi effort to complete the genocide of all European Jews. Before Germany&#x27;s defeat put an end to this project more than six million Jews had been murdered in the Holocaust. The camp operated from to the end of . It was situated about south of the local railroad station of Bełżec, in the new Lublin District of the General Government territory of German-occupied Poland. The burning of exhumed corpses on five open-air grids and bone crushing continued until March 1943.

Between 430,000 and 500,000 Jews are believed to have been murdered by the SS at Bełżec. It was the third-deadliest extermination camp, exceeded only by Treblinka and Auschwitz. Only seven Jews performing slave labour with the camp&#x27;s &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; survived World War II. Only Rudolf Reder&#x27;s experience there became known, thanks to his official postwar testimony.
The lack of viable witnesses able to testify about the camp&#x27;s operation is the primary reason why Bełżec is little known, despite the victim number count. Israeli historian David Silberklang writes that Belzec &quot;was perhaps the place most representative of the totality and finality of the Nazi plans for Jews&quot;.
==Background==
In the Second Polish Republic, the village of Bełżec was situated between the two major cities in the southeastern part of the country including Lublin northwest of Bełżec, and Lwów to the southeast (, now Lviv, Ukraine) with the largest Jewish populations in the region. Bełżec fell within the German zone of occupation in accordance with the German-Soviet Pact against Poland. Originally, Jewish forced labour was brought into the area in April 1940 for the construction of military defence facilities of the German strategic plan codenamed Operation Otto against the Soviet advance beyond their common frontier following the Soviet invasion of 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;M/MPwB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the territory of the so-called Nisko &quot;reservation&quot;, the city of Lublin became the hub of the early Nazi transfer of about 95,000 German, Austrian, and Polish Jews expelled from the West and the General Government area. The prisoners were put to work by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) in the construction of anti-tank ditches (&quot;Burggraben&quot;) along the transitory Nazi-Soviet border. The &quot;Burggraben&quot; project was abandoned with the onset of Operation Barbarossa. On 13 October 1941, Heinrich Himmler gave the SS-and-Police Leader of Lublin, &quot;SS Brigadeführer&quot; Odilo Globočnik an order to start Germanizing the area around Zamość, which entailed the removal of Jews from the areas of future settlement.

===Camp construction===

The decision to begin work on the first stationary gas chambers in the General Government preceded the actual Wannsee Conference by three months. The first steps were taken between mid-September and mid-October 1941, and the construction began around 1 November. The site near Bełżec was chosen for several reasons: it was situated on the border between the Lublin District and the German District of Galicia formed after Operation Barbarossa. It could &quot;process&quot; the Jews of both regions. The ease of transportation was secured by the railroad junction at nearby Rawa-Ruska and the highway between Lublin-Stadt and Lemberg. The northern boundary of the planned killing centre consisted of an anti-tank trench constructed a year earlier. The ditch, excavated originally for military purposes was likely to serve as the first mass grave. Globocnik brought in &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Richard Thomalla who was a civil engineer by profession and the camp construction expert in the SS. Work had commenced in early November 1941, using local builders overseen by a squad of Trawniki guards. The installation, resembling a railway transit point for the purpose of forced labour, was finished before Christmas. It featured insulated barracks for showering among several other structures. Some local men were released. The SS completed the work in February 1942 by fitting in the tank engine and the exhaust piping systems for gassing. The trial killings were performed in early March.

The &quot;Final Solution&quot; was formulated at the Wannsee Conference in late January 1942 by the leading proponents of gassing (who were unaware of Bełżec&#x27;s existence), including Wilhelm Dolpheid, Ludwig Losacker, Helmut Tanzmann and Governor Otto Wächter. Dolpheid negotiated with the &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; Viktor Brack in Berlin for the use of the Aktion T4 personnel in the process. Only two months later, on 17 March 1942, the daily gassing operations at Bełżec extermination camp began with the T4 leadership brought in from Germany under the guise of Organisation Todt (OT).

===Experience in the Aktion T4 euthanasia program===

The three commandants of the camp including &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; officers &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Christian Wirth and &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Gottlieb Hering, had been involved in the forced euthanasia program since 1940 in common with almost all of their German staff thereafter. Wirth had the leading position as the supervisor of six extermination hospitals in the Reich; Hering was the non-medical chief of the Sonnenstein gassing facility in Saxony as well as at the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. Christian Wirth had been a killing expert from the beginning as participant of the first T-4 gassing of handicapped people at the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre. He was, therefore, an obvious choice to be the first commandant of the first stationary extermination camp of Operation Reinhard in the General Government. It was his proposal to use the exhaust gas emitted by the internal-combustion engine of a motorcar as the killing agent instead of the bottled carbon monoxide, because no delivery from outside the camp would be required as in the case of the T-4 method. However, Wirth decided that the comparable technology of mobile gas vans used at Chełmno extermination camp before December 1941 (and by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the East), had proven insufficient for the projected number of victims from the Holocaust trains arriving at the new railway approach ramp.

Wirth developed his method on the basis of experience he had gained in the fixed gas chambers of Aktion T4. Even though Zyklon B became broadly available later on, Wirth decided against it. Zyklon B was produced by a private firm for both Birkenau, and Majdanek nearby, but their infrastructure differed. Bełżec was an Operation Reinhard camp meant to circumvent the problems of supply, and instead, rely on a system of extermination based on ordinary and readily available killing agents. For economic and practical reasons, Wirth had almost the same carbon monoxide gas used in T-4, generated with the torque of a large engine. Although Holocaust witnesses&#x27; testimonies differ as to the type of fuel, Erich Fuchs&#x27; postwar affidavit indicates that most probably it was a petrol engine with a system of pipes delivering exhaust fumes into the gas chambers. For very small transports of Jews and Gypsies over a short distance, a minimised version of the gas van technology was also used in Bełżec. The T-4 participant and first operator of the gas chambers, SS-&quot;Hauptscharführer&quot; Lorenz Hackenholt, rebuilt an Opel Blitz post-office vehicle with the help of a local craftsman into a small gas van. The killing process, using the lethal carbon monoxide, often failed to be completed quickly, inflicting horrific suffering on the victims as they suffocated to death. The guards jokingly referred to the killing site as the Hackenholt Foundation.

===Concealment of camp&#x27;s purpose===
Bełżec &quot;processing&quot; zone consisted of two sections surrounded by a high barbed wire fence camouflaged with cut fir branches: Camp 1, which included the victims&#x27; unloading area with two undressing barracks further up; as well as Camp 2, which contained the gas chambers and the mass graves dug by the crawler excavator. The two zones were completely screened from each other and connected only by a narrow corridor called &quot;der Schlauch&quot;, or &quot;the Tube&quot;. All arriving Jews disembarked from the trains at a platform in the reception zone. They were met by &quot;SS-Scharführer&quot; Fritz Jirmann (Irmann) standing at the podium with a loudspeaker, and were told by the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; men that they had arrived at a transit camp. To ready themselves for the communal shower, women and children were separated from men. The disrobed new arrivals were forced to run along a fenced-off path to the gas chambers, leaving them no time to absorb where they were. The process was conducted as quickly as possible amid constant screaming by the Germans. At times, a handful of Jews were selected at the ramp to perform all the manual work involved with extermination.

The wooden gas chambers—which were built with double walls that were insulated by earth packed between them—were disguised as the shower barracks, so that the victims would not realise the true purpose of the facility. The gassing itself, which took about 30 minutes, was conducted by Hackenholt with the Ukrainian guards and a Jewish aide. Removing the bodies from the gas chambers, burying them, sorting and repairing the victims&#x27; clothing for shipping was performed by &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; work-details. The workshops for the Jewish prisoners and the barracks for the Ukrainian guards were separated from the &quot;processing&quot; zone behind an embankment of the old Otto Line with the barbed wire on top. Most Jews from the corpse-unit (the &quot;Totenjuden&quot;) were murdered periodically and replaced by new arrivals, so that they would neither organise a revolt nor survive to tell about the camp&#x27;s purpose. The German SS and the administration were housed in two cottages outside the camp.

==Camp operation==
The history of Bełżec can be divided into two (or three) periods of operation. The first phase, from 17 March to the end of June 1942, was marked by the existence of smaller gas chambers housed in barracks constructed of planks and insulated with sand and rubber. Bełżec was the first killing centre of Operation Reinhard. There were many technical difficulties with the early attempts at mass extermination. The gassing installation was imperfect and usually only one or two rooms were working, causing a backlog. In the first three months, 80,000 people were murdered and buried in pits covered with a shallow layer of earth. The victims were Jews deported from the Lublin Ghetto and its vicinity. The original three gas chambers were found insufficient for completing their purpose.

The second phase of extermination began in July 1942, when new gas chambers were built of brick and mortar on a lightweight foundation, thus enabling the facility to &quot;process&quot; Jews of the two largest agglomerations nearby including the Kraków and Lwów Ghettos. The wooden gas chambers were dismantled. The new building was 24 meters long and 10 meters wide and had six gas chambers, insulated with cement walls. It could handle over 1,000 victims at a time. The design was soon replicated by the other two Operation Reinhard extermination camps: Sobibor and Treblinka.

There was a hand-painted sign on the new building that read &quot;Stiftung Hackenholt&quot; or Hackenholt Foundation named after the SS man who designed it. Until December 1942, at least 350,000 to 400,000 Jews were murdered in the new gas chambers. One Wehrmacht sergeant at the train station in Rzeszów, Wilhelm Cornides, recorded in his diary a conversation with a German policeman on 30 August 1942. The &quot;Bahnschutzpolizei&quot; told him: &quot;trains filled with Jews pass almost daily through the railway yards and leave immediately on the way to the camp. They return swept clean most often the same evening.&quot; The last transport of Jews arrived at Bełżec on 11 December 1942. The buried remains often swelled in the heat as a result of putrefaction and the escape of gases. The surface layer of soil split. In October 1942, the exhumation and burning of all corpses was ordered to cover up the crime on direct orders from &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Odilo Globocnik, the deputy of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler in Berlin. The bodies were placed on pyres made from rail tracks, splashed with petrol and burned over wood. The bones were collected and crushed. The last period of camp&#x27;s operation continued until June 1943 when the area was ploughed over, and disguised as a farm.

==Command structure==
The camp&#x27;s first commandant, Christian Wirth, lived very close to the camp in a house which also served as a kitchen for the SS as well as an armoury. He later moved to the Lublin airfield camp, to oversee Operation Reinhard till the end. After the German takeover of Italy in 1943, he was transferred by Globocnik to serve along with him in his hometown of Trieste. They set up the San Sabba concentration and transit camp there, killing up to 5,000 prisoners and sending 69 Holocaust trains to Auschwitz. Wirth received the Iron Cross in April 1944. The following month he was killed by partisans whilst travelling in an open-top car in what is now western Slovenia. After the camp&#x27;s closure, his successor there &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Gottlieb Hering was transferred to Poniatowa concentration camp temporarily until the massacres of the &quot;Aktion Erntefest&quot;, and later followed Wirth and Globocnik to Trieste. After the war ended, Hering served for a short time as the chief of Criminal Police of Heilbronn in the American zone, and died in autumn 1945 in a hospital. Lorenz Hackenholt survived the defeat of Germany, but disappeared in 1945 without a trace.

Only seven former members of the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Bełżec&quot; were indicted 20 years later in Munich. Of these, just one, Josef Oberhauser (leader of the SS guard platoon), was brought to trial in 1964, and sentenced to four years and six months in prison, of which he served half before being released.

===Camp guards===
Belzec camp guards included German &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; and up to 120 former Soviet prisoners of war (mostly Ukrainians) organised into four platoons. Following Operation Barbarossa, all of them underwent special training at the Trawniki SS camp division before they were posted as &quot;Hiwis&quot; (German abbreviation for &quot;Hilfswilligen&quot;, lit. &quot;those willing to help&quot;) in the concentration camps as guards and gas chamber operators. They provided the bulk of &quot;Wachmänner&quot; collaborators in all major killing sites of the Final Solution.

==Gas chambers==

A detailed description of how the gas chambers at Belzec were managed came in 1945 from Kurt Gerstein, Head of the Technical Disinfection Services who used to deliver Zyklon B to Auschwitz from the company Degesch during the Holocaust. In his postwar report written at the Rottweil hotel while in the French custody, Gerstein described his visit to Belzec on 18 or 19 August 1942. He witnessed there the unloading of 45 cattle cars crowded with 6,700 Jews deported from the Lwów Ghetto less than a hundred kilometres away, of whom 1,450 were already dead on arrival from suffocation and thirst. The remaining new arrivals were marched naked in batches to the gas chambers; beaten with whips to squeeze tighter inside.

== Closure and dismantlement ==
In the last phase of the camp operations, all prior mass graves were unearthed by a mechanical digger. It was the result of direct orders from the Nazi leadership (possibly from Himmler), soon after the Soviet Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish soldiers was discovered in Russia. At Katyn, the German-led exhumations by the international Katyn Commission revealed details of the mass murder by examining preserved bodies. The Germans attempted to use the commission&#x27;s results to drive a wedge between the Allies. All corpses buried at Bełżec were secretly exhumed and then gradually cremated on long open-air pyres, part of the country-wide plan known as the &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot;. Bone fragments were pulverised and mixed with the ashes to hide the evidence of mass murder. The site was planted with small firs and wild lupines and all camp structures were dismantled.

The last train with 300 Jewish &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; prisoners who performed the clean-up operation departed to Sobibor extermination camp for gassing in late June 1943. They were told that they were being evacuated to Germany. Any equipment that could be reused was taken by the German and Ukrainian personnel to the concentration camp Majdanek. Wirth&#x27;s house and the neighbouring SS building, which had been the property of the Polish Railway before the war, were not demolished. After locals started digging for valuables in Bełżec, the Germans installed a permanent guard so that their mass murder would not come to light. SS personnel with work commandos turned the camp into a fake farm with one Ukrainian SS guard assigned to settle there permanently with his family. This model for guarding and disguising murder sites was also adopted at the Treblinka and Sobibor death camps.

==Victims==
The historian Eugeniusz Szrojt in his 1947 study published by the &quot;Bulletin of the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland&quot; (&quot;Biuletyn Głównej Komisji Badania Zbrodni Niemieckich w Polsce&quot;, 1947) following an investigation by GKBZNwP which began in 1945, estimated the number of people murdered in Bełżec at 600,000. This number became widely accepted in the literature. Raul Hilberg gave a figure of 550,000. Yitzhak Arad accepted 600,000 as minimum, and the sum in his table of Bełżec deportations by the city exceeded 500,000. Józef Marszałek calculated 500,000. British historian Robin O&#x27;Neil once gave an estimate of about 800,000 based on his investigations at the site. German historians Dieter Pohl and Peter Witte, gave an estimate of 480,000 to 540,000. Michael Tregenza stated that it would have been possible to have buried up to one million victims on the site although the true number of people murdered is probably around half that number.

The crucial piece of evidence came from the declassified Höfle Telegram sent to Berlin on 11 January 1943 by Operation Reinhard&#x27;s Chief of Staff Hermann Höfle. It was published in 2001 by Stephen Tyas and Peter Witte. The radio telegram indicated that 434,508 Jews were deported to Bełżec through 31 December 1942 based on numbers shared by the SS with the state-run Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG). The camp had ceased to operate for mass-murder by then. The clean-up commando of up to 500 prisoners remained in the camp, disinterring the bodies and burning them. The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; was transported to Sobibor extermination camp around August 1943 and murdered on arrival. &quot;In our view,&quot; wrote Pohl &amp; Witte in 2001, &quot;there is no evidence to justify a figure higher than that of 600,000 victims.&quot;

The Holocaust train records were notoriously incomplete as revealed by postwar analysis by the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes against the Polish Nation. The difference between the &quot;low-end&quot; figure and other estimates can be explained by the lack of exact and detailed sources on the deportations statistics. Thus, Y. Arad writes, that he had to rely, in part, on Yizkor books of Jewish ghettos, which were not guaranteed to give the exact estimates of the numbers of deportees. He also relied on partial German railway documentation, from which the number of trains could be gleaned. Some assumptions had to be made about the number of persons per each Holocaust train. The Deutsche Reichsbahn calculations were predetermined with the carrying capacity of each trainset set up at 50 boxcars, each loaded with 50 prisoners, which was routinely disregarded by the SS cramming trains up to 200% capacity for the same price.

The Höfle&#x27;s numbers were repeated in Korherr Report suggesting their common origin. Other sources, like Westermann&#x27;s report, contain the exact data about the number of deported persons, but only estimates of the numbers of those who died in transit.

==Post-war==

Grave robbing at the site resumed after the German guard fled for the approaching Red Army. In 1945, the Lublin District Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes conducted an investigation into the crimes in Bełżec. The mass graves at the site were dug up by graverobbers seeking gold and valuables. In 1945 provincial authorities and the Tomaszów Lubelski Jewish Committee discussed the continuing plunder of the site. In 1945 Szmul Pelc, the chair of the committee of the Jewish Committee, was murdered by local graverobbers. Investigations of grave digging continued through the late 1950s. While Lublin District Commission published the results of their investigation in 1947, the site itself continued to be neglected and memory of the site was suppressed as very few of the camp&#x27;s victims were Polish, and few of the camp&#x27;s primarily Jewish victims survived. Beginning in the second half of the 1950s the pursuit by Germany itself of the German perpetrators revived interest in the site. The Soviet trials of Russian camp personnel, held in Kiev and Krasnodar in the early 1960s soon followed.

In the 1960s, the grounds of the former Bełżec camp were fenced off. The first monuments were erected, although the area did not correspond to the actual size of the camp during its operation due to lack of proper evidence and modern forensic research. Some commercial development took place in areas formerly belonging to it. Also, its remote location on the Polish–Soviet border meant that few people visited the site before the revolutions of 1989 and the return of democracy. It was largely forgotten and poorly maintained.

Following the collapse of the Communist dictatorship in 1989, the situation began to change. As the number of visitors to Poland interested in Holocaust sites increased, more of them came to Bełżec. In the 1990s the camp appeared badly neglected, even though it was cleaned by students from Bełżec school. In the late 1990s extensive investigations were carried out on the camp grounds to determine precisely the camp&#x27;s extent and provide greater understanding of its operation. Buildings constructed after the war on the camp grounds were removed. In 2004, Bełżec became a new branch of the Majdanek State Museum. New official monuments commemorating the camp&#x27;s victims were unveiled.

One of the prime benefactors behind the new memorial at Bełżec was Miles Lerman, an American Holocaust survivor whose own parents were murdered in Bełżec, raising approximately 5 million dollars with the help of the Polish government and the American Jewish Committee. Another prominent Holocaust survivor with a connection to Bełżec is philanthropist Anita Ekstein, former national chair of March of the Living Canada. Anita Ekstein was born in the Lviv area and was hidden as a child by Righteous Poles during the Holocaust. Her mother, Ethel Helfgott, was among the victims in Bełżec. Anita Ekstein has led many groups of students on educational trips to Poland where she shares her Holocaust story. She first visited Bełżec in 2005, a year after the new memorial opened, and discovered her mother&#x27;s name inscribed on the memorial wall on Mother&#x27;s Day.

==Archeological studies==
From late 1997 until early 1998, a thorough archaeological survey of the site was conducted by a team led by two Polish scientists including Andrzej Kola, director of the Underwater Archaeological Department at the University of Toruń, and Mieczysław Góra, senior curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography in Łódź (pl). The team identified the railway sidings and remains of a number of buildings. They also found 33 mass graves, the largest of which had an area of and was deep. The total volume of these mass graves was estimated at . Air photo analysis suggests that these 33 mass graves were not the only graves at Bełżec extermination camp.

All graves discovered by archaeologists contained large amounts of human cremation remains, and 10 graves also contained unburned human remains, which Prof. Kola described as follows: &quot;Deposition of corpses in the water-bearing layers or in very damp structure of the ground just above that layer, with the difficulty of air penetration, because of the depth, caused the changes of the deposited bodies into adipocere. In some graves the layer of corpses reached the thickness of ca 2,00m.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bay/kola&quot;&gt; Also in: Archeologists reveal new secrets of Holocaust, Reuters News, 21 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survivors==
It is believed that some 50 Jews might have escaped from Bełżec and only seven were still alive at the war&#x27;s end. An unknown number of prisoners jumped out from the moving Holocaust trains on the way to the camp, at their own peril. The railway embankments used to be lined with bodies.

There were only two Jewish escapees from the camp who shared their testimony with the Polish Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi German Crimes. They were Rudolf Reder and Chaim Hirszman. While Reder submitted a deposition in January 1946 in Kraków, Hirszman was assassinated in March 1946 at his home, by so-called &quot;cursed soldiers&quot;, from the anti-communist resistance organisation TOW. Following the war&#x27;s end, Hirszman had joined MBP, a secret police organisation created by the new Stalinist regime in Poland, to crush the anti-communist underground. His murder was before he was able to give a full account of his experiences at the camp.

Rudolf Reder summarised his account of the Bełżec camp imprisonment in the book &quot;Bełżec&quot;, published in 1946 by the Jewish Historical Committee in Kraków with Preface by Nella Rost, his editor and literary helper. The book was illustrated with a map by Józef Bau, a Holocaust survivor who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. It was reprinted in 1999 by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum with translation by Margaret M. Rubel. In 1960, Reder&#x27;s testimony became part of the German preparations for the Bełżec trial in Munich against eight former SS members of the extermination camp personnel. The accused were set free except for Oberhauser, who was sentenced to 4½ years of imprisonment, and released after serving half of his sentence.

<doc id="140612" wikidata="Q2090236" url="?curid=140612" title="Mudbrick">
<text>Mudbrick or mud-brick, also known as unfired brick, is an air-dried brick, made of a mixture of mud (containing loam, clay, sand and water) mixed with a binding material such as rice husks or straw. Mudbricks are known from 9000 BCE.

From around 5000–4000 BCE, mudbricks evolved into fired bricks to increase strength and durability. Nevertheless, in some warm regions with very little timber available to fuel a kiln, mudbricks continued to be in use. Even today, mudbricks are the standard of vernacular architecture in some warmer regions- mainly in parts of Africa and western Asia. In the 20th century, the compressed earth block was developed using high pressure as a cheap and eco-friendly alternative to obtain non-fired bricks with more strength than the simpler air-dried mudbricks.

==Ancient world==
The history of mudbrick production and construction in the southern Levant may be dated as far back to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (e.g., PPNA Jericho). These sun dried mudbricks, also known as adobe or just mudbrick, were made from a mixture of sand, clay, water and frequently tempered (e.g. chopped straw and chaff branches), and were the most common method/material for constructing earthen buildings throughout the ancient Near East for millennia. Unfired mud-brick is still made throughout the world today, using both modern and traditional methods.

The 9000 BCE dwellings of Jericho were constructed from mudbricks, affixed with mud, as were those at numerous sites across the Levant over the following millennia. Well-preserved mudbricks from a site at Tel Tsaf, in the Jordan Valley, have been dated to 5200 BCE, though there is no evidence that either site was the first to use the technology. Evidence suggests that the mudbrick composition at Tel Tsaf was stable for at least 500 years, throughout the middle Chalcolithic period.

The South Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh constructed and lived in mud-brick houses between 7000–3300 BCE. Mud bricks were used at more than 15 reported sites attributed to the 3rd millennium BCE in the ancient Indus Valley civilization. In the Mature Harappan phase fired bricks were used.

The Mesopotamians used sun-dried bricks in their city construction; typically these bricks were flat on the bottom and curved on the top, called plano-convex mud bricks. Some were formed in a square mould and rounded so that the middle was thicker than the ends. Some walls had a few courses of fired bricks from their bases up to the splash line to extend the life of the building.

In Minoan Crete, at the Knossos site, there is archaeological evidence that sun-dried bricks were used in the Neolithic period (prior to 3400 BCE).

Sun dried mudbrick was the most common construction material employed in ancient Egypt during pharaonic times and were made in pretty much the same way for millennia. Mud from some locations required sand, chopped straw or other binders such as animal dung to be mixed in with the mud to increase durability and plasticity. Workers gathered mud from the Nile river and poured it into a pit. Workers then tramped on the mud while straw was added to solidify the mold. The mudbricks were chemically suitable as fertilizer, leading to the destruction of many ancient Egyptian ruins, such as at Edfu. A well-preserved site is Amarna. Mudbrick use increased at the time of Roman influence.

In the Ancient Greek world, mudbrick was commonly used for the building of walls, fortifications and citadels, such as the walls of the Citadel of Troy (Troy II). These mudbricks were often made with straw or dried vegetable matter.

==Adobe==

In areas of Spanish influence, mud-brick construction is called adobe, and developed over time into a complete system of wall protection, flat roofing and finishes which in modern English usage is often referred to as &quot;adobe style&quot;, regardless of the construction method.

==Banco==
The Great Mosque of Djenné, in central Mali, is the world&#x27;s largest mudbrick structure. It, like much of Sahelian architecture, is built with a mudbrick called Banco, a recipe of mud and grain husks, fermented, and either formed into bricks or applied on surfaces as a plaster like paste in broad strokes. This plaster must be reapplied annually.

==Durability==
In some cases, brickmakers extended the life of mud bricks by putting fired bricks on top or covering them with stucco.

<text>Postman Pat is a British stop motion animated children&#x27;s television series first produced by Woodland Animations. The series follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a postman who works for the Royal Mail postal service in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of Longsleddale near Kendal).

&quot;Postman Pat&quot; first 13-episode series was screened on BBC One in 1981. John Cunliffe wrote the original treatment and scripts for the series, which was directed by animator Ivor Wood, who also worked on &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;, &quot;The Wombles&quot;, &quot;Paddington&quot;, and &quot;The Herbs&quot;. Following the success of the first series, four TV specials and a second series of thirteen episodes were produced during the 1990s. In this series, Pat had a family shown on screen for the first time (though his wife had been mentioned in a number of episodes).

A new version of the series was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films from 2004 to 2008 and expanded on many aspects of the original series.

The show ended on 29 March 2017, after eight series, twelve specials and five runs. The Special Delivery Service spin-off is still being rerun on CBeebies on weekends, and the previous Cosgrove Hall series from the 2000s was being rerun on ITVBe&#x27;s children&#x27;s block littleBe from September 2023 to May 2024. The original two Ivor Wood series are available to watch on BritBox, Prime Video and on DVD.

==Plot==
Each episode follows the adventures of Patrick Clifton, a friendly country postman, and his black and white cat Jess, as he delivers the post through the valley of Greendale. Although he initially concentrates on delivering his letters, he nearly always becomes distracted by a concern of one of the villagers and is always keen to help resolve their problems. Notable villagers include the postmistress, Mrs. Goggins; farmer couple Alf and Dorothy Thompson; the Reverend Timms; PC Selby, the police constable; Jeff Pringle, the school teacher; Peter Fogg, a farm hand; George Lancaster, a chicken farmer; Sam Waldron, a grocer with a mobile shop; Miss Hubbard, an upper-class woman; Julia Pottage, who runs Greendale Farm, and Ted Glen, the local handyman and inventor.

==Setting==
&quot;Postman Pat&quot; is set in the fictional village of Greendale and the nearby town of Pencaster, on the border between Cumbria and North Yorkshire.

Greendale has a different character in the various &quot;Postman Pat&quot; series. In the original series (1 and 2), it was a small village with narrow, winding roads. The gentle pace of life allowed Pat plenty of time to enjoy the countryside as he passed through, or even stop on quiet days to have a picnic.

In the more recent series from 2003 onwards, Greendale became a big, busy village situated in the heart of the Cumbrian countryside. Running through the centre of the village is the High Street, home to Mrs Goggins&#x27;s Post Office and shop, an unofficial meeting place for residents. Located on the edge of the village is the railway station, home to the Greendale Rocket. Nisha Bains runs a popular café there with Sara while her husband Ajay runs a regular schedule on the Greendale Rocket to the nearby town of Pencaster.

In the second series of the show, which aired in 1996, the village at the centre of the series was briefly referred to as Garner Bridge, while Greendale was the name of the valley in which Garner Bridge was situated. In the episode &quot;Postman Pat and the Suit of Armour&quot;, Greendale Post Office is referred to as &quot;Garner Bridge Post Office&quot;.

Pencaster is a large, bustling, modern town located within easy commuting distance for the villagers of Greendale. Situated on the waterfront, Pencaster is a hive of activity, boasting a market square in the centre surrounded by shops, houses, a large railway station, state-of-the-art buildings, and a boat jetty. It bears some resemblance to Lancaster, the county town of Lancashire, which likewise is a short commute from Longsleddale, the area used as the inspiration for Greendale.

Ingledale is another large, busy town situated in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside, only seen once in a special in 1991.

==Inspiration==
Cunliffe, interviewed about the series, has said that he chose the character of a postman since he needed a character who could visit the countryside and interact with many different people.

The inspiration for the post office itself comes from one located on the street in Kendal where Cunliffe lived when he was writing the original treatment. The post office, at 10 Greenside, closed in 2003.

Cunliffe did not retain rights to the character and was critical of some of the tie-in media later released. He wrote the stories to the series &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;, which he also presented, as a show which he could have more creative control over.

While Cunliffe visited post offices for inspiration, he has said that the character and village was not based on any one place or person. He commented in 2015 that &quot;I got maybe half a dozen people last year saying they were the inspiration.&quot;

==Cast and characters==

In Series 1, Ken Barrie voiced all the characters and narrated the series. In Series 2, Carole Boyd joined to voice all the female characters and child characters except Granny Dryden, who was still voiced by Barrie. In Series 3, Kulvinder Ghir, Janet James, and Archie Panjabi joined to voice the new characters and the child characters, while Boyd continued to voice the adult females, Charlie and Sarah, Melissa Sinden and Jimmy Hibbert also joined to perform the animal characters&#x27; vocal effects and Angela Griffin joined in Series 5 to voice a new character (Amy Wrigglsworth). In Series 6, Lewis MacLeod replaced Barrie as Pat. In Series 7, Barrie left the series completely, and MacLeod, Bradley Clarkson, and Dan Milne took over the rest of Barrie&#x27;s characters. Joe Trill joined in Series 8 to voice a new character.

==&quot;Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service&quot;==
In the spin-off series, &quot;Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service&quot;, Postman Pat has been promoted to Head of the SDS and is now called upon to deliver anything. Each episode follows Postman Pat on a Special Delivery mission, from rescuing a runaway cow to delivering a giant ice cube. In his new role, Postman Pat commutes to the nearby town of Pencaster where he collects his special deliveries from the Pencaster Mail Centre. Postman Pat now has a newer fleet of vehicles, including a bigger van, gyrocopter, 4x4 Jeep and motorbike, complete with sidecar for Jess. He has a new boss, Ben, who tends to give him instructions (whereas he was his own master before the &quot;promotion&quot;). Pat also seems to make more mistakes in his work since moving to SDS, largely because the new format is always based on one delivery, which has to go wrong somehow (thus often because of Pat&#x27;s errors).

The series features an expanded and diverse cast, a fleet of new vehicles, a world full of gadgets and the new town of Pencaster. &quot;Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service&quot; first screened on BBC Two on 29 September 2008. The new series was commissioned by the BBC and produced by Entertainment Rights and Cosgrove Hall Films.

A new series aired in 2016.

==Episodes==

==Outside the main broadcast series==

===Film===

&quot;Postman Pat: The Movie&quot;, a British-American direct-to-video computer-animated comedy children&#x27;s feature film version of the British stop-motion animated children&#x27;s television show, was theatrically released on 23 May 2014 in the United Kingdom. The film was distributed and produced by Lionsgate and Icon Productions and animated by Rubicon Group Holding. The story revolves around Pat entering a talent show audition which leads to robots taking over his postal service whilst he is away. The film stars Stephen Mangan as the voice of Pat and also features Jim Broadbent, Rupert Grint, David Tennant, Ronan Keating (as Pat&#x27;s singing voice), Susan Duerden, Sandra Teles, TJ Ramini and Peter Woodward.

===Spin-off===

A CGI spin-off to the series was made called &quot;Guess with Jess&quot; which follows Pat&#x27;s cat Jess, now with the ability to talk, and his adventures with the farm animals. The series debuted on 9 November 2009 and ended in 2013.

===Music===
Music for the original 1981 series was by Bryan Daly, who wrote a number of songs including the well-known theme tune. For the 2003 series, pop writer Simon Woodgate scored the show and wrote new songs, including a new closing theme &quot;Postman Pat (Can You Guess What&#x27;s In His Bag?)&quot;. The theme tune &quot;Postman Pat &amp; His Black and White Cat&quot; was sung by Ken Barrie for the original series in the 1980s and 1990s. An extended version of the tune was released as a single in the UK where it reached number 44 in the charts in July 1982. An album, titled &quot;Postman Pat: Songs and Music From the TV Series&quot;, was released by Post Music in 1982.

The theme tune and songs for &quot;Postman Pat Special Delivery Service&quot; (including &quot;Special Delivery Service, What&#x27;s It Going to Be Today?&quot;), was recorded by Simon Woodgate at Echobass Studios.

In 2013, DreamWorks Classics released &quot;Postman Pat SDS&quot; series 2. The new 26-episode series retained Bryan Daly&#x27;s original theme tune and Simon Woodgate&#x27;s closing song, however new character themes and incidental music was composed by Sandy Nuttgens.

The theme song has undergone several adaptations; from 1994 to 2006, the theme tune had additional instruments such as synthesised strings and a tambourine. A similar edit had already been made to the 1993 album version, which was an edit of the original 1982 album version.

===Books===
As of 2009, over twelve million books, including storybooks, integrated learning books, colouring books, and multi-character magazines, have been sold worldwide.

===Other===

Longleat Safari Park had an outdoor reproduction of Greendale village, including the Post Office, the Cliftons&#x27; house and the Greendale station. It also had a miniature model of Greendale. It was installed during the 1990s, was relocated during 2008 in preparation for a new animal area and was revamped a third time for 2013. The attraction was closed at the end of 2015 and was permanently removed in 2016.

===DVD and VHS releases===
====United Kingdom====
VHS and Betamax releases of Series 1 were originally released by Longman Video in the early-1980s, before BBC Worldwide secured them, and later released the four TV specials and Series 2 on VHS. For Series 1, the original opening titles which featured Pat driving in the original version of his van with a generic crown logo (which was used until Pat&#x27;s Thirsty Day) was replaced with an edited version of the shot for shot remake of the original intro (which had Pat driving the Royal Mail Van) as used when the show aired in countries like France and Australia. The edits made to the intro on the DVD involved some shots being replaced by scenes from &quot;Pat&#x27;s Difficult Day&quot;, &quot;Pat Takes A Message&quot;, and &quot;Pat&#x27;s Foggy Day&quot;. This edited intro was also used when CBeebies and BritBox reran the show.

After the sale of Woodland Animations to Entertainment Rights, the company began releasing VHS and DVDs of the revival series through their video label Entertainment Rights and distributor Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Right released only one classic series volume on VHS and DVD - &quot;Postman Pat in a Muddle&quot; in April 2004, which contained three Series 2 episodes.

While no further classic series releases were seen in the UK until 2011, Universal and Classic Media issued all four specials from 1991 to 1994 on the DVD &quot;Happy Birthday Postman Pat&quot;. On 3 February 2014, the first and second series were made available in their entirety for the first time in the UK, However, the titles are both season 2 with the season 3 theme which came under scrutiny from classic fans and also credits Carole Boyd as doing voices in series 1, despite it being only Ken Barrie at the time.

DVD releases of classic Postman Pat were limited in availability in various regions, although the revival series is more common.

In 2004, the entire original series was released on DVD in Spain, featuring both English and Spanish audio options.

===Other versions===
In Scotland, the series was shown not only in English but also sometimes broadcast as &quot;Pàdraig Post&quot;, in Scottish Gaelic, on BBC Alba.

==Research study==
&quot;Slower-paced&quot; and &quot;faster-paced&quot; episodes of Postman Pat were used in a 2021 research study on the effects of fast-paced television on children&#x27;s cognitive and problem-solving abilities. The results of the study suggested that faster-paced television did not negatively impact children&#x27;s attention spans, problem-solving, or comprehension.

==Award nominations==
In 2006, Postman Pat was nominated for &quot;Best Pre-school Animation&quot; at the BAFTA Children&#x27;s Awards.

==Parodies==
*&quot;Harry Enfield &amp; Chums&quot; featured a parody entitled &quot;Il Postino Pat&quot; (the show&#x27;s Italian title), with an operatic reworking of the theme tune and the characters speaking in Italian, referencing the film &quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot;. At the end, Pat instigates a communist revolution in Greendale before being shot and killed by fascist soldiers.
* &quot;Harry &amp; Paul&quot; parodied Postman Pat in series 3 and 4 with &quot;Parking Pataweyo&quot;, an African immigrant working as a stereotypically uncompromising traffic warden, played by Daniel Kaluuya, whose name and theme tune are based on Pat&#x27;s.
*In 1987, &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, the topical satirical puppet series, featured &quot;Temporary Postman Pratt&quot; in a send-up of Royal Mail&#x27;s employment of temporary postal workers during busy times. In the opening titles, Pratt can be seen driving a familiar (though yellow in colour) van along country roads before running over a black and white cat. Pratt likes to clear his workload as quickly as he can by dumping the post rather than delivering it. He is portrayed as a student who is lazy and rude. The segment was animated by Aardman Animations.
* In 1986, an episode of &quot;Bobby Davro on the Box&quot; featured &quot;Postman Pete&quot;, alongside other characters with spoofed names, such as &quot;Granny Wisden&quot; and &quot;Fred Ben&quot;. The segment was narrated and the theme tune was sung by the original series narrator, Ken Barrie.
* In 1997, an episode of &quot;The Treacle People&quot; briefly featured a section of the &quot;Postman Pat&quot; theme song, as a postcard was delivered by a walking postbox accompanied by a pink cat.
*In the round &quot;Scenes We&#x27;d Like to See&quot; on &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, series 15 episode 3, entitled &quot;Things you Wouldn&#x27;t Hear on a Kids&#x27; TV Show&quot;, Miles Jupp recorded the following parodied lines: &quot;Yodel delivery driver Pat, Yodel delivery driver Pat / He&#x27;s thrown your parcel in a hedge&quot;.
*In 2009, &quot;Casseta &amp; Planeta Urgente&quot; parodied select episodes of series 6 under the title &quot;Carteiro Pot, o Serviço de Entregas Opcionais&quot;: in this parody, the characters spoke in Portuguese and the theme tune had a synthesized instrumental and was performed by Fiuk and Marcelo Madureira with new lyrics by Casseta &amp; Planeta.

<doc id="140615" wikidata="Q186433" url="?curid=140615" title="Tropopause">
<text>The tropopause is the atmospheric boundary that demarcates the troposphere from the stratosphere, which are the lowest two of the five layers of the atmosphere of Earth. The tropopause is a thermodynamic gradient-stratification layer that marks the end of the troposphere, and is approximately above the equatorial regions, and approximately above the polar regions.

==Definition==

Rising from the planetary surface of the Earth, the tropopause is the atmospheric level where the air ceases to become cool with increased altitude and becomes dry, devoid of water vapor. The tropopause is the boundary that demarcates the troposphere below from the stratosphere above, and is part of the atmosphere where there occurs an abrupt change in the environmental lapse rate (ELR) of temperature, from a positive rate (of decrease) in the troposphere to a negative rate in the stratosphere. The tropopause is defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2°C/km or less, provided that the average lapse-rate, between that level and all other higher levels within 2.0 km does not exceed 2°C/km. The tropopause is a first-order discontinuity surface, in which temperature as a function of height varies continuously through the atmosphere, while the temperature gradient has a discontinuity.

==Location==

The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; it starts at the planetary boundary layer, and is the layer in which most weather phenomena occur. The troposphere contains the boundary layer, and ranges in height from an average of at the poles, to at the Equator. In the absence of inversions and not considering moisture, the temperature lapse rate for this layer is 6.5 °C per kilometer, on average, according to the &quot;U.S. Standard Atmosphere&quot;. A measurement of the tropospheric and the stratospheric lapse rates helps identify the location of the tropopause, since temperature increases with height in the stratosphere, and hence the lapse rate becomes negative. The tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate is less than a prescribed threshold.

Since the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it, it is at its maximum levels over the Equator, and reaches minimum heights over the poles. On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17 km over the equator. Due to the variation in starting height, the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopause.

Given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies, there exists an alternative definition named &quot;dynamic tropopause&quot;. It is formed with the aid of potential vorticity, which is defined as the product of the isentropic density, i.e. the density that is measurable by using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate, and the absolute vorticity, given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere. Instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable, the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in &quot;potential vorticity units&quot; (PVU, 1 PVU = 10 K m kg s). Given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere, the threshold value should be considered as positive north of the Equator and negative south of it. Theoretically, to define a global tropopause in this way, the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface. Nevertheless, the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical. For the extratropical tropopause in the Northern Hemisphere the WMO established a value of 1.6 PVU, but greater values ranging between 2 and 3.5 PVU have been traditionally used.

It is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition. For example, the lower stratosphere has much higher ozone concentrations than the upper troposphere, but much lower water vapor concentrations, so an appropriate boundary can be defined.

==Tropical Tropopause Layer Cold Trap==
In 1949 Alan West Brewer proposed that tropospheric air passes through the tropopause into the stratosphere near the equator, then travels through the stratosphere to temperate and polar regions, where it sinks into the troposphere.

This is now known as Brewer-Dobson circulation.
Because gases primarily enter the stratosphere by passing through the tropopause in the tropics where the tropopause is coldest, water vapor is condensed out of the air that is entering the stratosphere. This ″tropical tropopause layer cold trap″ theory has become widely accepted.

This cold trap limits stratospheric water vapor to 3 to 4 parts per million.

Researchers at Harvard have suggested that the effects of Global Warming on air circulation patterns will weaken the tropical tropopause layer cold trap.
Water vapor that is able to make it through the cold trap eventually rises to the top of the stratosphere, where it undergoes photodissociation into oxygen and hydrogen or hydroxide ions and hydrogen.

This hydrogen is then able to escape the atmosphere.
Thus, in some sense, the tropical tropopause layer cold trap is what prevents Earth from losing its water to space.
James Kasting has predicted that in 1 to 2 billion years, as the Sun increases in luminosity, the temperature of the Earth will rise enough that the cold trap will no longer be effective, and so the Earth will dry out.

==Phenomena==
The tropopause is not a fixed boundary. Vigorous thunderstorms, for example, particularly those of tropical origin, will overshoot into the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief (hour-order or less) low-frequency vertical oscillation. Such oscillation results in a low-frequency atmospheric gravity wave capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region.

Most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere, just above the tropopause, during the cruise phase of their flights; in this region, the clouds and significant weather perturbations characteristic of the troposphere are usually absent.

From 1948 until its cancellation in 1971, the show ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8–9 p.m. Eastern Time, and it is one of the few entertainment shows to have run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades (during its first season, it ran from 9 to 10 p.m. ET). Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; classical musicians, opera singers, popular recording artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville and, although vaudeville had undergone a slow demise for a generation, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.

Originally co-created and produced by Marlo Lewis, the show was first titled Toast of the Town, but was widely referred to as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; for years before September 25, 1955, when that became its official name. In the show&#x27;s June 20, 1948, debut, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed along with singer Monica Lewis and Broadway composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II previewing the score to their then-new show &quot;South Pacific&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1949.

From 1948 through 1962, the program&#x27;s primary sponsor was the Lincoln-Mercury Division of the Ford Motor Company; Sullivan read many commercials for Mercury vehicles live on the air during this period.

&quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was originally broadcast via live television from CBS-TV Studio 51, the Maxine Elliott Theatre, at Broadway and 39th Street, before moving to its permanent home at CBS-TV Studio 50 in New York City (1697 Broadway, at 53rd Street), which was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater on the occasion of the program&#x27;s 20th anniversary in June 1968. The last original Sullivan show telecast (#1068) was on March 28, 1971, with guests Melanie, Joanna Simon, Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass and Sandler and Young. It was one of many older shows with followings in undesirable key demographics that were purged from the network lineups that summer. The purge led into the Prime Time Access Rule taking effect that fall. Repeats were scheduled through June 6, 1971.

==Background==
Along with the new talent Sullivan booked each week, he also had recurring characters appear many times a season, such as his &quot;Little Italian Mouse&quot; puppet sidekick Topo Gigio, who debuted December 9, 1962, and ventriloquist Señor Wences debuted December 31, 1950. While most of the episodes aired live from New York City, the show also aired live on occasion from other nations, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. For many years, &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; was a national event each Sunday evening and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public.
On the occasion of the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA):
The show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As it had occurred with the annual telecasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in the 1960s and the 1970s, the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost a U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as a kingmaker, and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom, although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show&#x27;s status at the turn of the decade is illustrated by its use as the backdrop of the 1960 musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. The musical&#x27;s plot revolves around an ordinary teen girl&#x27;s chance to kiss a rock star live on the Sullivan show, and in the song &quot;Hymn for a Sunday Evening,&quot; her family expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones. Sullivan appeared as himself in the musical&#x27;s 1963 film adaptation.

In September 1965, CBS started televising the program in compatible color, as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system, developed by Peter Goldmark, and resisted using RCA&#x27;s compatible process until 1954. At that time, it built its first New York City color TV studio, Studio 72, in a former RKO movie theater at 2248 Broadway (81st Street). One &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was broadcast on August 22, 1954, from the new studio, but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s March 31, 1957 &quot;Cinderella&quot;. (The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and became the first studio where the PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was produced.) CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally modernized for color broadcasts in 1965. The 1965–66 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12, which was the last episode to air in black and white. This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles&#x27; convenience on August 14, the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and a two-week tour of North America, slightly before the program was ready for color transmission.

In the late 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers, the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. Younger viewers were growing to actively dislike the program; in 1970, Sullivan&#x27;s compilation special &quot;Ed Sullivan&#x27;s Swinging Sixties&quot; drew widely negative reviews. These factors were the reason the show was cancelled by CBS on March 16, 1971, as part of a mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming. While Sullivan&#x27;s landmark program ended without a proper finale, Sullivan produced one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974, including an &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; 25th anniversary special in 1973.

In 1990, television documentary producer Andrew Solt formed SOFA Entertainment, Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; from Ed Sullivan&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht. The collection consists of 1,087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971.
Since acquiring the rights to &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows. Starting in 1991, SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to the American public by producing numerous network specials, syndicating a half-hour series (that also aired on TV Land, PBS, VH1 and Decades) and home video compilations. Some of these compilations include &quot;The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles&quot;, &quot;All 6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones&quot;, &quot;Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows&quot;, &quot;Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Ed Sullivan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n Roll Classics&quot;, and 115 half-hour &quot;The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; specials, among others. Performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and as an app on iTunes.&quot; In 2021, MeTV began airing on Sunday nights half hour packages of performances from the show.

=== The Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra ===
In the early years of television, both CBS and NBC networks had their own symphony orchestras. NBC&#x27;s was conducted by Arturo Toscanini and CBS&#x27;s by Alfredo Antonini. &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (originally presented as: &quot;The Toast Of The Town&quot;) was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as Eileen Farrell, Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for Ella Fitzgerald, Diahann Carroll or Sammy Davis Jr.. and then onto The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder or Tom Jones or Itzhak Perlman. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from Gregory Hines, Juliet Prowse, Maria Tallchief or Margo Fonteyn to the Peter Gennaro dancers.
In the process, the musicians collaborated with several internationally recognized ballet troupes including: Ruth Page&#x27;s Chicago Opera Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, Roland Petit&#x27;s Ballets de Paris and Russia&#x27;s Igor Moiseyev Ballet. Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.

The lead trumpet player is the &quot;concert master&quot; of a studio orchestra. Chris Griffin (formerly with the trumpet section of Harry James, Ziggy Elman and the Benny Goodman Band) was Ray Bloch&#x27;s lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted, including the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Chris remained the lead trumpet player with &quot;The Ed Sullivan show&quot; from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971.

==== Band configuration ====
Trumpets: Chris Griffin, Bernie Privin, Jimmy Nottingham, and Thad Jones; Chris&#x27;s son Paul Griffin was a regular substitute trumpeter

Trombones: Roland Dupont, Morton Bullman, Frank Rehak, and Cliff Heather

Saxophones: Toots Mondello, Bernie Kaufman, Artie Drellinger, Hymie Schertzer, Ed Zuhlke, et al.

Piano: Hank Jones

Drums: Specs Powell/Howard Smith

Percussion: Milton Schlesinger, who similarly played from the first to last show. John Serry Sr often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in Skitch Henderson&#x27;s or Doc Severinsen&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show Band&quot;, the CBS producers of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured jazz pianist Bill Evans, who had recently composed an elegy to his father.

==Notable performances and guests==

&quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; is especially known to the World War II and baby boomer generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Supremes, the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Dusty Springfield, the Beach Boys, the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Buddy Holly, Janis Joplin, the Rolling Stones, the Mamas and the Papas, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Doors, Dionne Warwick, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark, Vanilla Fudge, and the Band and the famous Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps

The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster appeared on the program 67 times, a record for any performer. Bill Haley &amp; His Comets performed their hit &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in early August 1955, later recognized as the first rock and roll song broadcast on a national television program.

===Itzhak Perlman===
The American public&#x27;s first exposure to Itzhak Perlman was on the show in 1958, when he was 13. This performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music, but also for Perlman, who rode the waves of admiration to new heights of fame lasting a generation.

===Elvis Presley===

====Initial appearance====
On September 9, 1956, Presley made his first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen), even though Sullivan had vowed never to allow Presley on the show. According to Sullivan biographer Michael David Harris, &quot;Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, [Sullivan] said that he wouldn&#x27;t consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract.&quot;

At the time, Presley was filming &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, so Sullivan&#x27;s producer, Marlo Lewis, flew to Los Angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from CBS Television City in Hollywood. Sullivan, however, was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident. Charles Laughton guest-hosted in Sullivan&#x27;s place, and opened the show. Music journalist Greil Marcus wrote that Sullivan&#x27;s choice to have Elvis appear after Laughton&#x27;s introduction was an attempt to make Elvis less prominent in the show.

For his first set, Elvis played &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. According to writer Elaine Dundy, Presley sang &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; &quot;straight, subdued and tender ... a very different Elvis from the one on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; three months before&quot;. Elvis&#x27;s second set consisted of &quot;Ready Teddy&quot; and a shortened version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Popular mythology states that Sullivan censored Presley by shooting him only from the waist up, but in fact, Presley&#x27;s whole body was shown in the first and second shows.

Although Laughton was the main star and there were seven other acts on the show, Elvis was on camera for more than a quarter of the time allotted to all acts. The show had a 43.7 rating, and was viewed by a record 60,710,000 people which at the time represented an 82.6% share of the television audience, and the largest single audience in television history. The latter percentage share, remains, to this date, the largest in the history of US television.

====Second and third appearances====

Sullivan hosted a second appearance by Presley on October 28, 1956. For his first segment, Elvis performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, then &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. For the second segment, Elvis sang &quot;Love Me&quot;, and for his third, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;.

For the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, followed by a full version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. For a second set later in the show he sang &quot;Too Much&quot; and &quot;When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again&quot;. For his last set he sang &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;. For this third appearance, it was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, all of the songs on this show were ballads.

Although Sullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show, Elvis claimed in a 1969 interview that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion backstage: &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s standing over there saying, &#x27;Sumbitch. The second and third appearances drew 57 and 54.6 million viewers, respectively. Years later, Sullivan tried to book Presley again, but declined after Presley&#x27;s representatives presented a demanding rider.

===The Beatles===
In late 1963, Sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through Heathrow and witnessed how the Beatles&#x27; fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm, where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars and Lill Babs. Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager Brian Epstein top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better ideahe wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, for only a minimal fee, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.

The Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 is considered a milestone in American pop culture, and furthermore the beginning of the British Invasion in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, a record for US television at the time (broken three years later by the series finale of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;). The Beatles followed Ed&#x27;s show opening intro, performing &quot;All My Loving&quot;; &quot;Till There Was You&quot;, which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous &quot;SORRY GIRLS, HE&#x27;S MARRIED&quot; caption on John Lennon; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;. The act that followed the Beatles in the broadcast, magician Fred Kaps, was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change. The group returned later in the program to perform &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;.

The following week&#x27;s show was broadcast from Miami Beach where Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali) was in training for his first title bout with Sonny Liston. The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show (February 16) a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. A wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing &quot;She Loves You&quot; only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with &quot;This Boy&quot; and &quot;All My Loving&quot;, then returned later to close the show with &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;From Me to You&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;.

They were shown on tape February 23 (this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February 9 before their first live appearance). They followed Ed&#x27;s intro with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and closed the show once again with &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;.

The Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14, 1965. The show was broadcast September 12, 1965, and earned Sullivan a 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for one of the appearances. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;, and &quot;Act Naturally&quot; and then closed the show with &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;Help!&quot; Although this was their final live appearance on the show, the group provided filmed promotional clips of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan&#x27;s program over the next few years, including videos of both &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; from 1966 and three clips from 1967, including &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, and &quot;Hello, Goodbye.&quot; In late 1967, the group also sent a telegram to Sullivan in addition to their promotional clips, a note which the host read live on air. The group&#x27;s last appearance on Sullivan&#x27;s program was via prerecorded promotional clips of their songs &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;, broadcast on the show on the first day of March in 1970. Although both videos were recorded in late January 1969, the delay was due to the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the tedious &quot;Let It Be&quot; album sessions and the group&#x27;s impending break-up. In all probability, the scheduling of the March 1970 broadcast was to promote the release of the band&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Let It Be&quot; in May of that year.

===Black artists===

====The Supremes====

The Supremes were a special act for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In addition to 14 appearances, they were a personal favorite of Sullivan, whom he affectionately called &quot;The Girls&quot;. Over the five years they performed on the program, the Supremes performed 15 of their hit singles, and numerous Broadway showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard appeared 7 times from December 1964 through May 1967.

The group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;, with Ballard replacement Cindy Birdsong and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes&#x27; final appearance on the show, shortly before it ended, served as the platform to introduce America to Ross&#x27;s replacement, Jean Terrell, in March 1970.

====Opportunity====
In an era when few opportunities existed for black performers on national television, Sullivan was a champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an NEA interview, Sullivan commented:

The show included entertainers such as Frankie Lymon, The Supremes, Marian Anderson, Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey, LaVern Baker, Harry Belafonte, Brook Benton, James Brown (and the Famous Flames), Cab Calloway, Godfrey Cambridge, Diahann Carroll, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Bill Cosby, Count Basie, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis Jr., Bo Diddley, Duke Ellington, Lola Falana, the 5th Dimension, Ella Fitzgerald, the Four Tops, Dick Gregory, W. C. Handy, Lena Horne, the Jackson 5, Mahalia Jackson, Louis Jordan, Bill Kenny, B. B. King, George Kirby, Eartha Kitt, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Moms Mabley, Johnny Mathis, the Miracles, Melba Moore, the Platters, Leontyne Price, Richard Pryor, Lou Rawls, Della Reese, Nipsey Russell, Nina Simone, Sly and the Family Stone, The Talbot Brothers, the Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Leslie Uggams, Sarah Vaughan, William Warfield, Dionne Warwick, Dinah Washington, Ethel Waters, Flip Wilson, Jackie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, and Stevie Wonder.

Before his death in a plane crash in December 1967, soul singer Otis Redding had been booked to appear on the show the following year. One telecast included African-American bass-baritone Andrew Frierson singing &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; from Kern and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;, a song that, at that time, was usually sung on television by white singers, although it was written for a black character in the musical.

However, Sullivan featured &quot;rockers&quot;, and gave prominence to black musicians &quot;not without censorship&quot;. For instance, he scheduled Fats Domino &quot;at the show&#x27;s end in case he had to cancel a guest&quot;. He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were a young Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole or Fats Waller, as he performed &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;. On March 4, 1962, Sullivan presented Domino and his band, who did &quot;Jambalaya&quot;, Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;You Win Again&quot;, and &quot;Let the Four Winds Blow&quot;. All seven of Domino&#x27;s band members were visible to millions of viewers. On December 1, 1957, Sam Cooke performed a complete version of &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;. Cooke had been cut off four weeks earlier during a live performance of &quot;You Send Me&quot; as the show&#x27;s allotted time expired, causing an outrage among television audiences. Sullivan rebooked Cooke for the December 1 show to overwhelming success.

===The Muppets===
Between 1966 and 1971, Jim Henson performed some of his Muppet characters on the show. The characters made a total of 25 appearances.

Henson&#x27;s Muppets were introduced on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on September 18, 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as &quot;Jim, uh ... Newsom&#x27;s puppets.&quot; The act featured a small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster (performed by Jim Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz) with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song &quot;Rock It to Me&quot; by the Bruthers. After the act was done, the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird (who was previously used in a commercial for Royal Crown Cola).

Most of these artists performed in the same makeup and costumes that they wore in the shows, often providing the only visual recordings of these performances by the original cast members, since there were no network telecasts of the Tony Awards until 1967. Many performances have been compiled and released on DVD as &quot;The Best of Broadway MusicalsOriginal Cast Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

==Mental illness program==
In a 1958 NEA interview, Sullivan noted his pride about the show&#x27;s role in improving the public&#x27;s understanding of mental illness. Sullivan considered his May 17, 1953, telecast to be the single most important episode in the show&#x27;s first decade. During that show, a salute to Broadway director Joshua Logan, the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan, Logan told him that the show was becoming &quot;another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows&quot;; Sullivan asked him what he should do about it, and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution.

==Controversies==
===Bo Diddley===
On November 20, 1955, African-American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer and guitarist Bo Diddley appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, only to infuriate Sullivan (&quot;I did two songs and he got mad&quot;). Diddley had been asked to sing Tennessee Ernie Ford&#x27;s hit &quot;Sixteen Tons,&quot; which he agreed. But while the show was on air, he changed his mind and sang his eponymous single &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;.

A reporter, who was present at the time, described what happened:

In his biography, &quot;Living Legend&quot;, Diddley recalled, &quot;Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: &#x27;You are the first black boyquotethat ever double crossed me!&#x27; I was ready to &quot;fight&quot;, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an&#x27; him callin&#x27; me &#x27;black&#x27; in them days was as bad as sayin&#x27; &#x27;nigger&#x27;. My manager says to me &#x27;That&#x27;s Mr. Sullivan!&#x27; I said: &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, [h]e don&#x27;t talk to me like that!&#x27; An&#x27; so he told me, he says, &#x27;I&#x27;ll see that you never work no more in show business. You&#x27;ll never get another TV show in your life!&#x27;&quot; Diddley never did appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; again.

===&quot;A Short Vision&quot;===
On May 27, 1956, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; presented an animated short film entitled &quot;A Short Vision&quot;. The short subject showcased an unidentified object that is referred to as &quot;it&quot; by the narrator. The object flies over Earth. When it passes, the people are asleep except the leaders and the wise men who look up at the object. As the leaders and wise men look up and predators and prey hide in fear, it produces a mushroom cloud in the sky, killing everyone and everything, vaporizing the people, the animals and Earth. After this happens, there remains only a moth and a flame. The moth flies to the flame, gets vaporized and the flame dies. Thus, marking the end of humanity.

The short film is narrated in the style of the Bible. The animation is derived from mostly still images that produce a terrifying and horrifying moving image of the end of humanity. Just before CBS showed the film, Sullivan assured children that what they would see was an animated fantasy. He told the audience that &quot;It is grim, but I think we can all stand it to realize that in war there is no winner&quot;. The film gained notoriety from the show; but it also gained controversy because of it, due to the graphic way it depicted the horrors of a nuclear confrontation. Its graphic images also caused controversy. One of the visuals in the film depicted an animated character&#x27;s eyes imploding and the remains running down its cheeks and then it gets destroyed by the object.

According to some sources, including contemporary newspaper reports, Ed Sullivan&#x27;s telecast of &quot;A Short Vision&quot; caused a reaction as significant as Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast 20 years prior. Because of the popularity of the short film, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; broadcast it again on June 10 of the same year. Sullivanwho in an interview after the first showing erroneously claimed that he had warned children to not watch itasked adults to remove children from the room before watching the second, heavily publicized showing.

===Jackie Mason===
On October 18, 1964, Jackie Mason allegedly gave Sullivan the finger on air. A tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan.

Sullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the New York Supreme Court, which he won.

Sullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again,&quot; and impersonated Sullivan during his act. Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jun. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.

===The Doors===
During the Doors&#x27; rehearsal, Jim Morrison sang the alternate line of Light My Fire. However, he accidentally reverted to the original line during the live show, and CBS executives were powerless to change it. The Doors were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek, the band was told, &quot;Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You&#x27;ll never do the Sullivan show again.&quot; Morrison replied with glee, &quot;Hey man, we just &quot;did&quot; the Sullivan show.&quot;at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success.

Manzarek gave differing accounts of what happened. He had said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident were reenacted in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 biographical film, &quot;The Doors&quot;, albeit in a more dramatic fashion, with Morrison portrayed as emphasizing the word &quot;higher&quot;.

Sullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word &quot;higher&quot;. Sly &amp; the Family Stone later appeared on the show and performed their 1969 hit &quot;I Want to Take You Higher.&quot;

==Primetime specials==
==Parodies==
The show&#x27;s popularity has been the target of numerous tributes and parodies. These include:

* On an episode of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis did a parody called &quot;The Toast of the Colgate Town&quot;, with Lewis wearing fake teeth and slicked-back hair as &quot;Ed Solomon&quot;.
* The first episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on August 30, 1993, featured clips of Ed Sullivan spliced together to make it look as though he was introducing host David Letterman, while a segment later in the episode featured David channeling the &quot;ghost&quot; of Ed Sullivan, this time an archive clip of Sullivan introducing actor Paul Newman, who was live in the Letterman audience that night. Since moving to CBS from NBC, Letterman taped his show in the Ed Sullivan Theater, the studio where Sullivan also staged his program, until his 2015 retirement.
*On May 18, 1998, UPN aired a series pilot for &quot;The Virtual Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, featuring a computerized version of Sullivan, in conjunction with the voice and body movements of impressionist John Byner (who had appeared on Sullivan several times), who was fitted with a motion-capture sensor suit while backstage.

<text>Patpong (, , ) is an entertainment district in Bangkok&#x27;s Bang Rak District, Thailand, catering mainly, though not exclusively, to foreign tourists and expatriates. While Patpong is internationally known as a red light district at the heart of Bangkok&#x27;s sex industry, it is in fact only one of several red-light districts with some catering primarily to Thai men while others, like Patpong, cater primarily to foreigners.

A busy night market aimed at tourists is also located in Patpong.

==Location and layout==
Patpong consists of two parallel side streets running between Silom and Surawong Roads and one side street running from the opposite side of Surawong. Patpong is within walking distance from the BTS Skytrain Silom Line&#x27;s Sala Daeng Station, and MRT Blue Line&#x27;s Si Lom Station.

Patpong 1 is the main street with many bars of various kinds. Patpong 2 also has many similar bars. Next to these lies Soi Jaruwan, sometimes referred to as Patpong 3 but best known as Silom Soi 4. It has long catered to gay men, whilst nearby Soi Thaniya has expensive bars with Thai hostesses that cater almost exclusively to Japanese men.

==History and ownership==
Patpong gets its name from the family that owns much of the area&#x27;s property. Luang Patpongpanich (or Patpongpanit), an immigrant from Hainan Island, China, purchased the area in 1946. At that time it was an undeveloped plot of land on the outskirts of the city. A small klong (canal) and a teakwood house were the only features. The family built a road – now called Patpong 1 – and several shop buildings, which were rented out. Patpong 2 was added later, and both roads are private property and not city streets. Patpong 3 and Soi Thaniya are not owned by the Patpongpanich family. The old teak house was demolished long ago and the klong was filled in to make room for more shops. Originally Patpong was an ordinary business area, but the arrival of bars eventually drove out most of the other businesses.

By 1968, a handful of nightclubs existed in the area, and Patpong became an R&amp;R (rest and recuperation) stop for US military officers serving in the Vietnam War, although the main R&amp;R area for GIs was along New Petchburi Road, nicknamed &quot;The Golden Mile&quot;. In its prime during the 1970s and 1980s, Patpong was the premier nightlife area in Bangkok for foreigners, and was famous for its sexually explicit shows. In the mid-1980s the sois hosted an annual Patpong Mardi Gras, which was a weekend street fair that raised money for Thai charities. In the early-1990s, however, the Patpongpanich family turned the sidewalks of Patpong 1 Road into a night market, renting out spaces to street vendors.

The consequence was that Patpong lost much of its vibrancy as a nightlife strip, becoming crowded with tourist shoppers who ignored the nightlife. Nana Plaza and Soi Cowboy drew away many of Patpong&#x27;s thrill seekers. Patpong became a designated &quot;entertainment zone&quot; in 2004, along with Royal City Avenue (RCA) and portions of Ratchadapisek Road, where the largest commercial sex venues are found. This designation allows its bars to stay open until 02:00, instead of the 24:00 or 01:00 legal closing times enforced in other areas.

In October 2019 the Patpong Museum opened in Patpong Soi 2, housing a collection of art, antiques and displays covering 70 years of Patpong&#x27;s history. The privately owned museum was located on the 2nd floor of building 5 opposite Foodland supermarket and below Black Pagoda. Patpong Museum closed as of May 2023.

==In media==
Many Western films have featured Patpong, including &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). The final part of the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1989) is set in the Patpong bar scene.

In &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;, Spalding Gray discussed the red light district of Patpong and its prostitutes, saying there wasn&#x27;t much else to see in Bangkok save the Gold Buddha during the day and the whorehouses at night.

The song &quot;Welcome to Thailand&quot; from the 1987 studio album of the same name by the Thai rock band Carabao contains the lyrics: &quot;&quot;Tom, Tom, where you go last night?... I love Meuang Thai. I like Patpong&quot;. The song complains that &quot;Farang&quot; tourists (Westerners) are often attracted to the sleazy side of Thailand (the sex tourism of Patpong and Pattaya).

The movie &quot;Baraka&quot; features several shots of strippers in Patpong.

The 1994 book &quot;Patpong Sisters: An American Woman&#x27;s View of the Bangkok Sex World&quot; by Cleo Odzer describes the experiences of an anthropologist doing field research in Thailand.

&quot;Patpong: Bangkok&#x27;s Twilight Zone&quot; (2001, by Nick Nostitz) is a photographic depiction of aspects of the Patpong night life.

The 2008 book &quot;Ladyboys: The Secret World of Thailand&#x27;s Third Gender&quot; paints a portrait of Thailand&#x27;s kathoeys.

&quot;Patpong opera&quot; is a collection of songs written by Kevin Wood, manager of Radio City, to tunes of modern rock songs. Together they tell the story of the people in Patpong.

Patpong serves as part of the setting in Tom Robbins&#x27; book &quot;Villa Incognito&quot;.

<text>Tortoises ( ) are reptiles of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines (Latin for &quot;tortoise&quot;). Like other turtles, tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder Cryptodira, they retract their necks and heads directly backward into the shell to protect them.

Tortoises can vary in size with some species, such as the Galápagos giant tortoise, growing to more than in length, whereas others like the Speckled cape tortoise have shells that measure only long. Several lineages of tortoises have independently evolved very large body sizes in excess of , including the Galapagos giant tortoise and the Aldabra giant tortoise. They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals. Tortoises are the longest-living land animals in the world, although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. Galápagos tortoises are noted to live over 150 years, but an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita may have lived an estimated 255 years. In general, most tortoise species can live 80–150 years. 

Tortoises are placid and slow-moving, with an average walking speed of 0.2–0.5 km/h.

==Terminology==
Differences exist in usage of the common terms turtle, tortoise, and terrapin, depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory. These terms are common names and do not reflect precise biological or taxonomic distinctions.The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists uses &quot;turtle&quot; to describe all species of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are land-dwelling or sea-dwelling, and uses &quot;tortoise&quot; as a more specific term for slow-moving terrestrial species. General American usage agrees; turtle is often a general term; tortoise is used only in reference to terrestrial turtles or, more narrowly, only those members of Testudinidae, the family of modern land tortoises; and terrapin may refer to turtles that are small and live in fresh and brackish water, in particular the diamondback terrapin (&quot;Malaclemys terrapin&quot;). In America, for example, the members of the genus &quot;Terrapene&quot; dwell on land, yet are referred to as box turtles rather than tortoises.

British usage, by contrast, tends not to use &quot;turtle&quot; as a generic term for all members of the order, and also applies the term &quot;tortoises&quot; broadly to all land-dwelling members of the order Testudines, regardless of whether they are actually members of the family Testudinidae. In Britain, terrapin is used to refer to a larger group of semiaquatic turtles than the restricted meaning in America.

Australian usage is different from both American and British usage. Land tortoises are not native to Australia, and traditionally freshwater turtles have been called &quot;tortoises&quot; in Australia. Some Australian experts disapprove of this usage—believing that the term tortoises is &quot;better confined to purely terrestrial animals with very different habits and needs, none of which are found in this country&quot;—and promote the use of the term &quot;freshwater turtle&quot; to describe Australia&#x27;s primarily aquatic members of the order Testudines because it avoids misleading use of the word &quot;tortoise&quot; and also is a useful distinction from marine turtles.

==Biology==

===Life cycle===


Most species of tortoises lay small clutch sizes, seldom exceeding 20 eggs, and many species have clutch sizes of only 1–2 eggs. Incubation is characteristically long in most species, the average incubation period are between 100 and 160.0 days. Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her clutch with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate. The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the cloacal opening between the carapace and plastron. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed hatchling uses an egg tooth to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly herbivorous species commonly will consume worms or insect larvae for additional protein.

The number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a tree, can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of forage (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.

Tortoises generally have one of the longest lifespans of any animal, and some individuals are known to have lived longer than 150 years. Because of this, they symbolize longevity in some cultures, such as Chinese culture. The oldest tortoise ever recorded, and one of the oldest individual animals ever recorded, was Tu&#x27;i Malila, which was presented to the Tongan royal family by the British explorer James Cook shortly after its birth in 1777. Tu&#x27;i Malila remained in the care of the Tongan royal family until its death by natural causes on May 19, 1965, at the age of 188.

The Alipore Zoo in India was the home to Adwaita, which zoo officials claimed was the oldest living animal until its death on March 23, 2006. Adwaita (also spelled Addwaita) was an Aldabra giant tortoise brought to India by Lord Wellesley, who handed it over to the Alipur Zoological Gardens in 1875 when the zoo was set up. West Bengal officials said records showed Adwaita was at least 150 years old, but other evidence pointed to 250. Adwaita was said to be the pet of Robert Clive.

Harriet was a resident at the Australia Zoo in Queensland from 1987 to her death in 2006; she was believed to have been brought to England by Charles Darwin aboard the &quot;Beagle&quot; and then on to Australia by John Clements Wickham. Harriet died on June 23, 2006, just shy of her 176th birthday.

Timothy, a female spur-thighed tortoise, lived to be about 165 years old. For 38 years, she was carried as a mascot aboard various ships in Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy. Then in 1892, at age 53, she retired to the grounds of Powderham Castle in Devon. Up to the time of her death in 2004, she was believed to be the United Kingdom&#x27;s oldest resident.

Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise living on the island of St Helena, may be as old as years.

DNA analysis of the genomes of the long-lived tortoises, Lonesome George, the iconic last member of &quot;Chelonoidis abingdonii&quot;, and the Aldabra giant tortoise &quot;Aldabrachelys gigantea&quot; led to the detection of lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes that might contribute to their long lifespan.

===Dimorphism===
Many species of tortoises are sexually dimorphic, though the differences between males and females vary from species to species. In some species, males have a longer, more protruding neck plate than their female counterparts, while in others, the claws are longer on the females.

The male plastron is curved inwards to aid reproduction. The easiest way to determine the sex of a tortoise is to look at the tail. The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.

===Brain===
The brain of a tortoise is extremely small. Red-footed tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the hippocampus, which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. Studies have shown that red-footed tortoises may rely on an area of the brain called the medial cortex for emotional actions, an area that humans use for actions such as decision making.

In the 17th century, Francesco Redi performed an experiment that involved removing the brain of a land tortoise, which then proceeded to live six months. Freshwater tortoises, when subjected to the same experiment, continued similarly, but did not live so long. Redi also cut the head off a tortoise entirely, and it lived for 23 days.

==Distribution==
Tortoises are found from southern North America to southern South America, around the Mediterranean basin, across Eurasia to Southeast Asia, in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and some Pacific islands. They are absent from Australasia. They live in diverse habitats, including deserts, arid grasslands, and scrub to wet evergreen forests, and from sea level to mountains. Most species, however, occupy semiarid habitats.

Many large islands are or were characterized by species of giant tortoises. Part of the reason for this is that tortoises are good at oceanic dispersal. Despite being unable to swim, tortoises are able to survive long periods adrift at sea because they can survive months without food or fresh water. Tortoises have been known to survive oceanic dispersals of more than 740 km. Once on islands tortoises faced few predators or competitors and could grow to large sizes and become the dominant large herbivores on many islands due to their low metabolic rate and reduced need for fresh water compared to mammals.

Today there are only two living species of giant tortoises, the Aldabra giant tortoise on Aldabra Atoll and the dozen subspecies of Galapagos giant tortoise found on the Galapagos Islands. However, until recently giant tortoises could be found on nearly every major island group, including the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles (including Cuba and Hispaniola), the Lesser Antilles, the Canary Islands, Malta, the Seychelles, the Mascarene Islands (including Mauritius and Reunion), and Madagascar. Most of these tortoises were wiped out by human arrival. Many of these giant tortoises are not closely related (belonging to different genera such as &quot;Megalochelys&quot;, &quot;Chelonoidis&quot;, &quot;Centrochelys&quot;, &quot;Aldabrachelys&quot;, &quot;Cylindraspis&quot;, and &quot;Hesperotestudo&quot;), but are thought to have independently evolved large body size through convergent evolution. Giant tortoises are notably absent from Australasia and many south Pacific islands, but the distantly related meiolaniid turtles are thought to have filled the same niche. Giant tortoises are also known from the Oligocene-Pliocene of mainland North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, but are all now extinct, which is also attributed to human activity.
==Diet==
Tortoises are generally considered to be strict herbivores, feeding on grasses, weeds, leafy greens, flowers, and some fruits. However, hunting and eating of birds has been observed on occasion. Pet tortoises typically require diets based on wild grasses, weeds, leafy greens and certain flowers. Certain species consume worms or insects and carrion in their normal habitats. Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and has been associated with shell deformities and other medical problems. Different tortoise species vary greatly in their nutritional requirements.

== Behavior ==
Communication in tortoises is different from many other reptiles. Because they are restricted by their shell and short limbs, visual communication is not a strong form of communication in tortoises. Tortoises use olfactory cues to determine the sex of other tortoises so that they can find a potential mate. Tactile communication is important in tortoises during combat and courtship. In both combat and courtship, tortoises use ramming to communicate with other individuals.

==Phylogeny==
A molecular phylogeny of tortoises, following Le et al. (2006: 525):


A separate phylogeny via mtDNA analysis was found by Kehlmaier &quot;et al.&quot; (2021):
In 2023 Kehlmaier again recovered a very similar phylogeny to the 2021 one, which further reaffirmed the evolutionary distinctiveness of the extinct &quot;Cylindraspis&quot;, but swapped the position of &quot;Gopherus&quot; and &quot;Manouria&quot;, making &quot;Gopherus&quot; the most basal genus.

==In human culture==
===In religion===
In Hinduism, Kurma () was the second Avatar of Vishnu. Like the Matsya Avatara, Kurma also belongs to the Satya Yuga. Vishnu took the form of a half-man, half-tortoise, the lower half being a tortoise. He is normally shown as having four arms. He sat on the bottom of the ocean after the Great Flood. A mountain was placed on his back by the other gods so they could churn the sea and find the ancient treasures of the Vedic peoples.

In Judaism, tortoises are seen as unclean animals. Early Christians also viewed tortoises as unclean.

In Chinese and Japanese folk religion, tortoises are considered oracular animals. Tortoise shells were used by ancient Chinese as oracle bones to make predictions.

In Ancient Greek mythology, Hermes crafts the first lyre from a tortoise.

===In space===
In September, 1968, two Russian tortoises became the first animals to fly to and circle the Moon. Their Zond 5 mission brought them back to Earth safely.

<doc id="140621" wikidata="Q1396226" url="?curid=140621" title="Farang">
<text>Farang () is a Persian word that originally referred to the Franks (the major Germanic people) and later came to refer to Western or Latin Europeans in general. The word is borrowed from Old French or Latin , which are also the source of Modern English &quot;France, French&quot;.

The Western European and Islamic worlds came into prolonged contact with each other during the crusades and the establishment of the Crusader states. Many crusaders spoke (Old) French and were from the territory of modern France; while others came from other regions, such as modern Italy or England. In any case, the period predated the idea of the nation state in Europe. &quot;Frank&quot; or its equivalent term were used by both Medieval Greeks and Muslims to refer to any crusader or Latin Christian. From the 12th century onwards, it was the standard term for Western Christians in the Muslim world.

Through Muslim trading networks, the Persian term &quot;farang&quot; and related words such as &quot;Frangistan&quot; () were spread to languages of South Asia and Southeast Asia.

==Origin and geographic spread==
===Arabic===
The Persian word &quot;farang&quot; () or &quot;farangī&quot; (), refers to Franks, the major Germanic tribe ruling Western Europe. &quot;Frangistan&quot; () was a term used by Muslims and Persians in particular, during the Middle Ages and later periods, to refer to Western or Latin Europe. According to Rashid od-Din Fazl ol-Lāh-e Hamadāni, Arabic word &quot;Afranj&quot; comes from the Persian &quot;farang&quot;. This seems unlikely though, considering that the Arabic &#x27;al-Faranj&#x27; or &#x27;Afranj&#x27; has been attested since the 9th century, in the works of al-Jahiz and Ya&#x27;qubi, a century before &#x27;Farang&#x27; was first used in an anonymous late 10th century Persian geography book, suggesting that the Persian &#x27;Farang&#x27; is a loan from Arabic. By the 11th century, Arabic texts were increasingly using the term &#x27;Faransa&#x27; or &#x27;al-Faransiyah&#x27;, already attested in the work of Said al-Andalusi in the mid 11th century.

===Ethiopia and Eritrea===
In the languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea, &quot;faranj&quot; or &quot;ferenj&quot; in most contexts still means distant foreigner (generally used to describe Europeans or European descendant/white people), in certain contexts within the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora, the term &quot;faranj&quot; or &quot;ferenj&quot; has taken on a slightly alternative meaning that closely resembles the term Westerner or Westernized people even though it still mostly applies to European descendants/White People, it can be applied to African Americans and other Westernized People of Color.

===South, Southeast and East Asia===
During the Muslim Mughal Empire when the Europeans arrived in South Asia, the Persian word Farang was used to refer to foreigners of European descent. The words also added to local languages such as Hindi/Urdu as &quot;firangi&quot; (Devanāgarī: फिरंगी and Urdu فرنگی) and Bengali as &quot;firingi&quot; (ফিরিঙ্গি). The word was pronounced &quot;paranki&quot; (പറങ്കി) in Malayalam, &quot;parangiar&quot; in Tamil,Sinhala, and Malay as &quot;ferenggi&quot;. From there the term spread into China as &quot;folangji&quot; (佛郎機), which was used to refer to the Portuguese and their breech-loading swivel guns when they first arrived in China.

==Regional evolution==
===South Asia===
In Bangladesh and West Bengal, the modern meaning of &quot;firingi&quot; (ফিরিঙ্গি) refers to Anglo-Bengalis or Bengalis with European ancestry. Most &quot;firingi&quot;s tend to be Bengali Christians. Descendants of &quot;firingi&quot;s who married local Bengali women may also be referred to as &quot;Kalo Firingi&quot;s (Black firingis) or &quot;Matio Firingis&quot; (Earth-coloured firingis). Following the Portuguese settlement in Chittagong, the Portuguese fort and naval base came to be known as Firingi Bandar or the Foreigner&#x27;s Port. There are also places such as Firingi Bazaar which exist in older parts of Dhaka and Chittagong. The descendants of these Portuguese traders in Chittagong continue to be referred to as &quot;Firingi&quot;s. The Indian biographical film &quot;Antony Firingee&quot; was very popular in the mid-20th century and was based on Anthony Firingee – a Bengali folk singer of Portuguese origin. There is also a river in the Sundarbans called Firingi River.

In Telugu &quot;phirangi&quot; (ఫిరంగి) means cannon, due to cannons being an import.

In Sinhala &quot;parangi&quot; (පරංගි) was used to refer to the Portuguese people. The poem &quot;Parangi Hatana&quot; describes the Battle of Gannoruwa.

In the Maldives &quot;faranji&quot; was the term used to refer to foreigners of European origin, especially the French. Until recently the lane next to the Bastion in the northern shore of Malé was called Faranji Kalō Gōlhi.

===Southeast Asia===
Edmund Roberts, US envoy to Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat in the early 1830s, defined the term as &quot;Frank (or European)&quot;. Black people are called &quot;farang dam&quot; (; &#x27;black farang&#x27;) to distinguish them from whites. This began during the Vietnam War, when the United States military maintained bases in Thailand. The practice continues in present-day Bangkok.

In modern Thailand, the &quot;Royal Institute Dictionary 1999&quot;, the official dictionary of Thai words, defines the word as &quot;a person of white race&quot;. The term is also blended into everyday terms meaning &quot;of/from the white race&quot;. For example, varieties of food/produce that were introduced by Europeans are often called &quot;farang&quot; varieties. Hence, potatoes are &quot;man farang&quot; (), whereas &quot;man&quot; () alone can be any tuber; &quot;no mai farang&quot; (; &quot;&quot;farang&quot; shoot&quot;) means asparagus; culantro is called &quot;phak chi farang&quot; (, literally farang cilantro/coriander); and chewing gum is &quot;mak farang&quot; (). &quot;Mak&quot; () is Thai for areca nut; chewing &quot;mak&quot; together with betel leaves &quot;(bai phlu)&quot; was a Thai custom. A non-food example is &quot;achan farang&quot; (; &quot;&quot;farang&quot; professor&quot;) which is the nickname of an influential figure in Thai art history, Italian art professor Silpa Bhirasri.

&quot;Farang&quot; is also the Thai word for the guava fruit, introduced by Portuguese traders over 400 years ago.

&quot;Farang khi nok&quot; (), also used in Lao, is slang commonly used as an insult to a person of white race, equivalent to white trash, as &quot;khi&quot; means feces and &quot;nok&quot; means bird, referring to the white color of bird-droppings.

In the Isan Lao dialect, the guava is called &quot;mak sida&quot; (), &quot;mak&quot; being a prefix for fruit names. Thus &quot;bak sida&quot; (), &quot;bak&quot; being a prefix when calling males, refers jokingly to a Westerner, by analogy to the Thai language where &quot;farang&quot; can mean both guava and Westerner.

<text>Decca Records is a British record label established in 1929 by Edward Lewis after his acquisition of a gramophone manufacturer, The Decca Gramophone Company. It set up an American subsidiary under the Decca name, which became an independent company just before the Second World War. The American spin-off became a subsidiary of MCA Inc. in 1962. Known for its technical innovations, the British parent company grew to become the second most successful recording company in Britain and celebrated fifty years of existence in 1979, shortly before being sold to PolyGram. Both Decca and its former subsidiary were subsequently acquired by Universal Music.

Decca and its American spin-off both built up strong catalogues of popular music. In their first two decades their artists included Gertrude Lawrence, George Formby, Jack Hylton and Vera Lynn in Britain and Bing Crosby, Al Jolson the Andrews Sisters and the Mills Brothers in the US. Later performers in their popular catalogues included in the US Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and Buddy Holly plus in the UK Elvis Presley (licenced from RCA Records), Tommy Steele, Lonnie Donegan, Chuck Berry (licenced from Chess Records), Johnny Cash (licenced from Sun Records), Eddie Cochran (licenced from Liberty Records), and the Rolling Stones.

In the classical sphere, Decca became a major player after the Second World War, building up a large catalogue of symphonic, operatic, chamber and other music. Between 1958 and 1965 the company made what has been widely described as the gramophone&#x27;s greatest achievement – the first complete recording to be released of Wagner&#x27;s operatic tetralogy, (The Nibelung&#x27;s Ring). Decca&#x27;s advanced technological expertise offered recorded sound of unprecedented realism in the mid-20th century, and it was an early adapter of digital technology.

==History==
===Foundation===

The origins of the Decca Record Company were not in making records but in making the gramophones on which to play them. Shortly before the First World War the first Decca product was offered to the public: the &quot;Decca Dulcephone&quot; a portable gramophone, retailing at two guineas (£2.10 in decimal currency, and equivalent to about £250 in 2023 terms). It was manufactured by the musical instrument makers Barnett Samuel and Sons Ltd, a company founded in 1869. There are various theories about the derivation of the name &quot;Decca&quot;, but the musicologist Robert Dearling describes it as &quot;a word whose origins are lost&quot;.

In the 1920s the company changed its name to &quot;The Decca Gramophone Company&quot; and it was floated on the stock market in 1928. Edward Lewis, a London stockbroker, acted for the company, despite his reservations about its business model:

Lewis tried to convince Decca&#x27;s board that the way forward was to expand into record production and manufacture, and recommended buying out the struggling Duophone Record Company in south London, arguing that &quot;with the well-known Decca trademark and ... distributing organization ... a Decca record would surely succeed where others were failing&quot;. The Decca directors were unpersuaded and Lewis raised enough capital to acquire not only Duophone but Decca itself.

On 7 February 1929 the Decca Record Company&#x27;s first discs were recorded: dance music performed by Ambrose and the May Fair Orchestra. The first classical recording took place four days later at the Chenil Galleries in Chelsea, and featured the violist Cecil Bonvallot in an arrangement of J. S. Bach&#x27;s . Among the fledgling company&#x27;s releases in its first year were a set of numbers from William Walton and Edith Sitwell&#x27;s &quot;Façade&quot; conducted by the composer and recited by Sitwell and Constant Lambert, and a set of Handel Concerti grossi conducted by Ernest Ansermet, who made more than a hundred recordings for Decca between then and 1968. A premiere recording of Delius&#x27;s &quot;Sea Drift&quot; conducted by Julian Clifford was in less than ideal sound, but marked Decca&#x27;s first association with the baritone Roy Henderson which lasted for the rest of his career.

===1930s===
The Great Depression of the 1930s hit Decca hard. Lewis, although he remained nominally merely a board member, effectively took over the direction of the company and at his instigation Decca made substantial cuts in the prices of its records. In 1930 Decca acquired the British rights to the German Polydor label, gaining access to a wide range of classical recordings. During the decade Decca also bought the British rights to the and Ultraphon catalogues, but sold its French subsidiary to Edison Bell. Decca bought a majority shareholding in the American Brunswick Record Company from the Warner Brothers film studios; its catalogue contained recordings by leading popular artists such as Bing Crosby, Guy Lombardo and Al Jolson. Decca established an American subsidiary, Decca Records US, in 1934, funded and chaired by Lewis and led by Jack Kapp, Milton Rackmil and E. F. Stevens. American Decca boosted its presence in the popular market by signing the Andrews Sisters and the Mills Brothers. As the Second World War loomed, Lewis, foreseeing a freeze of his overseas assets, sold his holdings in the US company.

In 1934, Jack Kapp established a country &amp; western line for the new Decca American subsidiary by signing Frank Luther, Sons of the Pioneers, Stuart Hamblen, The Ranch Boys, and other popular acts based in both New York and Los Angeles. Louisiana singer/composer Jimmie Davis began recording for Decca the same year, joined by western vocalists Jimmy Wakely and Roy Rogers in 1940.

In 1935, the Compo Company became the Canadian distributor of American Decca recordings.

Between 1929 and 1938 record sales in Britain fell by eighty-five per cent, and Lewis sought new ways of keeping Decca afloat. He signed popular artists such as the singers Gertrude Lawrence and George Formby, the best-selling dance-band leader Jack Hylton and the singer Vera Lynn, who later became the first non-American singer to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 1935 Decca made the first recording of Walton&#x27;s First Symphony and in the same year lured Sir Henry Wood away from EMI, although he later returned there. Other classical artists recruited by the company included the newly formed Boyd Neel Orchestra in 1934, followed by the Griller Quartet in 1935 and Clifford Curzon in 1937. Lewis&#x27;s biographer Peter Martland writes that &quot;through a combination of Lewis&#x27;s adroitness, good luck, and a gradual upturn in the global economy, by the time the Second World War broke out in 1939, it appeared that Decca had weathered the storm&quot;.

===Second World War===
Decca had acquired the small Crystalate record company in the late 1930s, and with it its sound engineers Arthur Haddy and Kenneth Wilkinson, as well as its studios in West Hampstead. Recording continued at the studios throughout the Second World War. Although production was hampered by a shortage of the shellac from which records were made, for Decca the positive results of the war far outweighed the disadvantages. Haddy and his team were moved from making commercial recordings to developing vital technology for the war effort. They were tasked with making recording equipment to detect the sonic differences in the water movement around German and British submarine propellers. As the relevant differences were at the high end of the frequency range, unprecedently sensitive equipment had to be invented, and this the Decca engineers did. This was not only an important contribution to the war effort, but made possible greatly enhanced gramophone recordings when the war ended. &quot;We&#x27;d got the goods&quot;, Haddy later recalled.

The American offshoot of Decca was less affected by the war than the British company. It bought out Warner Brothers&#x27; residual stake in Brunswick and floated as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1942. The company&#x27;s popular music catalogue now included recordings by, among others, the Ink Spots, Jimmy Dorsey, Judy Garland, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. In 1942 the company released the first recording of &quot;White Christmas&quot; by Bing Crosby. He recorded another version of the song in 1947, also for US Decca; it became and has remained the world&#x27;s best-selling single. American Decca pioneered original cast albums of musicals with the Broadway cast of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943, and other shows followed, including &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;.

===Post-war===

On 8 June 1945 Decca announced that its ffrr (full frequency range recording) system had been &quot;in daily use for the past twelve months&quot;. The company&#x27;s publicity manager, Francis Attwood, suggested a new trademark consisting of the letters &quot;ffrr&quot; coming out of a human ear. This was adopted and Lewis later observed that Attwood&#x27;s design was &quot;to become of immense value&quot;. The dramatically enhanced frequency range now possible prompted Decca to move its main London recording venue from the West Hampstead studios to the acoustically superb Kingsway Hall in 1944. Ansermet conducted what Dearling calls &quot;the first important ffrr release&quot;, Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Petrushka&quot;, recorded there in February 1946.

Another technical advance that greatly benefited Decca was the invention of the long-playing record (LP), pressed on vinyl rather than shellac and playing for five times longer than 78 r.p.m. discs. The technology was pioneered in the US by Columbia Records and in Europe by Decca. From 1948 to 1950 Decca concentrated its efforts on exporting LPs for the American market and it was not until June 1950 that Decca LPs became available in Britain. The playing time of LP made recordings of complete operas considerably more viable than hitherto, and Decca recorded Mozart&#x27;s (The Seraglio) in Vienna in June 1950 and Wagner&#x27;s four-and-a-half-hour (The Mastersingers) in 1951–52. Decca&#x27;s main British rival, EMI, comprising the Columbia, HMV and Parlophone labels, lagged behind, having initially reached the conclusion that there was no future in LP, devoting itself instead to an unsuccessful two-year attempt to perpetuate the 78 format.

Most recording contracts had expired or lapsed during the war, and consequently many eminent artists, previously exclusive to rival labels, could be enticed by Decca&#x27;s technical edge. The company instituted an ambitious programme of international classical recordings in many European centres, building up an artist roster comparable with those of its pre-war competitors. For the first time since the 1930s Decca was able to resume full-price releases. A mainstay of the orchestral catalogue was provided by Ansermet and his Suisse Romande Orchestra in Geneva, who recorded for Decca from 1949 to 1968. Peter Pears signed with the company in 1944, Kathleen Ferrier in 1946, Julius Katchen in 1947 and the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company – hitherto exclusive to EMI – in 1949. In 1950 the Vienna Philharmonic, also contracted to EMI until then, entered into an exclusive contract with Decca. Other former EMI artists who joined Decca were Wilhelm Backhaus and Wilhelm Kempff.

From the late 1940s on, the American Decca had a sizeable roster of country artists. The main architect of American Decca&#x27;s success in country music was Owen Bradley, who joined American Decca in 1947 and was later promoted to vice president and head of A&amp;R for the Nashville operations in 1958.

In 1947, Lewis, finding the now independent US Decca uncooperative in distributing British recordings, set up a new American subsidiary, London Records.

===1950s ===
Despite having the Vienna Philharmonic under contract, Decca began the decade at a disadvantage to EMI so far as orchestral recordings were concerned. On the HMV label EMI had Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s Royal Philharmonic and on Columbia Walter Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia. The London orchestras available to Decca were the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), described by Decca&#x27;s discographer Philip Stuart as &quot;in rather run-down condition in the post-war years&quot;. Among the Decca recordings with the LPO is a cycle of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s symphonies, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult in the presence of the composer between 1952 and 1956. The Vienna Philharmonic recording of conducted by Josef Krips with singers from the Vienna State Opera was the first of a long series of opera recordings.
Stereophony – a system for recording and reproducing sound using separate microphones feeding separate loudspeakers in playback to give a spatial effect – had been known for many years and had been used in the cinema from the 1930s. When the prospect emerged in the mid-1950s that domestic equipment could be manufactured to reproduce stereophonic recordings, Decca began recording in stereo, first in Geneva on 13 May 1954 and experimentally in London from December 1954 and in Vienna from April 1955. Decca&#x27;s first stereo recording, produced by James Walker, was Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Antar&quot; symphonic suite.

The producer John Culshaw was a strong advocate of stereophony, but not all his Decca colleagues agreed. Launching stereophonic recordings only five or so years after the introduction of LPs would require considerable fresh outlay by record producers and purchasers alike: the former needing to re-record all their back catalogues and the latter to buy new playback equipment. It was not until 1958 that Decca began issuing stereo recordings, both in Britain and in the US.

In popular music American Decca assembled a substantial list of performers in the 1950s, including Bill Haley &amp; His Comets – whose 1954 &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; was an especial success and Buddy Holly. British Decca had Tommy Steele and Lonnie Donegan. British Decca also licensed from independent record companies Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash, Eddie Cochran and Jerry Lee Lewis which were issued in the UK on the London label. In June and July 1957 American Decca released the soundtracks from Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions&#x27; film &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, which, exceptionally, had two separate soundtracks, each featuring completely different music. The acts from American Decca and its Coral Records subsidiary were issued by British Decca on Brunswick Records and Coral. British Decca also issued licensed American records on the London label.

Beginning in 1951 the independent American Decca, led by Rackmil, bought shares in Universal Pictures, holding a controlling interest by 1954. The two companies merged with MCA in 1959. The American RCA label severed its long affiliation with EMI in 1957, and entered into an alliance with Decca, which took over the British marketing and distribution of RCA recordings, including top selling popular recordings by artists including Elvis Presley. An agreement between the two companies allowed artists exclusive to one label to record for the other, and Decca producers and engineers made nearly 200 recordings in Europe to be sold under the RCA label. Artists thus recorded included Pierre Monteux, Arthur Rubinstein, Leopold Stokowski, Jascha Heifetz, Joan Sutherland, Birgit Nilsson and André Previn. Decca production teams also worked on recording sessions for the company&#x27;s subsidiary but largely autonomous labels Argo and, later, Oiseau-Lyre.

Also in 1951, American Decca bought its Canadian distributior the Compo Company.

1958 saw Decca embarking on what has been described in three continents as the greatest recording ever made: Wagner&#x27;s (The Nibelung&#x27;s Ring). The recording was conceived and produced by Culshaw, who engaged the Vienna Philharmonic, the conductor Georg Solti and leading Wagner singers including Birgit Nilsson, Wolfgang Windgassen, Hans Hotter and Gottlob Frick and, in roles they did not play onstage, well-known singers such as Kirsten Flagstad, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Joan Sutherland. Culshaw and his engineering colleagues set out to capture on disc performances that would recreate in listeners&#x27; minds the drama that Wagner intended, compensating for the lack of visual images with imaginative production, making use of the newly available stereophonic technology.

American Decca actively re-entered the classical music field in 1950 with distribution deals from Deutsche Grammophon and Parlophone. American Decca began issuing its classical music recordings in 1956 when Israel Horowitz joined Decca to head its classical music operations. To further American Decca&#x27;s dedication to serious music, in August 1950, Rackmill announced the release of a new series of disks to be known as the &quot;Decca Gold Label Series&quot; which was to be devoted to &quot;symphonies, concertos, chamber music, opera, songs and choral music.&quot; American and European artists were to be the performers. Among the classical recordings released on Decca&#x27;s &quot;Gold Label&quot; series were albums by Leroy Anderson, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Max Rudolf and guitarist Andrés Segovia.

===1960s===
In the 1960s Decca consolidated its position as the only British record company to rival EMI. By the end of the decade Decca had 22.8 per cent of the British LP market, second only to EMI, which had 26.5 per cent. Technically it surpassed its competitor – in 1965 &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Decca&#x27;s engineers were incomparable – and it had expanded its overseas operations to include not only the completion of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle but extensive repertoire from Karl Münchinger and the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra in baroque music, Solti and Tullio Serafin in Italian operas with the Santa Cecilia Academy Chorus and Orchestra, Sutherland in the repertoire, and the Vienna Philharmonic in operatic and purely orchestral works with Herbert von Karajan and in a Beethoven cycle conducted by Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt. Luciano Pavarotti made his first recordings in 1964. Legge&#x27;s Philharmonia became the self-governing New Philharmonia in the same year, and made more than 70 Decca recordings, with conductors including Benjamin Britten, Stokowski, Carlo Maria Giulini and Claudio Abbado. Britten, both as pianist and conductor, maintained a long association with Decca, recording most of his major works as well as those of other composers. Culshaw left the company in 1967 to become head of music for BBC television, but Decca had a team of experienced producers to replace him, including Erik Smith, Christopher Raeburn and James Mallinson.

In 1962, MCA completed its acquisition of Decca Records Inc. with American Decca stock exchanged for MCA stock to American Decca stockholders.

In popular music British Decca missed some opportunities in the 1960s, including blocking the release of Ray Peterson&#x27;s &quot;Tell Laura I Love Her&quot; in 1960, and rejecting the Beatles in 1962. According to legend the Decca executive Dick Rowe told the group&#x27;s manager, &quot;Guitar groups are on the way out&quot;, but in fact the Beatles auditioned for Rowe&#x27;s assistant, Mike Smith, who – as his opposite numbers at HMV and Columbia had already done – turned the group down. The Beatles were later taken up by George Martin of the small Parlophone branch of EMI. Decca did not repeat the mistake with the Rolling Stones, whom the company signed up in 1963. In 1966 Decca set up a &quot;progressive&quot; subsidiary, Deram Records, which became home to bands like the Moody Blues, whose &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; became one of the best-selling albums of its time. Others recording for Deram in the 1960s were Amen Corner, Chicken Shack and Ten Years After. Decca lost an important source of American recordings when Atlantic Records switched British distribution to Polydor Records in 1966 so that Atlantic could gain access to a greater number of British artists.

In 1966, The American entity Decca Records Inc was dissolved and from that point on, Decca Records was a division of MCA Inc.

In 1968, American Decca parent MCA founded MCA Records in the UK which took over the handling of American Decca material as well as MCA&#x27;s sister labels Kapp Records and Uni Records.

===1970s===
In 1970, American Decca&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary the Compo Company was reorganized into MCA Records (Canada).

British Decca&#x27;s fortunes declined during the 1970s. Lewis and his principal associate Maurice Rosengarten were growing old and less interested in new talent. Culshaw cited as an example Rosengarten&#x27;s opposition in the previous decade to the signing of Pavarotti because it might upset the ageing tenor Mario del Monaco, who had been recording for British Decca since 1952. The producer Hugh Mendl had attempted at the end of the 1960s to convince Lewis that the company needed some modernisation of its structure and practices, but Lewis thought Mendl&#x27;s ideas revolutionary and nothing was done.

Despite what Culshaw dubbed the hardening of British Decca&#x27;s arteries, on the classical side the company launched two new labels in 1974. James Mallinson&#x27;s &quot;Headline&quot; series was devoted to contemporary music and during the rest of the 1970s issued recordings of works by, among others, Berio, Birtwistle, Cage, Henze, Ligeti, Maxwell Davies, Takemitsu and Xenakis. The &quot;Florilegium&quot; label was dedicated to early music, in competition with Archiv and Das Alte Werk. The company continued to lead the field in recording technology. In the US and Europe companies had been experimenting with digital recording for some years. In the US the small company Telarc made the first commercial digital recordings in 1978. In the same year Decca developed its own digital recorders for recording, mixing, editing, and mastering albums. The company&#x27;s first digital recording was made in Vienna in December 1978: the Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Christoph von Dohnányi in Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; Symphony. During 1979 the new system was used in Tel Aviv from March, the US from April, London from June, and Geneva from December. It superseded analogue in the US by late 1979 and elsewhere by mid-1981. In May 1979 Decca made the world&#x27;s first digital recording of an opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, conducted by Solti with his Chicago forces.

In the 1970s British Decca&#x27;s popular catalogue had fewer substantial additions than previously. The Rolling Stones left to set up their own label in 1971 and the Moody Blues were the only international rock act that continued to record for Decca. Among the company&#x27;s major commercial successes of the decade was Dana&#x27;s two-million selling single, &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, issued on British Decca&#x27;s subsidiary label Rex Records. New recordings by artists familiar from the previous decade, including the Bachelors, Val Doonican, and Engelbert Humperdinck, continued to sell well.

In his memoirs Culshaw wrote of &quot;an era of decline&quot;, and lamented the missed opportunities of Lewis&#x27;s later years, when his entrepreneurial flair and his instincts for the market had been overtaken by a cautious conservatism. In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Peter Martland writes of Lewis: &quot;Like many who create, build, and retain close personal control over large enterprises, Lewis was unable to appoint a successor or relinquish control of the business. As a consequence, in 1980, days before his death, the business, then in the grip of a serious financial crisis, was sold&quot;. Decca was bought by the German-Dutch conglomerate PolyGram. The Decca pressing plant in New Malden, the studios in West Hampstead and Decca&#x27;s headquarters in central London were all closed down.

In 1971, MCA established MCA Records in the United States, combining American Decca, Kapp and Uni Records with the three labels maintaining their identities. American Decca also shut down its classical music department in 1971.

In 1973, MCA Records consolidated its three American labels, Decca, Kapp and Uni and were absorbed into the MCA label. They hired veteran US Decca producer Milt Gabler to supervise the reissue of albums originally issued on the three labels on the MCA label.

===1980 onwards===

After being absorbed by PolyGram, British Decca continued as a separate label. It concentrated chiefly on the classical and crossover repertoires. During the 1980s there was some activity in popular music, with hits from Bananarama, Bronski Beat, the Communards and Fine Young Cannibals, but as a classical label British Decca was a stronger presence, making numerous records with Solti in Chicago, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Dutoit, the Cleveland Orchestra with Riccardo Chailly, Dohnányi, and a long-time British Decca artist Vladimir Ashkenazy, and soloists including Kiri Te Kanawa, Renée Fleming, Pascal Rogé, Joshua Bell, Cecilia Bartoli and Jean-Yves Thibaudet. Among Decca&#x27;s later classical signings are the cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the pianist Benjamin Grosvenor.

British Decca&#x27;s prominence in the crossover repertoire dates from 1990 when Pavarotti&#x27;s recording of the aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; from &quot;Turandot&quot; was used by the BBC to introduce its coverage of the FIFA World Cup. When Decca&#x27;s recording of the tournament&#x27;s opening concert performance by Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo and José Carreras was released, it became the biggest-selling classical album of all time. The three tenors&#x27; record paved the way for Decca&#x27;s crossover artists such as Russell Watson, Andrea Bocelli, Katherine Jenkins and Alfie Boe.

In 1994, MCA Nashville revived the Decca label as a country music label.

Both British Decca and American Decca have come under the proprietorship of a single owner. PolyGram, which bought British Decca in 1980, and MCA, which bought American Decca twenty years earlier, were acquired by the Universal Music Group in 1998. The consolidation combining both American and British Decca under one parent company led to the shutdown of the Decca country music label in the USA and the London Records classical music arm renamed Decca Records in North America in February 1999. The catalogue of Philips Records, also owned by Universal, has been merged with British Decca&#x27;s. Universal also owns Deutsche Grammophon, which remains a separate label within the group and also manages the American Decca classical music catalogue. In 2011 Universal donated 200,000 of its American Decca master recordings from the 1920s to the 1940s to the United States Library of Congress.

In 2017, Universal Music revived the Decca Gold American classical music label under the management of the Verve Label Group.

<text>EMI Group Limited (formerly EMI Group plc until 2007; originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries, also referred to as EMI Records or simply EMI) was a British transnational conglomerate founded in March 1931 in London. At the time of its acquisition by Universal Music in 2012, it was the fourth largest business group and record label conglomerate in the music industry, and was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; record companies (now the &quot;Big Three&quot;). Its labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records, and Capitol Records, which are now referenced under Universal Music due to their acquisition with the exception of Parlophone, as it is now owned by Warner Music.

EMI was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was also once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but faced financial problems and US$4 billion in debt, leading to its acquisition by Citigroup in February 2011. Citigroup&#x27;s ownership was temporary, as EMI announced in November 2011 that it would sell its music arm to Vivendi&#x27;s Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion and its publishing business to a Sony/ATV consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium include the estate of Michael Jackson, the Blackstone Group, and the Abu Dhabi–owned Mubadala Development Company. EMI&#x27;s locations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada were all disassembled to repay debt, but the primary head office located outside those countries is still functional.

EMI Music Publishing is now owned by Sony Music Publishing, the music publishing division of Sony Music which bought another 70% stake in EMI Music Publishing.

== History ==

Electric and Musical Industries Ltd was formed in March 1931 by the merger of the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company, with its &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; record label, firms that have a history extending back to the origins of recorded sound. The new vertically integrated company produced sound recordings as well as recording and playback equipment.

The company&#x27;s gramophone manufacturing led to 40 years of success with larger-scale electronics and electrical engineering.

In October 1979, EMI merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to create Thorn EMI.

On 16 August 1996, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerging Thorn from EMI again: the company became EMI Group plc, and the electronics and rentals divisions were divested as Thorn plc.

The company broke up in 2012.

== Electronics research and development ==
===Television===
In 1934, an EMI research team led by Sir Isaac Shoenberg developed the electronic Marconi-EMI system for television broadcasting, which quickly replaced Baird&#x27;s electro-mechanical system following its introduction in 1936. After the Second World War, EMI resumed its involvement in making broadcasting equipment, notably providing the BBC&#x27;s second television transmitter at Sutton Coldfield. It also manufactured broadcast television cameras for British television production companies as well as for the BBC. The commercial television ITV companies also used them alongside cameras made by Pye and Marconi. Their best-remembered piece of broadcast television equipment was the EMI 2001 colour television camera, which became the mainstay of much of the British television industry from the end of the 1960s until the early 1990s. Exports of this piece of equipment were low, however, and EMI left this area of product manufacture.

=== Blumlein and radar ===
EMI engineer Alan Blumlein received a patent for the invention of stereophonic sound in 1931. He was killed in 1942 whilst conducting flight trials on an experimental H2S radar set.

During and after World War II, the EMI Laboratories in Hayes, Hillingdon developed radar equipment (including the receiver section of the British Army&#x27;s GL-II anti-aircraft fire-control radar), microwave devices such as the reflex klystron oscillator (having played a crucial role in the development of early production types following on from the British Admiralty Signal School&#x27;s pioneering NR89, the so-called &quot;Sutton tube&quot;), electro-optic devices such as infra-red image converters, and eventually guided missiles employing analogue computers.

===Photomultipliers===
The company was also for many years an internationally respected manufacturer of photomultipliers. This part of the business was transferred to Thorn as part of Thorn-EMI, then later became the independent concern Electron Tubes Ltd.

===Computers and CT scanner===
The EMI Electronic Business Machine, a valve and magnetic drum memory computer, was built in the 1950s to process the British Motor Corporation payroll.

In 1958, the EMIDEC 1100, the UK&#x27;s first commercially available all-transistor computer, was developed at EMI&#x27;s Central Research Laboratories in Hayes under the leadership of Godfrey Hounsfield, an electrical engineer at EMI.

In the early 1970s, with financial support by the UK Department of Health and Social Security as well as EMI research investment, Hounsfield developed the first CT scanner, a device which revolutionised medical imaging. In 1973, EMI was awarded a prestigious Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Innovation for what was then called the &quot;EMI scanner&quot;; in 1979, Hounsfield won the Nobel Prize for his accomplishment.

After brief, but brilliant, success in the medical imaging field, EMI&#x27;s manufacturing activities were sold off to other companies, notably Thorn (see Thorn EMI). Subsequently, development and manufacturing activities were sold off to other companies and work moved to other towns such as Crawley and Wells.

===Emihus===
Emihus Electronics, based in Glenrothes, Scotland, was owned 51% by Hughes Aircraft, of California, US, and 49% by EMI. It manufactured integrated circuits, electrolytic capacitors and, for a short period in the mid-1970s, hand-held calculators under the Gemini name.

== Music ==
Early in its life, the Gramophone Company established its subsidiary operations and branch offices in a number of many other countries inside and outside of the British Commonwealth, including Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as in Canada, Russia, India, China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Gramophone&#x27;s (later EMI&#x27;s) Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries dominated the popular music industries in those countries across the Asia-Pacific region from the 1920s until the 1960s, when other locally owned labels (such as Festival Records) began to challenge the near monopoly of EMI. Over 150,000 78-rpm recordings from around the world are held in EMI&#x27;s temperature-controlled archive in Hayes, some of which have been released on CD since 2008 by Honest Jon&#x27;s Records.

In 1931, the year the company was formed, it opened the legendary recording studios at London&#x27;s Abbey Road. During the 1930s and 1940s, its roster of artists included Arturo Toscanini, Sir Edward Elgar, and Otto Klemperer, among many others. During this time EMI appointed its first A&amp;R managers. These included George Martin, who later brought the Beatles into the EMI fold.

When the Gramophone Company merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company (including Columbia&#x27;s subsidiary label Parlophone) in 1931, the new Anglo-American group was incorporated as Electric &amp; Musical Industries Limited. At this point, the Radio Corporation of America had a majority shareholding in the new company due to RCA purchasing the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929. Victor owned 50% of the British affiliated Gramophone Company, giving RCA chairman David Sarnoff a seat on the EMI board.

However, EMI was subsequently forced to sell Columbia USA due to anti-trust action taken by its American competitors. By this time the record industry had been hit hard by the Depression and in 1934 a much-diminished Columbia USA was purchased for just US$70,500 by ARC-BRC (American Record Corporation–Brunswick Record Company), which also acquired the OKeh label.

RCA sold its stake in EMI in 1935, but due to its 1929 takeover of Victor, RCA retained the North and South American rights to the &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark.

In 1938, ARC-Brunswick was taken over by CBS, which then sold the American Brunswick label to American Decca Records, which along with its other properties, Vocalion Records and Aeolian Vocalion Records, used it as a subsidiary budget label afterward. CBS then operated Columbia as its flagship label in both the United States and Canada.

EMI retained the rights to the Columbia name in most other territories including the UK, Australia and New Zealand. It continued to operate the label with moderate success until 1973, when it was retired and replaced by the EMI Records imprint, making records with the Columbia Records label manufactured outside North America between 1972 and 1992 rare.

In 1990, following a series of major takeovers that saw CBS Records acquired by the Sony Corporation of Japan, EMI sold its remaining rights to the Columbia name to Sony and the label is now operated exclusively throughout the world by Sony Music Entertainment; the exception being Japan, where the trade mark is owned by Columbia Music Entertainment.

EMI released its first LPs in 1952 and its first stereophonic recordings in 1955 (first on reel-to-reel tape and then LPs, beginning in 1958). In 1957, to replace the loss of its long-established licensing arrangements with RCA Victor and Columbia Records (Columbia USA cut its ties with EMI in 1951), EMI entered the American market by acquiring 96% of the stock for Capitol Records USA.

From 1960 to 1995, their &quot;EMI House&quot; corporate headquarters was located at 20 Manchester Square London, England, the stairwell from which was featured on the cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Please Please Me&quot; album. In addition, an unused shot from the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; photo session, featuring the boys in short hair and cleancut attire, was used for the cover of the Beatles&#x27; first double-disc greatest-hits compilation entitled &quot;1962–1966&quot; (also known as &quot;The Red Album&quot;). In 1969, Angus McBean took a matching group photograph featuring the boys in long hair and beards to contrast with the earlier cleancut image to show that the boys could have appeal across a wide range of audiences. This photo was originally intended for the &quot;Get Back&quot; album which later was entitled &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The photo was used instead for the cover of the Beatles&#x27; second greatest-hits double-disc compilation entitled &quot;1967–1970&quot; (also known as &quot;The Blue Album&quot;). (The two compilations were released in 1973.)

EMI&#x27;s classical artists of the period were largely limited to the prestigious British and European orchestras, such as the Philharmonia Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra as well as the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. During the era of the long-playing record (LP), very few American and Canadian orchestras had their principal recording contracts with EMI, one notable exception being that of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, especially during the tenure of William Steinberg.

From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, the company enjoyed huge success in the popular music field under the management of Sir Joseph Lockwood. The strong combination of EMI and its subsidiary labels (including Parlophone, His Master&#x27;s Voice, Columbia and Capitol Records) along with a roster of stellar groups such as the Hollies, the Shadows, the Beach Boys and the Beatles
along with hit solo performers such as Frank Sinatra, Cliff Richard, and Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole, made EMI the best-known and most successful recording company in the world at that time.

In 1967, while shifting their focus on pop and rock music roster to Columbia and Parlophone, EMI converted HMV solely to a classical music label exclusively. For the emerging progressive rock genre including Pink Floyd, who had debuted on Columbia, EMI established a new subsidiary label, Harvest Records, two years later.
In 1971, Electric &amp; Musical Industries changed its name to EMI Ltd. and on 1 January 1973 EMI phased out most of its heritage labels and replacing them with the EMI imprint. On 1 July 1973 the Gramophone Company subsidiary (The Gramophone Co. Ltd.) was renamed EMI Records Ltd as well, and in 1978, EMI launched EMI America Records as its second label in the United States after Capitol. EMI Music Worldwide was also formed in 1978 with Bhaskar Menon as chairman and CEO. In February 1979, EMI Ltd acquired United Artists Records and with it their subsidiary labels Liberty Records and Imperial Records. Eight months later, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI Ltd. to form Thorn EMI.

Sometime in the late 1980s, EMI America merged with sister label Manhattan Records, founded in 1984, becoming EMI Manhattan and eventually EMI USA when Capitol absorbed it in 1989.

Also in 1989, Thorn EMI bought a 50% interest in Chrysalis Records, completing the buyout two years later. Six months after completing the buyout of Chrysalis, Thorn EMI bought Virgin Records from Richard Branson in one of its highest-profile and most expensive acquisitions in record music history. In 1992, Thorn EMI entered the Christian music market by acquiring Sparrow Records.

===Aftermath of demerger from Thorn===
Due to the increasing divergence of business models, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerger proposals on 16 August 1996. The resulting media company was now known as EMI Group PLC. In 1997, EMI Records USA was folded into both Virgin and Capitol.

Since the 1930s, the Pathé Records label headquartered in Shanghai, China had been published under the EMI banner and since then, EMI had also been the dominant label in the cantopop market throughout Greater China until the genre&#x27;s decline in the mid-1980s. Between the years 2004–2006, EMI then completely and totally divested itself from the c-pop market, and after that, all Hong Kong music artists previously associated with EMI had their music published by Gold Label, a concern unaffiliated with EMI and with which EMI did not yet hold any interest.

On 21 November 2000, Streamwaves and EMI signed a deal licensing EMI&#x27;s catalogue in a digital format for their online streaming music service. This was the first time EMI had licensed any of its catalogue to a streaming music website.

Pop star Robbie Williams signed a six-album deal in 2002 paying him over £80 million ($157 million), which was not only the biggest recording contract in British music history at the time, but also the second biggest in music history behind that of Michael Jackson.

Apple Records, the record label representing The Beatles, launched a suit against EMI for non-payment of royalties on 15 December 2005. The suit alleged that EMI had withheld $50 million from the record label; however, an EMI spokesman noted that audits of record label accounts are not that unusual, confirming at least two hundred such audits performed on the label, but that these audits rarely result in legal action. A legal settlement was announced on 12 April 2007 and terms were undisclosed.

On 2 April 2007, EMI announced it would be releasing its music in DRM-free formats. These were to be issued in AAC format, which gave higher quality for the same bitrate compared with the ubiquitous MP3 format. The music would be distributed via Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store (under the iTunes Plus category).

Tracks were to cost $1.29/€1.29/£0.99. Legacy tracks with FairPlay DRM would still be available for $0.99/€0.99/£0.79 – albeit with lower quality sound and DRM restrictions still in place. Users would be able to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; the EMI tracks that they had already bought for $0.30/€0.30/£0.20. Albums were also to be available at the same price as their lower quality, DRM counterparts and music videos from EMI would also be DRM-free. The higher-quality, DRM-free files became available worldwide on iTunes on 30 May 2007, and were expected to appear on other music download services soon thereafter.

Following this decision, Universal Music Group also announced sales of DRM-free music (which was described as an experiment).

In May 2006, EMI attempted to buy Warner Music Group, which would have reduced the world&#x27;s four largest record companies (Big Four) to three; however, the bid was rejected. Warner Music Group launched a Pac-Man defense, offering to buy EMI. EMI rejected the $4.6 billion offer.

=== Terra Firma takeover ===
After a decline in the British market share from 16% to 9%, and the announcement that it had sustained a loss of £260 million in 2006/2007, in August 2007 EMI was acquired by Terra Firma Capital Partners for £4.2 billion. Following the transition, several artists including Radiohead left EMI, while other artists such as Paul McCartney had left ahead of the takeover. At the same time, the Rolling Stones signed a one-album deal with Interscope Records/Universal Music Group outside its contract with EMI, which expired in February 2008, and then in July 2008 signed a new long-term deal with Universal Music Group. The Terra Firma takeover was also reported to have been the catalyst behind a lawsuit filed by Pink Floyd over unpaid royalties. In January 2011 Pink Floyd signed a new global agreement with EMI.

Around the same time, Guy Hands, CEO of Terra Firma Capital Partners, came to EMI with restructuring plans to cut between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs and to reduce costs by £200 million a year. As a result, the UK chief executive Tony Wadsworth left EMI after 25 years in January 2008. The cuts were planned to take effect over the year 2008, and would affect up to a third of EMI&#x27;s 5,500 staff. Thirty Seconds to Mars tried to exit their contract with EMI following the layoff of its staff and due to unpaid royalties, prompting the label to file a lawsuit for $30 million citing breach of contract. The suit was later settled following a defence based on a contract case involving actress Olivia de Havilland decades before. Jared Leto explained, &quot;The California Appeals Court ruled that no service contract in California is valid after seven years, and it became known as the De Havilland Law after she used it to get out of her contract with Warner Bros.&quot; Many industry watchers viewed the suit as a punitive harassment meant to scare other musicians. The band&#x27;s troubles with the label resonate through their third studio album &quot;This Is War&quot; (2009) and were the subject of the 2012 documentary &quot;Artifact&quot;.

In 2008, EMI withdrew from the South-East Asian market entirely, forcing its large roster of acts to search out contracts with other unaffiliated labels. As a result, the South-East Asian market was the only region in the world where EMI was not in operation, although the record label continued to operate in Hong Kong and Indonesia (which was named Arka Music Indonesia). The Chinese and Taiwanese operation of EMI as well as the Hong Kong branch of Gold Label, was sold to Typhoon Group and reformed as Gold Typhoon. The Philippine branch of EMI changed its name to PolyEast Records, and was a joint venture between EMI itself and Pied Piper Records Corporation. The physical audio and video products of the label have been distributed in South-East Asia by Warner Music Group since December 2008, while new EMI releases in China and Taiwan, were distributed under Gold Typhoon which was previously known as EMI Music China and EMI Music Taiwan, respectively. Meanwhile, the Korean branch of EMI (known as EMI Korea Limited) had its physical releases distributed by Warner Music Korea. EMI Music Japan, the Japanese EMI branch, remains unchanged from the reflection of Toshiba&#x27;s divestiture to the business by EMI buying the whole branch way back July 2007, making it a full subsidiary.

In July 2009, there were reports that EMI would not sell CDs to independent album retailers in a bid to cut costs, but in fact only a handful of small physical retailers were affected.

=== Citigroup ownership ===
In February 2010, EMI Group reported pre-tax losses of £1.75 billion for the year ended March 2009, including write-downs on the value of its music catalogue.
In addition, KPMG issued a going concern warning on the holding company&#x27;s accounts regarding an ability to remain solvent.

Citigroup (which held $4 billion in debt) took 100% ownership of EMI Group from Terra Firma Capital Partners on 1 February 2011, writing off £2.2 billion of debt and reducing EMI&#x27;s debt load by 65%. The group was put up for sale and final bids were due by 5 October 2011.

=== Sony/Universal/Warner sale ===
On 12 November 2011, it was announced that EMI would sell its recorded music operations to Universal Music Group (UMG) for £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) and its music publishing operations to Sony/ATV Music Publishing-for $2.2 billion. Among the other companies that had competed for the recorded music business was Warner Music Group which was reported to have made a $2 billion bid. However, IMPALA has said that it would fight the merger. In March 2012, the European Union opened an investigation into Universal&#x27;s purchase of EMI&#x27;s recorded music division and had asked rivals and consumer groups whether the deal will result in higher prices and shut out competitors.

On 21 September 2012, the sale of EMI to UMG was approved in both Europe and the United States by the European Commission and the Federal Trade Commission respectively. The European Commission approved the deal, however, under the condition that the merged company divest itself of one third of its total operations to other companies with a proven track record in the music industry. To comply with this condition, UMG divested V2 Records, Parlophone Records, Sanctuary Records, Chrysalis Records, Mute Records, EMI Classics, Virgin Classics, the 2CD Originals Series and EMI&#x27;s regional labels in most of Europe. These labels were operated separately under the name &quot;Parlophone Label Group&quot;, pending their sale. Universal would, however, retain its ownership of the Beatles&#x27; library (moved to the newly formed Calderstone Productions) and Robbie Williams&#x27; Chrysalis recordings (moved to the Island Records label).

Universal Music Group completed its acquisition of EMI on 28 September 2012, followed by worldwide compliance and complete rebranding by 1 April 2013. In compliance with the conditions of the European Commission, on 22 December, Universal Music Group sold the Mute catalogue, previously property of EMI, to German-based music rights company BMG. On 8 February 2013, Warner Music Group signed an agreement to acquire Parlophone, Chrysalis Records, EMI Classics, Virgin Classics, the 2CD Originals Series and some of EMI&#x27;s regional labels across Europe for US$765 million (£487 million). Regulatory approval was received on 15 May. Universal retained EMI&#x27;s former European labels in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and Finland.

Universal Music has continued to operate EMI entities it retained using the EMI name and formed Virgin EMI Records as a UMG label unit in the UK. The former EMI Records Ltd. was renamed Parlophone Records Ltd. in 2013, when Warner Music Group acquired Parlophone Music Group which has the rights to the old EMI Records catalogue.

The Australian and New Zealand EMI Columbia catalogues, including recordings by John Farnham, who went by Johnny during his time with the label, were ceded to Universal Music Australia&#x27;s imprint EMI Recorded Music and Universal Music New Zealand respectively.

Warner Music incorporated EMI Classics and Virgin Classics into its Warner Classics unit with the EMI Classics artist roster and catalogue absorbed into the Warner Classics label and the Virgin Classics artist roster and catalogue absorbed into the revived Erato Records label.

On 14 November 2013, EMI&#x27;s Middle Eastern branch was folded into Universal Music, causing the distribution of Warner Music Group&#x27;s releases in that region to be moved to Universal Music.

On 30 June 2014, Universal Music Group re-established EMI&#x27;s Taiwanese division, with A-Mei, Rainie Yang and Show Lo signing first to the label.

In May 2016, an independent company, Blue Raincoat Music, bought most of Chrysalis&#x27;s British catalogue from Warner Music, making Chrysalis an independent label again. However, the remainder of Chrysalis&#x27;s British catalogue, namely other past artists Spandau Ballet, Jethro Tull, the Ramones and The Proclaimers, stayed with Parlophone in the UK and (excluding Ramones) Rhino Entertainment in the United States. The Ramones American back catalogue remained with Island&#x27;s sister label Geffen Records, the successor of MCA Records, which previously distributed the band&#x27;s releases on Radioactive Records, and is licensed to Universal Music Enterprises. Additionally, the majority of Chrysalis&#x27;s American catalogue also remained with Capitol Music Group, parent of Island&#x27;s and Geffen&#x27;s sister label Capitol Records, and is currently distributed by that label. Debbie Harry&#x27;s only Chrysalis album with an American release, &quot;KooKoo&quot;, was later divested by Capitol. The European Chrysalis catalogue, including Harry&#x27;s four albums, plus the rights to ten artists not originally signed to the label are owned and distributed by Blue Raincoat.

The number of initial non-Chrysalis artists was later increased to 11 after adding former EMI artists Naked Eyes. Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s only Chrysalis album, &quot;A Woman &amp; a Man&quot;, had its distribution and rights outside the US reverted to CMG&#x27;s Virgin Records, Carlisle&#x27;s former label which was the second in her career.

Also in May 2016, the history of the record label was examined in the hour-long BBC documentary &quot;EMI: The Inside Story&quot;.

On 16 June 2020, Universal rebranded Virgin EMI as EMI Records, reopening the iconic label, and named Rebecca Allen, former president of Decca Records, as the new EMI&#x27;s president. UMG has continued to operate Virgin as an imprint of EMI.

==Operations==
===Entertainment and Leisure===
In 1964, EMI acquired Blackpool Tower from the Bickerstaffe family. In 1967, they also took over the Winter Gardens complex in Blackpool.

In 1967, EMI acquired the Grade Organisation, the UK&#x27;s largest showbusiness talent agency, for £7.5 million. This also included the recently acquired Shipman and King chain of 32 cinemas in the Home Counties.

==== Film, Theatre and Television ====

EMI Films was created in 1969 following the acquisition of Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC). At the time ABPC owned 270 ABC Cinemas; a half share (under the Associated British Corporation name) in the ITV contractor Thames Television; Elstree Studios at Shenley Road, and had recently bought Anglo-Amalgamated, a film studio. Bernard Delfont of the Grade Organisation became chairman and Chief Executive. In 1970, Delfont sold his own Bernard Delfont Organisation to EMI and the agencies were divested. He later became Chief Executive of EMI in 1979.

Their flagship cinema was the ABC 1 and 2 Shaftesbury Avenue which was built at the old Saville Theatre in London.

In 1974, the Film &amp; Theatre Corporation was split into EMI Cinemas and EMI Leisure Enterprises. On formation, EMI Cinemas ran 272 cinemas in the UK, including those of ABC.

Following EMI&#x27;s merger with Thorn Electrical Industries in 1979, EMI&#x27;s film division was renamed Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. In April 1986, Thorn EMI sold its film production and distribution arm (Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment), home video (Thorn EMI Video), and cinema (ABC Cinemas) operations to businessman Alan Bond. Bond, in turn, sold it to The Cannon Group a week later.

====EMI Leisure====
EMI Leisure Enterprises was formed in April 1974 and controlled Blackpool Tower; EMI&#x27;s 16 squash clubs and five bowling alleys; discotheques; 23 licensed premises and other amusement interests. It began developing new leisure businesses, including Brighton Marina and golf activities with the opening of Aldenham Golf Club. In April 1977 they acquired the Empire Ballroom and Cinema in Leicester Square in London and in September 1977 acquired Bailey Leisure Services Limited which they renamed EMI Dancing which provided the group with dance halls, cabaret clubs and discotheques around the UK. By the late 1970s, the leisure business contributed 15% of group revenues. In 1978, EMI acquired the Prince Edward Theatre. It also owned two other theatres in London as well as theatres in the rest of the UK.

Following the merger with Thorn, part of EMI&#x27;s leisure interests were sold to Trust House Forte in November 1980 for £16 million. Lord Delfont became chairman and chief executive of THF&#x27;s leisure division. EMI Social Centres chain of bingo halls remained with Thorn EMI.

The Winter Gardens in Blackpool were sold in 1983 to First Leisure.

====Hotels and restaurants====
In 1972, EMI Hotels won a bidding war against Ralston Purina to buy the Golden Egg group from the Kaye brothers for £14 million, which included a stake in Angus Steakhouse restaurants and the Selfridge Hotel, which opened in July 1973.

In June 1977, EMI acquired the Tower Hotel, London. At the end of 1978, they owned four other hotels: Royal Horseguards Hotel; Royal Angus; Royal Trafalgar; and Royal Westminster.

As well as Angus Steakhouse, their restaurants also included Wimpy Bars, Picnic Basket and Tennessee Pancake Houses.

Following the merger with Thorn, seven hotels and 12 Angus Steakhouse restaurants were sold in July 1980 for £23 million to Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries.

===EMI Music===

====Labels under the EMI banner====
====Past and present EMI musicians====
===EMI Music Publishing===

As well as the well-known record label the group also owned EMI Music Publishing, which was the largest music publisher in the world. EMI Music Publishing has won the &quot;Music Week&quot; Award for Publisher of the Year every year for over 10 years; in 2009, for the first time in history the award was shared jointly with Universal Music Publishing. As is often the case in the music industry, the publishing arm and record label are very separate businesses.

EMI administered the publishing rights of over 1.3 million songs, headlined by Queen, Carole King, The Police, the Motown catalog, Kanye West, Alicia Keys, Drake, Sia, P!nk, Pharrell Williams, and Calvin Harris.

EMI&#x27;s music publishing operations were sold to a consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2012; BMG acquired the music publishing libraries of Virgin Music (which EMI held) and Famous Music UK (which Sony/ATV held).

==Criticism==

=== CD price fixing ===

Between 1995 and 2000, music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as minimum advertised pricing to artificially inflate prices of compact discs in order to end price wars by discounters such as Best Buy and Target in the early 1990s.

A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI and Universal Music. In restitution for price fixing, they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups; however, they admitted no wrongdoing. It is estimated customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.

On Internet Freedom Day in January 2013, EMI evoked controversy after the removal of Martin Luther King Jr&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech from Vimeo due to a copyright violation.

<doc id="140625" wikidata="Q10990037" url="?curid=140625" title="Sylvester the Cat">
<text>Sylvester J. Pussycat Sr. is a fictional character, an anthropomorphic cat in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. Most of his appearances have him often chasing Tweety Bird, Speedy Gonzales, or Hippety Hopper. He appeared in 103 cartoons in the golden age of American animation, lagging only behind superstars Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and Daffy Duck. Three of his cartoons won Academy Awards, the most for any starring a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character: they are &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;, &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;, and &quot;Birds Anonymous&quot;.

==Animation history==
===Development===
Before Sylvester&#x27;s appearance in the cartoons, Blanc voiced a character named Sylvester on &quot;The Judy Canova Show&quot; using the voice that would eventually become associated with the cat.

==Personality and catchphrases==
Like Daffy, Sylvester is known for having a sloppy lisp. A common gag used for both Sylvester and Daffy is a tendency to go on a long rant, complaining about a subject and then ending it by saying &quot;Sakes&quot;.

He shows a different personality when paired with Porky Pig in explorations of spooky places, in which he does not speak, behaves as a scaredy-cat, and always seems to see the scary things Porky does not see and gets scolded by him for it every time.

For the most part, Sylvester has always played the antagonist role, but he&#x27;s sometimes featured playing the protagonist in a couple of cartoons while having to deal with the canine duo of Spike and Chester after being chased around. In 1952&#x27;s &quot;Tree for Two&quot; (directed by Friz Freleng), Sylvester is cornered in the back alley and this would result in Spike getting mauled by a black panther that had earlier escaped from a zoo without Spike and Chester knowing about it. In the 1954 film &quot;Dr. Jerkyl&#x27;s Hide&quot;, Sylvester pummels Spike (here called &quot;Alfie&quot;) thanks to a potion that transforms him into a feline monster. Both times after Spike&#x27;s ordeal, Sylvester would have the courage and confidence to confront Chester, only to be beaten up and tossed away by the little dog.

Perhaps Sylvester&#x27;s most developed role is in a series of Robert McKimson-directed shorts, in which the character is a hapless mouse-catching instructor to his dubious son, Sylvester Junior, with the &quot;mouse&quot; being a powerful baby kangaroo named Hippety Hopper which he constantly mistakes for a &quot;giant mouse&quot;. His alternately confident and bewildered episodes bring his son to shame, while Sylvester himself is reduced to nervous breakdowns.

Sylvester also had atypical roles in a few cartoons:

* &quot;Kitty Kornered&quot; (1946), a Bob Clampett cartoon in which a black-nosed, yellow-eyed Sylvester was teamed with three other cats to oust owner Porky Pig from his house.
* &quot;Doggone Cats&quot; (1947), an Arthur Davis cartoon where Sylvester is teamed up with an orange cat (later reused as Sylvester&#x27;s brother Alan in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;) to torment a dog named Wellington the Dog as he delivers a package to Uncle Louie.
* &quot;Catch as Cats Can&quot; (1947), another Davis cartoon that portrays Sylvester as a simple-minded cat with a dopey voice. While the cartoon essentially follows a cat-vs-canary plot, it takes a different approach as Sylvester is persuaded to eat the canary (caricatured as Frank Sinatra) by a green parrot (caricatured as Bing Crosby).
* &quot;Back Alley Oproar&quot; (1948), a Friz Freleng cartoon (actually a remake of the 1941 short &quot;Notes to You&quot;) wherein Sylvester pesters the sleep-deprived Elmer Fudd by performing several amazing musical numbers in the alley and even a sweet lullaby (&quot;go to sleep... go to sleep... close your big bloodshot eyes...&quot;) to temporarily ease Elmer back to the dream world, though &quot;very&quot; temporarily.
* &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; (1950), a Chuck Jones cartoon in which Sylvester plays the Basil Rathbone-like villain to Daffy Duck&#x27;s Errol Flynn-esque hero.
* &quot;Canned Feud&quot; (1951), another Freleng cartoon in which Sylvester tries to retrieve a can opener from a mouse out of fears he would starve to death. Unlike most cartoons, the mouse is portrayed as an instigator of the conflict or antagonist rather than Sylvester himself.
* &quot;Red Riding Hoodwinked&quot; (1955), another Freleng cartoon where Sylvester co-stars with an absent-minded Big Bad Wolf in which each not only tries to get their particular &quot;prey&quot; (Sylvester vs. Tweety and the Wolf vs. Little Red Riding Hood) but they both nearly come to blows with each other playing &quot;Grandma&quot;. (&quot;You&#x27;re musclin&#x27; in on my racket!&quot;)
*&quot;A Taste of Catnip&quot; (1966). a Robert McKimson cartoon that Sylvester cameos in. When Daffy Duck blows up a catnip factory in Mexico, Sylvester and other enraged cats beat up Daffy.

In the television series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, Sylvester appeared as the mentor of Furrball. He also starred in &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;. In the series, he plays the narrator at the beginning of episodes.

==Filmography==

The character debuted in Friz Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Life With Feathers&quot; (1945). Freleng&#x27;s 1947 cartoon &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; was the first pairing of Tweety Bird with Sylvester, and the Bob Clampett-directed &quot;Kitty Kornered&quot; (1946) was Sylvester&#x27;s first pairing with Porky Pig.

He also appears in a handful of cartoons with Elmer Fudd, such as a series of three cartoons underwritten by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation extolling the American economic system.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Sylvester appeared in various Warner Bros. television specials, and in the 1980s, he appeared in the feature-film compilations.

Sylvester has been &quot;killed&quot; more times than any other Warner Bros. cartoon character, having &quot;died&quot; in &quot;Peck Up Your Troubles&quot;, &quot;I Taw a Putty Tat&quot;, &quot;Back Alley Oproar&quot;, &quot;Mouse Mazurka&quot;, &quot;Bad Ol&#x27; Putty Tat&quot;, &quot;Tweet Tweet Tweety&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Tweet&quot;, &quot;Cats a-Weigh&quot;, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Waitin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Muzzle Tough&quot;, &quot;Sandy Claws&quot;, &quot;Tweety&#x27;s Circus&quot;, &quot;Too Hop To Handle&quot;, &quot;Tree Cornered Tweety&quot;, &quot;Tweet and Lovely&quot;, &quot;Trick or Tweet&quot; (along with Sam Cat), &quot;The Wild Chase&quot; (along with Wile E. Coyote), &quot;Museum Scream&quot;, and the Looney Tunes Cartoons episodes &quot;Fully Vetted&quot; and &quot;Boo! Appetweet&quot;. He was even cast in the role of the Jacob Marley-like ghost called Sylvester the Investor in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas.&quot;

Sylvester serves as the titular character in &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, under the ownership of Granny and again having desires of eating Tweety and being tharwted by Butch. He helps solves mysteries and defeats the culprits in the end. In the finale of the series, he abandons his desire of eating Tweety following a dream and express his love for the bird.

A baby version of Sylvester is part of the title cast of characters in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, voiced by Terry Klassen.

Sylvester is featured in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011–14), voiced by Jeff Bergman. He is shown living with Granny alongside Tweety. In &quot;Point, Laser Point&quot;, it is revealed that Sylvester was attracted by a glowing red dot that was on his mother&#x27;s necklace when he was young as experienced through hypnotic therapy done by Witch Lezah. It was also revealed that his mother (voiced by Estelle Harris) has retired to Florida. When Sylvester visits her, she reveals she&#x27;s disappointed that Sylvester isn&#x27;t married, doesn&#x27;t have kids, never kept wearing his retainer, never remembered where she lives in Florida, and has not caught Tweety yet. This episode also introduced Sylvester&#x27;s brother Alan (voiced by Jeff Bennett) who became more successful than Sylvester.

Sylvester also makes recurring appearances in both &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;. Jeff Bergman reprises his role for both.

Sylvester appeared in &quot;King Tweety&quot;. He was voiced by Eric Bauza, who also voiced him in &quot;Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem&quot;.

Sylvester appears in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; as one of the citizens/builders helpings Bugs and friends with building. In this series, he is more of being friends with Tweety and even lives with him.

===Cameo appearances===
Sylvester makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, where he provides the punchline for a double-entendre joke regarding Judge Doom&#x27;s (Christopher Lloyd) identity. This was Mel Blanc&#x27;s final time voicing him.

Sylvester appears as part of the Tune Squad team in &quot;Space Jam&quot;, voiced by Bill Farmer. He bears the number 9 on his jersey where the Tune Squad and Michael Jordan competed against the Monstars.

He also has two cameo appearances in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, but the second time, &quot;Sylvester&quot; is really Mr. Smith in disguise.

Sylvester appears in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Werewolf vs. Unicorn&quot;, voiced by Patrick Pinney. During Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s announcement of illegal aliens from Mexico, Sylvester demonstrates a wired fence that will keep the aliens out, only for it to be penetrated by Speedy Gonzales.

Sylvester makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales episode &quot;Kitty Cat Blues&quot; poster&quot;

Sylvester makes a vocal cameo appearance in the 2020 &quot;Animaniacs&quot; revival segment &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, with Jeff Bergman reprising his role.

Sylvester appears in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, voiced again by Jeff Bergman. He plays for the Tune Squad in their match against the Goon Squad. At one point before the second half, Sylvester thought he found Michael Jordan in the audience which he revealed to the Tune Squad only for LeBron James to find that he actually ran into Michael B. Jordan. This caused Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd to reprimand him for not noticing the difference as Sylvester thought he aged good.

Sylvester appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. He is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration.

==Other appearances==

From 1979 to 1983, Sylvester was the &quot;spokescat&quot; for 9 Lives&#x27; line of dry cat food. His face appeared on the product&#x27;s boxes and Sylvester was also featured in a series of television commercials. These ads usually consisted of Sylvester trying to get to his box of 9 Lives dry cat food while avoiding Hector the Bulldog. Sylvester would always succeed in luring the dog away so he could get to his food, but would always find himself a target again by the end of the commercial, which generally ended with Sylvester calling 9 Lives dry cat food &quot;worth riskin&#x27; your life for.&quot;

===In comic books===

Western Publications produced a comic book about Tweety and Sylvester entitled &quot;Tweety and Sylvester&quot;, first in Dell Comics &quot;Four Color&quot; series #406, 489, and 524, then in their own title from Dell Comics (#4–37, 1954–62), and later from Gold Key Comics (#1–102, 1963–72). In most of the earlier comic books, Sylvester has white fur surrounding his eyes (similar to Pepé Le Pew) and green eyes. They both disappeared in the later comic books. The green eyes could be seen in some merchandise as well.

Sylvester and Tweety appeared in a DC Comics and Looney Tunes crossover comic called &quot;Catwoman/Tweety and Sylvester&quot; #1. In the issue, witches from the DC and Looney Tunes universes placed a wager where the existence of all birds and cats (as well as all bird- and cat-themed heroes and villains) depended on if Sylvester could eat Tweety. Sylvester (designed more realistically for the DC Universe) teamed up with Catwoman, while Tweety teamed up with the Black Canary.

===In video games===
Sylvester has appeared in the video games &quot;Sylvester and Tweety in Cagey Capers&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Crazy Castle 3&quot;, &quot;Sylvester and Tweety: Breakfast on the Run&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports&quot;.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Sylvester&quot; is a play on &quot;Felis silvestris&quot;, the scientific name for the European wildcat (domestic cats like Sylvester are in the species &quot;Felis catus&quot;). Sylvester was not named until Chuck Jones gave him the name Sylvester, which was first used in &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;. Although the character was named Sylvester in later cartoon shorts (beginning with 1948&#x27;s &quot;Scaredy Cat&quot;), he was called &quot;Thomas&quot; in his first appearance with Tweety in &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;, most likely as a reference to a male cat being called a tom. However, this name would never be used again because MGM already had a cat named Thomas from &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. Mel Blanc had also voiced a human character named Sylvester on Judy Canova&#x27;s radio show earlier in the 1940s.

==Voice==
===Origin===
Sylvester&#x27;s trademark is his sloppy and yet stridulating lisp. In Mel Blanc&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;That&#x27;s Not All Folks!&quot;, Sylvester&#x27;s voice is similar to Daffy Duck&#x27;s, only not sped up in post-production, plus the even more exaggerated slobbery lisp. Conventional wisdom is that Daffy&#x27;s lisp, and hence also Sylvester&#x27;s, were based on the lisp of producer Leon Schlesinger. However, Blanc made no such claim. He said that Daffy&#x27;s lisp was based on him having a long beak and that he borrowed the voice for Sylvester. He also said that Sylvester&#x27;s voice was very much like his own, excluding the lisp (his son Noel Blanc has also confirmed this). In addition, director Bob Clampett, in a 1970 &quot;Funnyworld&quot; interview, agreed with Blanc&#x27;s account concerning Schlesinger. Greg Ford once asked Blanc what was the difference between Daffy and Sylvester&#x27;s voices. Blanc said to him that Daffy is a Jew and Sylvester is a Gentile.

<text>[[Oscar De La Hoya]] vs. [[Félix Trinidad]], billed as The Fight of the Millennium, was a boxing match held at the Mandalay Bay Events Center on the Las Vegas Strip on September 18, 1999, to unify the WBC and IBF welterweight championships.

After twelve tensely fought rounds, Trinidad was declared the winner by a majority decision.

==Background==
Planned by promoters Bob Arum and Don King, it pitted WBC world champion Oscar De La Hoya, a Mexican American, Los Angeles native, versus Puerto Rican IBF world champion Félix Trinidad. It was the last of the so-called &quot;superfights&quot; of the 20th century. 

==The fight==
After twelve tensely fought rounds, Trinidad was declared the winner by a majority decision.

De La Hoya and Trinidad were content to box from the outside most of the fight, with De La Hoya using his boxing skills and Trinidad looking for openings in De La Hoya&#x27;s guard. De La Hoya injured one of Trinidad&#x27;s eyes along the process, and he built a lead that he apparently felt, after nine rounds, secured him the win on points. In fact, at the time, he was leading, but only by 87–84 and 86–85 on two score cards while the third card was tied at 86–86. 

De La Hoya boxed in circles from rounds ten to twelve, while Trinidad upped his offensive output. This became a crucial matter because while De La Hoya backpedalled, Trinidad accumulated points on the scorecards and De La Hoya was given only one round by one of the three scoring judges the rest of the way. Trinidad out-punched De la Hoya by a margin of 64 to 33 during those three remaining rounds. 

Trinidad was afterwards declared winner by margins of 115–113 on one card and 115–114 on the second, the third one being a 114–114 draw, thus Trinidad winning by a 12 rounds majority decision.

==Aftermath==
The bout set the pay-per-view record for a non-heavyweight fight with 1.4 million ($70 million) buys on HBO and $12.9 million in ticket sales, until it was broken by De La Hoya-Mayweather on May 5, 2007. It set the record 2.4 million buys, the most in boxing history until that was surpassed by Mayweather-Pacquiao in 2015 with the record of 4.4 million buys.

In 2014, both boxers were inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="140627" wikidata="Q178397" url="?curid=140627" title="Apatite">
<text>Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals, usually hydroxyapatite, fluorapatite and chlorapatite, with high concentrations of OH−, F− and Cl− ion, respectively, in the crystal. The formula of the admixture of the three most common endmembers is written as Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl)2, and the crystal unit cell formulae of the individual minerals are written as Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, Ca10(PO4)6F2 and Ca10(PO4)6Cl2.

The mineral was named apatite by the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1786, although the specific mineral he had described was reclassified as fluorapatite in 1860 by the German mineralogist Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg. Apatite is often mistaken for other minerals. This tendency is reflected in the mineral&#x27;s name, which is derived from the Greek word ἀπατάω (apatáō), which means &quot;to deceive&quot;.

==Geology==
Apatite is very common as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks, where it is the most common phosphate mineral. However, occurrences are usually as small grains which are often visible only in thin section. Coarsely crystalline apatite is usually restricted to pegmatites, gneiss derived from sediments rich in carbonate minerals, skarns, or marble. Apatite is also found in clastic sedimentary rock as grains eroded out of the source rock. Phosphorite is a phosphate-rich sedimentary rock containing as much as 80% apatite, which is present as cryptocrystalline masses referred to as &quot;collophane&quot;. Economic quantities of apatite are also sometimes found in nepheline syenite or in carbonatites.

Apatite is the defining mineral for 5 on the Mohs scale. It can be distinguished in the field from beryl and tourmaline by its relative softness. It is often fluorescent under ultraviolet light.

Apatite is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. Hydroxyapatite, also known as hydroxylapatite, is the major component of tooth enamel and bone mineral. A relatively rare form of apatite in which most of the OH groups are absent and containing many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions is a large component of bone material.

Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite; in the mid-20th century, it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste typically contains a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate). Too much fluoride results in dental fluorosis and/or skeletal fluorosis.

Fission tracks in apatite are commonly used to determine the thermal histories of orogenic belts and of sediments in sedimentary basins. (U-Th)/He dating of apatite is also well established from noble gas diffusion studies for use in determining thermal histories and other, less typical applications such as paleo-wildfire dating.

==Uses==
The primary use of apatite is as a source of phosphate in the manufacture of fertilizer and in other industrial uses. It is occasionally used as a gemstone. Ground apatite was used as a pigment for the Terracotta Army of 3rd-century BCE China, and in Qing dynasty enamel for metalware.

During digestion of apatite with sulfuric acid to make phosphoric acid, hydrogen fluoride is produced as a byproduct from any fluorapatite content. This byproduct is a minor industrial source of hydrofluoric acid. Apatite is also occasionally a source of uranium and vanadium, present as trace elements in the mineral.

Fluoro-chloro apatite forms the basis of the now obsolete halophosphor fluorescent tube phosphor system. Dopant elements of manganese and antimony, at less than one mole-percent — in place of the calcium and phosphorus — impart the fluorescence, and adjustment of the fluorine-to-chlorine ratio alter the shade of white produced. This system has been almost entirely replaced by the tri-phosphor system.

Apatites are also a proposed host material for storage of nuclear waste, along with other phosphates.

===Gemology===

Apatite is infrequently used as a gemstone. Transparent stones of clean color have been faceted, and chatoyant specimens have been cabochon-cut. Chatoyant stones are known as &quot;cat&#x27;s-eye apatite&quot;, transparent green stones are known as &quot;asparagus stone&quot;, and blue stones have been called &quot;moroxite&quot;. If crystals of rutile have grown in the crystal of apatite, in the right light the cut stone displays a cat&#x27;s-eye effect. Major sources for gem apatite are Brazil, Myanmar, and Mexico. Other sources include Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United States.

=== Use as an ore mineral ===
Apatite is occasionally found to contain significant amounts of rare-earth elements and can be used as an ore for those metals. This is preferable to traditional rare-earth ores such as monazite, as apatite is not very radioactive and does not pose an environmental hazard in mine tailings.
However, apatite often contains uranium and its equally radioactive decay-chain nuclides.

The town of Apatity in the Arctic North of Russia was named for its mining operations for these ores.

Apatite is an ore mineral at the Hoidas Lake rare-earth project.

==Thermodynamics==
The standard enthalpies of formation in the crystalline state of hydroxyapatite, chlorapatite and a preliminary value for bromapatite, have been determined by reaction-solution calorimetry. Speculations on the existence of a possible fifth member of the calcium apatites family, iodoapatite, have been drawn from energetic considerations.

Structural and thermodynamic properties of crystal hexagonal calcium apatites, Ca10(PO4)6(X)2 (X= OH, F, Cl, Br), have been investigated using an all-atom Born-Huggins-Mayer potential by a molecular dynamics technique. The accuracy of the model at room temperature and atmospheric pressure was checked against crystal structural data, with maximum deviations of c. 4% for the haloapatites and 8% for hydroxyapatite. High-pressure simulation runs, in the range 0.5–75 kbar, were performed in order to estimate the isothermal compressibility coefficient of those compounds. The deformation of the compressed solids is always elastically anisotropic, with BrAp exhibiting a markedly different behavior from those displayed by HOAp and ClAp. High-pressure p-V data were fitted to the Parsafar-Mason equation of state with an accuracy better than 1%.

The monoclinic solid phases Ca10(PO4)6(X)2 (X= OH, Cl) and the molten hydroxyapatite compound have also been studied by molecular dynamics.

==Lunar science==
Moon rocks collected by astronauts during the Apollo program contain traces of apatite. Following new insights about the presence of water in the moon, re-analysis of these samples in 2010 revealed water trapped in the mineral as hydroxyl, leading to estimates of water on the lunar surface at a rate of at least 64 parts per billion100 times greater than previous estimatesand as high as 5 parts per million. If the minimum amount of mineral-locked water was hypothetically converted to liquid, it would cover the Moon&#x27;s surface in roughly one meter of water.

==Bio-leaching==
The ectomycorrhizal fungi &quot;Suillus granulatus&quot; and &quot;Paxillus involutus&quot; can release elements from apatite. Release of phosphate from apatite is one of the most important activities of mycorrhizal fungi, which increase phosphorus uptake in plants.

== Apatite group and supergroup ==
Apatite is the prototype of a class of chemically, stoichometrically or structurally similar minerals, biological materials, and synthetic chemicals. Those most similar to apatite are also known as apatites, such as lead apatite (pyromorphite) and barium apatite (alforsite). More chemically dissimilar minerals of the apatite supergroup include belovites, britholites, ellestadites and hedyphanes.

Apatites have been investigated for their potential use as pigments (copper-doped alkaline earth apatites), as phosphors and for absorbing and immobilising toxic heavy metals.

In apatite minerals strontium, barium and lead can be substituted for calcium; arsenate and vanadate for phosphate; and the final balancing anion can be fluoride (fluorapatites), chloride (chlorapatites), hydroxide (hydroxyapatites) or oxide (oxyapatites). Synthetic apatites add hypomanganate, hypochromate, bromide (bromoapatites), iodide (iodoapatites), sulfide (sulfoapatites), and selenide (selenoapatites). Evidence for natural sulfide substitution has been found in lunar rock samples.

Furthermore, compensating substitution of monovalent and trivalent cations for calcium, of dibasic and tetrabasic anions for phosphate, and of the balancing anion, can occur to a greater or lesser degree. For example, in biological apatites there is appreciable substitution of sodium for calcium and carbonate for phosphate, in belovite sodium and cerium or lanthanum substitute for a pair of divalent metal ions, in germanate-pyromorphite germanate replaces phosphate and chloride, and in ellestadites silicate and sulphate replace pairs of phosphate anions. Metals forming smaller divalent ions, such as magnesium and iron, cannot substitute extensively for the relatively large calcium ions but may be present in small quantities.

<text>In BDSM culture, a play party is a social event in which attendees socialize with like-minded people and engage in BDSM activities. Generally there is an area for drinking and socializing, an area for changing into more appropriate attire (such as fetishwear), and an area for &quot;play&quot; or sexually arousing activities. 

Organizers often provide certain large pieces of BDSM equipment to which people can be bound or restrained. Party goers usually bring their own whips, canes, restraints etc. In larger play parties, there are usually dungeon monitors who enforce party rules such as safe, sane and consensual and risk-aware consensual kink.

It is not mandatory to play at a party; instead, attendees are welcome to merely take the role of a voyeur. It is not acceptable, however, to touch anyone or their BDSM equipment or sex toys without permission or to interrupt a scene in any way. 

A play party can be a place for safer first date scenes. Often a &quot;Do Not Invite List&quot; is kept to keep out known persistent rule breakers.

In 2000, a play party in Attleboro, Massachusetts was invaded by police for alleged violations of assault and morality laws.

<text>Abbey Road Studios (formerly EMI Recording Studios) is a music recording studio at 3 Abbey Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, City of Westminster, London. It was established in November 1931 by the Gramophone Company, a predecessor of British music company EMI, which owned it until Universal Music Group (UMG) took control of part of it in 2013. It is ultimately owned by UMG subsidiary Virgin Records Limited.

The studio&#x27;s most notable client was the Beatles, who used the studio – particularly its Studio Two room – as the venue for many of the innovative recording techniques that they adopted throughout the 1960s. In 1976, the studio was renamed from &quot;EMI&quot; to &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

In 2009, Abbey Road came under threat of sale to property developers. In response, the British Government protected the site, granting it English Heritage Grade II listed status in 2010, thereby preserving the building from any major alterations.

==History==
===1920s–1940s===
Originally a nine-bedroom Georgian townhouse built in 1831 on the footpath leading to Kilburn Abbey, the building was later converted to flats where the best-known resident was Maundy Gregory, who was famous (or infamous) for selling political honours.

In 1929, the Gramophone Company acquired the premises. The property benefited from a large garden behind the townhouse, which permitted a much larger building to be constructed to the rear; thus, the Georgian façade belies the true dimension of the building. The architectural partnership Wallis, Gilbert and Partners was hired to convert the property into a recording studio, an unusual request at the time. Three purpose-built studios were constructed and the existing house was adapted for use as administration offices. Pathé filmed the opening of the studios in November 1931 when Edward Elgar conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in recording sessions of his music. In 1934, the inventor of stereo sound, Alan Blumlein, recorded Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter Symphony&quot; which was conducted by Thomas Beecham at the studios.

The neighbouring house is also owned by the studio and used to accommodate musicians. During the mid-20th century, the studio was extensively used by British conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent, whose house was located near the studio building.

The Gramophone Company merged with Columbia Graphophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) in 1931, and the studios later became known as EMI Recording Studios. In 1936 cellist Pablo Casals became the first to record Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Cello Suites No. 1 &amp; 2 at the command of EMI head Fred Gaisberg. The recordings went on to spur a revolution among Bach aficionados and cellists alike. &quot;Fats&quot; Waller played the Compton organ there.

Glenn Miller recorded at the Abbey Road studios during World War II, when he was based in the United Kingdom.

In 1931 an echo chamber was built in the studios, in the early days of artificial reverberation.

===1950s–1970s===
In 1958, Studio Two at EMI became a centre for rock and roll music when Cliff Richard and the Drifters (later Cliff Richard and the Shadows) recorded &quot;Move It&quot; there, and later pop music material.

EMI is closely associated with the Beatles, who recorded almost all of their albums and hits there between 1962 and 1970 using the four-track REDD mixing console designed by Peter K. Burkowitz. The Beatles named their 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Iain Macmillan took the album&#x27;s cover photograph outside the studios, with the result that the nearby zebra crossing has become a place of pilgrimage for Beatles fans. It has been a tradition for visitors to pay homage to the band by writing on the wall in front of the building even though it is painted over every three months. In December 2010, the zebra crossing at Abbey Road was given a Grade II listed status.

After becoming the studio&#x27;s general manager in 1974, Ken Townsend began a rebranding effort to capitalise on the studio&#x27;s connection with the Beatles. To emphasise the studio&#x27;s independence, Townsend commissioned the artist Alan Brown to design a unique logo, and in 1976 the facility officially changed names from &quot;EMI Studios&quot; to &quot;Abbey Road Studios&quot;. Having previously been mostly restricted to UK-based EMI acts, the studio&#x27;s name-change served the added purpose of encouraging non-EMI acts to record at the studio.

Notable producers and sound engineers who have worked at Abbey Road include Fred Gaisberg (who had first recorded Enrico Caruso in Milan in 1902, and had set up the first recording studio in London at Maiden Lane in 1898), Walter Legge, George Martin, Tutti Camarata, Geoff Emerick, Norman &quot;Hurricane&quot; Smith, Ken Scott, Mike Stone, Alan Parsons, Peter Vince, Malcolm Addey, Peter Bown, Richard Langham, Phil McDonald, John Kurlander, Richard Lush and Ken Townsend, who invented the studio effect known as automatic double tracking (ADT). The chief mastering engineer at Abbey Road was Chris &quot;Vinyl&quot; Blair, who started his career as a tape deck operator.

From 1966 to 1971, the Walt Disney Music Company recorded vocals, instrumentals and narration and dialogue for over a dozen albums at Abbey Road for U.S. and international release, including &quot;The Aristocats, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Doctor Dolittle, Heidi&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Most of the sessions included The Mike Sammes Singers, who backed up The Beatles on &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Good Night.&quot;

In 1979, EMI commissioned the British jazz fusion band Morrissey-Mullen to record Britain&#x27;s first digitally recorded single record at Abbey Road Studios.

===1980s–2010s===
Abbey Road Studios got its start in the film scoring business in 1980 when Anvil Post Production formed a partnership with the studio, called Anvil-Abbey Road Screen Sound; with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; being the first major film soundtrack recorded in Studio 1. The partnership started when Anvil was left without a scoring stage when Denham Studios were demolished. It ended in 1984 when EMI merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to become Thorn EMI. Abbey Road&#x27;s success in the scoring business continued after the partnership ended.

From 18 July to 11 September 1983, the public had a rare opportunity to see inside the Studio Two room, where the Beatles made most of their records. While a new mixing console was being installed in the control room, the studio was used to host a video presentation called &quot;The Beatles at Abbey Road&quot;. The soundtrack to the video had a number of recordings that were not made commercially available until the release of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; project over a decade later.

In September 2012, with the takeover of EMI, the studio became the property of Universal Music. It was not one of the entities that were sold to Warner Music as part of Parlophone and instead the control of Abbey Road Studios Ltd was transferred to Virgin Records.

==Sale attempt==
On 17 February 2010, it was reported that EMI had put the studios up for sale because of increasing debts. There was reported interest by property developers in redeveloping the site into luxury flats. It had also been reported there was a possibility the studios could be purchased by the National Trust to preserve what was in effect a historical building. A Save Abbey Road Studios campaign attempted to ensure the premises remained a working studio.

On 21 February 2010, EMI stated it planned to keep the studio and was looking for an investor to help finance a &quot;revitalisation&quot; project. Meanwhile, the British government declared Abbey Road Studios a Grade II listed building which protected it from major alteration. The following December, the pedestrian crossing at Abbey Road was listed on the National Heritage List.

Paul McCartney, speaking to BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 16 February 2010, said there had been efforts to save Abbey Road by &quot;a few people who have been associated with the studio for a long time,&quot; although he did not name them or include himself among them. &quot;I have so many memories there with the Beatles,&quot; McCartney said, &quot;It still is a great studio. So it would be lovely for someone to get a thing together to save it.&quot;

==Abbey Road Institute==
In March 2015, Abbey Road Institute was founded as a school for music production and audio engineering. In addition to the London location, Abbey Road Institute offers education globally with schools in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Johannesburg, Miami, Paris and Sydney. All of the campuses offer the same course, the Advanced Diploma in Music Production and Sound Engineering, which has been developed in collaboration with industry leaders and the team at Abbey Road Studios. Some campuses offer additional short courses, including Portfolio Preparation, Song Production Masterclass, Music theory Fundamentals for Producers amongst others.
In April 2021, Abbey Road Institute London announced it would be expanding and moving into the currently closed Angel Recording Studios in the summer of 2021.

<doc id="140631" wikidata="Q6935655" url="?curid=140631" title="Munch (BDSM)">
<text>A munch (derived from &quot;burger munch&quot;) is a casual social gathering for people involved in or interested in kink, BDSM, alternative relationship lifestyles, or fetishes. Usually no BDSM, kink, or fetish activities take place; however, there are venues that offer a play munch where you can take part in BDSM activites.

==Characteristics== 
Munches often take place at a restaurant, bar, coffee shop, or other public setting. A munch organizer usually reserves a large table, a back area, or a private room. People are free to arrive and leave within the specified hours. The primary purpose is socializing and meeting like-minded individuals. Munches are intended as opportunities for those who are curious about kink to meet others, become more comfortable, and better informed. Unlike a play party, munches are informal affairs that discourage fetish attire or BDSM play, though wearing of subtle collars or leather items may be permissible if they are nondescript. Munches can be geared towards specific groups, such as LGBTIQA or BIPOC, while others may be focused on specific kinks such as Master/slave or submissive roundtables. Etiquette and rules tend to vary across munches.

==Marketing==
Munch organizers may post their event information on social networking sites, or use e-mail or mailing lists. Local BDSM/Kink groups may announce a munch in-person at a meeting, on a community calendar or newsletter, or on their own websites.
==History==
The Usenet group alt.sex.bondage was a common meeting ground online; as was a San Francisco-area email list known as BABES (Bay Area Bondage Enthusiasts Society). While organizations such as the Society of Janus and the BackDrop Club existed, there were few informal ways to meet others socially within the fetish scene. After that initial meeting, an informal rotation of organizers and locations were instituted, with widely varying amounts of success.

The Kirk&#x27;s Burger Munch attracted a large and often spirited crowd, some of which participated in discreet play. As time went on, the atmosphere became more overtly fetish and BDSM play oriented, and people started bringing in outside food. Ultimately, the management insisted that the group stop meeting there. Many of the original participants organized another social gathering just down the street, though STella (a member of BABES) requested they not use the name &quot;burger munch&quot;. The name was shortened to &quot;munch&quot;. 

The term &quot;Burger Munch&quot; was also used in Boston in 1993.

<doc id="140632" wikidata="Q598185" url="?curid=140632" title="Carl W. Stalling">
<text>Carl William Stalling (November 10, 1891 – November 29, 1972) was an American composer, voice actor and arranger for music in animated films. He is most closely associated with the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts produced by Warner Bros., where he averaged one complete score each week, for 22 years.

==Biography==
Stalling was born to Ernest and Sophia C. Stalling. His parents were from Germany; his father arrived in the United States in 1883. The family settled in Lexington, Missouri where his father was a carpenter. He started playing piano at six. By the age of 12, he was the principal piano accompanist in his hometown&#x27;s silent movie house. For a short period, he was also the theatre organist at the St. Louis Theatre, which eventually became Powell Symphony Hall.

By his early 20s, he was conducting his own orchestra and improvising on the organ at the Isis Movie Theatre in Kansas City. His actual job at the time was to play &quot;organ accompaniment&quot; for silent films. During that time, he met and befriended a young Walt Disney, who was producing animated comedy shorts in Kansas City. According to music critic Neil Strauss, the chance meeting between Stalling and Disney in the early 1920s was of great importance to the development of music for animation. Stalling was at his job at the Isis Movie Theatre, demonstrating his ability to combine well-known music by other creators with his own, improvised compositions. Disney stepped into the movie theater and was reportedly impressed with his style. He approached Stalling to introduce himself, and their acquaintance was mutually beneficial. Stalling was able to arrange the screening of a few Disney animated shorts at the Isis, and Disney ensured that Stalling would play the accompaniment for his films.

Disney eventually left Kansas City and moved to California to open a new studio. Stalling and Disney kept in touch through correspondence, and considered each other friends. In 1928, Disney was on a journey from California to New York City to record the sound and make the preview of &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, Disney&#x27;s first released sound short. During the journey he stopped at Kansas City to hire Stalling to compose film scores for two other animated shorts. Stalling composed several early cartoon scores for Walt Disney, including &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; in 1928 (but not &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;). &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; were originally silent films and were the first two Mickey Mouse animated short films in production.

When finishing composing the film scores, Stalling went to New York City to record them for Disney. Walt was apparently pleased with the results, and offered to hire Stalling as his studio&#x27;s first music director. In order to get the job, Stalling had to move to California, where the studio was located. According to Martha Sigall, Stalling accepted because the job offer was a great opportunity for him. He probably realized that his career as an organist for a silent movie theatre was coming to an end, because the silent film era was also at its end. Sound films were the new trend.
Stalling soon followed Disney in moving to Hollywood, in order to work for his friend. Animation historian Allan Neuwirth credits Stalling for basically inventing the process of creating a film score for cartoons. According to Strauss, the &quot;wildly talented&quot; Stalling was suitable as a film score composer for animated films. Stalling even voiced Mickey Mouse in &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot; in 1929.

Stalling encouraged Disney to create a new series of animated short films, in which the animation and its action would be created to match the music. This was still unusual at the time, since film music was played or composed to match the action of a film. Stalling&#x27;s discussions with Disney on whether the animation or the musical score should come first led to Disney creating the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series of animated short films. Stalling is credited with both the composition and the musical arrangement of &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot; (1929), the first of the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;. These cartoons allowed Stalling to create a score that Disney handed to his animators.
The &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; was an innovative animated film series, in which pre-recorded film scores were making use of well-known classical works and the animation sequences were choreographed to match the music. Stalling helped Disney streamline and update the sound process used in creating early animated sound films, following the long and laborious synchronization process used in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. The close synchronization of music and on-screen movement pioneered by the Disney short films became known as Mickey Mousing.

While working at the Disney studio, Stalling further refined a forerunner to the click track, they called the &quot;Tick-system&quot;. Initially, Wilfred Jackson utilized a Metronome to set a definitive tempo of the cartoon sections, that then got further developed over the years (being transcribed onto a &quot;bar-sheet&quot; or a &quot;dope-sheet&quot;). The system helped synchronize music and sound effects to the visuals. An early example of a click track was used in the production of &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot; (1929). The method used in this film involved a reel of unexposed film with holes punched out to make clicks and pops when run on the sound head. According to Strauss, this version of the click track is credited to sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.

Stalling left Disney after two years, at the same time as animator Ub Iwerks. He had reportedly completed the scoring of about 20 animated films for Disney. Finding few outlets in New York, Stalling rejoined Iwerks at the Iwerks Studio in California, while freelancing for Disney and others. Stalling served as the music director of Iwerks&#x27; studio until the studio shut down in 1936. In 1936, when Leon Schlesinger—under contract to produce animated shorts for Warner Bros.—hired Iwerks, Stalling went with him to become a full-time cartoon music composer. According to Sigall, Stalling was hired by the Leon Schlesinger studio in July, 1936. She recalled the month because she was hired by the studio as an apprentice painter that same month. Stalling already had a reputation as a very talented musician and composer. He had gained this reputation and considerable experience as the music director at the studios of both Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Schlesinger was aware of these facts when offering to hire him. Stalling had been recommended to Schlesinger by storyman Ben Hardaway. Hardaway had met Stalling while they both worked at the Iwerks studio and, when Schlesinger started searching for a new music director for his studio, Hardaway suggested hiring his old colleague who was available. According to Sigall, the hiring of Stalling turned out to be a smart move for Schlesinger. The new music director (Stalling) became an integral member of the team producing two very successful animated series.

The two animated series which Schlesinger produced for Warner Bros. were the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, both introduced in the early 1930s. Prior to 1936, most of the animated films of these two series included film scores by either Frank Marsales, Bernard B. Brown, or Norman Spencer. From 1936 onwards, Stalling was the film score composer for almost every theatrical animated short released by Warner Bros. Cartoons until his retirement. Stalling served as the music director for this studio for 22 years and is credited for the film score of over 600 animated films.

Like his predecessors as music director for the studio, Stalling had full access to the expansive Warner Bros. catalog and musicians. He could also use the fifty-piece orchestra of the company, headed at the time by Leo F. Forbstein. The executives at Warner Bros. in fact insisted that Stalling should use as much music and songs from their feature films as possible. Their dual goal was to help promote the animated shorts by associating them with already popular music, and to help promote the songs themselves by giving them additional publicity. They hoped that such cross promotion would increase the sales of the songs.

Stalling remained with Warner Bros. until he retired in 1958. His last cartoon was &quot;To Itch His Own&quot;, directed by Chuck Jones. After Stalling retired in 1958, he was succeeded by Milt Franklyn, who had assisted Stalling as an arranger since the mid 1930s and was promoted to musical director in the early 1950s. Stalling and Franklyn had shared credits for musical direction during the last years of Stalling&#x27;s tenure.

Stalling died in the Los Angeles area on November 29, 1972.

==Composing style==

Although Stalling&#x27;s composing technique followed the conventions of music accompaniment from the silent film era that were based on improvisation and compilation of musical cues from catalogs and cue-sheets, he was also an innovator. Stalling is among the first music directors to extensively use the metronome to time film scores. He was one of three composers, along with Max Steiner and Scott Bradley, credited with the invention of the click track.

His stock-in-trade was the &quot;musical pun&quot;, where he used references to popular songs, or even classical pieces, to add a dimension of humor to the action on the screen. Working with directors Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson and Chuck Jones, he developed the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; style of very rapid and tightly coordinated musical cues, punctuated with both instrumental and recorded sound effects, and occasionally reaching into full blown musical fantasies such as &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot; and &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;.

Stalling&#x27;s working process involved meeting each animated short film&#x27;s director or directors before the animation process began. Together they set the time signatures to which the short was to be drawn. The animators of the film were measuring animation frames per beat. After the animation process was completed, Stalling would receive the animators&#x27; exposure sheets or bar sheets. The sheets broke the animation, dialogue, and sound effects into musical bars, which Stalling would then use to create his score for the film.

When working on a film score, Stalling would incorporate his musical puns. He chose popular songs whose titles fit the on-screen gags. His music quotations were often brief, sometimes not lasting more than four seconds. John Zorn has described Stalling&#x27;s sense for quotation as &quot;Ivesian&quot;, in reference to composer Charles Ives and his innovative musical quotation techniques. His musical cues, the unedited periods between the commencement and end of a single musical take, had varying lengths. At the short end of the spectrum, they would last no more than two seconds. At the long end, they would last two minutes. Stalling would often use music quotations from the themes of the live-action films of the Warner Bros.&#x27; studio.

Most of his film scores involved 500 measures in ten sections. His compositions were performed by Warner Brothers&#x27; fifty-piece orchestra. Neil Strauss notes that this orchestra was often employed for relatively undemanding film scores for live-action feature films. When working for Stalling, the orchestra would find itself burdened with more challenging and taxing work. Stalling recorded many variations of the opening themes of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series. The theme of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series was &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; (1937), a minor hit from the team of Dave Franklin and Cliff Friend. Franklin and Friend were members of the Tin Pan Alley. The theme of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series was &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (1935). An electric guitar provided the song&#x27;s initial sound effect.

Stalling was a master at quickly changing musical styles based on the action in the cartoon. His arrangements were complicated and technically demanding. The music itself served both as a background for the cartoon, and provided musical sound effects. The titles of the music often described the action, sometimes forming jokes for those familiar with the tunes.

Stalling made extensive use of the many works of Raymond Scott, whose music was licensed by Warner Bros. in the early 1940s. According to Strauss, Stalling relied heavily on the music Scott composed during the 1930s. For example, the reportedly &quot;fast and wacky&quot; &quot;Powerhouse&quot; (1937) by Scott was frequently used to accompany animated scenes involving conveyor-belts or chases. Scott&#x27;s works had a cartoon sensibility and brought visual images to mind, elements which Stalling needed for his compositions. Due to Stalling&#x27;s frequent use of his works, Raymond Scott was eventually considered a &quot;cartoon composer&quot; in his own right. But Scott did not actually compose his works with the intention of using them as film scores.

Stalling&#x27;s cues are always tied to the story on the screen. For example, he often used &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; and &quot;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&quot; in scenes with attractive women or characters in female drag, and &quot;California, Here I Come&quot; for scenes where characters make hasty departures. Scenes involving automobiles were often accompanied by &quot;In My Merry Oldsmobile&quot;, and scenes involving airplanes were often accompanied by the theme song to &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot;. Raymond Scott&#x27;s &quot;In an 18th Century Drawing Room&quot; is usually associated with Granny in the Sylvester and Tweety shorts, and his &quot;Powerhouse&quot; pops up in scenes of machines, factories or mechanical devices. Stalling composed music for the Rossini-derived short &quot;The Rabbit of Seville&quot;, and linked Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of the Comedians&quot; to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Stalling is remembered today for the scores of cartoons that remain popular, and are often remembered for their music. His melodies are heard through most of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, and imitated in new &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; compilations and features such as &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;.

Film critic Leonard Maltin pointed out that listening to the soundtracks of the Warner cartoons was an important part of his musical education; the use of the full Warner Bros. Orchestra resulted in a richness of sound that is often lacking in more modern cartoons.

Allan Neuwirth considers Stalling&#x27;s work style in the Warner Bros. films to be highly recognizable. It consisted of &quot;lush orchestrations&quot;, sampling of popular songs, and &quot;hair-trigger shifts in pacing&quot;. The pacing of the film score could quickly change from manic and furious to slow and gentle, and back again. Stalling&#x27;s music would match the mood required for any given scene. Neuwirth argues that the music managed to enhance the mood set by these scenes. This was what made Stalling&#x27;s work so effective.

==Comments by Chuck Jones==

Chuck Jones and the other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; directors sometimes complained about Stalling&#x27;s proclivity for musical quotation and punning. In an interview, Jones complained:

Musicologist and animation historian Daniel Goldmark has noted that Jones repeated this anecdote about Stalling in a number of interviews. Jones also claimed in a 1975 interview that &quot;My Funny Little Bumble Bee&quot; song was too obscure for the audience to notice the musical reference. He exaggerated that one had to be 108-years-old to even remember the existence of the song. Goldmark believes that the anecdote itself was inaccurate in several ways. The &quot;Bumble Bee song&quot; of the anecdote was actually &quot;Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee&quot; (1912), which was not obscure to begin with. It was a hit song from the musical &quot;A Winsome Widow&quot;, produced by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. It had also been recorded to great acclaim by the popular duo of Ada Jones and Billy Murray. And Stalling actually used this song only once during his entire tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons. The song served as the title music of &quot;The Bee-Deviled Bruin&quot; (1949), an animated short directed by Chuck Jones. Goldmark has also noted that Jones&#x27; claim about the repeated use of &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot; in cave scenes was inaccurate. Stalling did use the melody composed by Felix Mendelssohn in several animated shorts, but never in combination with an actual cave scene.

<doc id="140633" wikidata="Q1426279" url="?curid=140633" title="Get Back">
<text>&quot;Get Back&quot; is a song recorded by the English rock band the Beatles and Billy Preston, written by Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. It was originally released as a single on 11 April 1969 and credited to &quot;The Beatles with Billy Preston&quot;. The song is one of the few examples of John Lennon featuring prominently as lead guitarist. The album version of this song contains a different mix that features a studio chat between Paul McCartney and John Lennon at the beginning, which lasts for 20 seconds before the song begins, also omitting the coda featured in the single version, and with a final dialogue taken from the Beatles&#x27; rooftop concert. This version became the closing track of &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970), which was released just after the group split up. The single version was later issued on the compilation albums &quot;1967–1970&quot;, &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Past Masters&quot;, and &quot;1&quot;.

The single reached number one in the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Australia, France, West Germany, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Belgium. It was the Beatles&#x27; only single that credited another artist at their request. &quot;Get Back&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; first single release in true stereo in the US. In the UK, the Beatles&#x27; singles remained monaural until the following release, &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;. It was also the only Beatles single to debut on the UK singles charts at number one.

==Composition==

===Musical development===
&quot;Get Back&quot; is unusual in the Beatles&#x27; canon in that almost every moment of the song&#x27;s evolution has been documented, from its beginning as an offhand riff to its final mixing in several versions. That is covered in bootleg recordings, books, the 1970 documentary &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and the 2021 Peter Jackson-directed documentary &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;.

The song&#x27;s melody grew out of some unstructured jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. After working out the rhythm and harmony of the primary riff on his Höfner bass, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking &quot;Get back to the place you should be&quot; from George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot; into &quot;Get back to where you once belonged&quot;. McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax&#x27;s recording of &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot; a few months earlier. On 9 January, McCartney brought a more developed version of &quot;Get Back&quot; to the group, with the &quot;Sweet Loretta&quot; verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the &quot;Get Back&quot; single, McCartney wrote, &quot;We were sitting in the studio, and we made it up out of thin air ... we started to write words there and then ... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by.&quot;

At the beginning of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; version of the song, Lennon can be heard jokingly saying &quot;Sweet Loretta Fart (often misheard as &quot;fat&quot;, due to Lennon&#x27;s pronunciation), she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan.&quot; The album version of the song also ends with Lennon famously quipping, &quot;I&#x27;d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition.&quot; (He had said that at the end of their 30 January 1969 rooftop concert on the roof of Apple Studios, but Phil Spector edited it into the studio version of &quot;Get Back&quot; that was released on the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album.)

In an interview in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1980, Lennon described &quot;Get Back&quot; as &quot;... a better version of &#x27;Lady Madonna&#x27;. You know, a potboiler rewrite&quot;. Lennon also said that &quot;there&#x27;s some underlying thing about Yoko in there&quot;, saying that McCartney looked at Yoko Ono in the studio every time he sang &quot;Get back to where you once belonged.&quot;

===Early protest lyrics===
When McCartney introduced the song to the group during the Twickenham rehearsals, the lyrics were mostly incomplete except for the &quot;Get Back&quot; chorus. McCartney improvised various temporary lyrics leading to what has become known in Beatles&#x27; folklore as the &quot;No Pakistanis&quot; version. This version parodied the anti-immigrant views of Enoch Powell, a Member of Parliament (MP) whose racially charged speeches, particularly the Rivers of Blood speech, had recently gained much media attention. The lyrics addressed attitudes toward immigrants in the United States and the United Kingdom: &quot;... don&#x27;t need no Puerto Ricans living in the USA&quot;; and &quot;don&#x27;t dig no Pakistanis taking all the people&#x27;s jobs&quot;, though these lyrics were meant to be a parody and a criticism of those prejudiced against immigrants. Later during the same session, the subject of immigration came up again in an improvised jam that has become known as &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. The lyrics included a line, &quot;You&#x27;d better get back to your Commonwealth homes&quot;.

==Recordings and post-production work==
Billy Preston, an old friend of the Beatles, was in England for some television appearances. He joined the Beatles on keyboards on 22 January. The group, with Preston playing Fender Rhodes electric piano, recorded about ten takes on 23 January. They made a concerted effort to perfect &quot;Get Back&quot; on 27 January, recording about 14 takes. By this time, the song had the addition of a false ending and reprise coda. After numerous takes, the band jammed some old numbers and then returned to &quot;Get Back&quot; one last time in an attempt to record the master take. This performance (Take 11) was considered to be the best yet: it was musically tight and punchy without mistakes, though the song finishes without the restart. On the session tape, George Harrison comments, &quot;[W]e missed that end&quot;; this is the version heard on the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; album. On 28 January the group attempted to recapture the previous day&#x27;s performance and recorded several new takes, each including the coda. Whilst these takes were good, they did not quite achieve the quality of the best take from the previous day. The line-up for the released versions of &quot;Get Back&quot; was Paul McCartney, lead vocal and bass; John Lennon, lead guitar and backing vocal; George Harrison, rhythm guitar; Ringo Starr, drums; and Billy Preston, electric piano. Harrison, the usual lead guitarist, had temporarily quit the group on 10 January, so Lennon worked out the lead guitar part and played it on the recordings.

The Beatles had EMI produce a mono remix of the track on 4 April, completed by Jeff Jarrett. The Beatles were unhappy with the mix, and on 7 April, McCartney and Glyn Johns worked at Olympic Studios to produce new remixes for the single release. They made an edited version using the best take of the main part of the song (Take 11) from 27 January and the &#x27;best coda&#x27; ending from 28 January. The edit is so precise that it appears to be a continuous take, achieving the ending the Beatles had desired all along. This was a divergence from the concept of a straight live performance without studio trickery, but a relatively minor one, and avoids the somewhat abrupt ending of the version used on the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; album.
The Beatles performed &quot;Get Back&quot; (along with other songs from the album) as part of The Beatles&#x27; rooftop performance, which took place on the roof of Apple Studios in Savile Row, London on 30 January 1969, an edited version of which was included in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film. &quot;Get Back&quot; was performed in full three times. During the third, which marked the end of the rooftop performance, the Beatles were interrupted by the police, who had received complaints from office workers nearby. After the police spoke to Mal Evans, he turned off Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s amplifiers only for Harrison to switch them back on, insisting that they finish the song. McCartney said, &quot;You&#x27;ve been playing on the roofs again, and that&#x27;s no good, and you know your Mummy doesn&#x27;t like that ... she gets angry ... she&#x27;s gonna have you arrested! Get back!&quot; The third rooftop performance of &quot;Get Back&quot; is available on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;: the last song of the Beatles&#x27; final live performance.

At the end of the last rooftop performance of &quot;Get Back&quot;, the audience applauds, and McCartney says, &quot;Thanks, Mo&quot;, in reply to Maureen Starkey&#x27;s cheering. Lennon adds: &quot;I&#x27;d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we&#x27;ve passed the audition&quot;. Spector used some of the talk preceding the master take of 27 January and edited on these comments to make the album version sound different from the single.

The stereo single version and that of the B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot;, were the first Beatles recordings to feature Starr&#x27;s drum kit in true stereo, mixed across the left and right channels. This utilised the then-fairly new 8-track recording technology and was a result of the growing popularity of stereo over mono. The only other Beatles&#x27; track to employ this recording method was &quot;The End&quot; on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

==The Releases==
===The Single version===
On 11 April 1969, Apple Records released &quot;Get Back&quot; as a single in the UK, paired with &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; on the B-side. The single began its 17-week stay in the charts on 23 April at No. 1, a position it held for six weeks. It was the first Beatles single to enter the official UK singles chart at the top. In the US, &quot;Get Back&quot; began its first of 12 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart the week ending 10 May. Two weeks after the song&#x27;s chart debut, it hit No. 1, where it stayed for five weeks. &quot;Get Back&quot; became the band&#x27;s 17th No. 1 song on &quot;Billboard&quot;, matching Elvis Presley&#x27;s previous record of 17 number ones.

In both the UK and US, the single was released by Apple, although EMI retained the rights to the song as part of their contract. It was the only Beatles single to include an accompanying artist&#x27;s name, crediting &quot;Get Back/Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; to &quot;The Beatles with Billy Preston&quot;. Neither Apple nor Capitol Records created a picture sleeve for the single—it was modestly packaged in a black sleeve with a cursive-style font simply stating &quot;The Beatles on Apple&quot;. Apple launched a print ad campaign for the song concurrent with its release showing a photo of the band with the slogan &quot;The Beatles as Nature Intended&quot;, indicating that the sound of &quot;Get Back&quot; harked to the group&#x27;s earlier days.

The single version of the song contains a chamber reverb effect throughout and a coda after a false ending, with the lyrics &quot;Get back Loretta / Your mommy&#x27;s waiting for you / Wearing her high-heel shoes / And her low-neck sweater / Get back home, Loretta.&quot; This does not appear on the album version; the single version&#x27;s first LP appearance would come three years later on the &quot;1967–1970&quot; compilation. This version also appeared in the albums &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Past Masters&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. It was also included in the original line-up of the proposed &quot;Get Back&quot; album, which was scheduled to be released in the fall of 1969.

In the UK and Europe, &quot;Get Back/Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; last single to be released in mono, but in the US, the single was released in stereo. It was the Beatles&#x27; first single to be released in true stereo instead of mono as part of the &quot;stereo only&quot; movement gaining force in 1969. In both versions, the lead guitar played by Lennon is in the left channel, and the rhythm guitar played by Harrison is in the right channel. The single was also released in the experimental PocketDisc format by Americom in conjunction with Apple and Capitol in the late 1960s.

===&quot;Let It Be&quot; version===
When Phil Spector came to remix &quot;Get Back&quot;, he wanted to make it seem different from the version released as the single, though both versions were essentially the same take. The unreleased &quot;Get Back&quot; albums included elements of studio chatter to add to the live feel of the recordings. In this spirit, Spector included part of the studio chatter recorded immediately before a take recorded on 27 January, slightly crossfaded it onto the beginning of the master take (also recorded on January 27), and omitted the coda recorded on January 28, instead adding McCartney and Lennon&#x27;s remarks after the close of the rooftop performance. This created the impression that the single and album versions are different takes. The single&#x27;s reverb effect was also omitted from this remix.

===&quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; version===
In 2003, &quot;Get Back&quot; was re-released on the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; album, remixed by independent producers with the sanction of surviving Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, with John Lennon&#x27;s and George Harrison&#x27;s widows. The &quot;Naked&quot; version of &quot;Get Back&quot; is a remix of the take recorded on 27 January 1969 used for both the single and album versions, without the coda recorded the following day or the framing dialogue from the studio and rooftop concert added to the album version. The single&#x27;s reverb effect was also omitted from this remix, and the song fades immediately before the final &quot;whoo&quot;. Apple also prepared a specially-created music video of the &quot;Let It Be ... Naked&quot; release of the song to promote that album in 2003. This video is edited together using stock footage of the band, along with Billy Preston, George Martin and others.

===&quot;The Love&quot; version===
In 2006, a newly mixed version of &quot;Get Back&quot; produced by George Martin and his son Giles was included on the album &quot;Love&quot;. This version incorporates elements of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (the intro chord), &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (the improvised orchestral crescendo), &quot;The End&quot; (Ringo Starr&#x27;s drum solo, Paul McCartney&#x27;s second guitar solo, and John Lennon&#x27;s last guitar solo), and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot; (Take 1&#x27;s drum count-off intro). However, this piece has several edits, including an extended intro, and the second verse is removed completely.

===&quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; versions===
Universal Music released take 8 from the recording sessions to promote the 50th-anniversary edition of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and the 2021 &quot;Get Back&quot; documentary miniseries. This version has McCartney ad-libbing a different spoken word section over the bridge, beginning with &quot;It&#x27;s five o&#x27;clock ... your mother&#x27;s got your tea on.&quot; As the band performed the song three times during their impromptu rooftop concert on 30 January 1969, all three of those versions also appear in the final episode of the mini-series, as the concert is shown in its entirety. Take 3 of the rooftop concert was released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot; in 1996, while the first two were released in January 2022.

==McCartney live performances==
McCartney performed &quot;Get Back&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on 15 July 2009. Letterman&#x27;s show was taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater, the same theatre that hosted the Beatles&#x27; performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964 and 1965. McCartney&#x27;s performance was not on the stage, however. Instead, he performed atop the theatre&#x27;s marquee overlooking Broadway. In the interview preceding the performance, Letterman asked McCartney if he had ever played on a marquee before. &quot;I&#x27;ve done a roof&quot;, McCartney replied, referring to the Beatles&#x27; 1969 performance atop the Apple Corps building in London.

McCartney also performed the song as a kind of encore on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 11 December 2010. The performance was unusual for the show because McCartney had played the two standard songs that musical guests play, then had played a third song (&quot;A Day in the Life&quot;/&quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;). At the normal conclusion of the show, when host Paul Rudd thanked the cast, McCartney retook the stage for &quot;Get Back&quot;, the broadcast of which was partially cut off due to time constraints.

McCartney performed this live during his 1989/1990 World Tour, and it was released on both the full-length and highlight versions of the subsequent live album &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot; (1990). In 2009, a performance was included on the &quot;Good Evening New York City&quot; album.

In 2005, the song was part of his Super Bowl halftime show.

McCartney and the Foo Fighters performed the song at the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.

* Billy Preston, who played the Rhodes piano on the original Beatles recording, covered the song for the 1978 film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and its soundtrack album. This version peaked at No. 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
* Steve Wariner, in 1995 for the Beatles tribute album &quot;Come Together: America Salutes the Beatles&quot;. Wariner&#x27;s version peaked at No. 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart.

==Cultural references==
* In the 2007 film, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, directed by Julie Taymor, most characters are named after lyrics in Beatles songs. A principal character is named Jojo, an African American who was played by Martin Luther McCoy.

* Hirohiko Araki&#x27;s 1987 manga &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; may have used this song for inspiration for the main character of the first part Jonathan Joestar, who starts as a loner but gains companions throughout his journey. At the end of the series&#x27;s third part, &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;, Joseph Joestar is seen listening to the song on his Walkman.

<text>Basic Operating System/360 (BOS/360) was an early IBM System/360 operating system.

== Origin ==
BOS was one of four System/360 Operating System versions developed by the IBM General Products Division (GPD) in Endicott, New York to fill a gap at the low end of the System/360 line when it became apparent that OS/360 was not able to run on the smallest systems. BPS (Basic Programming support) was designed to run on systems with a minimum of 8 KB of main storage and no disk. BOS was intended for disk systems with at least 8 KB and one 2311 disk drive. DOS and TOS were developed from BOS for systems with at least 16 KB and either disks (DOS) or tape drives only (TOS).

BOS was released in October 1965, nearly two years before OS/360, thus BOS was the only disk based operating system available at launch for a machine that was marketed as disk based.

== Components ==
BOS consisted of the following components:
* Control programs:
** The supervisor.
** Job control capable of running jobs sequentially from the card reader.
** The IPL loader.
* System Service Programs:
** The Linkage Editor.
** The Librarian, supporting a core-image library, and optionally a macro library and a relocatable library.
** The &quot;Load System Program,&quot; a sysgen program to build a disk-resident BOS system from cards.
* IBM-supplied processing programs which could be installed with BOS:
** Language translators, an Assembler and an RPG compiler. Compilers for FORTRAN IV and COBOL were added later.
** Autotest, a debugging aid.
** Sort/Merge.
** Utility programs for file-to-file copy between devices and formats.
** Remote Job Entry allowing the BOS system to submit jobs to a remote System/360 and receive output.
* Data Management, consisting of supervisor support for Physical IOCS, and macros for Logical IOCS which could be incorporated into the user&#x27;s processing programs.

== IBM 1070 Process Communication Supervisor ==
The IBM 1070 Process Communication Supervisor was a dedicated process control system that ran as an extension under BOS &quot;Relying on the BOS supervisor to handle ordinary physical and logical I/O operations (i. e., for cards, disk, etc.), the PC supervisor is specialized to the process control aspects of the user&#x27;s program.&quot;

<doc id="140637" wikidata="Q4454107" url="?curid=140637" title="Twickenham Film Studios">
<text>Twickenham Film Studios is a film studio in St Margarets, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, that is used by various motion picture and television companies. It was established in 1913 by Ralph Jupp on the site of a former ice rink. At the time of its original construction, it was the largest film studio in the United Kingdom.

In February 2012, it was announced that due to the studio going into administration, it would close before June, just a year before its centenary. The studio was subsequently saved from closure, with a new owner acquiring the studio in August 2012.

The studios were acquired in February 2020 by The Creative District Improvement Co. with backing from British Airways Pension Fund and TIME + SPACE Studios as operator on a long lease to run the studios.

==History==
===London Film===
In 1913, the studios were constructed by the newly formed London Film Company, and were at that time the largest in Britain. London Film was a leading producer during the First World War, but the company struggled and went out of business in 1920. Twickenham Studios were sold off, and were used for various independent productions.

===Julius Hagen===
During the 1930s, the studio was run by Julius Hagen. Hagen built up his business making Quota quickies for major American studios, who were required by law to produce a certain number of British films each year to be allowed to release their pictures into the lucrative British market. Hagen became very efficient at producing large numbers of these quickies of varying quality. He often filmed all day, and then brought in different crews and actors to work through the night.

Following the success of Alexander Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), Hagen became interested in producing films which could be released in America. Twickenham took on more quality work such as the Gracie Fields vehicle &quot;This Week of Grace&quot;. This ultimately led Hagen to stop making quickies entirely and focus exclusively on &quot;quality&quot; productions. He began to make more expensive films, such as Seymour Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1935) and &quot;Spy of Napoleon&quot; for which he hoped to gain an international market. Hagen spent £100,000 rebuilding Twickenham Studios and acquired studios in other parts of London. He also broke with his established distributors and attempted to distribute his own films. This proved a mistake, however, as the major American studios blocked his entry into their market, while his films failed to gain access to the British market. In 1937, Hagen&#x27;s company went bankrupt as part of a wider slump in British filmmaking that year, bringing an end to his reign at Twickenham.

Numerous films have been made at Twickenham Film Studios since the end of Hagen&#x27;s tenure, including Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; (1939).

===Post-war===
In 1946, Alfred Shipman formed Alliance Film Studios Limited, controlling Riverside, Southall and Twickenham Film Studios. After his death in 1956, his two sons Gerald (father of Piers Flint-Shipman) and Kenneth Shipman took control of the studios, with Kenneth later going on to form Alliance Film Distributors.

===Later films===

In the 1960s, classic films such as &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) starring Michael Caine, &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), featuring Caine and Noël Coward, and Roman Polanski&#x27;s first English language film, &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965), were made at Twickenham. &quot;Be My Guest&quot; (also 1965) features Jerry Lee Lewis, an early appearance by the young actor Steve Marriott, and The Nashville Teens. The first two Beatles feature films were made at Twickenham: &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) and &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), and also their promotional film for &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (1968). The Beatles used the studios while rehearsing music for their album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. A film was made of some of the sessions; both the film and the album were released in 1970. Footage from Twickenham was the setting of the first of a three-part documentary about these sessions directed by Peter Jackson.

In the 1980s, the studio was used for &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981), &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988). Later films include &quot;The Others&quot; (2001), &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996), &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (1998), and the animated film &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993).

==Facilities==

===Sound stages===
Twickenham Film Studios has three stages that are sound-proofed and operate on a &#x27;four wall&#x27; basis. Dressing rooms, star apartments, make-up, hairdressing and wardrobe departments and camera rooms are situated adjacent to each stage, with nearby prop rooms, art departments and office suites. The largest, Stage 1, has a concrete water tank, housed underneath the floor boards. A camera pit at one end allows underwater viewing through a glass screen. This stage has been used for innumerable films, including the two Beatles films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) and &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988). Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Sleuth&quot; (2007) was shot on this stage. Films shot on Stage 3 include Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;, Karel Reisz&#x27;s &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), and Lewis Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; (1989). Later films include &quot;Layer Cake&quot; (2004), directed by Matthew Vaughn, and &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; (2007), directed by Mike Newell. The thriller &quot;Before I Go To Sleep&quot; (2014), written and directed by Rowan Joffé, which features Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, was shot at the studios early in 2013.

More recently, Twickenham Film Studios carried out script-to-screen work on Ten Percent, the British remake of French series Call My Agent. Recent work also includes Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast, Top Gun: Maverick, Oscar-winning Bohemian Rhapsody, Last Night in Soho and House of Gucci.

===Post-production===
The studios&#x27; post production facilities include a state-of-the-art sound centre, at the heart of which is the refurbished The Richard Attenborough Theatre, named after Richard Attenborough, who used to have his production offices at the studios.

Following major modernisation and expansion in recent years, Twickenham Film Studios has extensively refurbished and upgraded its two largest re-recording theatres, making the studios the most advanced sound department in the UK. The Dubbing Theatres have 4K DCI Projection and HDX Pro Tools rigs as standard.

It is one of the studios in the UK which has been Dolby Premier certified. Other facilities include a second dubbing theatre, ADR / Foley Theatre, numerous cutting rooms, office facilities and sound transfer facilities.

<doc id="140638" wikidata="Q287657" url="?curid=140638" title="Tokugawa Yoshinobu">
<text>Prince was the 15th and last &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan. He was part of a movement which aimed to reform the aging shogunate, but was ultimately unsuccessful. He resigned his position as shogun in late 1867, while aiming at keeping some political influence. After these efforts failed following the defeat at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in early 1868, he went into retirement, and largely avoided the public eye for the rest of his life.

==Early life==

Tokugawa Yoshinobu was born in Edo as the seventh son of Tokugawa Nariaki, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Mito. Mito was one of the &quot;gosanke&quot;, the three branch families of the Tokugawa clan which were eligible to be chosen as &quot;shōgun&quot;. His birth name was Matsudaira Shichirōmaro () His mother, Princess Arisugawa Yoshiko, was a member of the Arisugawa-no-miya, a cadet branch of the imperial family; through her, he was a third cousin (once removed) of the then-Emperor Ninkō. Shichirōmaro was brought up under strict, spartan supervision and tutelage. His father Nariaki followed the example of the second Mito daimyo, Tokugawa Mitsukuni (1661-1690), who had sent all his sons after the firstborn to be raised in Mito. Shichirōmaro was seven months old when he arrived in Mito in 1838. He was taught in the literary and martial arts, as well as receiving a solid education in the principles of politics and government at Kōdōkan.

At the instigation of his father, Shichirōmaro was adopted by the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family in order to have a better chance of succeeding to the shogunate and changed his first name to Akimune (昭致). He became family head in 1847, coming of age that year, receiving court rank and title, and taking the name Yoshinobu. Upon the death of the 13th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Iesada, in 1858, Yoshinobu was nominated as a potential successor. His supporters touted his skill and efficiency in managing family affairs. However, the opposing faction, led by Ii Naosuke, won out. Their candidate, the young Tokugawa Yoshitomi, was chosen, and became the 14th &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemochi. Soon after, during the Ansei Purge, Yoshinobu and others who supported him were placed under house arrest. Yoshinobu himself was made to retire from Hitotsubashi headship.

The period of Ii&#x27;s domination of the Tokugawa government was marked by mismanagement and political infighting. Upon Ii&#x27;s assassination in 1860, Yoshinobu was reinstated as Hitotsubashi family head, and was nominated in 1862 to be the , receiving the position soon afterwards. At the same time, his two closest allies, Matsudaira Yoshinaga and Matsudaira Katamori, were appointed to other high positions: Yoshinaga as , Katamori as . The three men then took numerous steps to quell political unrest in the Kyoto area, and gathered allies to counter the activities of the rebellious Chōshū Domain. They were instrumental figures in the &quot;kōbu gattai&quot; political party, which sought a reconciliation between the shogunate and the imperial court.

In 1864, Yoshinobu, as commander of the imperial palace&#x27;s defense, defeated the Chōshū forces in their attempt to capture the imperial palace&#x27;s in what is called the Kinmon Incident. This was achieved by use of the forces of the Aizu–Satsuma coalition.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1866–1867)==
After the death of Tokugawa Iemochi in 1866, Yoshinobu was chosen to succeed him, and became the 15th &quot;shōgun&quot;. He was the only Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; to spend his entire tenure outside of Edo: he never set foot in Edo Castle as &quot;shōgun&quot;. Immediately upon Yoshinobu&#x27;s ascension as &quot;shōgun&quot;, major changes were initiated. A massive government overhaul was undertaken to initiate reforms that would strengthen the Tokugawa government. In particular, assistance from the Second French Empire was organized, with the construction of the Yokosuka arsenal under Léonce Verny, and the dispatch of a French military mission to modernize the armies of the &quot;bakufu&quot;.

The national army and navy, which had already been formed under Tokugawa command, were strengthened by the assistance of the Russians, and the Tracey Mission provided by the British Royal Navy. Equipment was also purchased from the United States. The outlook among many was that the Tokugawa Shogunate was gaining ground towards renewed strength and power; however, it fell in less than a year.

==Boshin War (1868–69)==
Fearing the renewed strengthening of the Tokugawa shogunate under a strong and wise ruler, samurai from Satsuma, Chōshū and Tosa formed an alliance to counter it. Under the banner of &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; (&quot;revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians!&quot;) coupled with a fear of the new &quot;shōgun&quot; as the &quot;Rebirth of Ieyasu&quot; (家康の再来) who would continue to usurp the power of the Emperor, they worked to bring about an end to the shogunate, though they varied in their approaches. In particular, Tosa was more moderate; it proposed a compromise whereby Yoshinobu would resign as &quot;shōgun&quot;, but preside over a new national governing council composed of various &quot;daimyōs&quot;. To this end, Yamanouchi Toyonori, the lord of Tosa, together with his advisor, Gotō Shōjirō, petitioned Yoshinobu to resign in order to make this possible.

On 9 November 1867, Yoshinobu tendered his resignation to the Emperor and formally stepped down ten days later, returning governing power to the Emperor. He then withdrew from Kyoto to Osaka. However, Satsuma and Chōshū, while supportive of a governing council of &quot;daimyōs&quot;, were opposed to Yoshinobu&#x27;s leading it. They secretly obtained an imperial edict calling for the use of force against Yoshinobu (later shown to be a forgery) and moved a massive number of Satsuma and Chōshū troops into Kyoto. There was a meeting called at the imperial court, where Yoshinobu was stripped of all titles and land, despite having taken no action that could be construed as aggressive or criminal. Any who would have opposed this were not included in the meeting. Yoshinobu opposed this action, and composed a message of protest, to be delivered to the imperial court; at the urging of the leaders of Aizu, Kuwana, and other domains, and in light of the immense number of Satsuma and Chōshū troops in Kyoto, he dispatched a large body of troops to convey this message to the court.

When the Tokugawa forces arrived outside Kyoto, they were refused entry, and were attacked by Satsuma and Chōshū troops, starting the Battle of Toba–Fushimi, the first clash of the Boshin War. Though the Tokugawa forces had a distinct advantage in numbers, Yoshinobu abandoned his army in the midst of the fight once he realized the Satsuma and Chōshū forces raised the Imperial banner, and escaped to Edo. He placed himself under voluntary confinement, and indicated his submission to the imperial court. However, a peace agreement was reached wherein Tayasu Kamenosuke, the young head of a branch of the Tokugawa family, was adopted and made Tokugawa family head; On 11 April 1868, Edo Castle was handed over to the imperial army, and the city spared from all-out war.

Together with Kamenosuke (who took the name Tokugawa Iesato), Yoshinobu moved to Shizuoka. Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, had also retired to Shizuoka, centuries earlier. Iesato was made the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the new Shizuoka Domain, but lost this title a few years later, when the domains were abolished. Even after losing his position as ruling shogun, Yoshinobu strove to promote his son Iesato&#x27;s political career so that he could attain the highest level of influence in the Japanese Imperial court, and also serve as a bridge between old world Japan and modern emerging Japan both domestically and internationally. The close relationship between father and son is highlighted in the illustrated biography on Prince Tokugawa Iesato titled &quot;The Art of Peace&quot;. 

Many of the &quot;hatamoto&quot; also relocated to Shizuoka; a large proportion of them did not find adequate means to support themselves. As a result, many of them resented Yoshinobu, some of them to the point of wanting him dead. Yoshinobu was aware of this, and was so afraid of assassination that he redesigned his sleeping arrangement to confuse any potential assassin.

==Later life==

Living a life in quiet retirement, Yoshinobu indulged in many hobbies, including oil painting, kyudo (archery), hunting, photography, and cycling. Some of Yoshinobu&#x27;s photographs have been published in recent years by his great-grandson, Yoshitomo. His other great-grandson, Yasuhisa Tokugawa of the Mito line, is the former Chief Priest at Yasukuni Shrine and current Kaicho of the Kokusai Budoin (IMAF).

On 3 June 1902, the Emperor Meiji allowed him to re-establish his own house as a Tokugawa branch (&quot;bekke&quot;) with the highest rank in the peerage, that of prince (&quot;kōshaku&quot;), for his loyal service to Japan. He took a seat in the House of Peers, and resigned in 1910. Tokugawa Yoshinobu died on 21 November 1913 at 16:10 and is buried in Yanaka Cemetery, Tokyo.

On 9 January 1896, his ninth daughter Tsuneko Tokugawa (1882–1939) married Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, a second cousin to both Emperor Hirohito and Empress Kōjun and nephew of Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito.

On 26 December 1911, his granddaughter Kikuko Tokugawa was born. She married Prince Takamatsu, the brother of Emperor Hirohito, to become Princess Takamatsu.

His grandson Tokugawa Hiromi graduated as part of the 65th Class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in March 1938. On 12 July 1943, he was killed in action during World War II when the submarine he was deployed on was fired on by the destroyer in Indispensable Strait near Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Shrapnel cut down Tokugawa and two enlisted lookouts, but the submarine was able to dive and escape. Tokugawa was posthumously promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

<text>Doménikos Theotokópoulos (, ; 1 October 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (; &quot;The Greek&quot;), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. &quot;El Greco&quot; was a nickname, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters often adding the word (), which means &quot;Cretan&quot; in Ancient Greek.

El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete), which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, Italy, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570, he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto and Titian. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings, such as &quot;View of Toledo&quot; and &quot;Opening of the Fifth Seal&quot;.

El Greco&#x27;s dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation by the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

==Life==

===Early years and family===

Born in 1541, in either the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had probably been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco&#x27;s father, Geṓrgios Theotokópoulos (; 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Almost nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, except that they were also Greek. His second wife was a Spaniard. El Greco&#x27;s older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531–1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent the last years of his life (1603–1604) in El Greco&#x27;s Toledo home.

El Greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the Cretan school, a leading center of post-Byzantine art. In addition to painting, he probably studied the classics of ancient Greece, and perhaps the Latin classics also; he left a &quot;working library&quot; of 130 volumes at his death, including the Bible in Greek and an annotated Vasari book. Candia was a center for artistic activity where Eastern and Western cultures co-existed harmoniously, where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century, and had organized a painters&#x27; guild, based on the Italian model. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a &quot;master&quot; (&quot;maestro Domenigo&quot;), meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop. Three years later, in June 1566, as a witness to a contract, he signed his name in Greek as (; &quot;Master Ménegos Theotokópoulos, painter&quot;).

Most scholars believe that the Theotokópoulos &quot;family was almost certainly Greek Orthodox&quot;, although some Catholic sources still claim him from birth. Like many Orthodox emigrants to Catholic areas of Europe, some assert that he may have transferred to Catholicism after his arrival, and possibly practiced as a Catholic in Spain, where he described himself as a &quot;devout Catholic&quot; in his will. The extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars, such as Nikolaos Panayotakis, Pandelis Prevelakis and Maria Constantoudaki, indicates strongly that El Greco&#x27;s family and ancestors were Greek Orthodox. One of his uncles was an Orthodox priest, and his name is not mentioned in the Catholic archival baptismal records on Crete. Prevelakis goes even further, expressing his doubt that El Greco was ever a practicing Roman Catholic.

Important for his early biography, El Greco, still in Crete, painted his &quot;Dormition of the Virgin&quot; near the end of his Cretan period, probably before 1567. Three other signed works of &quot;Domḗnicos&quot; are attributed to El Greco (&quot;Modena Triptych&quot;, &quot;St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child&quot;, and &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;).

===Italy===

It was natural for the young El Greco to pursue his career in Venice, Crete having been a possession of the Republic of Venice since 1211. Though the exact year is not clear, most scholars agree that El Greco went to Venice around 1567. Knowledge of El Greco&#x27;s years in Italy is limited. He lived in Venice until 1570 and, according to a letter written by his much older friend, the greatest miniaturist of the age, Giulio Clovio, was a &quot;disciple&quot; of Titian, who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous. This may mean he worked in Titian&#x27;s large studio, or not. Clovio characterized El Greco as &quot;a rare talent in painting&quot;.

In 1570, El Greco moved to Rome, where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice () before he left for Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a guest at the Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (&quot;View of Mt. Sinai&quot; and a portrait of Clovio are among them).

Unlike other Cretan artists who had moved to Venice, El Greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter. His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian. The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light. Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer&#x27;s day while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco was sitting in a darkened room, because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his &quot;inner light&quot;. As a result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism.

By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that &quot;he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint&quot;. However, despite El Greco&#x27;s criticism, Michelangelo&#x27;s influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the &quot;Allegory of the Holy League&quot;. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (&quot;The Purification of the Temple&quot;), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century &quot;Chronicles&quot;, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo&#x27;s teachings.

Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo&#x27;s technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a &quot;foolish foreigner&quot;, and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and hired as assistants the painters Lattanzio Bonastri de Lucignano and Francisco Preboste.

In 1577, El Greco migrated to Madrid and then to Toledo, where he produced his mature works. At the time, Toledo was the religious capital of Spain and a populous city with &quot;an illustrious past, a prosperous present and an uncertain future&quot;. In Rome, El Greco had earned the respect of some intellectuals, but was also facing the hostility of certain art critics. During the 1570s the huge monastery-palace of El Escorial was still under construction and Philip II of Spain was experiencing difficulties in finding good artists for the many large paintings required to decorate it. Titian was dead, and Tintoretto, Veronese and Anthonis Mor all refused to come to Spain. Philip had to rely on the lesser talent of Juan Fernández de Navarrete, of whose &quot;gravedad y decoro&quot; (&quot;seriousness and decorum&quot;) the king approved. When Fernández died in 1579, the moment was ideal for El Greco to move to Toledo.

Through Clovio and Orsini, El Greco met Benito Arias Montano, a Spanish humanist and agent of Philip; Pedro Chacón, a clergyman; and Luis de Castilla, son of Diego de Castilla, the dean of the Cathedral of Toledo. El Greco&#x27;s friendship with Castilla would secure his first large commissions in Toledo. He arrived in Toledo by July 1577, and signed contracts for a group of paintings that was to adorn the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo and for . By September 1579 he had completed nine paintings for Santo Domingo, including &quot;The Trinity&quot; and &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot;. These works would establish the painter&#x27;s reputation in Toledo.

El Greco did not plan to settle permanently in Toledo, since his final aim was to win the favor of Philip and make his mark in his court. Indeed, he did manage to secure two important commissions from the monarch: &quot;Allegory of the Holy League&quot; and &quot;Martyrdom of St. Maurice&quot;. However, the king did not like these works and placed the St Maurice altarpiece in the chapter-house rather than the intended chapel. He gave no further commissions to El Greco. The exact reasons for the king&#x27;s dissatisfaction remain unclear. Some scholars have suggested that Philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that El Greco&#x27;s works violated a basic rule of the Counter-Reformation, namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style. Philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions, and had very decided tastes; a long sought-after sculpted Crucifixion by Benvenuto Cellini also failed to please when it arrived, and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place. Philip&#x27;s next experiment, with Federico Zuccari was even less successful. In any case, Philip&#x27;s dissatisfaction ended any hopes of royal patronage El Greco may have had.

====Mature works and later years====
Lacking the favor of the king, El Greco was obliged to remain in Toledo, where he had been received in 1577 as a great painter. According to Hortensio Félix Paravicino, a 17th-century Spanish preacher and poet, &quot;Crete gave him life and the painter&#x27;s craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through Death he began to achieve eternal life.&quot; In 1585, he appears to have hired an assistant, Italian painter Francisco Preboste, and to have established a workshop capable of producing altar frames and statues as well as paintings. On 12 March 1586 he obtained the commission for &quot;The Burial of the Count of Orgaz&quot;, now his best-known work.

The decade 1597 to 1607 was a period of intense activity for El Greco. During these years he received several major commissions, and his workshop created pictorial and sculptural ensembles for a variety of religious institutions. Among his major commissions of this period were three altars for the Chapel of San José in Toledo (1597–1599); three paintings (1596–1600) for the Colegio de Doña María de Aragon, an Augustinian monastery in Madrid, and the high altar, four lateral altars, and the painting &quot;St. Ildefonso&quot; for the Capilla Mayor of the Hospital de la Caridad (Hospital of Charity) at Illescas (1603–1605). The minutes of the commission of &quot;The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception&quot; (1607–1613), which were composed by the personnel of the municipality, describe El Greco as &quot;one of the greatest men in both this kingdom and outside it&quot;.

Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture; this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life. In 1608, he received his last major commission at the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo.

El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving contracts mention him as the tenant from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he spent the rest of his life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of his only son, Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco&#x27;s grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.

During the course of the execution of a commission for the Hospital de Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and died a month later, on 7 April 1614. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed that his son should have the power to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament (El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.

==Art==
===Technique and style===
The primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of El Greco&#x27;s style. El Greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion. He believed that grace is the supreme quest of art, but the painter achieves grace only by managing to solve the most complex problems with ease.

El Greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting, and declared that color had primacy over form. Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, wrote that the painter liked &quot;the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity&quot; and that &quot;he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature&quot;.

Art historian Max Dvořák was the first scholar to connect El Greco&#x27;s art with Mannerism and Antinaturalism. Modern scholars characterize El Greco&#x27;s theory as &quot;typically Mannerist&quot; and pinpoint its sources in the Neoplatonism of the Renaissance. Jonathan Brown believes that El Greco created a sophisticated form of art; according to Nicholas Penny &quot;once in Spain, El Greco was able to create a style of his own—one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting&quot;.


In his mature works El Greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco&#x27;s perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco&#x27;s preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco&#x27;s mature works; for &quot;The Immaculate Conception (El Greco, Toledo)&quot; El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another &quot;because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure&quot;. A significant innovation of El Greco&#x27;s mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.

Another characteristic of El Greco&#x27;s mature style is the use of light. As Jonathan Brown notes, &quot;each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source&quot;. Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco&#x27;s handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism.

Modern scholarly research emphasizes the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco&#x27;s mature style and stresses the painter&#x27;s ability to adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings. Harold Wethey asserts that &quot;although Greek by descent and Italian by artistic preparation, the artist became so immersed in the religious environment of Spain that he became the most vital visual representative of Spanish mysticism&quot;. He believes that in El Greco&#x27;s mature works &quot;the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain in the period of the Counter-Reformation&quot;.

El Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter&#x27;s features but also to convey their character. His portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings, but are of equally high quality. Wethey says that &quot;by such simple means, the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist, along with Titian and Rembrandt&quot;.

===Painting materials===
El Greco painted many of his paintings on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used the expensive natural ultramarine.

===Suggested Byzantine affinities===
Since the beginning of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco&#x27;s style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco&#x27;s roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco&#x27;s later work.

The discovery of the &quot;Dormition of the Virgin&quot; on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter&#x27;s Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin. Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism. Based on the notes written in El Greco&#x27;s own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art. According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka &quot;far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work&quot;. In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that &quot;despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering&quot;. Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco&#x27;s painting is &quot;neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art&quot;.

The English art historian David Davies seeks the roots of El Greco&#x27;s style in the intellectual sources of his Greek-Christian education and in the world of his recollections from the liturgical and ceremonial aspect of the Orthodox Church. Davies believes that the religious climate of the Counter-Reformation and the aesthetics of Mannerism acted as catalysts to activate his individual technique. He asserts that the philosophies of Platonism and ancient Neo-Platonism, the works of Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the texts of the Church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of El Greco&#x27;s style. Summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue, José Álvarez Lopera, curator at the , Madrid, concludes that the presence of &quot;Byzantine memories&quot; is obvious in El Greco&#x27;s mature works, though there are still some obscure issues concerning his Byzantine origins needing further illumination.

===Architecture and sculpture===
El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime. He usually designed complete altar compositions, working as architect and sculptor as well as painter—at, for instance, the Hospital de la Caridad. There he decorated the chapel of the hospital, but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished. For the master designed the original altar of gilded wood which has been destroyed, but his small sculptured group of the &quot;Miracle of St. Ildefonso&quot; still survives on the lower center of the frame.

His most important architectural achievement was the church and Monastery of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, for which he also executed sculptures and paintings. El Greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting. He is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in Toledo. Pacheco characterized him as &quot;a writer of painting, sculpture and architecture&quot;.

In the marginalia that El Greco inscribed in his copy of Daniele Barbaro&#x27;s translation of Vitruvius&#x27; , he refuted Vitruvius&#x27; attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius&#x27; manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.

==Legacy==
===Posthumous critical reputation===
El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as &quot;contemptible&quot;, &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;worthy of scorn&quot;. The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as &quot;strange&quot;, &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;original&quot;, &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;. The phrase &quot;sunk in eccentricity&quot;, often encountered in such texts, in time developed into &quot;madness&quot;.

With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco&#x27;s works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the &quot;gifted&quot;, the &quot;misunderstood&quot;, the &quot;mad&quot;), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco&#x27;s later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who &quot;painted horrors in the Escorial&quot; in the words of Ephraim Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; in 1899.

In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco&#x27;s works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School. The same year Julius Meier-Graefe, a scholar of French Impressionism, traveled in Spain, expecting to study Velázquez, but instead becoming fascinated by El Greco; he recorded in 1910 his experiences in &quot;Spanische Reise&quot; (&quot;Spanish Journey&quot;, published in English in 1926), the book which widely established El Greco as a great painter of the past &quot;outside a somewhat narrow circle&quot;. In El Greco&#x27;s work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowing of modernity. These are the words Meier-Graefe used to describe El Greco&#x27;s impact on the artistic movements of his time:

To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best &quot;with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public&quot;. Fry described El Greco as &quot;an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way&quot;.

During the same period, other researchers developed alternative, more radical theories. The ophthalmologists August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular; the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana. Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated that &quot;to Greeks [El Greco] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard&quot;.

Epitomizing the consensus of El Greco&#x27;s impact, Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, said in April 1980 that El Greco was &quot;the most extraordinary painter that ever came along back then&quot; and that he was &quot;maybe three or four centuries ahead of his time&quot;.

===Influence on other artists===


According to Efi Foundoulaki, &quot;painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century &#x27;discovered&#x27; a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves&quot;. His expressiveness and colors influenced Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet. To the Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that &quot;mystical inner construction&quot; that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was Paul Cézanne, one of the forerunners of Cubism. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and (in appearance only) unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, &quot;Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them&quot;. Fry observed that Cézanne drew from &quot;his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme&quot;.

The Symbolists, and Pablo Picasso during his Blue Period, drew on the cold tonality of El Greco, utilizing the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on his Proto-Cubist , he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Opening of the Fifth Seal&quot; (owned by Zuloaga since 1897). The relation between and the &quot;Opening of the Fifth Seal&quot; was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed.

The early Cubist explorations of Picasso were to uncover other aspects in the work of El Greco: structural analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights. Several traits of Cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco&#x27;s work. According to Picasso, El Greco&#x27;s structure is Cubist. On 22 February 1950, Picasso began his series of &quot;paraphrases&quot; of other painters&#x27; works with &quot;The Portrait of a Painter after El Greco&quot;. Foundoulaki asserts that Picasso &quot;completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by Cézanne&quot;.

The expressionists focused on the expressive distortions of El Greco. According to Franz Marc, one of the principal painters of the German expressionist movement, &quot;we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art&quot;. Jackson Pollock, a major force in the abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco. By 1943, Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master.

Pollock influenced the artist Joseph Glasco&#x27;s interest in El Greco&#x27;s art. Glasco created several contemporary paintings based on one of his favorite subjects, El Greco&#x27;s View of Toledo.

Kysa Johnson used El Greco&#x27;s paintings of the Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master&#x27;s anatomical distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut&#x27;s portraits.

El Greco&#x27;s personality and work were a source of inspiration for poet Rainer Maria Rilke. One set of Rilke&#x27;s poems (&quot;Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II.&quot;, 1913) was based directly on El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;. Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis, who felt a great spiritual affinity for El Greco, called his autobiography &quot;Report to Greco&quot; and wrote a tribute to the Cretan-born artist.

In 1998, the Greek electronic composer and artist Vangelis published &quot;El Greco&quot;, a symphonic album inspired by the artist. This album is an expansion of an earlier album by Vangelis, (&quot;A Tribute to El Greco&quot;, ). The life of the Cretan-born artist is the subject of the film &quot;El Greco&quot; of Greek, Spanish and British production. Directed by Ioannis Smaragdis, the film began shooting in October 2006 on the island of Crete and debuted on the screen one year later; British actor Nick Ashdon was cast to play El Greco.

In reference to El Greco, the Austrian artist Matthias Laurenz Gräff created his large-format religious triptych &quot;Weltenalegorie&quot; (World allegory) in 2009, which contains various figures from El Greco&#x27;s paintings.

==Debates on attribution==

The exact number of El Greco&#x27;s works has been a hotly contested issue. In 1937, a highly influential study by art historian Rodolfo Pallucchini had the effect of greatly increasing the number of works accepted to be by El Greco. Pallucchini attributed to El Greco a small triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena on the basis of a signature on the painting on the back of the central panel on the Modena triptych (&quot;&quot;, Created by the hand of Doménikos). There was consensus that the triptych was indeed an early work of El Greco and, therefore, Pallucchini&#x27;s publication became the yardstick for attributions to the artist. Nevertheless, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any connection at all with the artist and, in 1962, produced a reactive catalogue with a greatly reduced corpus of materials. Whereas art historian José Camón Aznar had attributed between 787 and 829 paintings to the Cretan master, Wethey reduced the number to 285 authentic works and Halldor Sœhner, a German researcher of Spanish art, recognized only 137. Wethey and other scholars rejected the notion that Crete took any part in his formation and supported the elimination of a series of works from El Greco&#x27;s .

Since 1962, the discovery of the &quot;Dormition&quot; and the extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that Wethey&#x27;s assessments were not entirely correct, and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted the perception of the whole nature of El Greco&#x27;s origins, development and . The discovery of the &quot;Dormition&quot; led to the attribution of three other signed works of &quot;Doménicos&quot; to El Greco (&quot;Modena Triptych&quot;, &quot;St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child&quot;, and &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;) and then to the acceptance of more works as authentic—some signed, some not (such as &quot;The Passion of Christ (Pietà with Angels)&quot; painted in 1566),—which were brought into the group of early works of El Greco. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate his early style, some painted while he was still on Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome. Even Wethey accepted that &quot;he [El Greco] probably had painted the little and much disputed triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete&quot;. Nevertheless, disputes over the exact number of El Greco&#x27;s authentic works remain unresolved, and the status of Wethey&#x27;s catalogue is at the center of these disagreements.

A few sculptures, including &quot;Epimetheus and Pandora&quot;, have been attributed to El Greco. This doubtful attribution is based on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco&#x27;s studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 2010 the heirs of the Baron Mor Lipot Herzog, a Jewish Hungarian art collector who had been looted by the Nazis, filed a restitution claim for El Greco&#x27;s &quot;The Agony in the Garden&quot;. In 2015, El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Gentleman&quot;, which had been looted by the Nazis from German Jewish art collector Julius Priester in 1944, was returned to his heirs after it surfaced at an auction with a fake provenance. According to Anne Webber, co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, the painting&#x27;s provenance had been &quot;scrubbed&quot;.

<text>The Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing (CAC), housed at Frank H. T. Rhodes Hall on the campus of Cornell University, is one of five original centers in the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Supercomputer Centers Program. It was formerly called the Cornell Theory Center.

==Establishment==
The Cornell Theory Center (CTC) was established in 1985 under the direction of Cornell Physics Professor and Nobel Laureate Kenneth G. Wilson. In 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the CTC, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications began the development of NSFNet, a TCP/IP-based computer network that could connect to the ARPANET at Cornell University and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-kbit/s network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5-Mbit/s T1s in 1988 and to 45 Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the Internet and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the World Wide Web. In the early 1990s, in addition to support from the National Science Foundation, the CTC received funding from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Institutes of Health, New York State, IBM Corporation, SGI, and members of the center&#x27;s Corporate Research Institute. The center&#x27;s focus was on developing scalable parallel computing resources for its user community and applying their expertise in parallel algorithm development and optimization to a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.

==History==
In 1995, the building that houses what was then known as the Cornell Theory Center was named Frank H. T. Rhodes Hall which currently houses the Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing.

The Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing, and its predecessor the Cornell Theory Center, deployed the first IBM Scalable POWERparallel System SP2 supercomputer and first Dell supercomputer, and established a financial solutions center for supercomputing.

Today, CAC is a partner on the National Science Foundation XSEDE project, a collection of integrated digital resources and services enabling open science research. CAC is also developing training for TACC&#x27;s Frontera supercomputer, serving as the technical lead for the Scalable Cyberinfrastructure Institute for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (SCiMMA) project, developing software for the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP), and designing cyberinfrastructure for the NANOGrav Physics Frontiers Center.

A 175 times faster computation of a CDC hepatitis C model on a CAC MATLAB cloud is noted in the International Data Corporation&#x27;s What the Exascale Era Can Provide report. CAC was an early implementer of cloud computing with the deployment of Red Cloud. CAC also designed and deployed a federated cloud called Aristotle and builds cloud images and containerizes applications for efficiency and portability.

Under the Office of the Vice Provost for Research, CAC provides Cornell faculty, staff, and students, the national research community, and industry with a range of high performance computing and consulting services. Organizations that have participated in CAC&#x27;s Partner Program include Boeing, Corning, Dell, Ford, HypoVereinsbank, Intel, Microsoft, Pfizer, and start-ups whose technologies have been acquired. The Center is under the direction of David Lifka and Richard Knepper.

==Building==
Rhodes Hall is an eight-story building occupying a narrow, triangular site between Hoy Road and Cascadilla Gorge. 

In 1989, blueprints and material samples were used to simulate new areas of the building before it was complete. Images of the building&#x27;s stair tower were computed with a ray tracer using soft shadowing techniques.

<text>CORC (the Cornell computing language) was a simple computer language developed at Cornell University in 1962 to serve lay users, namely for students to use to solve math problems. Its developers, industrial engineering professors Richard W. Conway and William L. Maxwell, sought to create a language which could both expose mathematics and engineering students to computing and remove the burden of mechanical problem-solving from their professors.

CORC was designed with ease of use in mind. It contained strains of both FORTRAN and ALGOL but was much simpler. Since programs were tediously input with punched cards, the compiler had a high tolerance for error, attempting to bypass or even correct problem sections of code. Students could submit a program by 5 PM which would be compiled or run overnight, with results available the next morning.

It was initially run on the Burroughs 220 and later extended to the CDC 1604. In 1966 it was superseded by CUPL, a batch compiler for teaching which ran on the IBM System/360.

An extension of CORC, the Cornell List Processor (CLP), was a list processing language used for simulation.

JOSS (acronym for JOHNNIAC Open Shop System) was one of the first interactive, time-sharing programming languages. It pioneered many features that would become common in languages from the 1960s into the 1980s, including use of line numbers as both editing instructions and targets for branches, statements predicated by Boolean decisions, and a built-in source-code editor that can perform instructions in direct or immediate mode, what they termed a &quot;conversational user interface&quot;.

JOSS was initially implemented on the JOHNNIAC machine at RAND Corporation and put online in 1963. It proved very popular, and the users quickly bogged the machine down. By 1964, a replacement was sought with higher performance. JOHNNIAC was retired in 1966 and replaced by a PDP-6, which ultimately grew to support hundreds of computer terminals based on the IBM Selectric. The terminals used green ink for user input and black for the computer&#x27;s response. Any command that was not understood elicited the response .

The system was highly influential, spawning a variety of ports and offshoots. Some remained similar to the original, like TELCOMP and STRINGCOMP, CAL, CITRAN, ISIS, PIL/I, JEAN (ICT 1900 series), BOSS and INTERP on the Burroughs B5500, Algebraic Interpretive Dialogue (AID, on PDP-10). Others, such as FOCAL and MUMPS, developed in distinctive directions. JOSS also bears a strong resemblance to the BASIC interpreters found on microcomputers in the 1980s, differing mainly in syntax details.

==History==
===Initial idea===
In 1959, Willis Ware wrote a RAND memo on the topic of computing in which he stated future computers would have &quot;a multiplicity of personal input-output stations, so that many people can interact with the machine at the same time.&quot; The memo gained the interest of the US Air Force, Rand&#x27;s primary sponsors, and in 1960, they formed the Information Processor Project to explore this concept, what would soon be known as time-sharing. The project was not specifically about time-sharing, but aimed to improve human-computer interaction overall. The idea at the time was that constant interaction between the user and the computer in a back-and-forth manner would make such interactions more natural. As JOSS director Keith Uncapher later put it:

A formal proposal to develop what became JOSS on the JOHNNIAC computer was accepted in March 1961.

===JOSS-1===
JOSS was implemented almost entirely by J. Clifford Shaw, a mathematician who worked in Rand&#x27;s growing computing division. It was written in a symbolic assembly language called EasyFox (E and F in the US military&#x27;s then phonetic alphabet), also developed by Shaw.

The JOSS system was brought up formally for the first time in May 1963, supporting five consoles, one in the machine room and another four in offices around the building. The early consoles were based in the IBM Model 868 Transmitting Typewriter, as the Selectric had not yet been introduced to market when development began. The first schedule was published on 17 June, with JOSS running for three hours from 9am to 12 every day. It was declared fully operational on eight terminals in January 1964. The final version was deployed in January 1965.

By this time the JOHNNIAC was already over a decade old, and its tube-based logic was never highly reliable to begin with. Even when it was working well, the system became so popular it quickly bogged down. Users were enthusiastic, one stated:

Another put it more succinctly:

===JOSS-2 switchover===
In May 1964, the decision was made to look for a new machine to replace the JOHNNIAC and dedicate it entirely to running an expanded version of JOSS. The machine would also have to support new terminals made to Rand&#x27;s specifications, and be delivered by 31 October 1965.

A total of nine bids were received for the new machine. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) won the contest with their new PDP-6 system, and Air Force funding was released for the purchase. DEC also agreed to build thirty terminals based on the IBM Selectric typewriter modified with a special mechanism to advance to the next page in a fan-fold paper feed. Several other portions of the overall system were delivered from other companies.

The PDP-6 arrived in late July 1965, and was initially tested using Teletype Model 33&#x27;s as terminals. The new version of the code was developed by Charles L. Baker, Joseph W. Smith, Irwin D. Greenwald, and G. Edward Bryan. The system was first declared operational in October, although this included six hours of scheduled maintenance per week. The first prototype terminal arrived in November. In December, a terminal in Las Vegas was connected to the machine remotely for the first time. In February 1966, this was sent to McClellan Air Force Base, followed by one in August to the Air Force Academy and two in September to ARPA and an Air Force office in the Pentagon. The first permanent offsite teletype connection for a Teletype Model 35 was installed at the Langley Air Force Base in February 1967.

With the new machine up and running, JOHNNIAC was taken offline on 11 February 1966, and officially retired on 18 February. Its last running program was written in JOSS and counted down seconds until it would be turned off. The machine was sent to the Los Angeles County Museum, and eventually ended up at the Computer History Museum outside San Francisco. Having been replaced by the JOSS-2 system, the original was retroactively known as JOSS-1.

===JOSS-2 use===
By the end of 1966 the new JOSS-2 system was fully functional and turned over to JOSS use 24/7. The new machine offered about 30 times the computational speed, five times the storage space per user, and many new features in the language itself. The new platform could ultimately support up to 100 terminals in simultaneous use. The Air Force remained the owner of the system, with Rand and others operating as consultants. CPU time was billed out to external users at a rate of about $1 per minute, although that was only during the actual execution; time spent typing and printing was free.

By 1970, there were between 500 and 600 users at Rand and various Air Force sites across the country. Many of these were occasional users, precisely what the system had been intended for. To support them, the custom terminals were equipped with special &quot;JOSS plugs&quot; so they could be wheeled from office to office and plugged into custom outlets. Two-hundred of the plugs were installed around Rand, and the terminal chassis was designed to be narrow enough to fit through doors while still leaving room for a coffee on one side. Toggling the power switch on the terminal caused it to connect at the new location.

The custom terminals had been designed for JOSS as the engineers felt that the Model 33&#x27;s &quot;telecommunications functions are a mystery to the untrained person&quot; and would be too confusing for the occasional users to bother learning. In practice, the Selectric-based mechanisms proved too fragile for the constant use they saw and were frequently being repaired in the field by IBM servicemen. In 1970, a full third of the terminals were completely rebuilt, and the output from the computer slowed to improve reliability. The Air Force, by this time, had decided to use the Model 35 instead, as it was both readily available and much less expensive.

Uses were enthusiastic and to serve them, Rand began publishing &quot;The JOSS Newsletter&quot;, edited by Shirley Marks. Ultimately 44 issues were published between November 1967 and June 1971.

===JOSS-3===
In the early 1970s, programmers at one of IBM&#x27;s west coast facilities built a JOSS-3 for the IBM 370/158 running OS/360. Little information about this system exists, with the exception that it was on this machine that JOSS finally retired. According to a note in a historical overview, Rand was hesitant to allow IBM to use the JOSS name, and as a result &quot;the IBM version was never widely used.&quot;

==Implementation==
JOSS-II on the PDP-6 was divided into two parts, matching the internal memory layout of the machine. The machine was equipped with two banks of core memory, with 16k 36-bit words in each bank. The JOSS system itself, which included the operating system, user and file management code, terminal handler and the interpreter, used up much of the first of these banks. The second bank was used for user programs. Although this was a relatively large amount of memory for the era, the system was so heavily used that the 16k word user store was not enough, and it was backed up with a magnetic drum for paging support. The drum was driven by external hardware and did not require attention from the main processor.

In order to support multiple user programs, the PDP-6 hardware was modified to examine bit-20 of any address reference. If this bit was set, the address was in &quot;user space&quot; and was modified so that address zero pointed to the base address of that user. In this way, user programs could be moved about in memory without causing problems for the system, and the operating system could switch from user to user simply by changing a single internal register.

Permanent storage was provided by a Storage Products hard drive with 5.7 million words of storage. Like the drum, the actual input/output to and from the drum was handled externally, although in this case the movement was triggered by user actions to load and store their programs. An IBM-compatible tape drive was used to move data to and from the drive as needed, an operation that was also independent of the CPU. Two DECtape units were also available and worked in the same fashion as the IBM drive. Demonstration programs were available, such as a mortgage calculator and early mainframe games. Because large programs caused paging that slowed the computer for all, &quot;The JOSS Newsletter&quot; often asked users to use less storage. 

Terminals were handled through a custom &quot;concentrator&quot; that consisted of a mechanical Strowger switch that could connect any of the 300 to 400 possible terminal plugs to any of 40 outputs. A further eight lines were dedicated to Teletype Model 33 inputs, as opposed to the JOSS-style Selectrics. Those 48 lines were then connected to an electronic multiplexer connected to the CPU. The multiplexer was interrupt driven, meaning idle terminals did not use up any cycles.

The custom JOSS terminals were built by DEC. These consisted of a Selectric mechanism built into a custom chassis containing the communications system, power supply, and other components. A custom font ball was used to provide basic mathematical symbols like ≠ so two-character combinations like &lt;&gt; did not have to be used. The communications system was based on a 6-bit character code in an 8-bit packet with start and stop bits. The lines were driven at 120 bit/s to match the maximum 15 character per second speed of the Selectric mechanism. Shift-in and shift-out codes were used to move the ribbon from green to black and back. These codes were also noticed by the communications system and changed lights on the front panel to indicate whether the computer or user had control of the terminal at that moment.

==Language==
JOSS so emphasized user-friendliness that &quot;JOSS-like&quot; became a descriptor of a new user interacting with a time-sharing system. Children and others said that unlike a &quot;complicated&quot; computer, JOSS was &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;kind&quot; like &quot;a real person with a sense of humor&quot;, with funny responses like . 

===Direct and indirect mode===
JOSS introduced the idea of a single command line editor that worked both as an interactive language and a program editor. Commands that were typed without a line number were executed immediately, in what JOSS referred to as &quot;direct mode&quot;. If the same line was prefixed with a line number, it was instead copied into the program code storage area, which JOSS called &quot;indirect mode&quot;. New lines were added to the program if the line number was unique, replaced extant lines with the same number, or removed from the program if an extant line number was typed in with no code following it.

In contrast to most BASICs, JOSS saved the entire user input to files, not just the program code. When loaded, JOSS essentially typed the lines back in. This meant that &quot;program files&quot; could contain both program statements and direct mode instructions. For instance, it was common to see programs that listed the statement lines and then have the file end with to immediately run the program as soon as it completed loading. There were some features that could only be used in direct mode, like and , which were input without line numbers but still returned when the program was loaded.

Direct and indirect instructions could be mixed freely in a workspace. This allowed comments to be inserted in source code by adding direct-mode lines beginning with , or by placing one at the end of a line of code and then adding a comment after it. Blank lines were also ignored, allowing the program to be broken up for clarity.

===Program statements===
Every line in a JOSS program must start with a line number. Line numbers are fixed-point numbers consisting of two two-digit integers separated by a period. As in BASIC, line numbers are used both as labels to target from and statements, and to support editing. Entering a line of code with a new line number inserts it into a program, while entering one with an extant line number replaces the prior version or deletes it if it is empty.

The portion of the line number to the left of the period is termed the &quot;page&quot; or &quot;part&quot;, while the portion to the right is termed the &quot;line&quot;. Thus the line number refers to page 10, line 12. Branches can target either a page, or a line within a page. When the latter format is used, the combined page and line is termed a &quot;step&quot;.

Pages are used to define subroutines, which return when the next line is on a different page. For instance, if a subroutine for calculating the square root of a number is in page 3, one might have three lines of code 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, and it would be called using The code would return to the statement after the Do when it reaches the next line on a different page, for instance, 4.1. No need exists for the equivalent of a at the end, although if an early return is required, accomplishes this.

Every line must start with a command keyword following the line number. No concept of a &quot;default command&quot; exists as is the case in BASIC with its optional statement. Multiple statements can be placed on one line, separated by colons or semicolons. Every line must end with a period.

===Loops and conditions===
JOSS uses a suffix notation to indicate conditional evaluation, &quot;do this if this is true&quot;, in contrast to most languages which place the condition in front in prefix notation, &quot;if this is true, do this&quot;. Unlike FORTRAN or FOCAL, any statement can be conditionally evaluated in this fashion. For example, to print a string only if a condition is met, one can combine the if with a :

 1.1 Type &quot;Hello, World!&quot; if X=5.

JOSS supported six infix comparisons, , , , , , , and Boolean operators , , and .

Loops were handled in a similar fashion, using the command and a somewhat obscure format for specifying the loop bounds and step value, . For instance, to step from 1 to 10 by 2, the format is . Like , could be applied to any other statement:

 1.2 Type &quot;Hello, Wikipedia!&quot; for i=1(2)10.

Note that the for applies only to a single statement; if one wants to run multiple statements in a loop, they would be separated to another part and called using do:

 1.3 Do part 5 for i=1(1)100.
 5.1 Type &quot;Hello, Wikipedia!&quot;.
 5.2 Type &quot;This is JOSS.&quot;.

As in BASIC, any of the inputs to the for loop could be constants, variables or other expressions.

As these sorts of ranges could be applied to any line of code, it was possible to define limits and loops when the program was invoked. For instance, consider the program:

 1.1 Type X.

Normally if one invoked this in a fashion similar to BASIC&#x27;s :

 Do part 1.

It would produce:

 0

However, one can modify this behaviour by adding a loop construct to the invocation:

 Do part 1 for X = 1(1)5.

Which would produce:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

This allows formulas to be constructed in programs without having to be placed within loops. Looping, if desired, can be provided by the user when they start the program.

===Expressions and propositions===
A unique feature of JOSS was its handling of logical expressions. Most computer languages offer some way to form a multi-part mathematical expression, for instance, which sets the variable x to the value 9. JOSS expanded on this concept by clearly defining the concept of the &quot;proposition&quot;, an expression that returns a logical value, true or false, instead of a numeric one. They were mostly seen in statements, as in the examples above, but the Boolean value could also be stored in a variable directly, or one could convert true to 1 and false to 0 using the (truth value) function.

In addition to propositions, JOSS also had the concept of &quot;conditional expressions&quot;. These consisted of strings of propositions along with code that would run if that proposition was true. This allowed multi-step decision trees to be written in a single line. They serve a purpose similar to the ternary operator found in modern languages like C or Java, where they are used to return a value from a compact structure implementing if-then-else. JOSS&#x27; version has any number of conditionals, not just three, so it is more of a compact switch statement than a compact if-then.

This example recreates the function of the function:

 Let s(x)=[x=0:0; x&gt;0:1; x&lt;0:-1].

This defines a function &quot;s&quot; which takes a single parameter, &quot;x&quot;, and makes three consecutive tests against it. Whichever test succeeds first returns the corresponding value after the colon.

===Ranges===
Another advanced feature of JOSS was that it had the concept of a range as a built-in type that could be stored and manipulated. Ranges are normally found as the inputs to for loops, where they are part of the syntax of the loop itself. For instance, in BASIC one writes a for loop using this basic syntax:

This will perform a loop that assigns I the values 1, 3, 5 and then exits.

JOSS used a somewhat obscure format to define the limits of the loop. The equivalent code in JOSS would be:

 I=1(2)5

Note that this code does not include a for. That is because in JOSS, ranges are first-class citizens of the language, not something that is part of a loop as in BASIC. Ranges can be defined and used in many contexts outside loops. For example, here is a conditional expression that evaluates the factorial of a parameter x:

 Let f(x)=[x=0:1 ; fp(x)=0:prod(i=1(1)x:i)].

In this example, there are two main propositions, separated by the semicolon. The first, on the left, states that if the parameter x is 0, the condition should immediately return 1. If that proposition fails, it moves to the second test, on the right. This one checks if the fractional part of x is zero (i.e., it is an integer), and if so, it calls the function to multiply a range of values. The &#x27;s parameter is also a proposition, but in this case, the test is replaced by a loop iterator that runs from 1 to x stepping by 1. If that proposition is true, which is it for all values of the loop, it returns the index i. This causes a series of values to be sent into from 1 to x.

The combination of these features allows for complex functions to be written in a few commands. This sort of functionality has only become common in much more modern languages, which typically use iterators or a map function to provide the same outcomes. JOSS&#x27;s capability to combine decisions and loops in a compact form is unknown in other languages of the era, including offshoots like FOCAL.

=== Commands ===
====Set====
The command assigns the results of an expression to the specified variable. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .
 01.30 Set p=3.14156.
 01.60 Set i=l*(r/100)*t.

 was optional when used in direct mode, where one could type without the Set command. This was not allowed in indirect mode, in contrast to BASIC.

====Let====
 was used to define user-defined functions. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .

 Let t(x)=sin(x)/cos(x).
 Set j=t(1.1).
 Type j.

 can also be used to set the value of a variable using a formula consisting of a constant:

 Let x=5.

From that point, it can be used identically to one created using . There is a subtle difference, however, when this X is referenced in code, the value will be calculated by evaluating the right-hand side. A is only evaluated once, so it is much faster.

The system generally suggested using only in direct mode, saving them out for use in a program by inserting them at the top or bottom of the file. This avoided the being called multiple times during execution, as it would only be called once during the loading process.

====Demand====
The takes a list of variables and stores the user input in variables. The optional qualifier added a custom prompt. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .

 01.01 Type &quot;What is your age?&quot;.
 01.02 Demand A.
 01.03 Type &quot;You are&quot;, A.
 01.04 Demand H as &quot;What is your height?&quot;.
 01.05 Type H,&quot;? That tall?&quot;.

====Type====
The command outputs one or more items separated by commas. In its basic form it is equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s . However, includes a number of optional forms that make it highly overloaded, performing a range of unrelated output tasks.

When used to print values, the parameters can be variables, literal strings surrounded by double-quotes, and the special character that produces a line feed. also supports formatted output using format strings. See the section on below for details.

Type is also used as the equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s statement, writing out the program. For instance, will print out a single line of code, while will print out the entire part, and prints out the entire program.

Further, it can also be used to print lists of internal values. produces a list of all variables and their values, while prints out the program size. Keywords include , and .

====Page====
 triggers a page feed on the special JOSS terminals. JOSS would normally send a page feed when the terminal reached line 54 on the paper, so if one wanted to ensure a block of data would not be split in half, one could:

 1.10 Page if $&gt;44.

 is a pseudo-variable that returns the current line number.

====Line====
 triggers a line feed on the special JOSS terminals.

====To====
The command jumps program execution to the specified part or step number, using or respectively. It is the equivalent of BASIC&#x27;s . Contrast with , an indirect command used from the command line that starts programs, the equivalent of BASIC&#x27;s .
 01.01 Demand A as &quot;TYPE A NUMBER&quot;.
 01.05 To step 1.01.
 01.10 To part 1.

====Do====
 is similar to , but branches to a subroutine. As with , you can or . If a step is provided, that single line is run and then returns to the statement after the . If a part is provided, execution starts at the first line of the block and continues until the end of the block is reached or a statement is encountered.
 01.15 Do step 7.24.
 01.16 Do part 8.

 had one special short form for looking in keeping with it being very common in most programs. This used the modifier instead of a normal , in the case for simple loops. So the following lines are equivalent:

 Do part 1 for i=1(1)5.
 Do part 1, 5 times.

JOSS maintains a pointer to the currently executing line, which a would change. However, it included a special &quot;parenthetic do&quot; that could be used in direct mode to test certain sections of the code without changing the main pointer. For instance, if the program stopped due to an error and it was not clear which section caused the problem, one might test a particular subroutine with:

 (Do part 2.)

====Done====
The command returns from a subroutine call. As subroutines return automatically when the end of the part is reached, is only required for returning early, and is often used with a conditional. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s .
 *Routine to ask the user for a positive value and repeat until it gets one
 01.10 Demand X as &quot;Enter a positive value greater than zero&quot;.
 01.20 Done if X&gt;0.
 01.30 To step 1.1

====Stop====
The command terminates execution of the program and returns control to the editing environment. Equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s or , although BASIC&#x27;s is intended to allow to pick up execution at the same location, a feature that has no direct equivalent in JOSS&#x27;s workspace-oriented system.
 01.10 Type X.
 01.20 Stop.

====Go====
Available in direct mode only, is the equivalent to BASIC&#x27;s and , depending on whether a program is currently stopped due to an error or command being encountered.

====Cancel====
Another direct-mode-only command, is used when the program has stopped for an error and the user wants to reset the program, which it does by clearing the program counter. A would pick up at the last location, but issuing a makes start at the top again. If the current breakpoint was due to a parenthetical , one can issue a parenthetical cancel, , to stop just that sub-execution and allow a to continue at the last non-parenthetical line.

===Math===
JOSS stored all numbers as radix-10 floating point.

JOSS contained six mathematical operators:
* for addition
* for subtraction
* for multiplication (the interpunct, not period) 
* for division
* for exponents
* for absolute value, with an expression in the middle

Mathematical expressions could use () and [] interchangeably in matched pairs to establish precedence. For instance:

 1.30 Set A=|-10·[5+1]·(1+5)|.

Would produce 360.

===Functions===
The language contained the following built-in functions:

====Math====
* - Sine of an angle given in radians
* - Cosine
* - Takes X and Y values of a point and returns the angle between that point and the x-axis
* - Naperian log
* - Natural base to the power of the argument
* - Square root
* - Sign of the argument, 0 returns 0, -ve values -1, +ve +1
* - Integer part of the argument, returns 22026
* - Fractional part, returns .4658
* - Digit part, returns 2.20264658
* - Exponent part, returns 4, the location of the decimal

====Boolean====
* - Truth value, returns 1 if the expression is true, 0 otherwise

====Looping functions====
JOSS also defined a number of functions that performed looping internally, in order to avoid the programmer having to write a loop to perform simple tasks like summing a series of numbers. The parameters could be either a list of simple expressions separated by commas, or a range construct whose command could be any statement or function call.

* - Maximum value of the provided expressions
* - Minimum
* - Sum
* - Product
* - First item in the list that matches a condition, returns that result

==File management==
The JOSS system used a hard disk to store user programs in an allocated space. Within that space were a number of files that were referred to using a multi-part filename consisting of an integer and a five-letter name in parentheses, for instance, . The integer part is the equivalent of a directory, and the name is the sub-file within it, maintained by JOSS itself.

Files are written with and loaded with . One could also read or save only certain parts of the workspace, for instance to save a single routine to a file. Additionally, one could set a default file to which all references were assumed with Files could be deleted with .

==Sample program==
 1.1 Demand p,q.
 1.2 Stop if q&lt;0 or r(q,2)=0.
 1.3 Set a=1.
 1.4 Do part 2 while q&gt;1 and a≠0.
 1.5 Type a in form 3.
 1.6 Stop.
 2.1 Do part 20.
 2.1 Do part 11 if p&lt;0.
 2.2 Do part 12 if p≥q.
 2.3 Do part 13 if p=0.
 2.4 Done if a=0.
 2.5 Set p=p/4 while r(p,4)=0.
 2.6 Do part 14 if r(p,2)=0.
 2.7 Do part 20.
 2.8 Set a=-a if r(p,4)=r(q,4)=3.
 2.9 Set s=p, p=q, q=s.
 2.95 Do part 20.
 11.1 Set a=-a if r(q,4)=3.
 11.2 Set p=|p|.
 11.3 Do part 20.
 12.1 Set p=r(p,q).
 12.2 Do part 20.
 13.1 Set a=0, p=1, q=1.
 14.1 Set a=-a if r(q,8)=3 or r(q,8)=5.
 14.2 Set p=p/2.
 20.1 Type p, q in form 1 if a=1.
 20.2 Type p, q in form 2 if a=-1.
 Form 1: &quot; L(%.0f,%.0f) =&quot;
 Form 2: &quot; -L(%.0f,%.0f) =&quot;
 Form 3: &quot; %.0f\n&quot;

Note that this is not an original sample, but rather one from a modern simulator. There are some syntactic differences from the original JOSS language.

<doc id="140648" wikidata="Q1199348" url="?curid=140648" title="The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul">
<text>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is a 1988 humorous fantasy detective novel by Douglas Adams. It is the second book by Adams featuring private detective Dirk Gently, the first being &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;. Adams had intended to follow it with a third such novel, &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, but he died before completing it; an unfinished draft is included in a posthumously published collection of the same name.

&quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; has been adapted for radio, and several plot lines appear in the 2010 BBC TV series.

==Title==
The title is a phrase that appeared in Adams&#x27; novel &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; to describe the wretched boredom of immortal being Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged, and is a play on the theological treatise &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;, by Saint John of the Cross.

The novel is named for that time on a Sunday, after afternoon but before evening, as the weekend had finished but the week had not yet begun, that occurred to Adams as a listless limbo of the working man:
==Plot summary==
While trying to purchase an airline ticket to Oslo at Heathrow Airport, American journalist Kate Schechter finds herself in line behind a large blond man who also wants to get on the flight but has no identification or means to pay. The check-in counter is suddenly consumed by fire, and both Kate and the man are taken to a hospital with injuries. The man is later removed from the hospital, along with his short-handled sledgehammer and a Coca-Cola vending machine, and Kate checks herself out in order to find where he has gone.

Meanwhile, &quot;holistic&quot; detective Dirk Gently wakes up several hours late for a meeting with songwriter Geoffrey Anstey, a new client. Anstey had engaged Dirk to protect him from a green-eyed giant armed with a scythe, saying that it had to do with a contract he had signed. When Dirk arrives at Anstey&#x27;s home, he finds the man&#x27;s body in a chair and his head on a record turntable. Searching the home, he discovers an envelope marked with several names, all of which are crossed out except for Anstey&#x27;s, and gets his nose broken by Anstey&#x27;s son while trying to question him. The boy is watching a television news broadcast on the Heathrow incident, which mentions that a check-in clerk has gone missing; Dirk recognises her as his former secretary.

At the private Woodshead Hospital, which caters to wealthy patients with bizarre medical afflictions, a one-eyed old man is removed and put into a van for transport to a new location during a visit by Kate. While following the van, she has a chance encounter with Dirk, who takes particular interest in her mention of a short man she saw accompanying the old patient.

Returning to her home, Kate finds the blond man - actually the Norse god Thor — waiting for her and in need of first aid after being glued to a wooden floor and attacked by a hostile eagle. The old patient is his father Odin, against whom he has a long-standing grudge over being repeatedly punished for losing his temper, and the short man is Odin&#x27;s goblin-like assistant Toe Rag. The eagle eventually departs and makes its way into Dirk&#x27;s home, trying repeatedly to attack him as he examines the document he found in Anstey&#x27;s home.

Even though Dirk cannot read the printed language, the formatting of the document suggests to him that it is not a contract, but rather a bill for services rendered. He discovers that the homeless persons sleeping in and around the St Pancras railway station are actually various gods whose status has declined drastically over the centuries, due to mortals&#x27; reduced need for them. He follows them into Valhalla, where Thor has issued a challenge to Odin but failed to show up. The challenge concerns the sale of Odin&#x27;s powers to a married couple, lawyer Clive Draycott and his advertising-executive wife Cynthia, who are also in attendance. Unable to support himself in the modern world, Odin had sold his powers to finance his admission to Woodshead, where he could live in comfort. The Draycotts in turn re-sold portions of that power to other parties, but Toe Rag became involved and tried to bill them for his time. The bill was passed from one buyer to another, finally reaching Anstey, and Toe Rag had him killed by the scythe-carrying giant when the payment deadline came.

Thor takes Kate to Valhalla, but all the other gods have departed and he ends up facing Odin alone. Angry over not being able to reach him by flying to Oslo, Thor had lost control of his powers, transforming a fighter jet into the eagle that harassed both Thor and Dirk, destroying the Heathrow check-in counter, and turning its clerk into the Coca-Cola machine. Thor undoes these changes to prove that he has his temper under control, but finds himself at a loss as to how to settle his disagreement with Odin. At Kate&#x27;s suggestion, Odin wills his entire estate to Woodshead and is admitted as a patient for the rest of his life. The Draycotts are killed when the restored fighter jet bursts out of Dirk&#x27;s home and crashes into their car.

A sub-plot involves Dirk&#x27;s kitchen refrigerator, which has become so filthy that he and his cleaning lady have started trying to trick one another into opening it first. He buys a new one from a fence and has the old one hauled away. A new god ultimately bursts out of it, created from Dirk&#x27;s guilt over failing to prevent Anstey&#x27;s death, and kills Toe Rag and the giant.

==Adaptations==
A BBC radio adaptation, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;, starring Harry Enfield, Peter Davison, John Fortune and Stephen Moore was broadcast in October 2008.

&quot;Dirk Gently&quot; (2010–2012) starred Stephen Mangan in the title role in a pilot broadcast on BBC 4 in 2010 and a three-episode series broadcast in 2012. The series includes several plot lines from &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;, including Dirk&#x27;s Zen navigation, his psychological battle with his cleaning lady, and a horoscope that is aimed at him personally by the compiler.

<text>Pyrrho of Elis (; ; ) was a Greek philosopher of Classical antiquity, credited as being the first Greek skeptic philosopher and founder of Pyrrhonism.

==Life==

Pyrrho of Elis is estimated to have lived from around 365/360 until 275/270 BCE. Pyrrho was from Elis, on the Ionian Sea. He was likely a member of the Klytidiai, a clan of seers in Elis who interpreted the oracles of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia where Pyrrho served as a high priest. The Klytidiai were descendants of Klytios, who was the son of Alcmaeon and the grandson of Amphiaraus. In the &quot;Python&quot;, Pyrrho&#x27;s student Timon of Phlius describes first meeting Pyrrho on the grounds of an Amphiareion, i.e., a temple of Amphiaraus, while they were both on a pilgrimage to Delphi.

Most biographical information on Pyrrho, as well as some information concerning his demeanor and behavior, come from Diogenes Laertius; his work on Pyrrho&#x27;s life drew primarily from the works of mid-third century BC biographer Antigonus of Carystus. Diogenes Laërtius, quoting from Apollodorus of Athens, says that Pyrrho was at first a painter, and that pictures by him were exhibited in the gymnasium at Elis. Later he was diverted to philosophy by the works of Democritus, and according to Diogenes Laërtius became acquainted with the Megarian dialectic through Bryson, pupil of Stilpo. Unlike the founders of other Hellenistic philosophies, Pyrrho was not substantively influenced by Socrates.

Pyrrho, along with Anaxarchus, travelled with Alexander the Great on his Indian campaign, &quot;so that he even went as far as the Gymnosophists in India and the Magi&quot; in Persia. Returning to Elis, he lived in poor circumstances, but was highly honored by the Elians, who made him a high priest, and also by the Athenians, who conferred upon him the rights of citizenship.

As for his behavior, Pyrrho is reported to have been very reclusive, appearing only rarely to his household. This was due to a reproach given to Anaxarchus which he had overheard, arguing that he would not be able to teach anyone else to be good while he paid court to kings. He is also said to have retained equanimity at all times, even to the extent of completing a conversation after his audience departed and he was left alone. His indifference is further demonstrated by a report that after Anaxarchus fell into a muddy puddle, Pyrrho walked by without offering assistance, an act that was later praised by Anaxarchus himself. As tales of his nonchalance seem to dominate the sources about him, still others relate a degree of sensitivity. One account tells of him being angered on behalf of his sister, justifying himself with the statement that &quot;where a little woman was concerned it was not appropriate to display indifference&quot;. Another tells of him being frightened by a dog and explaining that &quot;it was difficult to strip oneself completely of being human; but one could struggle against circumstances, by means of actions in the first instance, and if they were not successful, by means of reason&quot;. The inconsistency of these tales is echoed in the descriptions of his general approach as well. Diogenes himself states that Pyrrho avoided nothing and took no precautions, thereby making his safety dependent on his disciples, this according to Antigonus of Carystus, but he also quotes Aenesidemus as saying:&#x27;Although he practised philosophy on the principles of suspension of judgement, he did not act carelessly in the details of daily life. He lived to be nearly ninety.&#x27;Pyrrho&#x27;s pupils included Timon of Phlius, Hecataeus of Abdera, and Nausiphanes, who was one of Epicurus&#x27; teachers. Arcesilaus was also a pupil of Pyrrho, and he maintained Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy except in name. Upon becoming scholarch of the Platonic Academy, Arcesilaus transformed its teachings to conform with those of Pyrrho. This initiated Academic Skepticism, the second Hellenistic school of skeptical philosophy.

==Philosophy==

Pyrrho did not produce any written work. Most of the information on Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy comes from his student Timon. Only fragments of what Timon wrote have been preserved, mostly by Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes Laertius, and Eusebius. Little is known for certain about the details of Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy and how it may have differed from later Pyrrhonism. Most of what we know today as Pyrrhonism comes through the book &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot; written by Sextus Empiricus over 400 years after Pyrrho&#x27;s death.

Most sources agree that the primary goal of Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy was the achievement of a state of ataraxia, or freedom from mental perturbation, and that he observed that ataraxia could be brought about by eschewing beliefs (dogma) about thoughts and perceptions. However, Pyrrho&#x27;s own philosophy may have differed significantly in details from later Pyrrhonism. Most interpretations of the information on Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy suggest that he claimed that reality is inherently indeterminate, which, in the view of Pyrrhonism described by Sextus Empiricus, would be considered a negative dogmatic belief.

A summary of Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy was preserved by Eusebius, quoting Aristocles, quoting Timon, in what is known as the &quot;Aristocles passage.&quot; There are conflicting interpretations of the ideas presented in this passage, each of which leads to a different conclusion as to what Pyrrho meant:

&#x27;The things themselves are equally indifferent, and unstable, and indeterminate, and therefore neither our senses nor our opinions are either true or false. For this reason then we must not trust them, but be without opinions, and without bias, and without wavering, saying of every single thing that it no more is than is not, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not.&#x27;

In the writings of Cicero and Seneca Pyrrho is listed among those philosophers who left no one to carry on their teachings, though the opposite may be understood from Pliny. And so it is uncertain whether Pyrrhonism was a small but continuous movement in antiquity or whether it died out and was revived. Regardless, several centuries after Pyrrho lived, Aenesidemus led a revival of the philosophy. Pyrrhonism was one of the two major schools of philosophical skepticism that emerged during the Hellenistic period, the other being Academic skepticism. Pyrrhonism flourished among members of the Empiric school of medicine, where it was seen as the philosophic foundation to their approach to medicine, which was opposed to the approach of the Dogmatic school of medicine. Pyrrhonism fell into obscurity in the post-Hellenistic period.

Pyrrhonists view their philosophy as a way of life, and view Pyrrho as a model for this way of life. Their main goal is to attain ataraxia through achieving a state of epoché (i.e., suspension of judgment) about beliefs. One method Pyrrhonists use to suspend judgment is to gather arguments on both sides of the disputed issue, continuing to gather arguments such that the arguments have the property of isostheneia (equal strength). This leads the Pyrrhonist to the conclusion that there is an unresolvable disagreement on the topic, and so the appropriate reaction is to suspend judgement. Eventually the Pyrrhonist develops epoché as a habitual response to all matters of dispute, which results in ataraxia.

== Ancient Indian influences on Pyrrho ==
Diogenes Laërtius&#x27; biography of Pyrrho reports that Pyrrho traveled with Alexander the Great&#x27;s army on its conquest of India (327 to 325 BCE) and based his philosophy on what he learned there:

...he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the Magi. Owing to which circumstance, he seems to have taken a noble line in philosophy, introducing the doctrine of incomprehensibility, and of the necessity of suspending one&#x27;s judgment...

The sources and the extent of the Indian influences on Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy, however, are disputed. Philosophical skepticism was already present in Greek philosophy, particularly in the Democritean tradition in which Pyrrho had studied prior to visiting India. On the other hand, by this time Indian philosophy too had developed certain notions of skepticism tied to composure. Richard Bett heavily discounts any substantive Indian influences on Pyrrho, arguing that on the basis of testimony of Onesicritus regarding how difficult it was to converse with the gymnosophists, as it required three translators, none of whom understood any philosophy, that it is highly improbable that Pyrrho could have been substantively influenced by any of the Indian philosophers. According to Indologist and Buddhist scholar Johannes Bronkhorst, early Buddhism and Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophy share no connection.

It has also been hypothesized that the gymnosophists were Jains, or Ajnanins, and that these are likely influences on Pyrrho. Authors see probable influence of Indian skepticism not only in Pyrrhonism, but also in Buddhism itself as a common ground.

<text>Kennywood is an amusement park in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, just southeast of Pittsburgh. The park opened on May 30, 1898, as a trolley park attraction at the end of the Mellon family&#x27;s Monongahela Street Railway.

It was purchased in 1906 by F. W. Henninger and Andrew McSwigan, both of whom later formed the family-owned Kennywood Entertainment Company. The company later sold Kennywood, along with four other parks, in 2007 to Parques Reunidos, an international entertainment operator based in Spain.

The amusement park features various structures and rides dating back to the early 1900s. Along with Rye Playland Park, it is one of two amusement parks in the United States designated as a National Historic Landmark. Kennywood is also one of thirteen trolley parks in the United States that remain in operation.

== Location ==
Kennywood is approximately from Downtown Pittsburgh, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. The park is along Pennsylvania Route 837 (Green Belt), known as Kennywood Boulevard as it passes through the borough. The closest Interstate connection is Exit 77 (Edgewood/Swissvale) on Interstate 376. The Mon–Fayette Expressway will eventually go past Kennywood, which will prompt an expansion of the park when it is built.

Historically, the park is on the location of the July 9, 1755 Battle of the Monongahela, where British general Edward Braddock was mortally wounded, ending his expedition to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. George Washington was a colonel to Braddock, and fought at the battle before they retreated. Later the land on the bluff above the Monongahela River was part of a farm owned by Anthony Kenny. Around the time of the American Civil War, the site was a popular picnic grove for locals, known as &quot;Kenny&#x27;s Grove&quot;.

== History ==

A tree-filled portion of a farm overlooking the Monongahela River near Pittsburgh owned by Anthony Kenny, known as &quot;Kenny&#x27;s Grove&quot;, was a popular picnic spot for local residents during the American Civil War. In 1898, the Monongahela Street Railways Company, partially owned by prominent banker Andrew Mellon, seeking to increase fare profits on the weekends, leased the land from the Kenny family in order to create a trolley park at the end of their line. The company&#x27;s chief engineer, George S. Davidson, designed the original layout of the park and served as its first manager. A carousel, casino hall, and dance pavilion were added in 1899. A bandstand was constructed in 1900, while the Old Mill was constructed in 1901, and the park&#x27;s first roller coaster, the Figure Eight Toboggan, was added in 1902.

After less than a decade, the trolley company no longer wanted to manage the park. The standing manager, Andrew S. McSwigan, along with partners Frederick W. Henninger and A. F. Meghan, leased and operated the park as Kennywood Park Limited beginning in 1906.
From its origin as a working-class picnic entertainment destination, the park grew in the first half of the twentieth century into a popular attraction that combined thrill rides with recreation venues such as swimming pools and dance halls.

Kennywood ceased to be served by streetcar when Mon Street Railways successor Pittsburgh Railways Company converted the route serving it, the lengthy #68 Duquesne-McKeesport line, from trolley to bus on September 15, 1958.

On December 12, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment announced that it would be selling Kennywood Park, along with four other amusement parks in the Northeastern United States, to Parques Reunidos, a company based in Madrid, Spain.

Kennywood uses the slogans &quot;Welcome to the family&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s finest traditional amusement park&quot;, and &quot;Make a new memory&quot;, although from the 1960s through the early 1990s the slogan was &quot;The roller coaster capital of the world&quot; (a title which is now used by Cedar Point). Kennywood features three wooden roller coasters still in working order (Jack Rabbit, Racer and Thunderbolt), along with three newer steel coasters (Phantom&#x27;s Revenge, Sky Rocket and Steel Curtain) and one indoor coaster (Exterminator).

The park holds several events throughout the year, including Phantom Fall Fest,

== Recognition ==
For the past several years, Kennywood has been rated the &quot;Favorite &#x27;Dark Attraction Park by the Darkride and Funhouse Enthusiasts (DAFE). Kennywood ranked second to Cedar Point in the category of &quot;Favorite Park&quot; in Theme Park Magazine&#x27;s 2004 Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards.

The park was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987.

== Attractions ==
=== Themed areas ===
* Kiddieland, featuring several child-oriented rides in a compact area located next to the edge of the cliff on the river-view side of the park. It was originally located next to the Jack Rabbit before moving to its current location in 1927.
* Lost Kennywood was added to the park in 1995. The area references Kennywood&#x27;s long history, including its short-lived rival Luna Park (1905–1909) and the illusion of old and dangerous rides.
* Steelers Country is themed after the Pittsburgh Steelers and includes a roller coaster called Steel Curtain, which has the tallest inversion in the world and the most inversions in the United States. Steelers Country was introduced in 2019.
* Area 412 is an intergalactic-themed area. This section was officially established in 2023 with Spinvasion&#x27;s debut, replacing the former Volcano Valley area.
* Kennywood Junction, which was originally named Thomas Town and themed to Thomas the Tank Engine, opened as an extension of Kiddieland on July 27, 2018. The Thomas Town theming was removed following the 2024 season.

==== Former ====
* Volcano Valley was established in 2003, and featured several rides, as well as cement volcanoes that spewed smoke. Volcano Valley was removed in 2020.

=== Roller coasters ===
Kennywood has made use of the hilly Pittsburgh terrain to create coasters with unique layouts. Thunderbolt and Jack Rabbit, both wooden coasters, place the lift chain in the middle of the ride, not at the beginning. In both cases, the car leaves the station and drops into a valley as its first drop. Phantom&#x27;s Revenge uses the same valley as Thunderbolt, and its second drop passes through the supports of Thunderbolt&#x27;s first drop, making Phantom&#x27;s Revenge&#x27;s second drop the longest and steepest drop in the ride.

=== Flat rides ===
=== Upcharge attractions ===
=== Dark rides ===
=== Water rides ===
=== Transportation rides ===
=== Kiddieland ===
=== Kennywood Junction ===
Kennywood Junction opened in 2018 as an expansion of Kiddieland, and was themed to Thomas the Tank Engine from 2018 to 2024.

== Incidents at Kennywood ==

* On April 24, 1961, the 64-year-old bandstand burned to the ground, hours after the park opened for the season.
* On May 17, 1968, a 15-year-old boy died on Thunderbolt after falling out of the train.
* On June 19, 1975, Ghost Ship burned to the ground. The fire was later found to be caused by an electrical malfunction.
* The 1986 arrest of a park visitor for drug possession went all the way to the Pennsylvania Superior Court in 1988, which ruled in favor of the park&#x27;s security force. The defendant had unsuccessfully attempted to have the evidence suppressed.
* On July 11, 1999, 30 guests were taken to local hospitals when an operator of Thunderbolt failed to brake an incoming train, resulting in a collision with a train further along in the station. 
* On May 31, 2002, a macroburst hit Kennywood, leaving one person dead. The storm, with winds up to 80 mph, knocked the roof off the wooden pavilion which housed The Whip.
* On September 24, 2022, three people were injured during a shooting inside the park during Phantom Fall Fest.

== Legacy and media ==

Pittsburgh locals have often use the phrase &quot;Kennywood is open&quot; in order to tell someone that their the zipper in their pants is down. The phrase is believed by former American Coaster Enthusiasts president Bill Linkenheimer, himself from the Pittsburgh suburb of Ross Township, to be unique to the park, saying that there is no equivalent for other parks like Cedar Point and Disneyland. The origin of the phrase is still shrouded in mystery, though Andy Quinn, himself a descendant of the McSwigan family which co-owned the park, suspects that it may have started as a joke made by park employees which spread relatively quickly. Some locals recall using the phrase as early as the 1940s.

The park has been present in various pieces of media. The 2009 film &quot;Adventureland&quot; was filmed at the park, though its appearance was heavily altered for filming. Earlier in 1988, Rick Sebak also made a film at the park titled &quot;Kennywood Memories&quot;, considered a classic WQED film by locals in addition to the park itself, as well as regarded by the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; as one of Sebak&#x27;s most popular documentaries.

In 1987, rock singer Freddy Cannon recorded a remade version of his 1962 hit &quot;Palisades Park&quot; called &quot;Kennywood Park&quot;, featuring attractions at Kennywood. The song was released on a limited-edition 45 vinyl pressing and sold as a $1.99 fundraising item for Pittsburgh&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital through the now-defunct National Record Mart.

<doc id="140659" wikidata="Q7992493" url="?curid=140659" title="When God Was a Woman">
<text>When God Was a Woman is the U.S. title of a 1976 book by sculptor and art historian Merlin Stone. It was published earlier in the United Kingdom as The Paradise Papers: The Suppression of Women&#x27;s Rites. It has been translated into French as (SCE-Services Complets d&#x27;Edition, Québec, Canada) in 1978, into Dutch as &quot;&quot; in 1979, into German as in 1989 and into Italian as in 2011.

Stone spent approximately ten years engaged in research of the lesser-known, sometimes hidden depictions of the Sacred Feminine, from European and Middle Eastern societies, in preparation to complete this work. In the book, she describes these archetypal reflections of women as leaders, sacred entities and benevolent matriarchs, and also weaves them into a larger picture of how our modern societies grew to the present imbalanced state. Possibly the most controversial/debated claim in the book is Stone&#x27;s interpretation of how peaceful, benevolent matriarchal society and Goddess-reverent traditions (including Ancient Egypt) were attacked, undermined and ultimately destroyed almost completely, by the ancient tribes including Hebrews and later the early Christians. To do this they attempted to destroy any visible symbol of the sacred feminine, including artwork, sculpture, weavings and literature. The reason being that they wanted the Sacred Masculine to become the dominant power, and rule over women and Goddess energies. According to Stone, the Torah or Old Testament was in many ways a male attempt to re-write the story of human society, changing feminine symbolism to masculine.

The book is now seen as having been instrumental in the modern rise of feminist theology in the 1970s to 1980s, along with authors such as Elizabeth Gould Davis, Riane Eisler and Marija Gimbutas. Some have related it as well to the work of authors Margaret Murray and Robert Graves.

<text>Tivoli Gardens, also known simply as Tivoli (), is an amusement park and pleasure garden in Copenhagen, Denmark. The park opened on 15 August 1843 and is the third-oldest operating amusement park in the world, after Dyrehavsbakken in nearby Klampenborg, also in Denmark, and Wurstelprater in Vienna, Austria.

With 4.6 million visitors in 2017, Tivoli is the most visited amusement park in Scandinavia and second-most popular seasonal amusement park in the world after Europa-Park. Tivoli is also the fifth-most visited amusement park in Europe, behind Disneyland Park, Europa-Park, Walt Disney Studios Park and Efteling. It is located in downtown Copenhagen, next to the Central rail station.

==History==

The amusement park was first called &quot;Tivoli &amp; Vauxhall&quot;; &quot;Tivoli&quot; alluding to the Jardin de Tivoli in Paris (which in its turn had been named after Tivoli near Rome, Italy), and &quot;Vauxhall&quot; alluding to Vauxhall Gardens in London. It is mentioned in various books, such as &quot;Number the Stars&quot; by Lois Lowry, and was also used prominently in the 1961 science fiction film &quot;Reptilicus&quot;.

Tivoli&#x27;s founder, Georg Carstensen (b. 1812 – d. 1857), obtained a five-year charter to create Tivoli by telling King Christian VIII that &quot;when the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics&quot;. The monarch granted Carstensen use of roughly 15 acres (61,000 m2) of the fortified glacis outside Vesterport (the West Gate) for an annual rent. Until the 1850s Tivoli was outside the city, accessible from the city only through the Vesterport.

From its beginning Tivoli included a variety of attractions: buildings in the exotic style of an imaginary Orient: a theatre, band stands, restaurants and cafés, flower gardens, and mechanical amusement rides such as a merry-go-round and a primitive scenic railway. After dark, colored lamps illuminated the gardens. On certain evenings, specially designed fireworks could be seen reflected in Tivoli&#x27;s lake, a remnant of the moat surrounding the city fortifications.

Composer Hans Christian Lumbye (b. 1810 – d. 1874) was Tivoli&#x27;s musical director from 1843 to 1872. Lumbye was inspired by Viennese waltz composers such as the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I and his sons), and became known as the &quot;Strauss of the North&quot;. Many of his compositions are specifically inspired by the gardens, including &quot;Salute to the Ticket Holders of Tivoli&quot;, &quot;Carnival Joys&quot; and &quot;A Festive Night at Tivoli&quot;. The Tivoli Symphony Orchestra still performs many of his works.

In 1874, a Chinese-style &quot;Pantomimeteatret&quot; (pantomime theatre) took the place of an older smaller theatre. The audience stands in the open, the stage being inside the building. The theatre&#x27;s &quot;curtain&quot; is a mechanical peacock&#x27;s tail. From the very beginning, the theatre was the home of Italian pantomimes, introduced in Denmark by the Italian Giuseppe Casorti. This tradition, dependent on the Italian Commedia dell&#x27;Arte, has been kept alive; it portrays the characters Cassander (the old father), Columbine (his beautiful daughter), Harlequin (her lover), and, especially popular with the youngest spectators, the stupid servant Pierrot. The absence of spoken dialogue is an advantage, for Tivoli is now an international tourist attraction.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Tivoli also hosted human exhibitions.

In 1943, Nazi sympathisers burnt many of Tivoli&#x27;s buildings, including the concert hall, to the ground. Temporary buildings were constructed in their place and the park was back in operation after a few weeks.

Tivoli is always evolving without abandoning its original charm or traditions. Georg Carstensen said in 1844: &quot;Tivoli will never, so to speak, be finished&quot;, a sentiment echoed just over a century later when Walt Disney said of his own Tivoli-inspired theme park, &quot;Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world&quot;.

In Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish, the word &quot;tivoli&quot; has become synonymous with any amusement park.

==Rides==

The park is best known for its wooden roller coaster, Rutschebanen, or as some people call it, Bjergbanen (&quot;The Mountain Coaster&quot;), built in 1914. It is one of the world&#x27;s oldest wooden roller coasters that is still operating today. An operator controls the ride by braking so that it does not gain too much speed during descent of the hills. It is an ACE Coaster Classic.

Another roller coaster, The Demon (&quot;Dæmonen&quot;), features an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, and a zero-G roll all during the ride time of just one minute and forty six seconds. An old roller coaster, The Snake (&quot;Slangen&quot;), was removed to have enough space for The Demon. In 2017, Tivoli Gardens added an optional virtual reality experience to the ride, simulating a flight through ancient China, along with encounters with dragons and demons. The Demon is situated next to the concert hall.

A well-known swing ride, The Star Flyer, opened in Tivoli in 2006. high and built by the Austria-based Australian company Funtime, it offers panoramic views of the city.

On 1 May 2009, Tivoli Gardens opened the new ride Vertigo, a looping plane ride where the rider pilots the ride, able to control the plane. This ride had extremely low capacity and suffered significant downtime. The ride was removed in 2021.

A Zamperla Air Race ride, Aquila, opened on 11 April 2013. It is a giant swing and spinner with centrifugal powers up to 4 g, named after the constellation of the Eagle.

The newest attractions include Fatamorgana and Tik Tak. Fatamorgana opened in 2016. This is the world&#x27;s first Condor 2GH, which offers two separate seating arrangements, one milder version with two-seater gondolas, and a thrilling version in which riders are slung around at high speed while seated in a ring and facing away from the center.

Tik Tak opened in 2018 and is the first permanent installation of a Mondial Shake R5. This model is slightly less aggressive than the traveling model and is spectacularly themed.
