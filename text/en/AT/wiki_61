<text>The reindeer or caribou (Rangifer tarandus) is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, native to Arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions of Northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. It is the only representative of the genus Rangifer. More recent studies suggest the splitting of reindeer and caribou into six distinct species over their range.

Reindeer occur in both migratory and populations, and their herd sizes vary greatly in different regions. The tundra subspecies are adapted for extreme cold, and some are adapted for long-distance migration.

Reindeer vary greatly in size and color from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer (&quot;R.&quot; (&quot;t.&quot;) &quot;platyrhynchus&quot;), to the largest, Osborn&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. osborni&quot;). Although reindeer are quite numerous, some species and subspecies are in decline and considered vulnerable. They are unique among deer (Cervidae) in that females may have antlers, although the prevalence of antlered females varies by subspecies.

Reindeer are the only successfully semi-domesticated deer on a large scale in the world. Both wild and domestic reindeer have been an important source of food, clothing, and shelter for Arctic people from prehistorical times. They are still herded and hunted today. In some traditional Christmas legends, Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus deliver gifts to good children on Christmas Eve.

== Description ==
Names follow international convention before the recent revision (see Reindeer#Taxonomy below). Reindeer / caribou (&quot;Rangifer&quot;) vary in size from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer (&quot;R.&quot; (&quot;t.&quot;) &quot;platyrhynchus&quot;), to the largest, Osborn&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. osborni&quot;). They also vary in coat color and antler architecture.

The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska through the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut throughout the tundra, taiga (boreal forest) and south through the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Of the eight subspecies classified by Harding (2022) into the Arctic caribou (&quot;R. arcticus&quot;), the migratory mainland barren-ground caribou of Arctic Alaska and Northern Canada (&quot;R. t. arcticus&quot;), summer in tundra and winter in taiga, a transitional forest zone between boreal forest and tundra; the nomadic Peary caribou (&quot;R. t. pearyi&quot;) lives in the polar desert of the high Arctic Archipelago and Grant&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. granti&quot; also called the Porcupine caribou) lives in the western end of the Alaska Peninsula and the adjacent islands; the other four subspecies, Osborn&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. osborni&quot;), Stone&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. stonei&quot;), the Rocky Mountain caribou (&quot;R. t. fortidens&quot;) and the Selkirk Mountains caribou (&quot;R. t. montanus&quot;) are all . The extinct insular Queen Charlotte Islands caribou (&quot;R. t. dawsoni&quot;), lived on Graham Island in Haida Gwaii (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands).

The boreal woodland caribou (&quot;R. t. caribou&quot;), lives in the boreal forest of northeastern Canada: the Labrador or Ungava caribou of northern Quebec and northern Labrador (&quot;R. t. caboti&quot;), and the Newfoundland caribou of Newfoundland (&quot;R. t. terranovae&quot;) have been found to be genetically in the woodland caribou lineage.

In Eurasia, both wild and domestic reindeer are distributed across the tundra and into the taiga. Eurasian mountain reindeer (&quot;R. t. tarandus&quot;) are close to North American caribou genetically and visually, but with sufficient differences to warrant division into two species. The unique, insular Svalbard reindeer inhabits the Svalbard Archipelago. The Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. fennicus&quot;) is spottily distributed in the coniferous forest zones from Finland to east of Lake Baikal: the Siberian forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. valentinae&quot;, formerly called the Busk Mountains reindeer (&quot;R. t. buskensis&quot;) by American taxonomists) occupies the Altai and Ural Mountains.

Male (&quot;bull&quot;) and female (&quot;cow&quot;) reindeer can grow antlers annually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly between populations. Antlers are typically larger on males. Antler architecture varies by species and subspecies and, together with pelage differences, can often be used to distinguish between species and subspecies (see illustrations in Geist, 1991 and Geist, 1998).

== Status ==
About 25,000 mountain reindeer (&quot;R. t. tarandus&quot;) still live in the mountains of Norway, notably in Hardangervidda. In Sweden there are approximately 250,000 reindeer in herds managed by Sámi villages. Russia manages 19 herds of Siberian tundra reindeer (&quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot;) that total about 940,000. The Taimyr herd of Siberian tundra reindeer is the largest wild reindeer herd in the world, varying between 400,000 and 1,000,000; it is a metapopulation consisting of several subpopulations — some of which are phenotypically different — with different migration routes and calving areas. The Kamchatkan reindeer (&quot;R. t. phylarchus&quot;), a forest subspecies, formerly included reindeer west of the Sea of Okhotsk which, however, are indistinguishable genetically from the Jano-Indigirka, East Siberian taiga and Chukotka populations of &quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot;. Siberian tundra reindeer herds have been in decline but are stable or increasing since 2000.

Insular (island) reindeer, classified as the Novaya Zemlya reindeer (&quot;R. t. pearsoni&quot;) occupy several island groups: the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago (about 5,000 animals at last count, but most of these are either domestic reindeer or domestic-wild hybrids), the New Siberia Archipelago (about 10,000 to 15,000), and Wrangel Island (200 to 300 feral domestic reindeer).

What was once the second largest herd is the migratory Labrador caribou (&quot;R. t. caboti&quot;) George River herd in Canada, with former variations between 28,000 and 385,000. As of January 2018, there are fewer than 9,000 animals estimated to be left in the George River herd, as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in April 2018 of the disappearance of the only herd of southern mountain woodland caribou in the contiguous United States, with an expert calling it &quot;functionally extinct&quot; after the herd&#x27;s size dwindled to a mere three animals. After the last individual, a female, was translocated to a wildlife rehabilitation center in Canada, caribou were considered extirpated from the contiguous United States. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) classified both the Southern Mountain population DU9 (&quot;R. t. montanus&quot;) and the Central Mountain population DU8 (&quot;R. t. fortidens&quot;) as Endangered and the Northern Mountain population DU7 (&quot;R. t. osborni&quot;) as Threatened.

Some species and subspecies are rare and three subspecies have already become extinct: the Queen Charlotte Islands caribou (&quot;R. t. dawsoni&quot;) from western Canada, the Sakhalin reindeer (&quot;R. t. setoni&quot;) from Sakhalin and the East Greenland caribou from eastern Greenland, although some authorities believe that the latter, &quot;R. t. eogroenlandicus&quot; Degerbøl, 1957, is a junior synonym of the Peary caribou. Historically, the range of the sedentary boreal woodland caribou covered more than half of Canada and into the northern states of the contiguous United States from Maine to Washington. Boreal woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as Threatened in 2002 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Environment and Climate Change Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34,000 boreal woodland caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada (Environment Canada, 2011b), although those numbers included montane populations classified by Harding (2022) into subspecies of the Arctic caribou. Siberian tundra reindeer herds are also in decline, and &quot;Rangifer&quot; as a whole is considered to be Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

== Naming ==
Charles Hamilton Smith is credited with the name &quot;Rangifer&quot; for the reindeer genus, which Albertus Magnus used in his , fol. Liber 22, Cap. 268: &quot;Dicitur Rangyfer quasi ramifer&quot;. This word may go back to the Sámi word . Carl Linnaeus chose the word &quot;tarandus&quot; as the specific epithet, making reference to Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s fol. 859–863, Cap. 30: De Tarando (1621). However, Aldrovandi and Conrad Gessner thought that &quot;rangifer&quot; and &quot;tarandus&quot; were two separate animals. In any case, the &quot;tarandos&quot; name goes back to Aristotle and Theophrastus.

The use of the terms &quot;reindeer&quot; and &quot;caribou&quot; for essentially the same animal can cause confusion, but the ICUN clearly delineates the issue: &quot;Reindeer is the European name for the species of &quot;Rangifer,&quot; while in North America, &quot;Rangifer&quot; species are known as Caribou.&quot; The word &quot;&quot; is an anglicized version of the Old Norse words (&quot;reindeer&quot;) and (&quot;animal&quot;) and has nothing to do with reins. The word &quot;caribou&quot; comes through French, from the Mi&#x27;kmaq , meaning &quot;snow shoveler&quot;, and refers to its habit of pawing through the snow for food.

Because of its importance to many cultures, &quot;Rangifer&quot; and some of its species and subspecies have names in many languages. Inuvialuit of the western Canadian Arctic and Inuit of the eastern Canadian Arctic, who speak different dialects of the Inuit languages, both call the barren-ground caribou . The Wekʼèezhìi (Tłı̨chǫ) people, a Dene (Athapascan) group, call the Arctic caribou and the boreal woodland caribou . The Gwichʼin (also a Dene group) have over 24 distinct caribou-related words.

Reindeer are also called by the Greenlandic Inuit and , sometimes , by the Icelanders.

== Evolution ==
The &quot;glacial-interglacial cycles of the upper Pleistocene had a major influence on the evolution&quot; of &quot;Rangifer&quot; species and other Arctic and sub-Arctic species. Isolation of tundra-adapted species &quot;Rangifer&quot; in Last Glacial Maximum refugia during the last glacial – the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Weichselian glaciation in Eurasia – shaped &quot;intraspecific genetic variability&quot; particularly between the North American and Eurasian parts of the Arctic.

Reindeer / caribou (&quot;Rangifer&quot;) are in the subfamily Odocoileinae, along with roe deer (&quot;Capreolus&quot;), Eurasian elk / moose (&quot;Alces&quot;), and water deer (&quot;Hydropotes&quot;). These antlered cervids split from the horned ruminants &quot;Bos&quot; (cattle and yaks), &quot;Ovis&quot; (sheep) and &quot;Capra&quot; (goats) about 36 million years ago. The Eurasian clade of Odocoileinae (Capreolini, Hydropotini and Alcini) split from the New World tribes of Capreolinae (Odocoileini and Rangiferini) in the Late Miocene, 8.7–9.6 million years ago. &quot;Rangifer&quot; &quot;evolved as a mountain deer, ...exploiting the subalpine and alpine meadows...&quot;. &quot;Rangifer&quot; originated in the Late Pliocene and diversified in the Early Pleistocene, a 2+ million-year period of multiple glacier advances and retreats. Several named &quot;Rangifer&quot; fossils in Eurasia and North America predate the evolution of modern tundra reindeer.

Archaeologists distinguish &quot;modern&quot; tundra reindeer and barren-ground caribou from primitive forms – living and extinct – that did not have adaptations to extreme cold and to long-distance migration. They include a broad, high muzzle to increase the volume of the nasal cavity to warm and moisten the air before it enters the throat and lungs, bez tines set close to the brow tines, distinctive coat patterns, short legs and other adaptations for running long distances, and multiple behaviors suited to tundra, but not to forest (such as synchronized calving and aggregation during rutting and post-calving). As well, many genes, including those for vitamin D metabolism, fat metabolism, retinal development, circadian rhythm, and tolerance to cold temperatures, are found in tundra caribou that are lacking or rudimentary in forest types. For this reason, forest-adapted reindeer and caribou could not survive in tundra or polar deserts. The oldest undoubted &quot;Rangifer&quot; fossil is from Omsk, Russia, dated to 2.1-1.8 Ma. The oldest North American &quot;Rangifer&quot; fossil is from the Yukon, 1.6 million years before present (BP). A fossil skull fragment from Süßenborn, Germany, &quot;R. arcticus stadelmanni&quot;, (which is probably misnamed) with &quot;rather thin and cylinder-shaped&quot; antlers, dates to the Middle Pleistocene (Günz) Period, 680,000-620,000 BP. &quot;Rangifer&quot; fossils become increasingly frequent in circumpolar deposits beginning with the Riss glaciations, the second youngest of the Pleistocene Epoch, roughly 300,000–130,000 BP. By the 4-Würm period (110,000–70,000 to 12,000–10,000 BP), its European range was extensive, supplying a major food source for prehistoric Europeans. North American fossils outside of Beringia that predate the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are of Rancholabrean age (240,000–11,000 years BP) and occur along the fringes of the Rocky Mountain and Laurentide ice sheets as far south as northern Alabama; and in Sangamonian deposits (~100,000 years BP) from western Canada.

A &quot;R. t. pearyi&quot;-sized caribou occupied Greenland before and after the LGM and persisted in a relict enclave in northeastern Greenland until it went extinct about 1900 (see discussion of &quot;R. t. eogroenlandicus&quot; below). Archaeological excavations showed that larger barren-ground-sized caribou appeared in western Greenland about 4,000 years ago.

The late Valerius Geist (1998) dates the Eurasian reindeer radiation dates to the large Riss glaciation (347,000 to 128,000 years ago), based on the Norwegian-Svalbard split 225,000 years ago. Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. fennicus&quot;) likely evolved from &quot;Cervus [Rangifer] geuttardi&quot; Desmarest, 1822, a reindeer that adapted to forest habitats in Eastern Europe as forests expanded during an interglacial period before the LGM (the Würmian or Weichsel glaciation);. The fossil species &quot;geuttardi&quot; was later replaced by &quot;R. constantini&quot;, which was adapted for grasslands, in a second immigration 19,000–20,000 years ago when the LGM turned its forest habitats into tundra, while &quot;fennicus&quot; survived in isolation in southwestern Europe. &quot;R. constantini&quot; was then replaced by modern tundra / barren-ground caribou adapted to extreme cold, probably in Beringia, before dispersing west (&quot;R. t. tarandus&quot; in the Scandinavian mountains and &quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot; across Siberia) and east (&quot;R. t. arcticus&quot; in the North American Barrenlands) when rising seas isolated them. Likewise in North America, DNA analysis shows that woodland caribou (&quot;R. caribou&quot;) diverged from primitive ancestors of tundra / barren-ground caribou not during the LGM, 26,000–19,000 years ago, as previously assumed, but in the Middle Pleistocene around 357,000 years ago. At that time, modern tundra caribou had not even evolved. Woodland caribou are likely more related to extinct North American forest caribou than to barren-ground caribou. For example, the extinct caribou &quot;Torontoceros [Rangifer] hypogaeus&quot;, had features (robust and short pedicles, smooth antler surface, and high position of second tine) that relate it to forest caribou.

Humans started hunting reindeer in both the Mesolithic and Neolithic Periods, and humans are today the main predator in many areas. Norway and Greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer from the Last Glacial Period until the present day. In the non-forested mountains of central Norway, such as Jotunheimen, it is still possible to find remains of stone-built trapping pits, guiding fences and bow rests, built especially for hunting reindeer. These can, with some certainty, be dated to the Migration Period, although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the Stone Age.

Cave paintings by ancient Europeans include both tundra and forest types of reindeer.

A 2022 study of ancient environmental DNA from the Early Pleistocene (2 million years ago) Kap Kobenhavn Formation of northern Greenland identified preserved DNA fragments of &quot;Rangifer&quot;, identified as basal but potentially ancestral to modern reindeer. This suggests that reindeer have inhabited Greenland since at least the Early Pleistocene. Around this time, northern Greenland was warmer than the Holocene, with a boreal forest hosting a species assemblage with no modern analogue. These are among the oldest DNA fragments ever sequenced.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Naming and research on museum collections ===
Carl Linnaeus in 1758 named the Eurasian tundra species &quot;Cervus tarandus&quot;, the genus &quot;Rangifer&quot; being credited to Smith, 1827.

&quot;Rangifer&quot; has had a convoluted history because of the similarity in antler architecture (brow tines asymmetrical and often palmate, bez tines, a back tine sometimes branched, and branched at the distal end, often palmate). Because of individual variability, early taxonomists were unable to discern consistent patterns among populations, nor could they, examining collections in Europe, appreciate the difference in habitats and the differing function they imposed on antler architecture. Comparative morphometrics, the measurement of skulls, is often seen as more objective than description of differences of color or antler patterns, but actually confounds genetic variance with epistatic and statistical variance as well as compounded environment-based variance.

For example, woodland caribou males, rutting in boreal forest where only a few females can be found, collect harems and defend them against other males, for which they have short, straight, strong, much-branched antlers, beams flattened in cross-section, designed for combat — and not too large, so as not to impede them in forested winter ranges.

By contrast, modern tundra caribou (see Evolution above) have synchronized calving as a predator-avoidance strategy, which requires large rutting aggregations. Males cannot defend a harem because, while he was busy fighting, they would disappear into the mass of the herd. Males therefore tend individual females; their fights are infrequent and brief. Their antlers are thin, beams round in cross-section, sweep back and then forward with a cluster of branches at the top; these are designed more for visual stimulation of the females. Their bez tines are set low, just above the brow tine, which is vertically flattened to protect the eyes while the buck &quot;threshes&quot; low brush, a courtship display. The low bez tines help the wide flat brow tines dig craters in the hard-packed tundra snow for forage, for which reason brow tines are often called &quot;shovels&quot; in North America and &quot;ice tines&quot; in Europe. The differences in antler architecture reflect fundamental differences in ecology and behavior, and in turn deep divisions in ancestry that were not apparent to the early taxonomists.

Similarly, working on museum collections where skins were often faded and in poor states of preservation, early taxonomists could not readily perceive differences in coat patterns that are consistent within a subspecies, but variable among them. Geist calls these &quot;nuptial&quot; characteristics: sexually selected characters that are highly conserved and diagnostic among subspecies.

=== Biological exploration expeditions ===
Towards the end of the 19th century, national museums began sending out biological exploration expeditions and collections accumulated. Taxonomists, usually working for the museums, began naming subspecies more rigorously, based on statistical differences in detailed cranial, dental and skeletal measurements than antlers and pelage, supplemented by better knowledge of differences in ecology and behavior. From 1898 to 1937, mammalogists named 12 new species (other than barren-ground and woodland, which had been named earlier) of caribou in Canada and Alaska, and three new species and nine new subspecies in Eurasia, each properly described according to the evolving rules of zoological nomenclature, with type localities designated and type specimens deposited in museums (see table in Species and subspecies below).

=== Reclassification ===
In the mid-20th century, as definitions of &quot;species&quot; evolved, mammalogists in Europe and North America made all &quot;Rangifer&quot; species conspecific with &quot;R. tarandus&quot;, and synonymized most of the subspecies. Alexander William Francis Banfield&#x27;s often-cited &quot;A Revision of the Reindeer and Caribou, Genus Rangifer&quot; (1961), eliminated &quot;R. t. caboti&quot; (the Labrador caribou), &quot;R. t. osborni&quot; (Osborn&#x27;s caribou — from British Columbia) and &quot;R. t. terranovae&quot; (the Newfoundland caribou) as invalid and included only barren-ground caribou, renamed as &quot;R. t. groenlandicus&quot; (formerly &quot;R. arcticus&quot;) and woodland caribou as &quot;R. t. caribou&quot;. However, Banfield made multiple errors, eliciting a scathing review by Ian McTaggart-Cowan in 1962. Most authorities continued to consider all or most subspecies valid; some were quite distinct. In his chapter in the authoritative 2005 reference work &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot;, referenced by the American Society of Mammalogists, English zoologist Peter Grubb agreed with Valerius Geist, a specialist on large mammals, that these subspecies were valid (i.e., before the recent revision): In North America, &quot;R. t. caboti&quot;, &quot;R. t. caribou&quot;, &quot;R. t. dawsoni&quot;, &quot;R. t. groenlandicus&quot;, &quot;R. t. osborni&quot;, &quot;R. t. pearyi&quot;, and &quot;R. t. terranovae&quot;; and in Eurasia, &quot;R. t. tarandus&quot;, &quot;R. t. buskensis&quot; (called &quot;R. t. valentinae&quot; in Europe; see below), &quot;R. t. phylarchus&quot;, &quot;R. t. pearsoni&quot;, &quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot; and &quot;R. t. platyrhynchus&quot;. These subspecies were retained in the 2011 replacement work &quot;Handbook of the Mammals of the World Vol. 2: Hoofed Mammals&quot;. Most Russian authors also recognized &quot;R. t. angustirostris&quot;, a forest reindeer from east of Lake Baikal.

However, since 1991, many genetic studies have revealed deep divergence between modern tundra reindeer and woodland caribou. Geist (2007) and others continued arguing that the woodland caribou was incorrectly classified, noting that &quot;true woodland caribou, the uniformly dark, small-maned type with the frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers&quot;, is &quot;scattered thinly along the southern rim of North American caribou distribution&quot;. He affirms that the &quot;true woodland caribou is very rare, in very great difficulties and requires the most urgent of attention.&quot;

==== Ecotypes ====
In 2011, noting that the former classifications of &quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;, either with prevailing taxonomy on subspecies, designations based on ecotypes, or natural population groupings, failed to capture &quot;the variability of caribou across their range in Canada&quot; needed for effective subspecies conservation and management, COSEWIC developed Designatable Unit (DU) attribution, an adaptation of &quot;evolutionary significant units&quot;. The 12 designatable units for caribou in Canada (that is, excluding Alaska and Greenland) based on ecology, behavior and, importantly, genetics (but excluding morphology and archaeology) essentially followed the previously named subspecies distributions, without naming them as such, plus some ecotypes. Ecotypes are not phylogenetically based and cannot substitute for taxonomy.

==== Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence ====
Meanwhile, genetic data continued to accumulate, revealing sufficiently deep divisions to easily separate &quot;Rangifer&quot; back into six previously named species and to resurrect several previously named subspecies. Molecular data showed that the Greenland caribou (&quot;R. t. groenlandicus&quot;) and the Svalbard reindeer (&quot;R. t. platyrhynchus&quot;), although not closely related to each other, were the most genetically divergent among &quot;Rangifer&quot; clades; that modern (see Evolution above) Eurasian tundra reindeer (&quot;R. t. tarandus&quot; and &quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot;) and North American barren-ground caribou (&quot;R. t. arcticus&quot;), although sharing ancestry, were separable at the subspecies level; that Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. fennicus&quot;) clustered well apart from both wild and domestic tundra reindeer and that boreal woodland caribou (&quot;R. t. caribou&quot;) were separable from all others. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence was accumulating that Eurasian forest reindeer descended from an extinct forest-adapted reindeer and not from tundra reindeer (see Evolution above); since they do not share a direct common ancestor, they cannot be Biological specificity#conspecific|conspecific. Similarly, woodland caribou diverged from the ancestors of Arctic caribou before modern barren-ground caribou had evolved, and were more likely related to extinct North American forest reindeer (see Evolution above). Lacking a direct shared ancestor, barren-ground and woodland caribou cannot be conspecific.

Molecular data also revealed that the four western Canadian montane ecotypes are not woodland caribou: they share a common ancestor with modern barren-ground caribou / tundra reindeer, but distantly, having diverged &gt; 60,000 years ago — before the modern ecotypes had evolved their cold- and darkness-adapted physiologies and mass-migration and aggregation behaviors (see Evolution above). Before Banfield (1961), taxonomists using cranial, dental and skeletal measurements had unequivocally allied these western montane ecotypes with barren-ground caribou, naming them (as in Osgood 1909 Murie, 1935 and Anderson 1946, among others) &quot;R. t. stonei&quot;, &quot;R. t. montanus&quot;, &quot;R. t. fortidens&quot; and &quot;R. t. osborni&quot;, respectively, and this phylogeny was confirmed by genetic analysis.

==== Novel genetics-based clades ====
DNA also revealed three unnamed clades that, based on genetic distance, genetic divergence and shared vs. private haplotypes and alleles, together with ecological and behavioral differences, may justify separation at the subspecies level: the Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou (COSEWIC DU11), an eastern montane ecotype of the boreal woodland caribou, and the Baffin Island caribou. Neither one of these clades has yet been formally described or named.

Jenkins et al. (2012) said that &quot;[Baffin Island] caribou are unique compared to other Barrenground herds, as they do not overwinter in forested habitat, nor do all caribou undertake long seasonal migrations to calving areas.&quot; It also shares a mtDNA haplotype with Labrador caribou, in the North American lineage (i.e., woodland caribou). Røed et al. (1991) had noted:Among Baffin Island caribou the TFL2 allele was the most common allele (p=0.521), while this allele was absent, or present in very low frequencies, in other caribou populations (Table 1), including the Canadian barren-ground caribou from the Beverly herd. A large genetic difference between Baffin Island caribou and the Beverly herd was also indicated by eight alleles found in the Beverly herd which were absent from the Baffin Island samples.Jenkins et al. (2018) also reported genetic distinctiveness of Baffin Island caribou from all other barren-ground caribou; its genetic signature was not found on the mainland or on other islands; nor were Beverly herd (the nearest mainly barren-ground caribou) alleles present in Baffin Island caribou, evidence of reproductive isolation.

These advances in &quot;Rangifer&quot; genetics were brought together with previous morphological-based descriptions, ecology, behavior and archaeology to propose a new revision of the genus.

The table above includes, as per the recent revision, &quot;R. t. caboti&quot; (the Labrador caribou (the Eastern Migratory population DU4)), and &quot;R. t. terranovae&quot; (the Newfoundland caribou (the Newfoundland population DU5)), which molecular analyses have shown to be of North American (i.e., woodland caribou) lineage; and four mountain ecotypes now known to be of distant Beringia-Eurasia lineage (see Taxonomy above).

The scientific name &quot;Tarandus rangifer buskensis&quot; Millais, 1915 (the Busk Mountains reindeer) was selected as the senior synonym to &quot;R. t. valentinae&quot; Flerov, 1933, in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; but Russian authors do not recognize Millais and Millais&#x27; articles in a hunting travelogue, &quot;The Gun at Home and Abroad&quot;, seem short of a taxonomic authority.

The scientific name &quot;groenlandicus&quot; is fraught with problems. Edwards (1743) illustrated and claimed to have seen a male specimen (&quot;head of perfect horns...&quot;) from Greenland and said that a Captain Craycott had brought a live pair from Greenland to England in 1738. He named it &quot;Capra groenlandicus&quot;, Greenland reindeer. Linnaeus, in the 12th edition of &quot;Systema naturae&quot;, gave &quot;grœnlandicus&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Cervus tarandus&quot;. Borowski disagreed (and again changed the spelling), saying &quot;Cervus grönlandicus&quot; was morphologically distinct from Eurasian tundra reindeer. Baird placed it under the genus &quot;Rangifer&quot; as &quot;R. grœnlandicus&quot;. It went back and forth as a full species or subspecies of the barren-ground caribou (&quot;R. arcticus&quot;) or a subspecies of the tundra reindeer (&quot;R. tarandus&quot;), but always as the Greenland reindeer / caribou. Taxonomists consistently documented morphological differences between Greenland and other caribou / reindeer in cranial measurements, dentition, antler architecture, etc. Then Banfield (1961) in his famously flawed revision, gave the name &quot;groenlandicus&quot; to all the barren-ground caribou in North America, Greenland included, because &quot;groenlandicus&quot; pre-dates Richardson&#x27;s &quot;R. arctus&quot;. However, because genetic data shows the Greenland caribou to be the most distantly related of any caribou to all the others (genetic distance, FST = 44%, whereas most cervid (deer family) species have a genetic distance of 2% to 5%)--as well as behavioral and morphological differences—a recent revision returned it to species status as &quot;R. groenlandicus&quot;. Although it has been assumed that the larger caribou that appeared in Greenland 4,000 years ago originated from Baffin Island (itself unique; see Taxonomy above), a reconstruction of LGM glacial retreat and caribou advance (Yannic et al. 2013) shows colonization by NAL lineage caribou more likely. Their PCA and tree diagrams show Greenland caribou clustering outside of the Beringian-Eurasian lineage.

The scientific name &quot;R. t. granti&quot; has a very interesting history. Allen (1902) named it as a distinct species, &quot;R. granti&quot;, from the &quot;western end of Alaska Peninsula, opposite Popoff Island&quot; and noting that:&quot;Rangifer granti&quot; is a representative of the Barren Ground group of Caribou, which includes &quot;R. arcticus&quot; of the Arctic Coast and &quot;R. granlandicus&quot; of Greenland. It is not closely related to &quot;R. stonei&quot; of the Kenai Peninsula, from which it differs not only in its very much smaller size, but in important cranial characters and in coloration. ...The external and cranial differences between &quot;R. granti&quot; and the various forms of the Woodland Caribou are so great in almost every respect that no detailed comparison is necessary. ...According to Mr. Stone, &quot;Rangifer granti&quot; inhabits the &quot; barren land of Alaska Peninsula, ranging well up into the mountains in summer, but descending to the lower levels in winter, generally feeding on the low flat lands near the coast and in the foothills...As regards cranial characters no comparison is necessary with &quot;R. montanus&quot; or with any of the woodland forms.&quot;Osgood and Murie (1935), agreeing with &quot;granti&quot;″s close relationship with the barren-ground caribou, brought it under &quot;R. arcticus&quot; as a subspecies, &quot;R. t. granti&quot;. Anderson (1946) and Banfield (1961), based on statistical analysis of cranial, dental and other characters, agreed. But Banfield (1961) also synonymized Alaska&#x27;s large &quot;R. stonei&quot; with other mountain caribou of British Columbia and the Yukon as invalid subspecies of woodland caribou, then &quot;R. t. caribou&quot;. This left the small, migratory barren-ground caribou of Alaska and the Yukon, including the Porcupine caribou herd, without a name, which Banfield rectified in his 1974 &quot;Mammals of Canada&quot; by extending to them the name &quot;granti&quot;. The late Valerius Geist (1998), in the only error in his whole illustrious career, re-analyzed Banfield&#x27;s data with additional specimens found in an unpublished report he cites as &quot;Skal, 1982&quot;, but was &quot;not able to find diagnostic features that could segregate this form from the western barren ground type.&quot; But Skal 1982 had included specimens from the &quot;eastern&quot; end of the Alaska Peninsula and the Kenai Peninsula, the range of the larger Stone&#x27;s caribou. Later, geneticists comparing barren-ground caribou of Alaska with those of mainland Canada found little difference and they all became the former &quot;R. t. groenlandicus&quot; (now &quot;R. t. arcticus&quot;). &quot;R. t. granti&quot; was lost in the oblivion of invalid taxonomy until Alaskan researchers sampled some small, pale caribou from the western end of the Alaska Peninsula, their range enclosing the type locality designated by Allen (1902) and found them to be genetically distinct from all other caribou in Alaska. Thus, &quot;granti&quot; was rediscovered, its range restricted to that originally described.

Stone&#x27;s caribou (&quot;R. t. stonei&quot;), a large montane type, was described from the Kenai Peninsula (where, apparently, it was never common except in years of great abundance), the eastern end of the Alaska Peninsula, and mountains throughout southern and eastern Alaska. It was placed under &quot;R. arcticus&quot; as a subspecies, &quot;R. t. stonei&quot;, and later synonymised as noted above. The same genetic analyses mentioned above for &quot;R. t. granti&quot; resulted in resurrecting &quot;R. t. stonei&quot; as well.

The Sakhalin reindeer (&quot;R. t. setoni&quot;), endemic to Sakhalin, was described as &quot;Rangifer tarandus setoni&quot; Flerov, 1933, but Banfield (1961) brought it under &quot;R. t. fennicus&quot; as a junior synonym. The wild reindeer on the island are apparently extinct, having been replaced by domestic reindeer.

Some of the &quot;Rangifer&quot; species and subspecies may be further divided by ecotype depending on several behavioral factors – predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling, woodland, woodland (boreal), woodland (migratory) or woodland (mountain), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration patterns (sedentary or migratory). North American examples of this are the Torngat Mountain population DU10, an ecotype of &quot;R. t. caboti&quot;; a recently discovered and unnamed clade between the Mackenzie River and Great Bear Lake of Beringian-Eurasian lineage, an ecotype of &quot;R. t. osborni&quot;; the Atlantic-Gaspésie population DU11, an eastern montane ecotype of the boreal woodland caribou (&quot;R. t. caribou&quot;); the Baffin Island caribou, an ecotype of the barren-ground caribou (&quot;R. t. arcticus&quot;); and the Dolphin-Union &quot;herd&quot;, another ecotype of &quot;R. t. arcticus&quot;. The last three of these likely qualify as subspecies, but they have not yet been formally described or named.

== Physical characteristics ==
Naming in this and following sections follows the taxonomy in the authoritative 2011 reference work &quot;Handbook of the Mammals of the World Vol. 2: Hoofed Mammals&quot;.

=== Antlers ===

In most cervid species, only males grow antlers; the reindeer is the only cervid species in which females also grow them normally. Androgens play an essential role in the antler formation of cervids. The antlerogenic genes in reindeer have more sensitivity to androgens in comparison with other cervids.

There is considerable variation among species and subspecies in the size of the antlers (e.g., they are rather small and spindly in the northernmost species and subspecies), but on average the bull&#x27;s antlers are the second largest of any extant deer, after those of the male moose. In the largest subspecies, the antlers of large bulls can range up to in width and in beam length. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among living deer species. Antler size measured in number of points reflects the nutritional status of the reindeer and climate variation of its environment. The number of points on male reindeer increases from birth to 5 years of age and remains relatively constant from then on. &quot;In male caribou, antler mass (but not the number of tines) varies in concert with body mass.&quot; While antlers of male woodland caribou are typically smaller than those of male barren-ground caribou, they can be over across. They are flattened in cross-section, compact and relatively dense. Geist describes them as frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers. Woodland caribou antlers are thicker and broader than those of the barren-ground caribou and their legs and heads are longer. Quebec-Labrador male caribou antlers can be significantly larger and wider than other woodland caribou. Central barren-ground male caribou antlers are perhaps the most diverse in configuration and can grow to be very high and wide. Osborn&#x27;s caribou antlers are typically the most massive, with the largest circumference measurements.

The antlers&#x27; main beams begin at the brow &quot;extending posterior over the shoulders and bowing so that the tips point forward. The prominent, palmate brow tines extend forward, over the face.&quot; The antlers typically have two separate groups of points, lower and upper.

Antlers begin to grow on male reindeer in March or April and on female reindeer in May or June. This process is called antlerogenesis. Antlers grow very quickly every year on the bulls. As the antlers grow, they are covered in thick velvet, filled with blood vessels and spongy in texture. The antler velvet of the barren-ground caribou and the boreal woodland caribou is dark chocolate brown. The velvet that covers growing antlers is a highly vascularised skin. This velvet is dark brown on woodland or barren-ground caribou and slate-grey on Peary caribou and the Dolphin-Union caribou herd. Velvet lumps in March can develop into a rack measuring more than a in length by August.
When the antler growth is fully grown and hardened, the velvet is shed or rubbed off. To Inuit, for whom the caribou is a &quot;culturally important keystone species&quot;, the months are named after landmarks in the caribou life cycle. For example, &quot;amiraijaut&quot; in the Igloolik region is &quot;when velvet falls off caribou antlers.&quot;

Male reindeer use their antlers to compete with other males during the mating season. Butler (1986) showed that the social requirements of caribou females during the rut determines the mating strategies of males and, consequently, the form of male antlers. In describing woodland caribou, which have a harem-defense mating system, SARA wrote, &quot;During the rut, males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers. Large males with large antlers do most of the mating.&quot; Reindeer continue to migrate until the bulls have spent their back fat. By contrast, barren-ground caribou males tend individual females and their fights are brief and much less intense; consequently, their antlers are long, and thin, round in cross-section and less branched and are designed more for show (or sexual attraction) than fighting.

In late autumn or early winter after the rut, male reindeer lose their antlers, growing a new pair the next summer with a larger rack than the previous year. Female reindeer keep their antlers until they calve. In the Scandinavian and Arctic Circle populations, old bulls&#x27; antlers fall off in late December, young bulls&#x27; antlers fall off in the early spring, and cows&#x27; antlers fall off in the summer.

When male reindeer shed their antlers in early to mid-winter, the antlered cows acquire the highest ranks in the feeding hierarchy, gaining access to the best forage areas. These cows are healthier than those without antlers. Calves whose mothers do not have antlers are more prone to disease and have a significantly higher mortality. Cows in good nutritional condition, for example, during a mild winter with good winter range quality, may grow new antlers earlier as antler growth requires high intake.
According to a respected Igloolik elder, Noah Piugaattuk, who was one of the last outpost camp leaders, caribou (&quot;tuktu&quot;) antlers

According to the Igloolik Oral History Project (IOHP), &quot;Caribou antlers provided the Inuit with a myriad of implements, from snow knives and shovels to drying racks and seal-hunting tools. A complex set of terms describes each part of the antler and relates it to its various uses&quot;. Currently, the larger racks of antlers are used by Inuit in Inuit art as materials for carving. Iqaluit-based Jackoposie Oopakak&#x27;s 1989 carving, entitled &quot;Nunali&quot;, which means &quot;place where people live&quot;, and which is part of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada, includes a massive set of caribou antlers on which he has intricately carved the miniaturized world of the Inuit where &quot;Arctic birds, caribou, polar bears, seals, and whales are interspersed with human activities of fishing, hunting, cleaning skins, stretching boots, and travelling by dog sled and kayak...from the base of the antlers to the tip of each branch&quot;.

=== Pelt ===
The color of the fur varies considerably, both between individuals and depending on season and species. Northern populations, which usually are relatively small, are whiter, while southern populations, which typically are relatively large, are darker. This can be seen well in North America, where the northernmost subspecies, the Peary caribou, is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent, while the Selkirk Mountains caribou (Southern Mountain population DU9) is the darkest and nearly the largest, only exceeded in size by Osborn&#x27;s caribou (Northern Mountain population DU7).

The coat has two layers of fur: a dense woolly undercoat and a longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs.{{efn|According to Inuit elder Marie Kilunik of the Aivilingmiut, Canadian Inuit preferred the caribou skins from caribou taken in the late summer or autumn, when their coats had thickened. They used it for winter clothing &quot;because each hair is hollow and fills with air trapping heat.&quot; Fur is the primary insulation factor that allows reindeer to regulate their core body temperature in relation to their environment, the thermogradient, even if the temperature rises to {{cvt|100|F|order=flip}}. In 1913, Dugmore noted how the woodland caribou swim so high out of the water, unlike any other mammal, because their hollow, &quot;air-filled, quill-like hair&quot; acts as a supporting &quot;life jacket&quot;.

A darker belly color may be caused by two mutations of MC1R. They appear to be more common in domestic reindeer herds.

=== Heat exchange ===
Blood moving into the legs is cooled by blood returning to the body in a countercurrent heat exchange (CCHE), a highly efficient means of minimizing heat loss through the skin&#x27;s surface. In the CCHE mechanism, in cold weather, blood vessels are closely knotted and intertwined with arteries to the skin and appendages that carry warm blood with veins returning to the body that carry cold blood causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. In this way, their legs for example are kept cool, maintaining the core body temperature nearly {{cvt|30|C-change}} higher with less heat lost to the environment. Heat is thus recycled instead of being dissipated. The &quot;heart does not have to pump blood as rapidly in order to maintain a constant body core temperature and thus, metabolic rate.&quot; CCHE is present in animals like reindeer, fox and moose living in extreme conditions of cold or hot weather as a mechanism for retaining the heat in (or out of) the body. These are countercurrent exchange systems with the same fluid, usually blood, in a circuit, used for both directions of flow.

Reindeer have specialized counter-current vascular heat exchange in their nasal passages. Temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control. Incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lungs and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the reindeer&#x27;s breath is exhaled, then used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly be absorbed into the blood through the mucous membranes. Like moose, caribou have specialized noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils.

=== Hooves ===
The reindeer has large feet with crescent-shaped cloven hooves for walking in snow or swamps. According to the Species at Risk Public Registry (SARA), woodland
{{blockquote|&quot;Caribou have large feet with four toes. In addition to two small ones, called &quot;dew claws,&quot; they have two large, crescent-shaped toes that support most of their weight and serve as shovels when digging for food under snow. These large concave hooves offer stable support on wet, soggy ground and on crusty snow. The pads of the hoof change from a thick, fleshy shape in the summer to become hard and thin in the winter months, reducing the animal&#x27;s exposure to the cold ground. Additional winter protection comes from the long hair between the &quot;toes&quot;; it covers the pads so the caribou walks only on the horny rim of the hooves.&quot;|source=SARA 2014}}

Reindeer hooves adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as &quot;cratering&quot;) through the snow to their favourite food, a lichen known as reindeer lichen (&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot;).

=== Size ===
The females (or &quot;cows&quot; as they are often called) usually measure {{cvt|162|-|205|cm}} in length and weigh {{cvt|80|-|120|kg}}. The males (or &quot;bulls&quot; as they are often called) are typically larger (to an extent which varies between the different species and subspecies), measuring {{cvt|180|-|214|cm}} in length and usually weighing {{cvt|159|-|182|kg}}. Exceptionally large bulls have weighed as much as {{cvt|318|kg}}. Weight varies drastically between the seasons, with bulls losing as much as 40% of their pre-rut weight.

The shoulder height is usually {{cvt|85|to|150|cm}}, and the tail is {{cvt|14|to|20|cm}} long.

The reindeer from Svalbard are the smallest of all. They are also relatively short-legged and may have a shoulder height of as little as {{cvt|80|cm}}, thereby following Allen&#x27;s rule.

=== Clicking sound ===
The knees of many species and subspecies of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound as they walk. The sounds originate in the tendons of the knees and may be audible from several hundred meters away. The frequency of the knee-clicks is one of a range of signals that establish relative positions on a dominance scale among reindeer. &quot;Specifically, loud knee-clicking is discovered to be an honest signal of body size, providing an exceptional example of the potential for non-vocal acoustic communication in mammals.&quot; The clicking sound made by reindeer as they walk is caused by small tendons slipping over bone protuberances (sesamoid bones) in their feet. The sound is made when a reindeer is walking or running, occurring when the full weight of the foot is on the ground or just after it is relieved of the weight.

=== Eyes ===
A study by researchers from University College London in 2011 revealed that reindeer can see light with wavelengths as short as 320 nm (i.e. in the ultraviolet range), considerably below the human threshold of 400 nm. It is thought that this ability helps them to survive in the Arctic, because many objects that blend into the landscape in light visible to humans, such as urine and fur, produce sharp contrasts in ultraviolet. It has been proposed that UV flashes on power lines are responsible for reindeer avoiding power lines because &quot;...in darkness these animals see power lines not as dim, passive structures but, rather, as lines of flickering light stretching across the terrain.&quot;

In 2023, researchers studying reindeer living in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland, suggested that UV visual sensitivity in reindeer helps them detect UV-absorbing lichens against a background of UV-reflecting snows.

The tapetum lucidum of Arctic reindeer eyes changes in color from gold in summer to blue in winter to improve their vision during times of continuous darkness, and perhaps enable them to better spot predators.

== Biology and behaviors ==
=== Seasonal body composition ===
Reindeer have developed adaptations for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months as well as for during cold months. The body composition of reindeer varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and non-breeding females between the seasons. Breeding females have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around {{cvt|10|kg}} more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than breeding females, as non-breeding females are able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both breeding and non-breeding females peaks in September. During the months of March through April, breeding females have more fat mass than the non-breeding females with a difference of almost {{cvt|3|kg}}. After this, however, non-breeding females on average have a higher body fat mass than do breeding females.

The environmental variations play a large part in reindeer nutrition, as winter nutrition is crucial to adult and neonatal survival rates. Lichens are a staple during the winter months as they are a readily available food source, which reduces the reliance on stored body reserves. Lichens are a crucial part of the reindeer diet; however, they are less prevalent in the diet of pregnant reindeer compared to non-pregnant individuals. The amount of lichen in a diet is found more in non-pregnant adult diets than pregnant individuals due to the lack of nutritional value. Although lichens are high in carbohydrates, they are lacking in essential proteins that vascular plants provide. The amount of lichen in a diet decreases in latitude, which results in nutritional stress being higher in areas with low lichen abundance.{{rp|6}}

In a study of seasonal light-dark cycles on sleep patterns of female reindeer, researchers performed non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) on reindeer kept in a stable at the UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The EEG recordings showed that: (1) the more time reindeer spend ruminating, the less time they spend in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep); and (2) reindeer&#x27;s brainwaves during rumination resemble the brainwaves present during NREM sleep. These results suggest that, by reducing the time requirement for NREM sleep, reindeer are able to spend more time feeding during the summer months, when food is abundant.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
{{Further|Rut (mammalian reproduction)#Cervidae}}
Reindeer mate in late September to early November, and the gestation period is about 228–234 days. During the mating season, bulls battle for access to cows. Two bulls will lock each other&#x27;s antlers together and try to push each other away. The most dominant bulls can collect as many as 15–20 cows to mate with. A bull will stop eating during this time and lose much of his body fat reserves.

To calve, &quot;females travel to isolated, relatively predator-free areas such as islands in lakes, peatlands, lake-shores, or tundra.&quot; As females select the habitat for the birth of their calves, they are warier than males. Dugmore noted that, in their seasonal migrations, the herd follows a female for that reason. Newborns weigh on average {{cvt|6|kg}}. In May or June, the calves are born. After 45 days, the calves are able to graze and forage, but continue suckling until the following autumn when they become independent from their mothers.

Bulls live four years less than the cows, whose maximum longevity is about 17 years. Cows with a normal body size and who have had sufficient summer nutrition can begin breeding anytime between the ages of 1 and 3 years. When a cow has undergone nutritional stress, it is possible for her to not reproduce for the year. Dominant bulls, those with larger body size and antler racks, inseminate more than one cow a season.

=== Social structure, migration and range ===

Some populations of North American caribou; for example, many herds in the barren-ground caribou subspecies and some woodland caribou in Ungava and northern Labrador, migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal, traveling up to {{cvt|5000|km|-3}} a year, and covering {{cvt|1000000|km2|-5}}. Other North American populations, the boreal woodland caribou for example, are largely sedentary. The European populations are known to have shorter migrations. Island populations, such as the Novaya Zemlya and Svalbard reindeer and the Peary caribou, make local movements both within and among islands. Migrating reindeer can be negatively affected by parasite loads. Severely infected individuals are weak and probably have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary between populations. Infections create an effect known as culling: infected migrating animals are less likely to complete the migration.

Normally travelling about {{cvt|19|-|55|km}} a day while migrating, the caribou can run at speeds of {{cvt|60|-|80|km/h}}. Young calves can already outrun an Olympic sprinter when only 1 day old. During the spring migration, smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of 50,000 to 500,000 animals, but during autumn migrations, the groups become smaller and the reindeer begin to mate. During winter, reindeer travel to forested areas to forage under the snow. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds. A reindeer can swim easily and quickly, normally at about {{cvt|6.5|km/h}} but, if necessary, at {{cvt|10|km/h}} and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river.

The barren-ground caribou form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from winter feeding grounds in taiga to spring calving grounds and summer range in the tundra. The migrations of the Porcupine herd of barren-ground caribou are among the longest of any mammal. Greenland caribou, found in southwestern Greenland, are &quot;mixed migrators&quot; and many individuals do not migrate; those that do migrate less than 60 km. Unlike the individual-tending mating system, aggregated rutting, synchronized calving and aggregated post-calving of barren-ground caribou, Greenland caribou have a harem-defense mating system and dispersed calving and they do not aggregate.

Although most wild tundra reindeer migrate between their winter range in taiga and summer range in tundra, some ecotypes or herds are more or less sedentary. Novaya Zemlya reindeer (&quot;R. t. pearsoni&quot;) formerly wintered on the mainland and migrated across the ice to the islands for summer, but only a few now migrate. Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. fennicus&quot;) were formerly distributed in most of the coniferous forest zones south of the tree line, including some mountains, but are now spottily distributed within this zone.

=== Distribution and habitat ===

{{main|Reindeer distribution}}
Originally, the reindeer was found in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Greenland, Russia, Mongolia and northern China north of the 50th latitude. In North America, it was found in Canada, Alaska, and the northern contiguous United States from Maine to Washington. In the 19th century, it was still present in southern Idaho. Even in historical times, it probably occurred naturally in Ireland, and it is believed to have lived in Scotland until the 12th century, when the last reindeer were hunted in Orkney. During the Late Pleistocene Epoch, reindeer occurred further south in North America, such as in Nevada, Tennessee, and Alabama, and as far south as Spain in Europe. Though their range retreated northwards during the terminal Pleistocene, reindeer returned to Northern Europe during the Younger Dryas. Today, wild reindeer have disappeared from these areas, especially from the southern parts, where it vanished almost everywhere. Large populations of wild reindeer are still found in Norway, Finland, Siberia, Greenland, Alaska and Canada.

According to Grubb (2005), &quot;Rangifer&quot; is &quot;circumboreal in the tundra and taiga&quot; from &quot;Svalbard, Norway, Finland, Russia, Alaska (USA) and Canada including most Arctic islands, and Greenland, south to northern Mongolia, China (Inner Mongolia), Sakhalin Island, and USA (northern Idaho and Great Lakes region).&quot; Reindeer were introduced to, and are feral in, &quot;Iceland, Kerguelen Islands, South Georgia Island, Pribilof Islands, St. Matthew Island&quot;; a free-ranging semi-domesticated herd is also present in Scotland.

There is strong regional variation in &quot;Rangifer&quot; herd size. There are large population differences among individual herds and the size of individual herds has varied greatly since 1970. The largest of all herds (in Taimyr, Russia) has varied between 400,000 and 1,000,000; the second largest herd (at the George River in Canada) has varied between 28,000 and 385,000.

While &quot;Rangifer&quot; is a widespread and numerous genus in the northern Holarctic, being present in both tundra and taiga (boreal forest), by 2013, many herds had &quot;unusually low numbers&quot; and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be. Caribou and reindeer numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range. This global decline is linked to climate change for northern migratory herds and industrial disturbance of habitat for non-migratory herds. Barren-ground caribou are susceptible to the effects of climate change due to a mismatch in the phenological process between the availability of food during the calving period.

In November 2016, it was reported that more than 81,000 reindeer in Russia had died as a result of climate change. Longer autumns, leading to increased amounts of freezing rain, created a few inches of ice over lichen, causing many reindeer to starve to death.

=== Diet ===
Reindeer are ruminants, having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat lichens in winter, especially reindeer lichen (&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot;); they are the only large mammal able to metabolize lichen owing to specialised bacteria and protozoa in their gut. They are also the only animals (except for some gastropods) in which the enzyme lichenase, which breaks down lichenin to glucose, has been found. However, they also eat the leaves of willows and birches, as well as sedges and grasses.

Reindeer are osteophagous; they are known to gnaw and partly consume shed antlers as a dietary supplement and in some extreme cases will cannibalise each other&#x27;s antlers before shedding. There is also some evidence to suggest that on occasion, especially in the spring when they are nutritionally stressed, they will feed on small rodents (such as lemmings), fish (such as the Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;)), and bird eggs. Reindeer herded by the Chukchis have been known to devour mushrooms enthusiastically in late summer.

During the Arctic summer, when there is continuous daylight, reindeer change their sleeping pattern from one synchronised with the sun to an ultradian pattern, in which they sleep when they need to digest food.

&quot;δ&quot;13CC values indicate reindeer living in the region around Biśnik Cave exhibited minimal ecological change during the transition from MIS 3 to MIS 2. Dental mesowear indicates that during the Late Pleistocene, reindeer living in central Alaska had highly abrasive diets similar to wild horses.

=== Predators ===
A variety of predators prey heavily on reindeer, including overhunting by people in some areas, which contributes to the decline of populations.

Golden eagles prey on calves and are the most prolific hunter on the calving grounds. Wolverines will take newborn calves or birthing cows, as well as (less commonly) infirm adults.

Brown bears and polar bears prey on reindeer of all ages but, like wolverines, are most likely to attack weaker animals, such as calves and sick reindeer, since healthy adult reindeer can usually outpace a bear. The gray wolf is the most effective natural predator of adult reindeer and sometimes takes large numbers, especially during the winter. Some gray wolf packs, as well as individual grizzly bears in Canada, may follow and live off of a particular reindeer herd year-round.

In 2020, scientists on Svalbard witnessed, and were able to film for the first time, a polar bear attack reindeer, driving one into the ocean, where the polar bear caught up with and killed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman_10/22/2021&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Andrew | date=October 22, 2021 | title=Polar bear hunting a reindeer caught on tape for first time.

On Svalbard, reindeer remains account for 27.3% in polar bear scats, suggesting that they &quot;may be a significant part of the polar bear&#x27;s diet in that area&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stempniewicz_Kulaszewicz_Aars_10/12/2021&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stempniewicz | first1=Lech | last2=Kulaszewicz | first2=Izabela | last3=Aars | first3=Jon | title=Yes, they can: polar bears &quot;Ursus maritimus&quot; successfully hunt Svalbard reindeer &quot;Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus&quot; | journal=Polar Biology | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=44 | issue=11 | date=October 12, 2021 | issn=0722-4060 | doi=10.1007/s00300-021-02954-w | pages=2199–2206| bibcode=2021PoBio..44.2199S | s2cid=241470816 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, as carrion, reindeer may be scavenged opportunistically by red and Arctic foxes, various species of eagles, hawks and falcons, and common ravens.

Bloodsucking insects, such as mosquitoes, black flies, and especially the reindeer warble fly or reindeer botfly (&quot;Hypoderma tarandi&quot;) and the reindeer nose botfly (&quot;Cephenemyia trompe&quot;), are a plague to reindeer during the summer and can cause enough stress to inhibit feeding and calving behaviors. An adult reindeer will lose perhaps about {{cvt|1|L}} of blood to biting insects for every week it spends in the tundra. The population numbers of some of these predators is influenced by the migration of reindeer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Tormenting insects keep caribou on the move, searching for windy areas like hilltops and mountain ridges, rock reefs, lakeshore and forest openings, or snow patches that offer respite from the buzzing horde. Gathering in large herds is another strategy that caribou use to block insects.

Reindeer are good swimmers and, in one case, the entire body of a reindeer was found in the stomach of a Greenland shark (&quot;Somniosus microcephalus&quot;), a species found in the far North Atlantic.

=== Other threats ===
White-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm (&quot;Parelaphostrongylus tenuis&quot;), a nematode parasite that causes reindeer, moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;), and mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) to develop fatal neurological symptoms which include a loss of fear of humans. White-tailed deer that carry this worm are partially immune to it.

Changes in climate and habitat beginning in the 20th century have expanded range overlap between white-tailed deer and caribou, increasing the frequency of infection within the reindeer population. This increase in infection is a concern for wildlife managers. Human activities, such as &quot;clear-cutting forestry practices, forest fires, and the clearing for agriculture, roadways, railways, and power lines,&quot; favor the conversion of habitats into the preferred habitat of the white-tailed deer – &quot;open forest interspersed with meadows, clearings, grasslands, and riparian flatlands.&quot; Towards the end of the Soviet Union, there was increasingly open admission from the Soviet government that reindeer numbers were being negatively affected by human activity, and that this must be remediated especially by supporting reindeer breeding by native herders.

== Conservation ==
=== Current status ===

According to the IUCN, &quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;, as a species, is not endangered because of its overall large population and its widespread range, but, as of 2015, the IUCN has classified the reindeer as Vulnerable due to an observed population decline of 40% over the last +25 years. Some reindeer species and subspecies are rare and three subspecies have already become extinct.

In North America, the Queen Charlotte Islands caribou and the East Greenland caribou both became extinct in the early 20th century, the Peary caribou is designated as Endangered, the boreal woodland caribou is designated as Threatened and some individual populations are endangered as well. While the barren-ground caribou is not designated as Threatened, many individual herds — including some of the largest — are declining and there is much concern at the local level. Grant&#x27;s caribou, a small, pale subspecies endemic to the western end of the Alaska Peninsula and the adjacent islands, has not been assessed as to its conservation status.

The status of the Dolphin-Union &quot;herd&quot; was upgraded to Endangered in 2017. In NWT, Dolphin-Union caribou were listed as Special Concern under the NWT Species at Risk (NWT) Act (2013).

Both the Selkirk Mountains caribou (Southern Mountain population DU9) and the Rocky Mountain caribou (Central Mountain population DU8) are classified as Endangered in Canada in regions such as southeastern British Columbia at the Canada–United States border, along the Columbia and Kootenay Rivers and around Kootenay Lake. Rocky Mountain caribou are extirpated from Banff National Park, but a small population remains in Jasper National Park and in mountain ranges to the northwest into British Columbia. Montane caribou are now considered extirpated in the contiguous United States, including Washington and Idaho. Osborn&#x27;s caribou (Northern Mountain population DU7) is classified as Threatened in Canada.

In Eurasia, the Sakhalin reindeer is extinct (and has been replaced by domestic reindeer) and reindeer on most of the Novaya Zemlya islands have also been replaced by domestic reindeer, although some wild reindeer still persist on the northern islands. Many Siberian tundra reindeer herds have declined, some dangerously, but the Taymir herd remains strong and in total about 940,000 wild Siberian tundra reindeer were estimated in 2010.

There is strong regional variation in &quot;Rangifer&quot; herd size. By 2013, many caribou herds in North America had &quot;unusually low numbers&quot; and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be. Caribou numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range. There are many factors contributing to the decline in numbers.

=== Boreal woodland caribou===
Ongoing human development of their habitat has caused populations of boreal woodland caribou to disappear from their original southern range. In particular, boreal woodland caribou were extirpated in many areas of eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century. Professor Marco Musiani of the University of Calgary said in a statement that &quot;The woodland caribou is already an endangered subspecies in southern Canada and the United States...[The] warming of the planet means the disappearance of their critical habitat in these regions. Caribou need undisturbed lichen-rich environments and these types of habitats are disappearing.&quot;

Boreal woodland caribou were designated as Threatened in 2002 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, (COSEWIC). Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34 000 boreal woodland caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada (Environment Canada, 2011b). &quot;According to Geist, the &quot;woodland caribou is highly endangered throughout its distribution right into Ontario.&quot;

In 2002, the Atlantic-Gaspésie population DU11 of the boreal woodland caribou was designated as Endangered by COSEWIC. The small isolated population of 200 animals was at risk from predation and habitat loss.

=== Peary caribou===
In 1991, COSEWIC assigned &quot;endangered status&quot; to the Banks Island and High Arctic populations of the Peary caribou. The Low Arctic population of the Peary caribou was designated as Threatened. In 2004, all three were designated as &quot;endangered.&quot; In 2015, COSEWIC returned the status to Threatened.

== Relationship with humans ==

Arctic peoples have depended on caribou for food, clothing, and shelter. European prehistoric cave paintings represent both tundra and forest forms, the latter either the Finnish forest reindeer or the narrow-nosed reindeer, an eastern Siberia forest form. Canadian examples include the Caribou Inuit, the inland-dwelling Inuit of the Kivalliq Region in northern Canada, the Caribou Clan in the Yukon, the Iñupiat, the Inuvialuit, the Hän, the Northern Tutchone, and the Gwichʼin (who followed the Porcupine caribou herd for millennia). Hunting wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer are important to several Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples such as the Duhalar for meat, {{Ill|Reindeer hide|lt=hides|de|Rentierfell}}, antlers, {{Ill|Reindeer milk|lt=milk|ru|Оленье молоко}}, and transportation.

Reindeer have been domesticated at least two and probably three times, in each case from wild Eurasian tundra reindeer after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Recognizably different domestic reindeer breeds include those of the Evenk, Even, and Chukotka-Khargin people of Yakutia and the Nenets breed from the Nenets Autonomous district and Murmansk region; the Tuvans, Todzhans, Tofa (Tofalars in the Irkutsk Region), the Soyots (the Republic of Buryatia), and the Dukha (also known as Tsaatan, the Khubsugul) in the Province of Mongolia. The Sámi (Sápmi) have also depended on reindeer herding and fishing for centuries.{{rp|IV}}{{rp|16}} In Sápmi, reindeer are used to pull a pulk, a Nordic sled.

The reindeer has an important economic role for all circumpolar peoples, including the Sámi, the Swedes, the Norwegians, the Finns and the Northwestern Russians in Europe, the Nenets, the Khanty, the Evenks, the Yukaghirs, the Chukchi and the Koryaks in Asia and the Inuit in North America. It is believed that domestication started between the Bronze and Iron Ages. Siberian reindeer owners also use the reindeer to ride on (Siberian reindeer are larger than their Scandinavian relatives). For breeders, a single owner may own hundreds or even thousands of animals. The numbers of Russian and Scandinavian reindeer herders have been drastically reduced since 1990. The sale of fur and meat is an important source of income. Reindeer were introduced into Alaska near the end of the 19th century; they interbred with the native caribou subspecies there. Reindeer herders on the Seward Peninsula have experienced significant losses to their herds from animals (such as wolves) following the wild caribou during their migrations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Reindeer meat is popular in the Scandinavian countries. Reindeer meatballs are sold canned. Sautéed reindeer is the best-known dish in Sápmi. In Alaska and Finland, reindeer sausage is sold in supermarkets and grocery stores. Reindeer meat is very tender and lean. It can be prepared fresh, but also dried, salted and hot- and cold-smoked. In addition to meat, almost all of the internal organs of reindeer can be eaten, some being traditional dishes. Furthermore, &quot;Lapin Poron liha&quot;, fresh reindeer meat completely produced and packed in Finnish Sápmi, is protected in Europe with PDO classification.

Reindeer antlers are powdered and sold as an aphrodisiac, or as a nutritional or medicinal supplement, to Asian markets.

The blood of the caribou was supposedly mixed with alcohol as drink by hunters and loggers in colonial Quebec to counter the cold. This drink is now enjoyed without the blood as a wine and whiskey drink known as &quot;Caribou&quot;.

=== Indigenous North Americans ===
{{missing information|section|US government intervention to introduce herding in the form of Alaska Reindeer Service; Canadian purchase from Alaska|date=March 2023}} 
Caribou are still hunted in Greenland and in North America. In the traditional lifestyles of some of Canada&#x27;s Inuit peoples and northern First Nations peoples, Alaska Natives, and the Kalaallit of Greenland, caribou is an important source of food, clothing, shelter and tools.

The Caribou Inuit are inland-dwelling Inuit in present-day Nunavut&#x27;s Kivalliq Region (formerly the Keewatin Region, Northwest Territories), Canada. They subsisted on caribou year-round, eating dried caribou meat in the winter. The Ahiarmiut are Caribou Inuit that followed the Qamanirjuaq barren-ground caribou herd.

There is an Inuit saying in the Kivalliq Region:

{{blockquote|The caribou feeds the wolf, but it is the wolf who keeps the caribou strong.|Kivalliq region}}

Elder Chief of Koyukuk and chair for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group Benedict Jones, or Kʼughtoʼoodenoolʼoʼ, represents the Middle Yukon River, Alaska. His grandmother was a member of the Caribou Clan, who travelled with the caribou as a means to survive. In 1939, they were living their traditional lifestyle at one of their hunting camps in Koyukuk near the location of what is now the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge. His grandmother made a pair of new mukluks in one day. Kʼughtoʼoodenoolʼoʼ recounted a story told by an elder, who &quot;worked on the steamboats during the gold rush days out on the Yukon.&quot; In late August, the caribou migrated from the Alaska Range up north to Huslia, Koyukuk and the Tanana area. One year when the steamboat was unable to continue, they ran into a caribou herd estimated to number 1 million animals, migrating across the Yukon. &quot;They tied up for seven days waiting for the caribou to cross. They ran out of wood for the steamboats, and had to go back down 40 miles to the wood pile to pick up some more wood. On the tenth day, they came back and they said there was still caribou going across the river night and day.&quot;

The Gwichʼin, an indigenous people of northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska, have been dependent on the international migratory Porcupine caribou herd for millennia.{{rp|142}} To them, caribou — &quot;vadzaih&quot; — is the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the Gwich&#x27;in, just as the American buffalo is to the Plains Native Americans. Innovative language revitalisation projects are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger Gwich&#x27;in speakers. In one project, lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwich&#x27;in elder Kenneth Frank works with linguists who include young Gwich&#x27;in speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy. The main goal of the research was to &quot;elicit not only what the Gwich&#x27;in know about caribou anatomy, but how they see caribou and what they say and believe about caribou that defines themselves, their dietary and nutritional needs, and their subsistence way of life.&quot; Elders have identified at least 150 descriptive Gwich&#x27;in names for all of the bones, organs and tissues. Associated with the caribou&#x27;s anatomy are not just descriptive Gwich&#x27;in names for all of the body parts, including bones, organs, and tissues, but also &quot;an encyclopedia of stories, songs, games, toys, ceremonies, traditional tools, skin clothing, personal names and surnames, and a highly developed ethnic cuisine.&quot; In the 1980s, Gwich&#x27;in Traditional Management Practices were established to protect the Porcupine caribou, upon which the Gwich&#x27;in depend. They &quot;codified traditional principles of caribou management into tribal law&quot; which include &quot;limits on the harvest of caribou and procedures to be followed in processing and transporting caribou meat&quot; and limits on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip.

=== Indigenous Eurasians ===
Reindeer herding has been vital for the subsistence of several Eurasian nomadic indigenous peoples living in the circumpolar Arctic zone such as the Sámi, Nenets, and Komi. Reindeer are used to provide renewable sources and reliable transportation. In Mongolia, the Dukha are known as the reindeer people. They are credited as one of the world&#x27;s earliest domesticators. The Dukha diet consists mainly of reindeer dairy products.

Reindeer husbandry is common in northern Fennoscandia (northern Norway, Sweden and Finland) and the Russian North. In some human groups such as the Eveny, wild reindeer and domestic reindeer are treated as different kinds of beings.

=== Husbandry ===
{{Main|Reindeer herding}}

The reindeer is the only successfully semi-domesticated deer on a large scale in the world. Reindeer in northern Fennoscandia (northern Norway, Sweden and Finland) as well in the Kola Peninsula and Yakutia in Russia, are mostly semi-domesticated reindeer, ear-marked by their owners. Some reindeer in the area are truly domesticated, mostly used as draught animals (nowadays commonly for tourist entertainment and races, traditionally important for the nomadic Sámi). Domestic reindeer have also been used for milk, e.g., in Norway.

There are only two genetically pure populations of wild reindeer in Northern Europe: wild mountain reindeer (&quot;R. t. tarandus&quot;) that live in central Norway, with a population in 2007 of between 6,000 and 8,400 animals; and wild Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;R. t. fennicus&quot;) that live in central and eastern Finland and in Russian Karelia, with a population of about 4,350, plus 1,500 in Arkhangelsk Oblast and 2,500 in Komi. East of Arkhangelsk, both wild Siberian tundra reindeer (&quot;R. t. sibiricus&quot;) (some herds are very large) and domestic reindeer (&quot;R. t. domesticus&quot;) occur with almost no interbreeding by wild reindeer into domestic clades and none the other way (Kharzinova et al. 2018; Rozhkov et al. 2020).

DNA analysis indicates that reindeer were independently domesticated at least twice: in Fennoscandia and Western Russia (and possibly also Eastern Russia). Reindeer have been herded for centuries by several Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples, including the Sámi, the Nenets and the Yakuts. They are raised for their meat, hides and antlers and, to a lesser extent, for milk and transportation. Reindeer are not considered fully domesticated, as they generally roam free on pasture grounds. In traditional nomadic herding, reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coastal and inland areas according to an annual migration route and herds are keenly tended. However, reindeer were not bred in captivity, though they were tamed for milking as well as for use as draught animals or beasts of burden. Millais (1915), for example, shows a photograph (Plate LXXX) of an &quot;Okhotsk Reindeer&quot; saddled for riding (the rider standing behind it) beside an officer astride a steppe pony that is only slightly larger. Domestic reindeer are shorter-legged and heavier than their wild counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In Scandinavia, management of reindeer herds is primarily conducted through &quot;siida&quot;, a traditional Sámi form of cooperative association.

The use of reindeer for transportation is common among the nomadic peoples of the Russian North (but not anymore in Scandinavia). Although a sled drawn by 20 reindeer will cover no more than {{cvt|20|–|25|km}} a day (compared to {{cvt|7|–|10|km}} on foot, {{cvt|70|–|80|km}} by a dog sled loaded with cargo and {{cvt|150|–|180|km}} by a dog sled without cargo), it has the advantage that the reindeer will discover their own food, while a pack of 5–7 sled dogs requires {{cvt|10|–|14|kg}} of fresh fish a day.

The use of reindeer as semi-domesticated livestock in Alaska was introduced in the late 19th century by the United States Revenue Cutter Service, with assistance from Sheldon Jackson, as a means of providing a livelihood for Alaska Natives. Reindeer were imported first from Siberia and later also from Norway. A regular mail run in Wales, Alaska, used a sleigh drawn by reindeer. In Alaska, reindeer herders use satellite telemetry to track their herds, using online maps and databases to chart the herd&#x27;s progress.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Domestic reindeer are mostly found in northern Fennoscandia and the Russian North, with a herd of approximately 150–170 reindeer living around the Cairngorms region in Scotland. The last remaining wild tundra reindeer in Europe are found in portions of southern Norway. The International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR), a circumpolar organisation, was established in 2005 by the Norwegian government. ICR represents over 20 indigenous reindeer peoples and about 100,000 reindeer herders in nine different national states. In Finland, there are about 6,000 reindeer herders, most of whom keep small herds of less than 50 reindeer to raise additional income. With 185,000 reindeer ({{as of|2001|lc=yes}}), the industry produces {{convert|2,000|MT|ST}} of reindeer meat and generates 35 million euros annually. 70% of the meat is sold to slaughterhouses. Reindeer herders are eligible for national and EU agricultural subsidies, which constituted 15% of their income. Reindeer herding is of central importance for the local economies of small communities in sparsely populated rural Sápmi.
Currently, many reindeer herders are heavily dependent on diesel fuel to provide for electric generators and snowmobile transportation, although solar photovoltaic systems can be used to reduce diesel dependency.
=== History ===
Reindeer hunting by humans has a very long history.

{{blockquote| Wild reindeer &quot;may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting.&quot;}}

Both Aristotle and Theophrastus have short accounts – probably based on the same source – of an ox-sized deer species, named &quot;tarandos&quot;, living in the land of the Bodines in Scythia, which was able to change the colour of its fur to obtain camouflage. The latter is probably a misunderstanding of the seasonal change in reindeer fur colour. The descriptions have been interpreted as being of reindeer living in the southern Ural Mountains in c. 350 BC.

A deer-like animal described by Julius Caesar in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; (chapter 6.26) from the Hercynian Forest in the year 53 BC is most certainly to be interpreted as a reindeer:
{{blockquote|There is an ox shaped like a stag. In the middle of its forehead a single horn grows between its ears, taller and straighter than the animal horns with which we are familiar. At the top this horn spreads out like the palm of a hand or the branches of a tree. The females are of the same form as the males, and their horns are the same shape and size.}}

According to Olaus Magnus&#x27;s &quot;Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus&quot; – printed in Rome in the year 1555 – Gustav I of Sweden sent 10 reindeer to Albert, Duke of Prussia, in the year 1533. It may be these animals that Conrad Gessner had seen or heard of.

During World War II, the Soviet Army used reindeer as pack animals to transport food, ammunition and post from Murmansk to the Karelian front and bring wounded soldiers, pilots and equipment back to the base. About 6,000 reindeer and more than 1,000 reindeer herders were part of the operation. Most herders were Nenets, who were mobilised from the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, but reindeer herders from the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Komi regions also participated.

In the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup event held in Levi, Finland each year, the winner of the women&#x27;s slalom event is awarded a reindeer. The prize is largely symbolic, as all the reindeer awarded continue living in on a farm in Finland.

=== Santa Claus ===

{{Main|Santa Claus&#x27;s reindeer}}

Around the world, public interest in reindeer peaks during the Christmas season. According to Western folklore, Santa Claus&#x27;s sleigh is pulled by flying reindeer. These reindeer were first named in the 1823 poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;, though the story originates earlier.

=== Mythology and art ===
Among the Inuit, there is a story of the origin of the caribou:
{{blockquote|Once upon a time there were no caribou on the earth. But there was a man who wished for caribou, and he cut a hole deep in the ground, and up this hole came caribou, many caribou. The caribou came pouring out, until the earth was almost covered with them. And when the man thought there were caribou enough for mankind, he closed up the hole again. Thus the caribou came up on earth.|}}

Inuit artists from the Barrenlands incorporate depictions of caribou — and items made from caribou antlers and skin — in carvings, drawings, prints and sculpture.

Contemporary Canadian artist Brian Jungen, of Dane-zaa First Nations ancestry, commissioned an installation entitled &quot;The ghosts on top of my head&quot; (2010–11) in Banff, Alberta, which depicts the antlers of caribou, elk and moose.
{{blockquote|I remember a story my Uncle Jack told me – a Dunne-Za creation story about how animals once ruled the earth and were ten times their size and that got me thinking about scale and using the idea of the antler, which is a thing that everyone is scared of, and making it into something more approachable and abstract.|Brian Jungen, 2011}}

Tomson Highway, CM is a Canadian and Cree playwright, novelist, and children&#x27;s author, who was born in a remote area north of Brochet, Manitoba. His father, Joe Highway, was a caribou hunter. His 2001 children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Caribou Song&quot;/&quot;atíhko níkamon&quot; was selected as one of the &quot;Top 10 Children&#x27;s Books&quot; by the Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The young protagonists of &quot;Caribou Song&quot;, like Tomson himself, followed the caribou herd with their families.

=== Heraldry and symbols ===
Several Norwegian municipalities have one or more reindeer depicted in their coats-of-arms: Eidfjord Municipality, Porsanger Municipality, Rendalen Municipality, Tromsø Municipality, Vadsø Municipality, and Vågå Municipality. The historic province of Västerbotten in Sweden has a reindeer in its coat of arms. The present Västerbotten County has very different borders and uses the reindeer combined with other symbols in its coat-of-arms. The city of Piteå also has a reindeer. The logo for Umeå University features three reindeer.

The Canadian 25-cent coin or &quot;quarter&quot; features a depiction of a caribou on one face. The caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut. A caribou statue was erected at the centre of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, marking the spot in France where hundreds of soldiers from Newfoundland were killed and wounded in World War I. There is a replica in Bowring Park in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland&#x27;s capital city.

Two municipalities in Finland have reindeer motifs in their coats-of-arms: Kuusamo has a running reindeer; and Inari has a fish with reindeer antlers.

<text>The &quot;Old World&quot; () is a term for Afro-Eurasia coined by Europeans after 1493, when they became aware of the existence of the Americas. It is used to contrast the continents of Africa, Europe, and Asia in the Eastern Hemisphere, previously thought of by the Europeans as comprising the entire world, with the &quot;New World&quot;, a term for the newly encountered lands of the Western Hemisphere, particularly the Americas. 

While located closer to Afro-Eurasia within the Eastern Hemisphere, Australia is considered neither an Old World nor a New World land, since it was only discovered by the Europeans later. Both Australia and Antarctica were associated instead with the &quot;Terra Australis&quot; that had been posited as a hypothetical southern continent.

==Etymology==
In the context of archaeology and world history, the term &quot;Old World&quot; includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the Bronze Age onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early civilizations, mostly in the temperate zone between roughly the 45th and 25th parallels north, in the area of the Mediterranean, including North Africa. It also included Mesopotamia, the Persian plateau, the Indian subcontinent, China, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.

These regions were connected via the Silk Road trade route, and they had a pronounced Iron Age period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called Axial Age, referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical Western (Hellenism, &quot;classical&quot;), Near Eastern (Zoroastrian and Abrahamic) and Far Eastern (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, Taoism) cultural spheres.

==Other names==
The mainland of Afro-Eurasia (excluding islands or island groups such as the British Isles, Japan, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and the Malay Archipelago) has been referred to as the &quot;World Island&quot;. The term may have been coined by Sir Halford John Mackinder in &quot;The Geographical Pivot of History&quot;.

<text>Fulham () is an area of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in West London, England, southwest of Charing Cross. It lies in a loop on the north bank of the River Thames, bordering Hammersmith, Kensington and Chelsea, with which it shares the area known as West Brompton. Over the Thames, Fulham faces Wandsworth, Putney, the London Wetland Centre in Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

First recorded by name in 691, it was an extensive Anglo-Saxon estate, the Manor of Fulham, and then a parish. It&#x27;s domain stretched from modern-day Chiswick in the west to Chelsea in the southeast; and from Harlesden in the northwest to Kensal Green in the northeast bordered by the littoral of Counter&#x27;s Creek and the Manor of Kensington. It originally included today&#x27;s Hammersmith. Between 1900 and 1965, it was demarcated as the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham, before its merger with the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith to create the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (known as the London Borough of Hammersmith from 1965 to 1979). The district is split between the western and south-western postal areas.

Fulham industrial history includes pottery, tapestry-weaving, paper-making and brewing in the 17th and 18th centuries in Fulham High Street, and later the automotive industry, aviation, food production, and laundries. In the 19th century, there was glass-blowing and this resurged in the 21st century with the Aronson-Noon studio and the former Zest gallery in Rickett Street. Lillie Bridge Depot, a railway engineering depot, opened in 1872, is associated with the building and extension of the London Underground, the electrification of Tube lines from the nearby Lots Road Power Station, and for well over a century has been the maintenance hub for rolling stock and track.

Two Premier League football clubs, Fulham and Chelsea, play in Fulham. Two other notable sporting clubs are the Hurlingham Club, known for polo, and the Queen&#x27;s tennis club, known for its annual pre-Wimbledon tennis tournament. In the 1800s, Lillie Bridge Grounds hosted the first meetings of the Amateur Athletic Association of England, the second FA Cup Final, and the first amateur boxing matches. The Lillie Bridge area was the home ground of the Middlesex County Cricket Club, before it moved to Marylebone.

==History==
The word Fulham originates from Old English, with Fulla being a personal name, and hamm being land hemmed in by water or marsh, or a river-meadow. So Fulla&#x27;s hemmed-in land. It is spelled Fuleham in the 1066 Domesday Book.

In recent years, there has been a great revival of interest in Fulham&#x27;s earliest history, largely due to the Fulham Archaeological Rescue Group. This has carried out a number of digs, particularly in the vicinity of Fulham Palace, which show that approximately 5,000 years ago Neolithic people were living by the riverside and in other parts of the area. Excavations have also revealed Roman settlements during the third and fourth centuries AD.

===Manor and Parish of Fulham===

There are two not necessarily conflicting versions of how Fulham Manor came into the possession of the Bishop of London. One states the manor (landholding) of Fulham was granted to Bishop Erkenwald about the year 691 for himself and his successors as Bishop of London. The alternative has it that The Manor of Fulham was acquired by Bishop Waldhere from Bishop Tyrhtel in AD 704. In due course the manor house became Fulham Palace, and for a millennium, the country residence of the Bishops of London.

The first written record of a church in Fulham dates from 1154, with the first known parish priest of All Saints Church, Fulham appointed in 1242. All Saints Church was enlarged in 1881 by Sir Arthur Blomfield.

Hammersmith was part of the ancient parish of Fulham up until 1834. Prior to that time it had been a perpetual curacy under the parish of Fulham. By 1834 it had so many residents, a separate parish with a vicar (no longer a curate) and vestry for works was created. The two areas did not come together again until the commencement of the London Government Act in 1965.

The parish boundary with Chelsea and Kensington was formed by the now culverted Counter&#x27;s Creek river, the course of which is now occupied by the West London Line. This parish boundary has been inherited by the modern boroughs of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and Kensington &amp; Chelsea.

===Early history===
In 879 Danish invaders sailed up the Thames and wintered at Fulham and Hammersmith. Raphael Holinshed (died 1580) wrote that the Bishop of London was lodging in his manor place in 1141 when Geoffrey de Mandeville, riding out from the Tower of London, took him prisoner. During the Commonwealth the manor was temporarily out of the bishops&#x27; hands, having been sold to Colonel Edmund Harvey.

In 1642, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, withdrawing from the Battle of Brentford (1642), ordered to be put a bridge of boats on the Thames to unite with his detachment in Kingston in pursuit of Charles I, who ordered Prince Rupert to retreat from Brentford back west. The King and Prince moved their troops from Reading to Oxford for the winter. This is thought to have been near the first bridge (which was made of wood). It was commonly named Fulham Bridge, built in 1729 and was replaced in 1886 with Putney Bridge.

Margravine Road recalls the existence of Brandenburgh House, a riverside mansion built by Sir Nicholas Crispe in the time of Charles I, and used as the headquarters of General Fairfax in 1647 during the civil wars. In 1792 it was occupied by Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his wife, and in 1820 by Caroline, consort of George IV. His non-political &#x27;wife&#x27; was Maria Fitzherbert who lived in East End House in Parson&#x27;s Green. They are reputed to have had several children.

The extract below of John Rocque&#x27;s Map of London, 1746 shows the Parish of Fulham in the loop of the Thames, with the boundary with Chelsea, Counter&#x27;s Creek, narrow and dark, flowing east into the river. The recently built, wooden, first Fulham/Putney bridge is shown and two Fulham village clusters, one central, one south-west.

===19th century transport and power plays===

The 19th century roused Walham Green village, and the surrounding hamlets that made up the parish of Fulham, from their rural slumber and market gardens with the advent first of power production and then more hesitant transport development. This was accompanied by accelerating urbanisation, as in other centres in the county of Middlesex, which encouraged trade skills among the growing population.

In 1824 the Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company, the first public utility company in the world, bought the Sandford estate in Sands End to produce gas for lighting — and in the case of the Hurlingham Club, for ballooning. Its ornately decorated number 2 gasholder is Georgian, completed in 1830 and reputed to be the oldest gasholder in the World. In connection with gas property portfolios, in 1843 the newly formed Westminster Cemetery Company had trouble persuading the Equitable Gas people (a future Imperial take-over) to sell them a small portion of land to gain southern access, onto the Fulham Road, from their recently laid out Brompton Cemetery, over the parish border in Chelsea. The sale was finally achieved through the intervention of cemetery shareholder and Fulham resident, John Gunter.

Meanwhile, another group of local landowners, led by Lord Kensington with Sir John Scott Lillie and others had conceived, in 1822, the idea of exploiting the water course up-river from Chelsea Creek on their land by turning it into a two-mile canal. It was to have a basin, a lock and wharves, to be known as the Kensington Canal, and link the Grand Union Canal with the Thames. In reality, however, the project was over budget and delayed by contractor bankruptcies and only opened in 1828, when railways were already gaining traction. The short-lived canal concept did however leave a legacy: the creation on Lillie&#x27;s land of a brewery and residential development, &#x27;Rosa&#x27;, and &#x27;Hermitage Cottages&#x27;, and several roads, notably, the Lillie Road connecting the canal bridge, (Lillie Bridge) at West Brompton with North End Lane and the eventual creation of two railway lines, the West London Line and the District line connecting South London with the rest of the capital. This was done with the input of two noted consulting engineers, Robert Stephenson in 1840 and from 1860, Sir John Fowler.

It meant that the area around Lillie Bridge was to make a lasting, if largely unsung, contribution for well over a century to the development and maintenance of public transport in London and beyond. Next to the Lillie Bridge engineering Depot, the Midland Railway established its own coal and goods yard.

In 1907 the engineering HQ of the Piccadilly Line in Richmond Place (16-18 Empress Place) oversaw the westward expansion of the line into the suburbs. At the turn of the century, the London Omnibus Co in Seagrave Road oversaw the transition of horse-drawn to motor buses, which were eventually integrated into London Transport and London Buses. This attracted a host of other automotive enterprises to move into the area.

With the growth of 19th-century transport links into East Fulham and its sporting venues by &#x27;Lillie Bridge&#x27;, along with the immediately neighbouring 24-acre Earl&#x27;s Court exhibition grounds, and the vast the Empress Hall (see entertainment section below). During the First World War it would become accommodation for Belgian refugees. Meanwhile, the historic hamlet of North End was massively redeveloped in the 1880s by Messrs Gibbs &amp; Flew, who built 1,200 houses on the fields. They had trouble disposing of the properties, so for public relations purposes, they renamed the area &#x27;West Kensington&#x27;, to refer to the more prosperous neighbourhood over the parish boundary.

The last farm to function in Fulham was Crabtree Farm, which closed at the beginning of the 20th century. A principal recorder of all these changes was a local man, Charles James Féret (1854-1921), who conducted research over a period of decades before publishing his three volume history of Fulham in 1900.

===Art and Craft===
Ceramics and weaving in Fulham go back to at least the 17th century, most notably with the Fulham Pottery, followed by the establishment of tapestry and carpet production with a branch of the French &#x27;Gobelins manufactory&#x27; and then the short-lived Parisot weaving school venture in the 1750s. William De Morgan, ceramicist and novelist, moved into Sands End with his painter wife, Evelyn De Morgan, where they lived and worked. Another artist couple, also members of the Arts and Crafts movement, lived at &#x27;the Grange&#x27; in North End, Georgiana Burne-Jones and her husband, Edward Burne-Jones, both couples were friends of William Morris.

Other artists who settled along the Lillie Road, were Francesco Bartolozzi, a florentine engraver and Benjamin Rawlinson Faulkner, a society portrait painter. Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, the French expressionist painter and friend of Ezra Pound, lived in Walham Green till his early death in 1915. Glass production was, until recently, represented by the stained glass studio of the purpose-built and Grade II listed Glass House in Lettice Street and latterly, by the Aaronson Noon Studio, with the &#x27;Zest&#x27; Gallery in Rickett Street, that was obliged to shut down in 2012, after 20 years by the developers of &#x27;Lillie Square&#x27; and Earl&#x27;s Court. Both glass businesses have now moved out of London.

The Art Bronze Foundry, founded by Charles Gaskin in 1922 operated in Michael Road, off the New King&#x27;s Road, a short distance from Eel Brook Common until it gave way to an apartment redevelopment in 2017. It had produced works by Henry Moore, Elisabeth Frink, Barbara Hepworth and Jacob Epstein among others. Its work may be seen in public spaces all over the world.

===20th century===

In 1926, the Church of England established the office of Bishop of Fulham as a suffragan to the Bishop of London.

Fulham remained a predominantly working-class area for the first half of the 20th century, with genteel pockets at North End, along the top of Lillie and New King&#x27;s roads, especially around Parsons Green, Eel Brook Common, South Park and the area surrounding the Hurlingham Club. Essentially, the area had attracted waves of immigrants from the countryside to service industrialisation and the more privileged parts of the capital.
With rapid demographic changes there was poverty, as noted by Charles Dickens (1812-1870) and Charles Booth (1840-1916). Fulham had its poorhouses, and attracted several benefactors, including: the Samuel Lewis (financier) Housing Trust, the Peabody Trust and the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation to provide low-cost housing.

The Metropolitan Asylums Board acquired in 1876 a 13-acre site at the bottom of Seagrave Road to build a fever hospital, &quot;The Western Hospital&quot;, that later became an NHS centre of excellence for treating polio until its closure in 1979. Bar one ward block remaining in private occupation, it was replaced by a gated-flats development and a small public space, Brompton Park.
Aside from the centuries-old brewing industry, exemplified by the Swan Brewery on the Thames, the main industrial activities involved motoring and early aviation — Rolls-Royce, Shell-Mex &amp; BP, Rover, the London General Omnibus Company — and rail engineering (Lillie Bridge Depot), laundries — the Palace Laundry is still extant — and the building trades. Later there developed distilling, Sir Robert Burnett&#x27;s &quot;White Satin Gin&quot;, food processing, e.g. Telfer&#x27;s Pies, Encafood and Spaghetti House, and Kodak&#x27;s photographic processing. This encouraged the southern stretch of North End Road to become Fulham&#x27;s unofficial &quot;High street&quot;, almost a mile from the actual Fulham High Street, with its own department store, F.H. Barbers, along with Woolworth&#x27;s, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury&#x27;s outlets, all long gone. The second ever Tesco shop opened in the North End Road. The UK&#x27;s reputedly oldest independent health-food shop, opened in 1966 by the Aetherius Society, still trades on Fulham Road.

Allied to these developments, the postwar period saw the extensive demolition of Fulham&#x27;s early 19th-century architectural stock, replaced by some Brutalist architecture — the current Ibis hotel — and the Empress State Building in Lillie Road that in 1962 replaced the declining Empress Hall. The London County Council and local council continued with much-needed council-housing development between World War II and up to the 1980s.

Fulham&#x27;s traditional population of working people has been partially displaced by affluent newcomers since the turn of the century.

===Piece of aviation history===
Geoffrey de Havilland, aviation pioneer, built his first aeroplane at his workshop in Bothwell Street, Fulham in 1909. Later, during the First World War, Cannon&#x27;s Brewery site at the corner of Lillie and North End Road was used for aircraft manufacture. The Darracq Motor Engineering Company of Townmead Road, became aircraft manufacturers in Fulham for the Airco company, producing De Havilland designs and components for the duration of the war.

===Musical heritage===
William Crathern, the composer, was organist at St Mary&#x27;s Church, West Kensington, when it was still known as North End. Edward Elgar, the composer, lived at 51 Avonmore Road, W14, between 1890 and 1891. The notorious Italian tenor Giovanni Matteo Mario de Candia and his wife opera singer Giulia Grisi, made Fulham their home from 1852 until the 1900s at a lovely country-manor where their daughters and son were born, among them writer Cecilia Maria de Candia. Conductor and composer Hyam Greenbaum married the harpist Sidonie Goossens on 26 April 1924 at Kensington Registry Office and they set up home in a first floor flat on the Fulham Road, opposite Michelin House.

===Redevelopment===

With the accession of Boris Johnson to the mayoralty of London, a controversial 80 acre high-rise redevelopment has been under way on the eastern borough boundary with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, involving the dismantling of the two Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Centres in RBKC and in Hammersmith and Fulham and the emptying and demolition of hundreds of commercial properties, thousands of both private and social housing units and including the demolition of a rare example in Fulham of mid-Victorian housing, designed by John Young, close to Grade I and II listed structures and to a number of conservation areas in both boroughs. It also involves the closure of the historic Lillie Bridge Depot, opened in 1872 and the dispersal of its operations by TfL

==Politics==

Fulham is part of two constituencies: one, Hammersmith bounded by the north side of the Lillie Road, is represented by Andy Slaughter for Labour, the other, Chelsea and Fulham parliamentary seat is currently held by Greg Hands for the Conservatives. Fulham was formerly a part of the Hammersmith and Fulham parliamentary constituency which was dissolved in 2010 to form the current seats. However, parts of Fulham continue to score highly on the Jarman Index, indicating poor health outcomes due to adverse socio-economic factors.

Fulham has in the past been solid Labour territory. Michael Stewart, one time Foreign Secretary in the Wilson government, was its long-standing MP, from 1945 until he stood down in 1979. It became a politically significant part of the country, having been the scene of two major parliamentary by-elections in the 20th century. In 1933, the Fulham East by-election became known as the &quot;peace by-election&quot;. The 1986 by-election following the death of Conservative MP, Martin Stevens, resulted in a Labour win for Nick Raynsford on a 10% swing.

With &quot;gentrification&quot;, Fulham voters have been leaning towards the Conservatives since the 1980s as the area underwent huge demographic change: the tightly packed terraces which had housed working-class families employed in trade, engineering and the industry that dominated Fulham&#x27;s riverside being gradually replaced with young professionals.

In the 2005 General Election, Greg Hands won the Hammersmith and Fulham Parliamentary seat for the Conservatives, polling 45.4% against Labour&#x27;s 35.2%, a 7.3% swing. In the 2010 General Election, he was re-elected this time for the newly formed Chelsea and Fulham constituency. In the 2015 General Election he was returned with an increased share of the vote. In the 2024 General Election Ben Coleman defeated Greg Hands by 151 votes to retake the seat for the Labour Party.

Hammersmith and Fulham is currently controlled by Labour. At the 2014 local elections, Labour won 11 seats from the Conservatives, giving them 26 councillors and control of the council (said to have been the then Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s &quot;favourite&quot;) for the first time since 2006.

==Sport, entertainment and life-style==

===Sport===

The first organised sporting activity in Fulham took place at the Lillie Bridge Grounds in the 1860s when British Amateur Athletics were introduced and the first codified Boxing under Marquess of Queensberry Rules matches were staged. The catalyst for sport in Fulham was the Cambridge rowing blue and sports administrator, Welshman John Graham Chambers. Later, with the destruction of the Lillie Bridge Grounds by a riot in 1889, they were replaced first by the Fulham F.C. stadium Craven Cottage and the Chelsea F.C. stadium at Stamford Bridge.
Other sports facilities were opened at The Queen&#x27;s Club for rackets and tennis and at the private members&#x27; Hurlingham Club, for a range of sporting activities in the south of the borough. Hurlingham Park&#x27;s tennis courts are used as netball courts and tennis nets are taken down and so restricting access to the courts for tennis. Hurlingham Park hosts the annual Polo in the Park tournament, which has become a recent feature of the area. The Hurlingham club is the historic home of polo in the United Kingdom and of the world governing body of polo.

Public tennis courts are located in Bishops Avenue, off Fulham Palace Road and on Eel Brook Common. Rugby is played on Eel Brook Common and in South Park. Normand Park in Lillie Road is the entry into the Virgin Active-operated &quot;Fulham Pools&quot; swimming facilities and neighbouring tennis courts.

Fulham has five active Bowls clubs: The Bishops Park Bowls club, The Hurlingham Park Bowls Club, Normand Park Bowls Club, The Parson&#x27;s Green Bowls club and The Winnington in Bishops Park.
===Entertainment===
The historic entertainment destinations in Fulham, have included Earl&#x27;s Court Pleasure Gardens, the brain-child of John Robinson Whitley, straddling the border with Kensington since 1879, then the 1894 Great Wheel and the 6,000-seater Empress Hall, built in 1894 at the instigation of international impresario, Imre Kiralfy — the scene of his spectacular shows and later sporting events and famous ice shows — and latterly, Earl&#x27;s Court II, part of the Earl&#x27;s Court Exhibition Centre in the neighbouring, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The first closed in 1959, replaced by an office block, the Empress State Building. The second, opened by Princess Diana, lasted just over 20 years until 2014. Along with the architecturally pleasing Mid-Victorian Empress Place, formerly access to the exhibition centre, it is destined for high rise re-development, but with usage as yet to be confirmed.

No trace is left today of either of Fulham&#x27;s two theatres, both opened in 1897. The &#x27;Grand Theatre&#x27; was on the approach to Putney Bridge and was designed by the prolific WGR Sprague, author of venues such as Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre and the Aldwych Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. It gave way to office blocks in the late 1950s. The &#x27;Granville Theatre&#x27;, founded by Dan Leno, to the design of Frank Matcham, once graced a triangle of land at Walham Green. After the Music hall era had passed, It served as a film and television studio, but was finally demolished in 1971. It too has been replaced by an office block in Fulham Broadway.

The performing arts continue in Fulham, like the notable Fulham Symphony Orchestra and the successful Fulham Opera. St John&#x27;s Parish Church, at the top of North End Road, stages choral and instrumental concerts as do other churches in the area.

There is a cinema complex as part of the Fulham Broadway Centre. Fulham Town Hall, built in 1888 in the &quot;classical renaissance&quot;, was used as a popular venue for concerts and dances, especially its Grand Hall. Behind Fulham Broadway, the heart of the original village of Walham Green has undergone pedestrianisation, including the spot once occupied by the village green and its pond next to St. John&#x27;s Parish Church and bordered by a number of cafés, bars, and a dance studio in the old Fulham Public Baths. The largest extant supermarket in Fulham, is located on the site of a cinema later converted to the iconic &quot;Dicky Dirts&quot; jean store with its sloping shop-floor, at the top of North End Road&#x27;s Street market. It started a new trend in how retail was done.

The debut albums by 1970s new wave bands The Stranglers (&quot;Rattus Norvegicus&quot;) and Generation X (&quot;Generation X&quot;) were recorded at TW Studios, 211 Fulham Palace Road. The Greyhound music venue at 176 Fulham Palace Road hosted up and coming punk, post-punk and indie bands in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Film music creator, Hans Zimmer double Oscar winner, launched his career in a studio behind the Lillie Langtry public house in Lillie Road in the 1970s.

===Gin, breweries and pubs===

The most illustrious brewery in Fulham was the Swan Brewery, Walham Green, dating back to the 17th century. Among its patrons were kings and other royalty. It was followed by the North End Brewery in 1832, Cannons again in North End in 1867 and finally on account of temperance, the alcohol-free phenomenon that was Kops Brewery founded in 1890 at a site in Sands End. In 1917 Kops Brewery closed and was converted into a margarine factory.

Gin distilling came to the remnants of the North End Brewery in Seagrave Road after a brief period of service as a timber works in the 1870s and lasted for almost a century. The premises were taken over by distillers Vickers who at the outbreak of the First World War sold out to Burnett&#x27;s, producers of White Satin Gin, until a 1970s take-over by a Kentucky liquor business. None of the breweries remains.

With its long history of brewing, Fulham still has a number of pubs and gastropubs. The oldest tavern is the &quot;Lillie Langtry&quot; in Lillie Road, originally the &quot;Lillie Arms&quot; named after its first freeholder, Sir John Scott Lillie, who built it in 1835 as part of the &#x27;North End Brewery&#x27; complex, run from 1832 to 1833 by a Miss Goslin. It was intended originally to service the Kensington Canal workers and bargees. Later, it was the watering hole of the new railway builders, motor and omnibus company staff and latterly Earl&#x27;s Court exhibition and Chelsea F.C. visitors. Of the three popular neighbouring pubs acquired by developers during 2014–15, the &quot;Imperial Arms&quot; and the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; were forced to shut; only the &quot;Atlas&quot;, reconstructed after bomb damage in the Second World War, has been reprieved.

&quot;The White Horse&quot; in Parsons Green is colloquially known by many as the &quot;Sloaney Pony&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Sloane Rangers&quot; who frequent it. Pubs which are Grade II listed buildings include the &quot;Duke on the Green&quot; and &quot;Aragon House&quot; both facing Parsons Green, &quot;the Cock&quot; in North End Road, and the &quot;Temperance&quot; in Fulham High Street. Other pubs include &quot;the Durrell&quot; in Fulham Road, the locally and Michelin Guide listed 1866 &quot;Harwood Arms&quot; in Walham Grove and &quot;the Mitre&quot; on Bishops Road.

===Open space===

Fulham has several parks, cemeteries and open spaces, of which Bishop&#x27;s Park, Fulham Palace Gardens, Hurlingham Park, South Park, Eel Brook Common and Parsons Green are the largest.

Among the other spaces are Normand Park, the vestige of a convent garden with a bowling green, Lillie Road Recreation Ground with its gym facility and Brompton Park in Seagrave Road. The Thames riverside walk in Bishop&#x27;s Park is interrupted by the Fulham football ground, but resumes after the neighbouring flats and continues to the Crabtree pub and beyond, past the Riverside Cafe on towards Hammersmith Bridge, affording views of the river and rural scenes on the opposite bank. It is part of the Thames Path.

==Heritage==

===Architectural===

Fulham parish&#x27;s rural past meant that its grand houses and not so grand vernacular and industrial buildings were either clustered in the village of Walham Green, along the Thames or scattered among the fields of the hamlet of North End. Many historic structures fell prey to industrialisation, war-time bombing or a rush to demolition and redevelopment. Gone are Burne-Jones&#x27;s &#x27;Grange&#x27; in W14 and Foote&#x27;s &#x27;Hermitage&#x27; villa and park as is Lovibond&#x27;s Cannon Brewery in SW6.

The ancient buildings and estate of Fulham Palace, the seat of the Bishops of London until 1973, remains the outstanding asset with its Grade I listed medieval and Tudor buildings including a small museum, 13 acres of grounds, walled garden, and the part-excavated longest moat in England. The gardens are Grade II* listed. The further original grounds are now divided between a park by the riverside, All Saints’ Primary School and The Moat School, and public allotments.

Church Gate to the south of Fulham Palace, is the approach to All Saints Church, with its 14-15th-c. tower and 18th-c. tombs in the churchyard including those of a number of the Bishops of London. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 led to a gradual reintroduction of Catholic worship in the parish, but not until 1847 was the foundation stone laid for a church. This was St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Fulham, with its presbytery, churchyard and school, off Crown Lane, designed in Gothic Revival style by Augustus Pugin. It is his only complete church and associated buildings in London and is Grade II* listed.

There are a number of other statutorily and locally listed structures strewn across Fulham. Worthy of note is the last remaining conical kiln of the Fulham Pottery. Broomhouse Lane has a number of structures of interest, ranging from the Broomhouse draw-dock of medieval origin to 18th-c. cottages (Sycamore and Ivy) and the Gothic revival Castle Club. The Vineyard in Hurlingham Road is of 17th-c. origin with later 19th-c. additions such as the stable buildings. The Hurlingham Club and grounds are of 18th-c. origin and Grade II* listed.
The winding North End Road had several buildings of note. What remains are &#x27;Crowthers&#x27; at no. 282, first built in 1712 with its extant 18th-c. gate-piers and the modernist (1938) Seven Stars public house, acquired by developers in 2014 and now converted into flats.

The New King&#x27;s Road contains several 18th-c. and early 19th-c. residences, namely, Northumberland House, Claybrook House, Jasmine House, Belgrave House, Aragon House, and 237–245 New King&#x27;s Road, all Grade II listed.

Much of the stock in Fulham attests its vigorous 19th-c. industrial and urban development, most of it, &#x27;low-rise&#x27;, and benefiting from the brick-fields that abounded locally at the time. An unlisted vestige of the early industrial era is the 1826 remnant of Gunter&#x27;s canal bridge, still visible from platform 4 at West Brompton station.

===Fulham in popular music and film===

Fulham has several references in song lyrics: 
* The album, &quot;Passion Play&quot;, by progressive rock band, Jethro Tull, contains: &quot;There was a rush along the Fulham Road/There was a hush in the Passion Play&quot;. 
*&quot;London&#x27;s Brilliant Parade&quot; by Elvis Costello, has the lyrics: &quot;From the gates of St. Mary&#x27;s/There were horses in Olympia/And a trolley bus in Fulham Broadway&quot;.
* &quot;What A Waste&quot; by Ian Dury and the Blockheads, contains the lines: &quot;I could be a writer with a growing reputation/I could be a ticket man at Fulham Broadway Station&quot;.
* &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; by Billy Idol&#x27;s 1970s punk rock band, Generation X, paints a gritty picture of casual street violence in 1970s Fulham. The song contains the refrain: &quot;Having fun, in South West Six,&quot; as well as the line, &quot;Hustling down the Fulham Road/Doing deals with Mr Cool&quot;. The song also makes reference to The Greyhound Pub, since closed, in Fulham Palace Road, and to the subway under Hammersmith Broadway.
* &quot;Ejector Seat Reservation&quot; by alternative rock band, Swervedriver, has the line: &quot;And just don&#x27;t tell me the Fulham score&quot;.
* &quot;Pretty Things&quot; by Take That has the line: &quot;At Fulham Broadway Station, I see them every day&quot; in 2010 album &quot;Progress&quot;.
* West London hip-hop artist, Example, released a comedy song, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Rap&quot;, with the chorus line: &quot;You can&#x27;t rap, my friend/You&#x27;re white and you&#x27;re from Fulham/Please put down the mic./ There&#x27;s no way you can fool them&quot;.

Fulham has been featured in films including &quot;The Omen&quot; and &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;. Fulham Broadway Underground station was used in &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;.

Esther Rantzen, presenter of long-running BBC One TV magazine, &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; frequently used North End market to gauge public opinion (&quot;vox pop&quot;).

===Education===
Fulham is home to several schools, including independent pre-preparatory and preparatory schools. Noted Fulham secondary establishments are the Grade II Listed Fulham Cross Girls School, The London Oratory School, Lady Margaret School and Fulham Cross Academy. There is also Kensington Preparatory School, that moved from Kensington into a former convent, next to Fulham Library in 1997.
 To cater for the large French-speaking population in the area, a French language primary school, &#x27;Marie d&#x27;Orliac&#x27;, has opened in the Grade II listed former Peterborough School near Parsons Green tube station. It is a feeder school for the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington.

==Transport==
An early account of Fulham, from a pedestrian&#x27;s viewpoint, is provided by Thomas Crofton Croker in his journal published in 1860.

===Rail===
Fulham nestles in a loop of the Thames across the river from Barnes and Putney. It straddles the Wimbledon and Richmond/Ealing Broadway branches of the District line of the tube — Fulham&#x27;s tube stations are Putney Bridge, Parsons Green, Fulham Broadway (originally named &quot;Walham Green&quot;), West Kensington (originally &quot;Fulham - North End&quot;) and Baron&#x27;s Court.

The London Overground West London Line stops at , just inside the Fulham borough boundary, and at in Fulham, Sands End. Until 1940 there was a Chelsea and Fulham railway station on this line, close to Stamford Bridge Stadium on Fulham Road, but this was closed following World War II bomb damage.

<doc id="143926" wikidata="Q36785" url="?curid=143926" title="Southern Ndebele language">
<text>isiNdebele (), also known as Southern Ndebele&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-2/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 639-3/RA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is an African language belonging to the Mbo group of Bantu languages, spoken by the Ndebele people of South Africa.

Northern Ndebele or Ndebele also known as isiNdebele is spoken in Limpopo in areas such as Polokwane (Bhulungwane), Ga-Rathoka (KaSondonga), Ga-Mashashane, Ga Maraba / Kalkspruit, Mokopane (Mghumbane), Zebediela (Sebetiela), which is closer to Southern Ndebele.

==Overview==

The Ndebele (Southern and Northern) people&#x27;s history has been traced back to King Ndebele, King Ndebele fathered King Mkhalangana, King Mkhalangana fathered King Mntungwa (not to be confused with the Khumalo Mntungwa, because he was fathered by Mbulazi), King Mntungwa fathered King Jonono, King Jonono fathered King Nanasi, King Nanasi fathered King Mafana, king Mafana fathered King Mhlanga and Chief Libhoko, King Mhlanga fathered King Musi and Chief Skhube.

Ndebele – Some of his sons were left behind with the Hlubi tribe
Mkhalangana – Some of his sons branched north and formed the Kalanga tribe
Mntungwa – Founder of the amaNtungwa clan
Njonono – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Jonono is in the Hlubi tribe
Nanasi – He died in Jononoskop near Ladysmith – Surname Nanasi is in the Hlubi tribe
Mafana – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)
Mhlanga – He died in Randfontein (Emhlangeni)
Musi – He died in kwaMnyamana (Pretoria)

King Musi&#x27;s kraal was based at eMhlangeni a place named after his father Mhlanga, the name of the place is currently known as Randfontein (Mohlakeng) and later moved to KwaMnyamana which is now called Emarula or Bon Accord in Pretoria. King Musi was a polygamist and fathered the following sons, Skhosana (Masombuka), Manala (Mbuduma), Ndzundza (Hlungwana), Thombeni (Kekana or Gegana), Sibasa, Mhwaduba (Lekhuleni) and Mphafuli and others.

Southern Transvaal Ndebele is one of the eleven official languages in the Republic of South Africa. The language is a Nguni or Zunda classification (UN) spoken mostly in the Mpumalanga Province, Gauteng, Limpopo and the Northwest.

The expression &quot;isikhethu&quot; can be loosely translated to mean &#x27;the Southern Ndebele way of doing or saying&#x27;. &quot;Isikhethu&quot; means Southern Ndebele in the same way that &quot;sikitsi&quot; will mean Swazi and &quot;se harona&quot; will mean Sotho.

The language has been severely marginalised over the years. Until the formation of the apartheid Southern Ndebele homeland (KwaNdebele), speaking the language publicly was discouraged. Most Southern Transvaal Ndebele speakers preferred Zulu especially because the latter was learned at school. Today the Southern Ndebele speakers, mostly those who are educated still prefer to use Southern Ndebele as home language for their children and will use Southern Ndebele as a language to communicate with other Southern Ndebele speakers.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
=== Consonants ===
Consonant sounds &quot;nt&quot;, &quot;nd&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;mf&quot;, and &quot;mv&quot; often result in allophones of .

===Click consonants===

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

The Southern Ndebele noun consists of two essential parts, the prefix and the stem. Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other Bantu languages.

The following table gives an overview of Southern Ndebele noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.

1 umu- replaces um- before monosyllabic stems, e. g. umuntu (person).

===Verbs===

Verbs use the following affixes for the subject and the object:

==Examples==
Months in Southern Ndebele
==AmaNdebele in Zimbabwe==
Zimbabwean Ndebele is part of the Nguni cluster and is therefore very similar to other Nguni languages (such as Zulu, Xhosa and Swati) with which it shares a high level of mutual intelligibility. The South African (or Southern Transvaal Ndebele), while maintaining its Nguni roots, has been influenced by the Sotho languages.

<doc id="143930" wikidata="Q282843" url="?curid=143930" title="Treaty ports">
<text>Treaty ports (; ) were the port cities in China and Japan that were opened to foreign trade mainly by the unequal treaties forced upon them by Western powers, as well as cities in Korea opened up similarly by the Qing dynasty of China (before the First Sino-Japanese War) and the Empire of Japan.

==Chinese treaty ports==


The British established their first treaty ports in China after the First Opium War by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As well as ceding the island of Hong Kong to Great Britain in perpetuity, the treaty also established five treaty ports at Shanghai, Guangzhou (Canton), Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Xiamen (Amoy). The following year the Chinese and British signed the Treaty of the Bogue, which added provisions for extraterritoriality and the most favored nation status for the latter country. Subsequent negotiations with the Americans (1844 Treaty of Wanghia) and the French (1844 Treaty of Whampoa) led to further concessions for these nations on the same terms as the British.

The second group of treaty ports was set up following the end of the Second Opium War (Arrow War) in 1860 and eventually, more than 80 treaty ports were established in China alone, involving many foreign powers.

===Characteristics===
Foreigners all lived in prestigious sections newly built for them on the edges of existing port cities. They enjoyed legal extraterritoriality, as stipulated in the unequal treaties. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers such as in the foreign concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.

Western images of the Chinese treaty ports focus on the distinctive geography of the &quot;bund&quot;, a long narrow strip of land in a prime location on the waterfront where the businesses, offices, warehouses, and residences of all foreigners were located. The Shanghai Bund was the largest and most famous. The North Riverbank in Ningbo (nowadays known as the Old Bund), was the first in China, opening in 1844, 20 years before the Shanghai bund. A typical bund contained British, German, French, American, Japanese, and other nationals.

The bund was a self-governing operation with its own shops, restaurants, recreational facilities, parks, churches, courts, police, and local government. The facilities were generally off-limits to the natives. The British, who by far dominated foreign trade with China, normally were the largest presence. Businessmen and officials typically brought their own families with them and stayed for years but sent their older children back to England for education.

Chinese sovereignty was only nominal. Officially, the foreign powers were not allowed to station military units in the bund, but in practice, there often was a warship or two in the harbor.

===Chinese capitulation treaties===
The treaty port system in China lasted approximately one hundred years. It began when the First Opium War ended in 1842. The major powers involved were the British, the French, and the Americans, although by the end of the 19th century all the major powers were involved.

The system effectively ended when Japan took control of most of the ports in the late 1930s, the Russians relinquished their treaty rights in the wake of the Russian Revolution in 1917, and the Germans were expelled in 1914. The three main treaty powers, the British, the Americans, and the French, continued to hold their concessions and extraterritorial jurisdictions until the Second World War. This ended when the Japanese stormed into their concessions in late 1941. They formally relinquished their treaty rights in a new &quot;equal treaties&quot; agreement with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s nationalist government-in-exile in Chongqing in 1943. The international communities that were residues of the treaty port era ended in the late 1940s when the communists took over and nearly all foreigners left.

===Impact on China===
Although the great majority of Chinese lived in traditional rural areas, a handful of booming treaty port cities became vibrant centers that had an enormous long-term impact on the Chinese economy and society. Above all Shanghai became the dominant urban center. Tianjin and Shenyang followed; Hong Kong, although a British colony, not a treaty port, was similar. Foreigners were welcomed and had stable safe bases, as did Christian missionaries. Outside the ports, the only foreigners were occasional Christian missionaries, and they often encountered serious difficulties. The other 89 cities that became treaty ports between 1842 and 1914 were of minor importance.

The Shanghai International Settlement rapidly developed into one of the world&#x27;s most modern cities, often compared to Paris, Berlin, and London. It set the standard of modernity for China and all of East Asia. In Shanghai, the British and American settlements combined in 1863 into an international settlement, with the French settlement operated separately nearby. The foreigners took out long-term leases on the land and set up factories, offices, warehouses, sanitation, police, gardens, restaurants, hotels, banks, and private clubs. The Shanghai Municipal Council was created in 1854, with nine members who were elected by three dozen foreign landowners at first, and by about 2,000 electors in the 1920s. Chinese residents comprised 90% of the total population of Shanghai but complained about taxation without representation. Eventually, the Council admitted five Chinese representatives.

The European community promoted technological and economic innovation, as well as knowledge industries, that proved especially attractive to Chinese entrepreneurs as models for their cities across the growing nation. Port cities combined several leadership roles. First of all, they were the major port of entry for all imports and exports - except for opium, which was handled by smugglers in other cities. Foreign entrepreneurs introduced the latest European manufacturing techniques, providing a model followed sooner or later by all of China. The first establishments focused on shipbuilding, ship repair, railway repair, and factories producing textiles, matches, porcelain, flour, and machinery. Tobacco, cigarettes, textiles, and food products were the specialty in Canton. Financing was handled by branch banks, as well as entirely new operations such as HSBC -the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which remains a world-class establishment into the 21st century. Across the modernizing world, railway construction was a major financial and industrial endeavor, usually led by the British. Investments now poured into building a railway-plus-telegraph system knitting China together, connecting the treaty ports, and other major cities, as well as mining districts and agricultural centers. Chinese entrepreneurs learned their skills in the port cities, and soon applied for and received bank loans for their startups. Chinese merchants headquartered there set up branches across Southeast Asia, including British Singapore and Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and the American Philippines.

The information industry flourished in the port cities, with printing shops, newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets in Chinese and European languages. Book publishers often featured Chinese translations of European classics in philosophy, politics, literature, and social issues. According to historian Klaus Mühlhahn:
:This vast network, with Shanghai as its center, spurred the transformation of the Chinese urban population. In their thoughts, tastes, and daily activities, the educated and affluent groups of the urban population began to abandon traditional ways of living and started to embrace what they saw as modern lifestyles.

Christian missionaries saw all of the Chinese population as their target audience, but they were headquartered in the port cities. The missionaries had very modest success in the conversion of the Chinese population but discovered they became widely popular for setting up medical and educational facilities. For example, St John&#x27;s University in Shanghai (1879–1952) first set up faculties of theology, Western learning, and Chinese languages, then expanded to cover literature, science, medicine, and intense coverage of Western languages eagerly sought by the ambitious Chinese intellectuals and entrepreneurs who had rejected the old Confucian exam system for the Western model of modernity. Engineering schools were established as well, and by 1914 a network of universities, colleges, teacher training schools, and specialized industrial schools was headquartered in the Port cities, and diffusing their alumni across urban China.

Students poured into the port cities. Many adopted ideas and used the facilities newly opened to them to network with each other, set up organizations and publications, and plot a revolution against the Qing government. Aggressive Japanese moves to dominate China in World War I caused a strong backlash of nationalism in the May Fourth Movement, which focused its ire not just on Japan, but also on the entire port city system as emblematic of imperialism that should no longer be tolerated. The national government had almost no police power in the port cities, allowing secret societies to flourish in the Chinese community, some of which turned into criminal gangs. Eventually, Shanghai had a strong underground illegal underworld that was ready to employ violence.

In modern China, most of the country&#x27;s special economic zones are located in former treaty ports and therefore have symbolic significance in demonstrating a &quot;reversal of fortunes&quot; in China&#x27;s dealings with foreigners since the century of humiliation. Researcher Zongyuan Zoe Liu writes that &quot;[t]he success of these cities as &#x27;red&#x27; treaty ports represented another step in China&#x27;s overall reform and opening-up plan while legitimizing the leadership of the CPC over the Chinese state and people.&quot;

===Major treaty ports===
For encyclopedic details on each treaty port, see Robert Nield&#x27;s &quot;China&#x27;s Foreign Places: The Foreign Presence in China in the Treaty Port Era, 1840-1943&quot; (2015).

===Leased territories===
In these territories the foreign powers obtained, under a lease treaty, not only the right to trade and exemptions for their subjects but a truly colonial control over each concession territory, de facto annexation:

==Japanese treaty ports==
Japan opened two ports to foreign trade, Shimoda and Hakodate, in 1854 (Convention of Kanagawa), to the United States. 
In 1858, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce designated four more ports, Kanagawa, Hyogo, Nagasaki, and Niigata. The treaty with the United States was followed by similar ones with Britain, the Netherlands, Russia, and France. The ports permitted legal extraterritoriality for citizens of the treaty nations. The system of treaty ports ended in Japan in the year 1899 as a consequence of Japan&#x27;s rapid transition to a modern nation. Japan had sought treaty revision earnestly, and in 1894, signed a new treaty with Britain which revised or abrogated the previous &quot;unequal&quot; treaty. Other countries signed similar treaties. The new treaties came into force in July 1899.

==Korean treaty ports==
Following the Ganghwa Treaty of 1876, the Korean kingdom of Joseon agreed to the opening of three strategic ports and the extension of legal extraterritoriality to merchants from Meiji Japan. Chinese merchants also entered Korea in earnest after the Qing army was sent to suppress the Imo Incident in 1882. The first port opened in this manner was Busan, while Incheon and Wonsan followed shortly thereafter. These cities became important centers of mercantile activity for traders from China and Japan until Korea&#x27;s colonization by Japan in 1910.

<text>Daniel Clarence Quinn (October 11, 1935 – February 17, 2018) was an American author (primarily, novelist and fabulist), cultural critic, and publisher of educational texts, best known for his novel &quot;Ishmael&quot;, which won the Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award in 1991 and was published the following year. Quinn&#x27;s ideas are popularly associated with environmentalism, though he criticized this term for portraying the environment as separate from human life, thus creating a false dichotomy. Instead, Quinn referred to his philosophy as &quot;new tribalism&quot;.

==Biography==
Daniel Quinn was born in Omaha, Nebraska, where he graduated from Creighton Preparatory School. He went on to study at Saint Louis University, at the University of Vienna, Austria, through IES Abroad, and at Loyola University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1957. He delayed part of this university education, however, while a postulant at the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Bardstown, Kentucky, where he hoped to become a Trappist monk; however his spiritual director, Thomas Merton, prematurely ended Quinn&#x27;s postulancy. Quinn went into publishing, abandoned his Catholic faith, and married twice unsuccessfully, before marrying Rennie MacKay Quinn, his third and final wife of 42 years.

In 1975, Quinn left his career as a publisher to become a freelance writer. He is best known for his book &quot;Ishmael&quot; (1992), which won the Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award in 1991. Several judges disputed giving the entire $500,000 award to Quinn for &quot;Ishmael&quot;, rather than dividing the money among several authors, though judge Ray Bradbury, for one, supported the decision. &quot;Ishmael&quot; became the first of a loose trilogy of novels by Quinn, including &quot;The Story of B&quot; and &quot;My Ishmael&quot;, all of which brought increasing fame to Quinn throughout the 1990s. He became a well-known author to followers of the environmental, simple living, and anarchist movements, although he did not strongly self-identify with any of these.

Quinn traveled widely to lecture and discuss his books. While response to &quot;Ishmael&quot; was mostly very positive, Quinn&#x27;s ideas have inspired the most controversy with a claim mentioned in &quot;Ishmael&quot; but made much more forcefully in &quot;The Story of B&quot;″s Appendix that the total human population grows and shrinks according to food availability and with the catastrophic real-world conclusions he draws from this.

In 1998, Quinn collaborated with environmental biologist Alan D. Thornhill in producing &quot;Food Production and Population Growth,&quot; a video elaborating in-depth the science behind the ideas he describes in his fiction.

Quinn&#x27;s book &quot;Tales of Adam&quot; was released in 2005 after a long bankruptcy scuffle with its initial publisher. It is designed to be a look through the animist&#x27;s eyes in seven short tales; Quinn first explores the idea of animism as the original worldwide religion and as his own dogma-free belief system in &quot;The Story of B&quot; and his autobiography, &quot;&quot;.

In February 2018, Quinn died of aspiration pneumonia in hospice care.

==Philosophy and themes==
Daniel Quinn was largely a fiction writer who explored the culturally-biased world-view (&quot;mythology&quot;, in his terms) driving modern civilization and the destruction of the natural world. He sought to recognize and criticize some of civilization&#x27;s most unchallenged &quot;myths&quot; or memes, which he considered to include the following: that the Earth was made especially for humans, so humans are destined to conquer and rule it; that humans are innately and inevitably flawed; that humans are separate from and superior to nature (which Quinn called &quot;the most dangerous idea in existence&quot;); and that all humans must be made to live according to some &quot;one right way&quot;.

Other common themes included ecology, environmental ethics, culture, and an in-depth look at human population dynamics. Although Quinn himself regarded the following associations as coincidental, his philosophy is sometimes compared with deep ecology, dark-green environmentalism, or anarcho-primitivism.

Quinn notably claimed that the total population of humans, like all living things, grows and shrinks according to a basic ecological law: an increase in food availability for any population yields an accompanying increase in the population&#x27;s overall size. Quinn worried that popular cultural thinking ignores this reality, instead regarding civilized humans as separate from and above any such law. He identified the Neolithic Revolution as the start of human overpopulation, when civilized peoples began to practice an imperialistic world-view that denigrates nature and that relies entirely upon expansionist farming (&quot;totalitarian agriculture&quot;), the human population growing in proportion to the decline of the rest of the world&#x27;s biomass. 

Quinn&#x27;s warnings about population, especially in relation to food availability, have often been compared to the warnings of 19th-century economist Thomas Robert Malthus. However, while Malthus warned that excess human population precariously motivates an excess of food production in order to sustain that population, Quinn considered the priorities of this assessment backwards. He instead warned that excess population is the inevitable &quot;result&quot; of access to excess food for the human organism &quot;en masse&quot; just as surely as it is for any other species, a concept which he described as one of the &quot;ABCs&quot; of well-established ecology, professing that no ecologist argues with the law (inevitable growth in the face of food availability) &quot;except&quot; in the case of the human, which he stated was universally regarded an exceptionalism despite &quot;10,000 years of evidence&quot; to the contrary in the form of the history of human population growth coincident with the rise of agriculture and the mass production of foodstuffs in excess to the needs for survival.

According to Quinn, the success of this totalitarian style of agriculture is unsustainable because we &quot;kill all of our competitors for food&quot; and even kill our &quot;competitors once-removed&quot; by attacking all of our &quot;favorite food species&quot;&#x27; competitors or predators, which he described as &quot;practically holy work for our farmers: kill everything that you can&#x27;t eat. Kill everything that eats what you eat.&quot;, and so on, which he claimed is causing the catastrophic loss of biodiversity planetwide, and, just as directly, an overshoot towards an eventual population crash, of which the civilized mainstream shows very little anticipation or interest.

Quinn&#x27;s conclusions on population also imply the controversial notion that sustained food aid to starving nations is merely delaying and dramatically worsening massive starvation crises, rather than resolving such crises, as is commonly assumed. Quinn claimed that reconnecting people to the food made available through their local habitats is a proven way to avoid famines and accompanying starvation. Some have interpreted this to mean that Quinn was resolving to let starving people in impoverished nations continue starving.

Quinn described civilization as primarily a single global economy and culture, whose total dependence on agriculture requires ever-more expansion, in turn generating ever-more population growth (an escalating vicious cycle he identifies as the &quot;food race&quot;). As a result, he viewed modern civilization, by definition, as unsustainable. He commonly analyzed and defended the effectiveness of traditional indigenous tribal societies—regarded by anthropological research as fairly egalitarian, ecologically well-adapted, and socially secure —as role models for developing a new diversity of workable human social structures in the future.

Quinn self-admittedly avoided presenting simplistic or universal solutions, though he strongly encouraged a worldwide paradigm shift away from the self-destructive memes of civilization and towards the values and organizational structures of a &quot;new tribalism&quot;. He clarified that this did not refer to the old style of ethnic tribalism so much as new groupings of individuals as equals trying to make a living communally, while still subject to evolution by natural selection. He eventually named this hypothetical, gradual shift the &quot;New Tribal Revolution&quot;. Quinn cautioned that his admiration for the sustainable lifestyles of indigenous tribes is not intended to encourage a massive &quot;return&quot; to hunting and gathering. Rather, he intended merely to acknowledge the enormous history of relative ecological harmony between humans and the rest of the environment (from which humans are never separate) and embrace the basic unit of a tribe as an effective model for human societies (just as the pack works for wolves, the hive for bees, etc.).

Quinn was influential in developing a vocabulary for his philosophy; he coined or popularized a variety of terms, including the following:
* Takers and Leavers — &quot;Takers&quot; refers to members of the dominant globalized civilization and its culture, while &quot;Leavers&quot; refers to members of the countless other non-civilized cultures existing both in the past and currently. Quinn later regretted these terms, supposing that &quot;hierarchical&quot; and &quot;tribal,&quot; respectively, may be better alternatives.
* Mother Culture – a personification of any culture&#x27;s inherently biased influences that are not perceived as biased by its members
* Food Race – the phenomenon of ongoing human overpopulation and its accompanying global catastrophes, in which the giving of more food to starving, growing populations paradoxically yields only still greater population growth and starvation
* Law of limited competition – a biological law that &quot;defines the limits of competition in the community of life,&quot; according to which &quot;you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors or destroy their food or deny them... access to food in general,&quot; meaning across-the-board; species that violate this law end up extinct
* Law of Life – the universal collection of all evolutionarily stable strategies
* Totalitarian Agriculture – today&#x27;s dominant form of agriculture that &quot;subordinates all other life-forms to the relentless, single-minded production of human food,&quot; unsustainable because it generates enormous food supplies that in turn generate ever-greater human population booms
* The Great Forgetting – widespread historical ignorance regarding &quot;the fact that we [humans] are a biological species in a community of biological species and are not exempt or exemptible from the forces that shape all life on this planet; this also includes our forgetting of the fact that most of human history has been based on an ecologically sound way of life (largely hunting and gathering)&quot;
* Boiling frog – &quot;a metaphor for so many circumstances in life when people are unwilling or unable to react effectively to crises that occur very gradually or imperceptibly,&quot; used especially by Quinn to refer to creeping normality in terms of escalating environmental degradation
* New Tribal Revolution – a hypothetical, sociocultural period of global change that Quinn supports, in which civilization would gradually begin to transform into a collection of more sustainable, tribally-organized societies

===Food race===
Quinn coined the term food race (by analogy to the Cold War&#x27;s &quot;nuclear arms race&quot;) to describe his concept of a perpetually escalating crisis of growing human population due to growing food production, of which the former is fueled by the latter. Quinn argues that as the worldwide human population increases, the typical international response is to produce and distribute more food to feed these greater numbers of people. However, assuming that population increases according to increased food availability, Quinn argues that this response only ends up leading to an even larger population and thus greater starvation in the end. Quinn&#x27;s solution to the food race—to stop producing so much food—is not generally a common-sense or intuitive response; instead he claims he is counter-intuitive or &quot;outside-the-box&quot; thinking.

Russell Hopfenberg has written at least two papers attempting to prove Quinn&#x27;s ideas, one paper with David Pimentel titled &quot;Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply&quot; and &quot;Human Carrying Capacity is Determined by Food Availability&quot;. Hopfenberg has also made a narrated slide show titled &quot;World Food and Human Population Growth&quot;. 

====Basis====
Quinn bases the food race on the premise that the total human population, like that of other animals, is influenced by food supply. Thus, larger populations are the result of more abundant food supplies, and intensification of food cultivation in response to population growth merely leads to still more population growth. Quinn compared this to the arms race in the Cold War. Like Garrett Hardin, Quinn believes any development to address food security will only lead to catastrophe.

=====Comparison to Malthusian catastrophe=====
The similarities between this concept and a Malthusian catastrophe are obvious, but Quinn states there are certain key differences. The primary problem in a Malthusian catastrophe is a population growing faster than the growth in food supply. Quinn states that population is a function of food supply, and not merely some independent variable. Quinn considers that problem is not a scarcity of food, but, rather, overpopulation. Quinn characterizes the Malthusian problem as &quot;how are we going to &quot;FEED&quot; all these people?&quot;, and characterizes the &quot;Quinnian problem&quot; as &quot;how are we going to stop &quot;PRODUCING&quot; all these people?&quot;

=====Criticism=====
The idea that human population is tied to food supply is contentious, however. Many biologists disagree with Quinn&#x27;s assessment. While food supply certainly imposes an upper limit on population growth, they point out that culture, living standards, human intelligence, and free will can impose lower, secondary limits to population growth. Critics also point out that the most significant population growth is occurring in the developing world, where regional food production is lowest. Meanwhile, the First World, where food is most plentiful, is undergoing a decline in birth rates. Quinn has suggested this results from international food distribution, claiming that the farms of the First World fuel population growth elsewhere. United Nations projections that the world population will level off sometime in the near future also contradict Quinn&#x27;s statements. In 1998 Daniel Quinn and Alan D. Thornhill then of the Society for Conservation Biology made a video exploring these topics titled &quot;Food Production And Population Growth&quot;.

==Influence==
&quot;Ishmael&quot; directly inspired the 1998 Pearl Jam album &quot;Yield&quot; (and particularly the song &quot;Do the Evolution&quot;), and the Chicano Batman song &quot;The Taker Story&quot; on their 2017 album &quot;Freedom is Free&quot;. In 2019 The Mammals, a folk band including Mike Merenda &amp; Ruth Ungar, released &quot;Nonet&quot; with many of the songs on it inspired by &quot;Ishmael&quot; and other Quinn books, most especially &quot;Beyond Civilization&quot;. North Carolina&#x27;s vegan hardcore band Undying has been heavily influenced by the work of Daniel Quinn.

Quinn&#x27;s writings have also influenced the filmmaker Tom Shadyac (who featured Quinn in the documentary &quot;I Am&quot;); the entrepreneur Ray C. Anderson, founder of Interface, Inc. (the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of modular carpet), who began transforming Interface with more green initiatives; as well as some of the ideology behind the 1999 drama film &quot;Instinct&quot;, and the 2007 documentary film &quot;What A Way To Go: Life at the End of Empire&quot;. Playwright Derek Ahonen has cited Quinn as the foremost influence on his play, &quot;The Pied Pipers of The Lower East Side&quot;, which attempts to dramatize the philosophies of New Tribalism.

Actor Morgan Freeman&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Ishmael&quot; trilogy inspired his involvement with nature documentaries, such as &quot;Island of Lemurs: Madagascar&quot; and &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, both of which he narrated, while adopting from Quinn the phrase &quot;the tyranny of agriculture&quot;. Punk rock band Rise Against includes &quot;Ishmael&quot; on their album &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;&#x27; reading list, and its sequel, &quot;My Ishmael&quot;, inspired the name of the band Animals as Leaders.

<text>Dr. Katherine Pulaski is a fictional medical doctor in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. She served a rotation as the chief medical officer aboard the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. During her time on the ship, her medical skills saved the lives of both Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Commander William Riker. She inadvertently caused Geordi LaForge to create a hologram of Professor Moriarty that became self-aware, after a bet involving the abilities of Lt. Commander Data. Pulaski seemed averse to most new technology and preferred to avoid the transporter, but was forced to rely on it to save her own life from a genetically modified infection. Before arriving on the &quot;Enterprise-D&quot;, she previously served on the USS &quot;Repulse&quot;. For a time in her past, she was romantically involved with William Riker&#x27;s father, Kyle Riker, with whom she has maintained a friendship.

Portrayed by actress Diana Muldaur, Pulaski replaced the character of Commander Beverly Crusher for the second season after Gates McFadden&#x27;s contract was not renewed. Thus, Pulaski first appeared in the second season opener &quot;The Child&quot;, and made her final appearance in the closing episode of the season, &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;. Before playing the role of Pulaski on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Muldaur appeared in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, playing different characters in the episodes &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; She later worked with series creator Gene Roddenberry on a pilot for the series &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. McFadden returned to replace Muldaur in the third season, reprising her role as Dr. Crusher for the remainder of the series.

Reviewers criticized Pulaski&#x27;s approach, as well as her inability to fit in with the crew. Critics noted that her transporter phobia was reminiscent of Dr. Leonard McCoy from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as was her relationship with Data; Pulaski&#x27;s interaction with Data raised comparisons to that of McCoy and Spock from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Episodes featuring Pulaski in a leading role produced divided opinions among critics, with some describing &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot; as a key episode while others argued that it showed only the negative side of her role.

==Concept and development==
Towards the end of the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, staff members convinced Gene Roddenberry to drop Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher from the show. Executive producer Rick Berman opposed this decision. To allow for McFadden&#x27;s return in the future, Roddenberry wrote Crusher&#x27;s character out rather than killing her. McFadden&#x27;s departure led to an opening for a new cast member. The producers contacted actress Diana Muldaur, unaware of her past involvement with Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; pilot. In the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Muldaur played the role of a doctor in two episodes: as Dr. Ann Mulhall in &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot;, and as Dr. Miranda Jones in &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; Muldaur also worked on the pilot for &quot;Planet Earth&quot; after getting to know Roddenberry and his wife, Majel Barrett, through their annual &quot;Star Trek&quot; Christmas parties.

Muldaur was not required to audition for the role of Pulaski. Instead, she was given 15 VHS cassettes of the first season. She found it &quot;very exciting&quot;, noting it &quot;got better and better and better&quot; as she watched it. Christina Pickles was also considered for the part of Pulaski, a decision Berman described as &quot;very tough&quot;. Muldaur finally agreed to play the role, but asked Roddenberry to change the name of the character to Kate, which became Katherine. The character of Katherine Pulaski was not modeled on Doctor Leonard McCoy from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, despite claims to the contrary.

Pulaski debuted in the second season episode &quot;The Child&quot;, along with Whoopi Goldberg making her first appearance as Guinan in the same episode. Even though Muldaur was a regular character on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, she was listed in the opening credits as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot;. After the second season, Muldaur left the series and joined the cast of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. She used footage of the episode &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot; to gain the part. Gates McFadden returned to continue her role as Dr. Crusher for the remainder of the series.

==Appearances==
Pulaski&#x27;s background is touched upon in the episode &quot;The Icarus Factor&quot;. She is thrice divorced and was previously romantically involved with Commander William Riker&#x27;s father Kyle Riker (Mitchell Ryan), after she was part of a rescue team responding to a Tholian attack on a Federation Starbase. She realised that a romantic relationship with Riker would not work, but they remained friends. Directly prior to serving on the &quot;Enterprise-D&quot; Pulaski served on the USS &quot;Repulse&quot;.

In, &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; she challenges Lt. Cmdr Data to solve an original Sherlock Holmes mystery on the holodeck. He accepts her challenge, which results in the creation of a self-aware hologram of Professor Moriarty (Daniel Davis). Pulaski joins Data and Lieutenant Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), but is captured by Moriarty who also takes over control of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Moriarty demands that they find a way to enable him to leave the holodeck, but is persuaded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to release control and be stored within the ship&#x27;s computer memory until a means can be found to grant his wish.

Pulaski&#x27;s apprehension at using the transporter was evident in &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot;, where Dr. Selar (Suzie Plakson) went with the away team instead of Pulaski, as it required her to beam over to a transport vessel. However, the transporter would later save Pulaski&#x27;s life in &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;, after she was infected with a disease from the planet Gagarin IV that accelerated her aging process. The transporter is used to remove the infection and she is returned to health.

She demonstrates her medical expertise on several occasions. In &quot;Time Squared&quot;, Pulaski discovers that the duplicate Captain Picard is out of sync in time and will slowly improve until he returns to the point at which he left. In the episode &quot;Pen Pals&quot;, Picard orders Pulaski to wipe the memories of a young girl called Sarjenka, whom Data had been corresponding with and helping in violation of the prime directive. In &quot;Samaritan Snare&quot;, she is summoned to Starbase 515 to perform heart surgery on Captain Picard, as she is the most experienced surgeon nearby. This is despite Picard&#x27;s wish for her not to perform the surgery, due to his concern with the image it might give to the crew.

When the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the lost colony of Mariposa in &quot;Up the Long Ladder&quot;, the Mariposans kidnap Pulaski and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and steal their DNA to clone new members of their colony. Although technologically advanced, the Mariposans lack genetic diversity. When Pulaski and Riker discover the clones, they destroy them. Picard helps resolve the dispute by suggesting the Mariposans allow the Bringloidi, a preindustrial, rural people whose colony was destroyed, to migrate to their world. The Mariposans, however, have relied on cloning for 300 years, and no longer sexually reproduce. Pulaski notes that with time, they will become familiar with the practice once again, and recommends that the Mariposans form large, group marriages with the Bringloidi to create a healthy population.

Following Data&#x27;s defeat at a game of stratagema in &quot;Peak Performance&quot;, Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) attempt to console him, but it is left to Captain Picard to convince Data that he is not malfunctioning. Pulaski&#x27;s final appearance on &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was in the episode &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;. When Commander Riker falls ill to a dangerous virus during an away team mission, Pulaski drives out the virus with a device that stimulates his memory centre. After she discovers that negative memories are more effective in removing the virus, she uses memories of fear and survival to save Riker&#x27;s life.

In the alternative future timeline portrayed in &quot;Endgame&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; finale, Pulaski is said to have worked at the Starfleet Medical facility in San Francisco.

===Novels===
Pulaski appears in several books of the non-canon novel series based on the adventures of the crew in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and elsewhere in the same time period. In Peter David&#x27;s novel &quot;Vendetta&quot; (1991), Pulaski is reassigned to the &quot;Repulse&quot; under Captain Taggart following her departure from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek: Progress&quot; (2006), a Starfleet Corps of Engineers book by Terri Osborne, Pulaski is on board the USS &quot;Progress&quot; when it visits Drema IV, as she wants to check up on the progress of Sarjenka, a young girl from &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Pen Pals&quot;. Pulaski also appeared alongside Wesley Crusher and Guinan in Michael Jan Friedman&#x27;s &quot;All Good Things...&quot; (1994), a novelisation of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; series finale.

==Reception and commentary==
In their 1998 book, &quot;Star Trek 101&quot;, Terry J. Erdmann and Paula M. Block called &quot;Unnatural Selection&quot; the key Pulaski episode. Science fiction writer Keith DeCandido described Pulaski as &quot;charming&quot; and noted that this feeling was mirrored on screen by Captain Picard. In &quot;Science Fiction Television: A History&quot;, author M. Keith Booker observed that &quot;Pulaski never quite meshed with the rest of the crew&quot;.

The events of &quot;Elementary Dear Data&quot; led film professor Zoran Samardžija to suggest that Pulaski may have been inspired by the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. In &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind&quot; (2011), Samardžija notes that Pulaski&#x27;s argument that Data lacks intuition is reminiscent of parts of Nietzsche&#x27;s 1878 work &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;. The relationship between Pulaski and Data was further considered by Rhonda V. Wilcox in her article &quot;Dating Data: Miscegenation in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;&quot; (1993). Wilcox notes that Pulaski &quot;frequently challenges Data in terms of his machine nature.&quot; She compares Data&#x27;s emotionless state to slavery due to the reference in &quot;The Child&quot; to Maya Angelou&#x27;s 1969 work &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;.

In 2016, Pulaski was ranked as the 39th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine, out of 100 characters. In 2019, she was listed as one of the underrated characters of the Star Trek universe by CBS.

<text>A rack railway (also rack-and-pinion railway, cog railway, or cogwheel railway) is a steep grade railway with a toothed rack rail, usually between the running rails. The trains are fitted with one or more cog wheels or pinions that mesh with this rack rail. This allows the trains to operate on steep gradients of 100% (45 degrees) or more, well above the 10% maximum for friction-based rail. The rack and pinion mechanism also provides more controlled braking and reduces the effects of snow or ice on the rails. Most rack railways are mountain railways, although a few are transit railways or tramways built to overcome a steep gradient in an urban environment.
The first cog railway was the Middleton Railway between Middleton and Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom, where the first commercially successful steam locomotive, &quot;Salamanca&quot;, ran in 1812. This used a rack and pinion system designed and patented in 1811 by John Blenkinsop.

The first mountain cog railway was the Mount Washington Cog Railway in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, which carried its first fare-paying passengers in 1868. The track was completed to reach the summit of Mount Washington in 1869. The first mountain rack railway in continental Europe was the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Mount Rigi in Switzerland, which opened in 1871. Both lines are still running.

== Rack-and-adhesion or pure-rack ==
As well as the rack system used, lines using rack systems fall into one of two categories depending on whether the rack rail is continuous or not. Lines where the rack rail is continuous, and the cog-drive is used throughout, are described as pure-rack lines. Other lines, which use the cog drive only on the steepest sections and elsewhere operate as a regular railway, are described as rack-and-adhesion lines.

On rack-and-adhesion lines, trains are equipped with propulsion and braking systems capable of acting both through the running rail wheels and the cog wheels, depending on whether the rack rail is present or not. Rack-and-adhesion lines also need to use a system for smoothing the transition from friction to rack traction, with a spring-mounted rack section to bring the pinion teeth gradually into engagement. This was invented by Roman Abt, who also invented the Abt rack system.

On pure-rack lines, the train&#x27;s running rail wheels are only used to carry the train and do not contribute to propulsion or braking, which is exclusively done through the cog wheels. Pure-rack lines have no need of transitioning systems, as the cog wheels remain engaged with the rack rail at all times, but all track, including sidings and depots, must be equipped with rack rail irrespective of gradient.

== History ==
A number of different designs of rack rail and matching cog wheel have been developed over the years. With the exception of some early Morgan and Blenkinsop rack installations, rack systems place the rack rail halfway between the running rails, mounted on the same sleepers or ties as the running rails.

=== Blenkinsop (1812) ===
John Blenkinsop thought that the friction would be too low from metal wheels on metal rails even on level ground, so he built his steam locomotives for the Middleton Railway in 1812 with a 20-tooth, diameter cog wheel (pinion) on the left side that engaged in rack teeth (two teeth per foot) on the outer side of the rail, the metal &quot;fishbelly&quot; edge rail with its side rack being cast all in one piece, in lengths. Blenkinsop&#x27;s system remained in use for 25 years on the Middleton Railway, but it became a curiosity because simple friction was found to be sufficient for railroads operating on level ground.

=== Fell (1860s)===
The Fell mountain railway system, developed in the 1860s, is not strictly speaking a rack railway, since there are no cogs with teeth. Rather, this system uses a smooth raised centre rail between the two running rails on steep sections of lines that is gripped on both sides to improve friction. Trains are propelled by wheels or braked by shoes pressed horizontally onto the centre rail, as well as by means of the normal running wheels.
=== Marsh (1861) ===

The first successful rack railway in the United States was the Mount Washington Cog Railway, developed by Sylvester Marsh. Marsh was issued a U.S. patent for the general idea of a rack railway in September 1861, and in January 1867 for a practical rack where the rack teeth take the form of rollers arranged like the rungs of a ladder between two L-shaped wrought-iron rails. The first public trial of the Marsh rack on Mount Washington was made on August 29, 1866, when only one quarter of a mile (402 meters) of track had been completed. The Mount Washington railway opened to the public on August 14, 1868. The pinion wheels on the locomotives have deep teeth that ensure that at least two teeth are engaged with the rack at all times; this measure helps reduce the possibility of the pinions riding up and out of the rack.

=== Riggenbach (1871) ===

The Riggenbach rack system was invented by Niklaus Riggenbach working at about the same time as, but independently from Marsh. Riggenbach was granted a French patent in 1863 based on a working model which he used to interest potential Swiss backers. During this time, the Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh&#x27;s Mount Washington Cog Railway and reported back with enthusiasm to the Swiss government. Eager to boost tourism in Switzerland, the government commissioned Riggenbach to build a rack railway up Mount Rigi. Following the construction of a prototype locomotive and test track in a quarry near Bern, the Vitznau–Rigi railway opened on 22 May 1871.

The Riggenbach system is similar in design to the Marsh system. It uses a ladder rack, formed of steel plates or channels connected by round or square rods at regular intervals. The Riggenbach system suffers from the problem that its fixed ladder rack is more complex and expensive to build than the other systems.

Following the success of the Vitznau–Rigi railway, Riggenbach established the &quot;Maschinenfabrik der Internationalen Gesellschaft für Bergbahnen&quot; (IGB) – a company that produced rack locomotives to his design.
=== Abt (1882) ===
The Abt system was devised by Carl Roman Abt, a Swiss locomotive engineer. Abt worked for Riggenbach at his works in Olten and later at his IGB rack locomotive company. In 1885, he founded his own civil engineering company.

During the early 1880s, Abt worked to devise an improved rack system that overcame the limitations of the Riggenbach system. In particular, the Riggenbach rack was expensive to manufacture and maintain and the switches were complex. In 1882, Abt designed a new rack using solid bars with vertical teeth machined into them. Two or three of these bars are mounted centrally between the rails, with the teeth of the pinions rotationally offset from each other to match. The use of multiple bars with offset teeth ensures that the pinions on the locomotive driving wheels are constantly engaged with the rack. The Abt system is cheaper to build than the Riggenbach because it requires a lower weight of rack over a given length. However the Riggenbach system exhibits greater wear resistance than the Abt.

The first use of the Abt system was on the Harzbahn in Germany, which opened in 1885. The Abt system was also used for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway in Wales from 1894 to 1896. In 1893 it was used by the Japanese Government Railways on the section between Yokokawa and Karuizawa in the Usui Pass. It is used today on the Ikawa Line of the Ōigawa Railway.

The pinion wheels can be mounted on the same axle as the rail wheels, or driven separately. The steam locomotives on the West Coast Wilderness Railway have separate cylinders driving the pinion wheel, as do the &quot;X&quot;-class locomotives on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway.

=== Agudio (1884) ===
The Agudio rack system was invented by Tommaso Agudio. Its only long-lived application was on the Sassi–Superga tramway which opened in 1884. It used a vertical rack with cog wheels on each side of the central rack. Its unique feature, however, was that the &#x27;locomotive&#x27; was propelled by means of an endless cable driven from an engine house at the foot of the incline. It was converted to use the Strub rack system in 1934.

=== Locher (1889) ===

The Locher rack system, invented by Eduard Locher, has gear teeth cut in the sides rather than the top of the rail, engaged by two cog wheels on the locomotive. This system allows use on steeper grades than the other systems, whose teeth could jump out of the rack. It is used on the Pilatus Railway.

Locher set out to design a rack system that could be used on gradients as steep as 1 in 2 (50%). The Abt system – the most common rack system in Switzerland at the time – was limited to a maximum gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). Locher showed that on steeper grade, the Abt system was prone to the driving pinion over-riding the rack, causing potentially catastrophic derailments, as predicted by Dr. Abt. To overcome this problem and allow a rack line up the steep sides of Mt. Pilatus, Locher developed a rack system where the rack is a flat bar with symmetrical, horizontal teeth. Horizontal pinions with flanges below the rack engage the centrally-mounted bar, both driving the locomotive and keeping it centered on the track.

This system provides very stable attachment to the track, also protecting the car from toppling over even under the most severe crosswinds. Such gears are also capable of leading the car, so even flanges on running wheels are optional. The biggest shortcoming of the system is that the standard railway switch is not usable, and a transfer table or other complex device must be used where branching of the track is needed.

Following tests, the Locher system was deployed on the Pilatus Railway, which opened in 1889. No other public railway uses the Locher system, although some European coal mines use a similar system on steeply graded underground lines.

=== Strub (1896) ===
The Strub rack system was invented by Emil Strub in 1896. It uses a rolled flat-bottom rail with rack teeth machined into the head approximately apart. Safety jaws fitted to the locomotive engage with the underside of the head to prevent derailments and serve as a brake. Strub&#x27;s U.S. patent, granted in 1898, also includes details of how the rack rail is integrated with the mechanism of a turnout.

The best-known use of the Strub system is on the Jungfraubahn in Switzerland. 

Strub is the simplest rack system to maintain and has become increasingly popular.
=== Morgan (1900)===
In 1900, E. C. Morgan of Chicago received a patent on a rack railway system that was mechanically similar to the Riggenbach rack, but where the rack was also used as a third rail to power the electric locomotive. Morgan went on to develop heavier locomotives and with J. H. Morgan, turnouts for this system. In 1904, he patented a simplified but compatible rack, where the teeth on the engine pinions engaged square holes punched in a bar-shaped center rail. J. H. Morgan patented several alternative turnout designs for use with this rack system. Curiously, Morgan recommended an off-center rack in order to allow clear passage for pedestrians and animals walking along the tracks. Some photos of early Morgan installations show this. A simplified rack mounting system could be used when the Morgan rack was not used for third-rail power and the Morgan rack offered interesting possibilities for street railways. The Morgan rack was good for grades of up to 16 percent.

The Goodman Equipment Company began marketing the Morgan system for mine railways, and it saw widespread use, particularly where steep grades were encountered underground. By 1907, Goodman had offices in Cardiff, Wales, to serve the British market. Between 1903 and 1909, the McKell Coal and Coke company in Raleigh County, West Virginia, installed of Morgan rack/third-rail track in its mines. Between 1905 and 1906, the Mammoth Vein Coal Company installed of powered rack in two of its mines in Everist, Iowa, with a maximum grade of 16%. The Donohoe Coke Co. of Greenwald, Pennsylvania had of Goodman rack in its mine in 1906. The Morgan system saw limited use on one common carrier railroad in the United States, the Chicago Tunnel Company, a narrow-gauge freight carrier that had one steep grade in the line up to their surface disposal station on the Chicago lakefront.

=== Lamella ===
The Lamella system (also known as the Von Roll system) was developed by the Von Roll company after the rolled steel rails used in the Strub system became unavailable. It is formed from a single blade cut in a similar shape to the Abt system, but typically wider than a single Abt bar. The Lamella rack can be used by locomotives designed for use on the Riggenbach or the Strub systems, so long as the safety-jaws that were a feature of the original Strub system are not used. Some railways use racks from multiple systems; for example, the St. Gallen Gais Appenzell Railway in Switzerland has sections of Riggenbach, Strub, and Lamella rack.

Most of the rack railways built from the late 20th century onwards have used the Lamella system.

== Switches ==
Rack railway switches are as varied as rack railway technologies, for optional rack lines such as the Zentralbahn in Switzerland and the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania it is convenient to only use switches on sections flat enough for adhesion (for example, on a pass summit). Other systems which rely on the rack for driving (with the conventional rail wheels undriven) such as the Dolderbahn in Zürich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway instead must switch the rack rail. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle.

The geometry of the rack system has a large impact on the construction of turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, there is no need to interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.

Turnouts are far more complex when the rack is at or below the level of the running rails. Marsh&#x27;s first rack patent shows such an arrangement, and the original Mount Washington Cog Railway he built had no turnouts. It was not until 1941 that a turnout was constructed on this line. There were more turnouts built for the line but all were hand operated. In 2003, a new automatic hydraulic turnout was developed and built at the base as a prototype. With the success of the new turnout, more new automatic hydraulic turnouts were built to replace the hand-operated ones. The new turnouts installed on the Mount Washington line in 2007 are essentially transfer tables. The Locher rack also requires transfer tables.

== Rolling stock ==
Originally almost all cog railways were powered by steam locomotives. The steam locomotive needs to be extensively modified to work effectively in this environment. Unlike a diesel locomotive or electric locomotive, the steam locomotive only works when its powerplant (the boiler, in this case) is fairly level. The locomotive boiler requires water to cover the boiler tubes and firebox sheets at all times, particularly the crown sheet, the metal top of the firebox. If this is not covered with water, the heat of the fire will soften it enough to give way under the boiler pressure, leading to a catastrophic failure.

On rack systems with extreme gradients, the boiler, cab, and general superstructure of the locomotive are tilted forward relative to the wheels so that they are more or less horizontal when on the steeply graded track. These locomotives often cannot function on level track, and so the entire line, including maintenance shops, must be laid on a gradient. This is one of the reasons why rack railways were among the first to be electrified and most of today&#x27;s rack railways are electrically powered. In some cases, a vertical boiler can be used that is less sensitive for the track gradient.

On a rack-only railroad, locomotives are always downward of their passenger cars for safety reasons: the locomotive is fitted with powerful brakes, often including hooks or clamps that grip the rack rail solidly. Some locomotives are fitted with automatic brakes that apply if the speed gets too high, preventing runaways. Often there is no coupler between locomotive and train since gravity will always push the passenger car down against the locomotive. Electrically powered vehicles often have electromagnetic track brakes as well.

The maximum speed of trains operating on a cog railway is very low, generally from depending on gradient and propulsion method. Because the Skitube has gentler gradients than typical, its speeds are higher than typical.

== In fiction ==
The Culdee Fell Railway is a fictional cog railway on the Island of Sodor in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; by Rev. W. Awdry. Its operation, locomotives and history are based on those of the Snowdon Mountain Railway, and it is featured in the book &quot;Mountain Engines&quot;.

<text>Alphaville: une étrange aventure de Lemmy Caution (&quot;Alphaville: A Strange Adventure of Lemmy Caution&quot;) is a 1965 French New Wave tech noir film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It stars Eddie Constantine, Anna Karina, Howard Vernon and Akim Tamiroff. The film won the Golden Bear award of the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965.

&quot;Alphaville&quot; combines the genres of dystopian science fiction and film noir. There are no special props or futuristic sets; instead, the film was shot in real locations in Paris, the night-time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville, while modernist glass and concrete buildings (which in 1965 were new and strange architectural designs) represent the city&#x27;s interiors. Although the film is set in the future, the technologies used and the corporations and events mentioned in the film place them firmly in the 20th century; for example, the hero describes himself as a Guadalcanal veteran.

Expatriate American actor Eddie Constantine plays Lemmy Caution, a trenchcoat-wearing secret agent. Constantine had already played this or similar roles in dozens of previous films; the character was originally created by British crime novelist Peter Cheyney. However, in &quot;Alphaville&quot;, director Jean-Luc Godard moves Caution away from his usual twentieth-century setting and places him in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia, the technocratic dictatorship of Alphaville.

==Plot==
Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from &quot;the Outlands&quot;. Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang, which he refers to as a Ford Galaxie, he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson and claims to work for the &quot;Figaro-Pravda&quot; newspaper. Caution is on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson; second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun; lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun, which is in complete control of all of Alphaville.

Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60&#x27;s dictates is that &quot;people should not ask &#x27;why&#x27;, but only say &#x27;because&quot;. People who show signs of emotion or refuse to adapt are presumed to be acting illogically and are executed by a variety of means: being machine gunned into a swimming pool, where they are stabbed by beautiful women to the applause of &quot;very important people&quot;, or by attending the &quot;execution theater&quot;, where they are electrocuted in their seats. There is a Bible and a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society.

Images of &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2 and &quot;E&quot; = &quot;hf&quot; (the equations of, respectively, special relativity and quantum mechanics) are displayed several times to refer to the scientism that underpins Alphaville. At one point, Caution passes through a place called the Grand Omega Minus, from where brainwashed people are sent out to the other &quot;galaxies&quot; to start strikes, revolutions, family rows, and student revolts. Caution is told that Alphaville plans to invade the &quot;outer countries&quot; and that his knowledge of them could be useful.

As an archetypal American antihero private eye, with a trenchcoat, fedora hat, and weathered visage, Lemmy Caution&#x27;s old-fashioned machismo conflicts with the puritanical computer. The opposition of his role to logic (and that of other dissidents to the regime) is represented by faux quotations from &quot;Capitale de la douleur&quot; (&quot;Capital of Pain&quot;), a book of poems by Paul Éluard.

Caution meets Dickson, who starts making love to a &quot;Seductress Third Class&quot; but then dies while telling Caution to &quot;make Alpha 60 destroy itself&quot; and &quot;save those who weep&quot;. Caution then enlists the assistance of Natacha von Braun, a programmer of Alpha 60 and daughter of Professor von Braun. Natacha is a citizen of Alphaville and, when questioned, says that she does not know the meaning of &quot;love&quot; or &quot;conscience&quot;. Caution falls in love with her, and his love introduces emotion and unpredictability into the city. Natacha discovers, with the help of Lemmy Caution, that she was actually born outside Alphaville.

Alpha 60 converses with Lemmy Caution several times, and its guttural voice seems to be ever-present in the city. The computer identifies Caution as a spy and sentences him to death, but he escapes, shooting and killing the men guarding him. He finds Professor von Braun, who was originally known as Leonard Nosferatu, but Caution is repeatedly told that Nosferatu no longer exists. The Professor offers Caution the chance to join Alphaville and even to rule a galaxy. When he refuses Caution&#x27;s offer to go back to &quot;the outlands&quot;, Caution kills him and escapes.

Caution finally destroys or incapacitates Alpha 60 by telling it a riddle that involves something that it cannot comprehend: poetry. The concept of the individual self has been lost to the collectivized citizens of Alphaville, and this is the key to Caution&#x27;s riddle. As the citizens collapse, Caution leaves Alphaville with Natacha, who eventually achieves an understanding of herself as an individual with desires. He tells her not to look back, and the film ends with her line &quot;Je vous aime&quot; (&quot;I love you&quot;).

==Production==
Despite its futuristic scenario, &quot;Alphaville&quot; was filmed entirely in and around Paris and no special sets or props were constructed. Buildings used were the Electricity Board building for the Alpha 60 computer centre and Le Grand Hotel.

Constantine came to the film through producer André Michelin, who had the actor under contract. Constantine had become a popular actor in France and Germany through his portrayal of tough-guy detective Lemmy Caution in a series of earlier films. Godard appropriated the character for &quot;Alphaville&quot; but according to director Anne Andreu, Godard&#x27;s subversion of the Lemmy Caution &quot;stereotype&quot; effectively shattered Constantine&#x27;s connection with the character—he reportedly said that he was shunned by producers after &quot;Alphaville&quot; was released. Constantine didn&#x27;t play Lemmy Caution again until &quot;Panic Time&quot; in 1980.

The opening section of the film includes an unedited sequence that depicts Caution walking into his hotel, checking in, riding an elevator and being taken through various corridors to his room. According to cinematographer Raoul Coutard, he and Godard shot this section as a continuous four-minute take. Part of this sequence shows Caution riding an elevator up to his room, which was achieved thanks to the fact that the hotel used as the location had two glass-walled elevators side by side, allowing the camera operator to ride in one lift while filming Constantine riding the other car through the glass between the two. However, as Coutard recalled, this required multiple takes, since the elevators were old and in practice they proved very difficult to synchronize.

Like most of Godard&#x27;s films, the performances and dialogue in &quot;Alphaville&quot; were substantially improvised. Assistant director Charles Bitsch recalled that, even when production commenced, he had no idea what Godard was planning to do. Godard&#x27;s first act was to ask Bitsch to write a screenplay, saying that producer Michelin had been pestering him for a script because he needed it to help him raise finance from backers in Germany (where Constantine was popular). Bitsch protested that he had never read a Lemmy Caution book, but Godard simply said &quot;Read one and then write it.&quot; Bitsch read a Caution book, then wrote a 30-page treatment and brought it to Godard, who said &quot;OK, fine&quot; and took it without even looking at it. It was then given to Michelin, who was pleased with the result, and the &quot;script&quot; was duly translated into German and sent off to the backers. In fact, none of it even reached the screen and according to Bitsch the German backers later asked Michelin to repay the money when they saw the completed film.

==Influences on the film==
*Caution references Louis-Ferdinand Céline directly in the taxi, when he says &quot;I am on a journey to the end of the night&quot; (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932). The use of poetry to combat Alpha 60 as a sentient being echoes the attitudes of Céline in a number of his works.
*Henri Bergson is also referenced by Caution when being interrogated by Alpha 60, when he answers &quot;the immediate data of consciousness &quot; (Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience, 1889) when asked his religion. Bergson&#x27;s rejection of idealism in favour of felt experiences parallels Caution&#x27;s conflict with the logical Alpha 60.
*Caution makes another reference to French poetry when speaking to Alpha 60, saying that when it will solve his riddle it will become &quot;[his] like, [his] brother,&quot; echoing the famous last line of Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;To the Reader&quot; in Flowers of Evil.
*Jean Cocteau exerted significant influence on Godard&#x27;s films, and parallels between &quot;Alphaville&quot; and Cocteau&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Orpheus&quot; are evident. For example, Orphée&#x27;s search for Cégeste and Caution&#x27;s for Henri Dickson, between the poems Orphée hears on the radio and the aphoristic questions given by Alpha 60, between Orphée&#x27;s victory over death through the recovery of his poetic powers and Caution&#x27;s use of poetry to destroy Alpha 60. Godard also openly acknowledges his debt to Cocteau on several occasions. When Alpha 60 is destroyed, for instance, people stagger down labyrinthine corridors and cling to the walls like the inhabitants of Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Zone de la mort&quot;, and, at the end of the film, Caution tells Natacha not to look back. Godard compares this scene with Orphée&#x27;s warning to Eurydice, and it is also possible to detect a reference here to the biblical flight from Sodom.
*The voice of Alpha 60 was performed by a man with a mechanical voice box replacing his cancer-damaged larynx. It is inspired by Dr. Mabuse&#x27;s disembodied voice in the 1933 film &quot;The Testament of Dr Mabuse&quot;.

==Legacy==
* German synth-pop band Alphaville took their name from the film.
* The affluent suburb Alphaville, outside São Paulo, Brazil, is named after the film.
* The cover of Robert Palmer&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Sally Through the Alley&quot; (1974) was inspired by &quot;Alphaville&quot;.
* The film production company Alphaville Pictures was co-founded in 2003 by Danish director Christoffer Boe, and was named after the film.
* Haruki Murakami&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;After Dark&quot; features a love hotel named after the film. The book is also set entirely at night and the narrative voice often takes the shape of a camera.
* The music video for the 2005 Kelly Osbourne song &quot;One Word&quot; is an homage to &quot;Alphaville&quot;. It was filmed in black and white and restages multiple sequences from the film, including many specific shots, and also recreates many of the film&#x27;s distinctive costumes, sets and locations.
* Jazz bassist and composer William Parker&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Alphaville Suite&quot; is inspired by and named after the film.

==Reception==

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Alphaville&quot; holds an approval rating of 92% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;While &quot;Alphaville&quot; is by no means a conventional sci-fi film, Jean-Luc Godard creates a witty, noir-ish future all his own.&quot; &quot;Time Out London&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;a dazzling amalgam of film noir and science fiction&quot;.

<doc id="143958" wikidata="Q433458" url="?curid=143958" title="Gaius Julius Civilis">
<text>Gaius Julius Civilis (AD 25 – ) was the leader of the Batavian rebellion against the Romans in 69 AD. His nomen shows that he (or one of his male ancestors) was made a Roman citizen (and thus, the tribe a Roman vassal) by either Augustus or Caligula.

==Early history==
Gaius Julius Civilis was born in AD 25. He was twice imprisoned on a charge of rebellion, and narrowly escaped execution. During the disturbances that followed the death of Nero, he took up arms under pretense of siding with Vespasian and induced the inhabitants of his native country to rebel. The Batavians, who had rendered valuable service under the early emperors, had been well treated in order to attach them to the cause of Rome. They were exempt from tribute, but were obliged to supply a large number of men for the army, and the burden of conscription and the oppression of provincial governors were important incentives to revolt. The Batavians were immediately joined by several neighboring Germanic tribes.

==Revolt==
The Roman garrisons near the Rhine were driven out, and twenty-four ships captured. Two legions under Mummius Lupercus were defeated at Castra Vetera (near the modern Xanten) and surrounded. Eight cohorts of Batavian veterans joined their countrymen, and the troops sent by Vespasian to the relief of Vetera threw in their lot with them.

&quot;Let Syria, Asia Minor, and the East, habituated as it is to despotism, submit to slavery... Freedom is a gift bestowed by nature even on the dumb animals. Courage is the peculiar excellence of man, and the Gods help the braver side.&quot;

- Gaius Julius Civilis

The result of these accessions to the forces of Civilis was a rising in Gaul. Hordeonius Flaccus was murdered by his troops (70 AD), and the whole of the Roman forces were induced by two commanders of the Gallic auxiliaries —Julius Classicus and Julius Tutor— to revolt from Rome and join Civilis. The whole of Gaul thus practically declared itself independent, and the foundation of a new kingdom of Gaul was contemplated. The prophetess Veleda predicted the complete success of Civilis and the fall of the Roman Empire. But disputes broke out among the different tribes and rendered co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal resolved to take strong measures for the suppression of the revolt.

==Defeat and surrender==
The arrival of Quintus Petillius Cerialis with a strong force awed the Gauls and mutinous troops into submission; Civilis was defeated at Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Trèves) and Castra Vetera, and forced to withdraw to the island of the Batavians. He finally came to an agreement with Cerialis whereby his countrymen obtained certain advantages, and resumed amicable relations with Rome. From this time, Civilis disappears from history.

==Notes==
==References==

<doc id="143960" wikidata="Q782889" url="?curid=143960" title="Aventura (band)">
<text>Aventura (formerly known as Los Tinellers) is an American bachata group formed in The Bronx, New York. With the lineup always consisting of the members Romeo Santos, Henry Santos, Lenny Santos (Len Melody), and Max Santos (Max Agende), they are regarded as one of the most influential Latin groups of all time. All of the members are of Dominican descent, although Romeo is also half Puerto Rican on his mother&#x27;s side. They were the first major bachata act to have originated in the United States instead of the Dominican Republic. The group was integral to the evolution of bachata music and are the pioneers of the modern bachata sound.

Aventura released five studio albums in a decade, creating many top 10 hits like &quot;Cuándo Volverás&quot;, &quot;Un Beso&quot;, &quot;Mi Corazoncito&quot;, &quot;Los Infieles&quot;, &quot;El Perdedor&quot;, &quot;Por un Segundo&quot;, &quot;Dile al Amor&quot;, among others. They have sold out many arenas including the world famous Madison Square Garden. Aventura has been nominated for awards such as American Music Awards, the Latin Grammy Awards, &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, and Premio Lo Nuestro. Aventura is one of the most internationally recognized Latin groups of the last two decades and frequently refer to themselves as &quot;K.O.B.&quot;, or &quot;Kings of Bachata&quot;.

== History ==

=== Formation, starting as Los Tinellers, and &quot;Trampa de Amor&quot; (1993–1996) ===
In 1993, Lenny Santos and his brother Max Santos formed a little band with a cousin of theirs and called themselves Banda Sueño. They would play mostly as a hobby. It didn&#x27;t last long, as the cousin was much older than Max and Lenny. They decided to look for a new singer around their age who could help them take their music career more seriously. Lenny was later introduced to Anthony via one of the group&#x27;s musicians named Roney Fernandez, who attended the same school as Anthony. They clicked instantly, and the two started working on songs together. Anthony was a singer and composer who would sing with his cousin Henry at their local church choir. Anthony later introduced Lenny to his cousin Henry, who also joined the group. These four would form Los Tinellers, which is the word &#x27;teenagers&#x27; but spelled in Spanish letters so non-English speaking Hispanics could pronounce it. The group would perform for their neighbors, at local stores and in the streets for free in the Bronx.

On July 9, 1995, the group was discovered by Elvin Polanco. Polanco was the coordinator of the 1995 Bronx Dominican Parade. Lenny and Anthony asked him if they could perform on stage at the parade. Polanco gave them the opportunity and was impressed by the group. Seeing the potential in the group, he became their manager and helped them record their first studio album despite having little funds. They released their first album in 1996 titled &quot;Trampa De Amor&quot; under Elca Productions. The album included songs that later on would be remade for later Aventura albums. One of them was &quot;Cuándo Volverás&quot;, which would later become their debut single. Unfortunately, only Anthony and Lenny were on the cover because of Henry and Max being late due to train traffic. The album did not do well commercially, selling a total of five copies.

=== Re-invented as Aventura, creating Urban Bachata, and &quot;Generation Next&quot; (1996–2000) ===
In 1996, with the help of new manager Julio César García, the group created a new image. He re-invented the group to resemble popular American boy bands. He renamed the group Aventura, which is Spanish for adventure. Later on, Elvin Polanco ran into some health problems which ended things between him and the group. In 1998, they signed a record deal with Premium Latin Music, Inc. With the help of the executive of the label, Franklin Romero, the group had the support they needed to finally expand and breakthrough in the music industry. Romero was also involved in the re-invention of the group becoming more boy band like.

On November 9, 1999, they released their debut album &quot;Generation Next&quot; along with a modernized and better known version of &quot;Cuándo Volverás&quot; as its main single in hopes of breaking bachata music into the mainstream from its traditional base. They slowly began to gather fans in Dominican Republic and in the east coast of the United States, especially in the cities of New York, Boston and Lancaster. The group was the first to experiment with fusing bachata with other genres like R&amp;B, Pop, Hip Hop, Rap, Reggae and Rock. They were one of the first bachata acts to sing a bachata song in Spanglish (English and Spanish). The group innovated bachata with fresh lyrics that incorporated songs with different themes. They created their own tone in bachata guitar by adding guitar effects such as wah, phaser, distortion, tremolo, and harmonizer. They also innovated the bachata bass with the use of bass techniques such as slapping, bass slides, and a lot of rock bass riffs into bachata. This would eventually lead to the creation of what is now known as Urban Bachata. While the album did have some success, it didn&#x27;t exceed expectations as the group was heavily criticized about the new style and the fact that they had added English in to the genre.

=== &quot;We Broke the Rules&quot;, Anthony becoming Romeo, and the expansion of Bachata (2001–2003) ===
While at the beginning they didn&#x27;t get the mainstream attention they were looking for with their debut album, the style they had introduced did help make the genre mainstream. In 2001 four songs were leaked to the public which were for their second studio album. The songs were &quot;Todavía Me Amas&quot;, &quot;Amor De Madre&quot;, &quot;Enséñame A Olvidar&quot;, and &quot;Obsesión&quot; which featured Dominican-American singer Judy Santos. Thanks to the success of &quot;Obsesión&quot;, the group got the big break they were waiting for and would eventually turn them into the icons that they are today. The song achieved huge success in many countries. It peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart in the U.S. It also topped many European charts by peaking at number 1 in seven countries, which made it peak at number 1 on the Eurochart Hot 100. This would expand bachata internationally as it reached countries where the genre was never heard before at the time. This would also be the start for Judy as a female vocalist for the group as she would eventually work for them in other songs.

Around this time, Anthony decided to go under the name Romeo Santos. He created an alter ego to be a more romantic character on stage to help him with his shyness. He came up with the name Romeo because of the song &quot;Todavía Me Amas&quot; in which he mentions Romeo and Juliet. This was also due to the fact there is another bachata artist by the name Antony Santos, who was the man that inspired him to become a bachata singer. Romeo would refer to himself as Anthony Santos from Aventura to be specific. Even though both singers had their names spelled different, it was still pronounced the same way. This led the group and the record label to make the decision to have Anthony go under the name he is known today, Romeo Santos.

On July 2, 2002, they would release their second album under the Aventura name title &quot;We Broke the Rules&quot;. It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Tropical Albums chart. It also peaked at number 1 in the French and Italian albums charts. The album would feature Judy Santos and Puerto Rican-American singer Toby Love, who worked for them as a back up vocalist until he left in 2005 to pursue a solo career. His voice was used for the songs &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;, a cover of an NSYNC song. In the same year, they would release their first live album titled &quot;En Vivo&quot;. It was based on their 2002 show at the United Palace in New York City. It was re-released in Europe on August 30, 2004, and renamed &quot;Unplugged&quot;. On January 11, 2011, it was released to the world under the title &quot;Live! 2002&quot;. In 2003, they released their first concert film, &quot;Aventura In Concert: Sold Out At The United Palace&quot;.

=== &quot;Love &amp; Hate&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Project&quot;, and Mainstream breakthrough in the U.S. (2003–2006)===

In 2003, the group released the main single for their third studio album titled &quot;Hermanita&quot;. The song addressed issue like domestic violence, especially the mistreatment of women in the household. The song peaked at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart and at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Tropical Songs chart. On November 18, 2003, they released their third studio album, &quot;Love &amp; Hate&quot;. It peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Tropical Albums chart and at number 3 in the Swiss Albums chart. It is their first album to get a Gold and Platinum certification in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2004, they released a special edition that was exclusively to Italy. It featured edited versions of the songs Cuándo volverás and Obsesión. They released a 2005 edition as well that was released exclusively for Romania. In 2005, they released their second concert film, &quot;The Love &amp; Hate Concert: Sold Out At The United Palace&quot;. It is based on a concert for &quot;Love &amp; Hate&quot; that took place at the United Palace in New York City.

In February 2005, they released their first single for their fourth studio album &quot;La Boda&quot;. It peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Tropical Airplay chart. On April 26, 2005, they released their fourth studio album, &quot;God&#x27;s Project&quot;. This is their first album distributed by Sony Music Latin. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, it peaked at number 133 on the Billboard 200, at number 5 on both Heatseekers Albums and Top Latin Albums charts, and at number 1 on the Tropical Albums chart making it the group&#x27;s first number one album on that chart. It is considered the group&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough album as they started to get more mainstream publicity in the United States. It was the best-selling tropical album of 2006 in the United States and was certified 4× Platinum in the U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album featured collaborations with Judy Santos, Anthony &#x27;El Mayimbe&#x27; Santos, Nina Sky, Don Omar, and Tego Calderón who was featured in a hidden track. This album also featured the songs &quot;Ella y Yo&quot;, &quot;Un Beso&quot;, and &quot;Angelito&quot; which were released as singles later on.

On May 9, 2005, &quot;Ella y Yo&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. It featured Puerto Rican Reggaeton artist, Don Omar. It peaked at 97 on the Billboard 100, at number 2 on the Hot Latin Songs and at number 1 on both the Latin Rhythm and Tropical Airplay &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The music video was released in the same year. It took place in a bar. The video is about Romeo Santos and Don Omar having a conversation about love. On August 8, 2005, &quot;Un Beso&quot; was released as the third a single. It became the main single for the fourth studio album. The group paid tribute to Spanish musician, Manzanita in this song. It peaked at number 6 on the Hot Latin Songs and at number 2 on the Tropical Airplay &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Later that year, &quot;Angelito&quot; was released as the last single and peaked at 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Tropical Airplay chart. This would also be the last song to feature Judy Santos as she would embark in her own music career. On March 10, 2006, Aventura would perform a sold-out show at The Theater at Madison Square Garden making it their first live performance at MSG.

=== &quot;K.O.B. Live&quot; and selling out Madison Square Garden (2006–2008) ===
On October 19, 2006, they released the single &quot;Los Infieles&quot; and while it is a studio song, it was released as the first single for their second live album. It peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart, at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Airplay chart, and at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Tropical Airplay chart. Later on, a remix was made which featured Mexican singer Frankie J. On December 19, 2006, they released their second live album, &quot;K.O.B. Live&quot;. It is a double-disc live album of Aventura&#x27;s greatest hits from their first four studio albums.

=== Inmortal Tour (2019–2021) ===
On April 1, 2019, the group posted an image on their Instagram account teasing a new Aventura single called &quot;Inmortal&quot; slated to be released at 9PM, captioning it &quot;#UTOPIA&quot;. At 9PM, Romeo uploaded a video saying that their new song would not be released at 9PM after all, and that it was intended to be an April Fool&#x27;s joke which led the fans to become upset and lash out on social media. The following day, however, the group apologized and announced that the April Fool&#x27;s joke was not the song, but was the release date. They then previewed the new single &quot;Inmortal&quot; and its music video, stating that it was being released on April 5, as a part of Romeo&#x27;s fourth studio and first collaboration album, &quot;Utopia&quot;. Eventually, the song was released on that date and it is their first single since 2010. It debuted at 95 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart.

That same night, Aventura won an award for Tropical Duo/Group of the Year.

On September 21, 2019, the group reunited for Romeo&#x27;s Utopia concert at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. They performed hits such as &quot;Dile al Amor&quot;, &quot;Todavía Me Amas&quot;, and &quot;Inmortal&quot;. The group performed &quot;Obsesión&quot; alongside Cardi B who would also performed her hit song &quot;I Like It&quot; at the concert. On December 8, 2019, an announcement was made regarding the band&#x27;s upcoming US tour, La Gira Inmortal. It was their first tour since splitting in 2011, and began in Los Angeles on February 5, 2020. In March 2020, the group had announced that concerts were postpone due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included 5 shows at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City that was supposed to take place from March 16 to the 19, and March 22, 2020. It was eventually postponed for the dates July 9 to the 12. However, it was eventually canceled just like all the other scheduled or postponed shows.

In June 2021, Aventura announced the return of the Inmortal Tour. But instead of doing the shows in the venues that were originally planned before their cancelation, they decided to play at stadiums and big arenas in certain cities. Before the tour started, the group released the single Volví on August 3, 2021, featuring Bad Bunny. On August 14, the tour started in Miami, Florida at Hard Rock Stadium. They became the first Latin act to ever sell out the stadium. The tour ended on October 9, 2021, in East Rutherford, New Jersey, at MetLife Stadium. This was the same venue Romeo Santos sold out 2 years prior. They had a show for Arlington, Texas, at Globe Life Field scheduled on August 22, 2021. However it was postpone to October 14, 2021. This would have been the last concert but for some unknown reason the concert never happened. It was never mentioned. There was no news nor any announcements were made about why it was canceled. On November 4, 2021, Aventura announced their very last concert to be set for December 18, 2021, At the Félix Sánchez Olympic Stadium in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. They sold out tickets 3 days after the day they went on sale. A second concert was set for December 19, 2021, which would eventually be their final concert together. Both shows were successful.

=== Possible forthcoming album, Final reunion, and Cerrando Ciclos (2022-present) ===
In 2022 and 2023, Romeo released his fifth studio album Formula, Vol. 3, and went on a tour which included numerous sold-out stadium shows. Meanwhile, Henry would release numerous singles. As for Lenny and Max, they would have these special events tour where they would play Aventura hits in clubs and small venues. Also, Max got to release rap singles and a few albums eventually. The albums were, &quot;Fama Y Dolor&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Max Beats Vol. 1&quot;.

On May 10, 2022, Max &quot;Agende&quot; Santos was interviewed by Mega Atlanta Radio. He mentioned a forthcoming album was in the works, but that he had no concrete announcement to make. Romeo&#x27;s fifth studio solo album, Formula, Vol. 3, included a skit in which a preview of a song was played. Fans claimed that the snippet didn&#x27;t sound like a Romeo Santos song, but an Aventura song instead, which insinuated that the group would eventually reunite soon.

On February 25, 2024, Romeo posted a social media, announcing that he would be posting something the following day. The next day, every member of the group posted a video that indicated that they were back. The following day, they announced dates for their tour, Cerrando Ciclos, which is considered the group&#x27;s final tour. On April 2, 2024, they released their first single since 2021 and first bachata song since 2019, &quot;Brindo Con Agua&quot;. It was released under Henry&#x27;s record label Hustlehard Entertainment LLC. It is also the fifth song and first single from the group in which Henry is the lead vocalist. This is the second Aventura song to be featured in one of the members solo projects instead of an album by the group as it is the eighth and lead single for Henry&#x27;s upcoming sixth studio album, &quot;2.0&quot;. The album was released on May 31, 2024. Aventura have hinted at a possible group album, but no official announcement has been made.

== Artistry ==

=== Musical style ===
While the group uses many genres in their music, they are mostly a Bachata band. Unlike traditional bachata artists, Aventura uses American genres like R&amp;B, Pop, Hip Hop, Rap, Reggae and Rock mixed with their Bachata songs. Anthony innovated bachata with fresh lyrics that incorporated songs with different themes, instead of just singing about heartbreak. Lenny innovated bachata guitar with his use of electric guitars. He also innovated the tone of bachata guitar by adding guitar effects such as wah, phaser, distortion, tremolo, and harmonizer. Max innovated the bachata bass with his use of bass techniques such as slapping and bass slides. Max incorporated a lot of rock bass riffs into bachata. They are the creators of the urban style of Bachata. As Los Tinellers, they started off as a traditional bachata group. In the late 1990s, they would re-invent themselves as Aventura and started to add a more Americanized style to the genre.

=== Influences ===
They have been influenced by many Latin and American artists. In Bachata, their influences include artists like Juan Luis Guerra, Pau Hernandez, Raulín Rodríguez, Luis Vargas, and Anthony Santos. Romeo even considers Anthony a father figure in the music business.

== Legacy ==
The group have been widely dubbed the Kings of Modern Bachata, K.O.B. for short. They are credited with making Bachata a musical genre recognized worldwide and for broadening its overall appeal. With their 2002 single Obsesión, the song had a wide cultural impact, launching their careers to heights they themselves never imagined. They have sold millions of albums, have broken numerous records, and have sold out multiple arenas and stadiums year over year during their heights as a band. 

The group&#x27;s musical style led to them being pioneers in creating the Urban Bachata sound, having inspired artists like Prince Royce, Leslie Grace, among others. They have paved the way for groups such as Xtreme, Bachata Heightz, 24 Horas, Optimo, among others.

<text>A beehive tomb, also known as a tholos tomb (plural tholoi; from , &quot;tholotoi táphoi&quot;, &quot;domed tomb(s)&quot;), is a burial structure characterized by its false dome created by corbelling, the superposition of successively smaller rings of mudbricks or, more often, stones. The resulting structure resembles a beehive, hence the traditional English name.

Tholoi were used for burial in several cultures in the Mediterranean and West Asia, but in some cases they were used for different purposes such as homes (Cyprus), rituals (Bulgaria, Syria), and even fortification (Spain, Sardinia). Although Max Mallowan used the same name for the circular houses belonging to the Neolithic culture of Tell Halaf (Iraq, Syria and Turkey), there is no relationship between them.

==Greece==
In Greece, the vaulted &quot;tholoi&quot; are a monumental Late Bronze Age development. Their origin is a matter of considerable debate: were they inspired by the tholoi of Crete which were first used in the Early Minoan period or were they a natural development of tumulus burials dating to the Middle Bronze Age.
In concept, they are similar to the much more numerous Mycenaean chamber tombs which seem to have emerged at about the same time. Both have chamber, doorway stomion and entrance passage dromos but tholoi are largely built while chamber tombs are rock-cut.

A few early examples of tholoi have been found in Messenia in the SW Peloponnese Greece (for example at Voidhokoilia), and recently near Troezen in the NE Peloponnese. These tholoi are built on level ground and then enclosed by a mound of earth. A pair of tumuli at Marathon, Greece indicate how a built rectangular (but without a vault) central chamber was extended with an entrance passage.

After about 1500 BCE, beehive tombs became more widespread and are found in every part of the Mycenaean heartland. In contrast, however, to the early examples these are almost always cut into the slope of a hillside so that only the upper third of the vaulted chamber was above ground level. This masonry was then concealed with a relatively small mound of earth.

The tombs usually contain more than one burial, in various places in the tomb either on the floor, in pits and cists or on stone-built or rock-cut benches, and with various grave goods. After a burial, the entrance to the tomb was filled in with soil, leaving a small mound with most of the tomb underground. 

The chamber is always built in masonry, even in the earliest examples, as is the stomion or entrance-way. The dromos in early examples was usually just cut from the bedrock, as in the Panagia Tomb at Mycenae itself. In later examples such as the Treasury of Atreus and Tomb of Clytemnestra (both at Mycenae), all three parts were constructed of fine ashlar masonry.

The chambers were built as corbelled vaults, with layers of stone placed closer together as the vault tapers toward the top of the tomb. These stone layers were trimmed from inside the tomb, creating a smooth dome. 

The entrances provided an opportunity for conspicuous demonstration of wealth. That of the Treasury of Atreus, for example, was decorated with columns of red and green “Lapis Lacedaimonius” brought from quarries over 100 km away.

The abundance of such tombs, often with more than one being associated with a settlement during one specific time period, may indicate that their use was not confined to the ruling monarchy only, although the sheer size and therefore the outlay required for the larger tombs (ranging in diameter and height) would argue in favour of royal commissions. The larger tombs contained amongst the richest finds to have come from the Late Bronze Age of Mainland Greece, despite the tombs having been pillaged both in antiquity and more recently. Although the Vapheio tholos, south of Sparta, had been robbed, two cists in the floor had escaped notice. These contained, among other valuable items, the two gold “Vapheio cups” decorated with scenes of bull taming which are among the best known of Mycenaean treasures.

==Levant and Cyprus==

Circular structures were commonly built in the Near East, including the examples known as &quot;tholoi&quot; found in the Neolithic Halaf culture of Iraq, Syria and Turkey. They were probably used as both houses and as storage structures, but ritual use may also have occurred. Other, later examples are found in Cyprus (Khirokitia), where they were used as homes. There is no clear connection between these domestic, circular buildings and later tholos tombs.

==Southern Europe and Sardinia==
In the Chalcolithic period of the Iberian Peninsula, beehive tombs appear among other innovative &quot;megalithic&quot; variants, from c. 3000 BCE. They are especially common in southern Spain and Portugal, while in Central Portugal and southeastern France other styles (artificial caves especially) are preferred instead. The civilization of Los Millares and its Bronze Age successor, El Argar, are particularly related to this burial style. 

The Bronze Age fortifications known as &quot;motillas&quot; in La Mancha (Spain) also use the &quot;tholos&quot; building technique.

The imposing stone structures known as &quot;nuraghi&quot;, as well as the similar structures of southern Corsica, dominated the Bronze Age landscape of Sardinia (Italy). Nuraghi are truncated conical towers of dry-laid stone, about 40 feet in diameter, sloping up to a circular roof some 50 feet above the ground. The vaulted ceiling is 20 to 35 feet above the floor.
Although the remains of some 7,000 nuraghi have been found, up to 30,000 may have been built.

There are also recorded Etruscan tombs at a necropolis at Banditaccia dating from the 6th and 7th centuries BCE, having an external appearance similar to a beehive. The interiors of these Etruscan tombs were furnished and decorated to resemble domestic dwellings, providing insight into the Etruscan practice of honoring the dead in a manner that reflected daily life.

==Bulgaria==
The beehive Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak is an example of the richly decorated tholoi tombs of Thracian rulers, many of which are found in modern Bulgaria and date from the 4th–3rd century BCE. The walls of the Kazanlak tomb are covered with plaster and stucco, with ornate scenes from the life of the deceased. Other tumuli, known as &quot;mogili&quot; in Bulgarian, that feature underground chambers in the form of a beehive dome include, among others, the Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari, Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo, Golyama Arsenalka, Tomb of Seuthes III, Thracian tomb Shushmanets, Thracian tomb Griffins, Thracian tomb Helvetia, Thracian tomb Ostrusha. There have been several significant gold and silver treasures associated with Thracian tombs currently kept at Bulgaria&#x27;s Archaeological and National Historical Museum and other institutions.

==Eastern Arabia==
The earliest stone-built tombs which can be called &quot;beehive&quot; are in Oman and the U.A.E., built of stacked flat stones which occur in nearby geological formations. They date to the Hafit period of the early Bronze Age, between 3,500 and 2,500 years BCE, a period when the Arabian Peninsula was subject to much more rainfall than now, and supported a flourishing civilization in what is now the Arabian Desert, to the west of the Hajar Mountains along the Gulf of Oman. No burial remains have ever been retrieved from these &quot;tombs&quot;, though there seems no other purpose for their construction. They are only superficially similar to the Aegean tombs (circular shape) as they are built entirely above ground level and do not share the same tripartite structure – the entrances are usually an undifferentiated part of the circular walling of the tomb. Currently there are three areas where these tombs can be found: Al-Hajar Region (particularly Jebel Hafeet near Al Ain in the U.A.E., and the Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn in Oman), Hat Region, and Hadbin area close to Barkaʾ. The Hajar tombs are very numerous and one or two have been restored, allowing one to crawl into the centre of a tall stone structure measuring .

==Somalia==
NE of Qandala is a field of tombs of varying sizes.

<text>Ænima ( ) is the second studio album by the American rock band Tool. It was released in vinyl format on September 17, 1996, and in compact disc format on October 1, 1996, through Zoo Entertainment. The album was recorded and cut at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood and The Hook in North Hollywood from 1995 to 1996. It is the first album by Tool to feature bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced original bassist Paul D&#x27;Amour the year prior. The album was produced by David Bottrill.

The album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart upon its initial release, selling 148,000 copies in its first week. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on March 4, 2003. The album appeared on lists of the best albums of 1996 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. The track &quot;Ænema&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. In 2003, &quot;Ænima&quot; was ranked the sixth most influential album of all time by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at No. 18 on its list of The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

==Background==
&quot;Ænima&quot; is Tool&#x27;s first studio album with former Peach bassist Justin Chancellor.

The title &quot;Ænima&quot; is a combination of the words &#x27;&#x27; (Latin for &#x27;soul&#x27; and associated with the ideas of &quot;life force&quot;, and a term often used by psychologist Carl Jung) and &#x27;enema&#x27;, the medical procedure involving the injection of fluids into the rectum.

Promotional singles were issued, in order of release, for &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, &quot;H.&quot;, &quot;Ænema&quot; and &quot;Forty-Six &amp; 2&quot; with just the first and third receiving music videos.
Several of the songs are short segues or interludes that connect to longer songs, pushing the total duration of the CD towards the maximum of around 80 minutes. These segues are &quot;Useful Idiot&quot;, &quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot;, &quot;Intermission&quot;, &quot;Die Eier von Satan&quot;, &quot;Cesaro Summability&quot;, and &quot;(-) Ions&quot;.

==Lyrics and themes==
The liner notes included references to dissociative anesthesia through ketamine as well as Timothy Leary, &quot;futants&quot;, ritual magic, and religious fundamentalism. The band dedicated the album to comedian Bill Hicks, who they felt was going in the same direction as them, and said this album was partly inspired by him. The inside cover displays art featuring a painting of a disabled patient that shows a resemblance to singer Maynard James Keenan and Bill Hicks depicted as a doctor or &quot;healer&quot; with the line, &quot;Another Dead Hero&quot;.

Demo versions of the songs &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, &quot;Eulogy&quot;, &quot;Pushit&quot;, and &quot;Ænema&quot; were recorded with Paul D&#x27;Amour on bass, before he left the band. These appeared online in early 2007. D&#x27;Amour also worked on &quot;H.&quot;, as he is credited as a co-songwriter on ASCAP&#x27;s website.

Speculation has surrounded the song &quot;H.&quot; The &quot;meaning&quot; of this song has seldom been detailed by the band, as they do not regularly comment on such matters. However, on several occasions, specifically on November 23, 1996, during a show at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, Keenan did grant some insight into the meaning of the song. Speaking to the audience, he said, &quot;Any of you ever seen those old Warner Bros. cartoons? Sometimes there&#x27;s that one where the guy is trying to make a decision, and he&#x27;s got an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Seems pretty obvious, right? The angel is trying to give him good advice while the devil is trying to get him to do what&#x27;s bad for him. It&#x27;s not always that simple, though. A lot of times they&#x27;re not really angels or devils, but friends giving you advice, looking out for your best interest but not really understanding what&#x27;s going to be best for you. So it kind of comes down to you. You have to make the decision yourself. This song is called &#x27;H.&#x27;&quot; The song was discussed live during a few other shows around this time, one example being on February 23, 1997, when Keenan introduced this song by referring to the shoulder angel and devil, and also said it is about a hurtful yet dependent relationship. In an interview Keenan gave in December 1996, he commented, &quot;My son&#x27;s name is Devo H. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say.&quot; It is also of note that the song&#x27;s working title was &quot;Half Empty&quot;, as it was introduced during a mini-tour of California by the band in December 1995.

The track &quot;Useful Idiot&quot; features the sound of the needle skipping at the end of a gramophone record growing louder as the track progresses. The track was set at the end of side 1 of the vinyl versions of &quot;Ænima&quot; as a joke to fool those who owned the version. The song (on vinyl) not only ends in a locked groove, which requires manual lifting of the needle to end playback, but also continues on the run-in groove of side 2.

&quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot; features calming piano music and the background noises of seagulls while a profanity-laden message from an answering machine plays. The person who left the message was a visiting Italian friend of Green Jellÿ member Gary Helsinger. Helsinger and Keenan were roommates at the time of the incident and Helsinger had earlier ejected the guest from the apartment for eating most of their food and running up an excessive phone bill. The name &quot;Harry Manback&quot; is a reference to a comedy routine by Bill Hicks. A follow-up message from the same guest became &quot;Message to Harry Manback II&quot;, found on &quot;Salival&quot; which features strings instead of piano.

&quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot; refers to a fan who accused the band of selling out after their first EP. &quot;OGT&quot; is taken to stand for &quot;Original Gangster Tool&quot;. Keenan whispers in the left channel throughout the song. At 1:41, &quot;consume, be fruitful, and multiply&quot; may be alluding to Genesis, which contains the phrase &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; six times. During Lollapalooza 1997, a version of &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot; remixed by Billy Howerdel in the form of lounge music played over the public address system between sets.

During 1996 concerts, Keenan told audiences that the song &quot;Jimmy&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Prison Sex&quot;, and how it is about getting through the abuse. It is preceded by &quot;Intermission&quot;, a short organ adaptation of the opening riff of &quot;Jimmy&quot;.

The fourth, and most controversial segue is the NDH spoken word track &quot;Die Eier von Satan&quot;. It is introduced by a distorted bassline giving way to a heavy industrial guitar, starting at the :23 mark and lasting only ten seconds, playing a single chord in Drop C tuning over a reversed drum beat in meter. The lyrics are performed in German by Marko Fox, bass player for ZAUM and SexTapes. He is backed by a sound that resembles a hydraulic press, and crowd cheering and applause that increase in volume as the lyrics are read with increasing ferocity, with the greatest emphasis on the line &quot;Und Keine Eier&quot; (&quot;And no eggs&quot;) which is repeated like a catchphrase. These combined effects make the song sound like a militant German rant or Nazi rally. While the tone is aggressive, the speaker is merely reciting a recipe for a Mexican wedding cookie. The song was originally translated by Gudrun Fox. According to Blair McKenzie Blake, the maintainer of Tool&#x27;s official website, &quot;Die Eier von Satan&quot; originally were cookies that &quot;Marko Fox&#x27;s grandmother used to bake for him as a child, without using eggs as an ingredient. The substitution for eggs is a magical incantation from the worm-eaten pages of some moldering grimoire.&quot; This magical incantation (&quot;sim salabim bamba sala do saladim&quot;) is taken from the German children&#x27;s song &quot;Auf einem Baum ein Kuckuck&quot; and popularized by Harry August Jansen. According to the lyrics, the special ingredient besides this &quot;incantation&quot; is &quot;a knife-tip of Turkish hashish&quot;. The title is a play on deviled eggs, translating to &quot;The eggs of Satan&quot; in English or &quot;The balls of Satan&quot;, due to a German double entendre of &quot;eier&quot;. So far the only time it has been performed live in its entirety was on December 19, 1996, at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. The track has been compared to the work of industrial and experimental artists such as Einstürzende Neubauten, Rammstein and Tom Waits.

&quot;Pushit&quot; was titled as a single word to emphasize the ambiguity of the pronunciation in regard to the &quot;s&quot; word (push it on me/push shit on me). An alternate version of &quot;Pushit&quot; was performed live, including an Aloke Dutta tabla solo, and appears on &quot;Salival&quot;.

The song &quot;Third Eye&quot; contains samples of comedian Bill Hicks. The title may be a reference to Hicks&#x27; assertions that psilocybe mushrooms could be used to &quot;squeegee [one&#x27;s] third eye clean.&quot; A goal of the album as a whole was to &quot;open people up in some way and help open their third eye and help them on a path.&quot;

&quot;Ænema&quot; makes lyrical references to Bill Hicks&#x27; set Arizona Bay, in which the San Andreas Fault collapses, purging the continent of Southern California and the Baja Peninsula which would give Arizona its own oceanfront. This is further illustrated in the lenticular map under the CD tray. The alternate spelling for the song emphasizes the &quot;enema&quot; portion of the combined title also used for the album; in this way, it differentiates the meaning of the song (with California&#x27;s collapse seen as a &#x27;flushing out&#x27; for the country) from the meaning of the album (the &quot;anima&quot; emphasis indicating a spiritual, Jungian focus for the album in its entirety) while retaining the song&#x27;s placement as the title track, though the differing spelling and pronunciation marks a different approach from other Tool albums that are named directly after songs (&quot;Opiate&quot;, &quot;Undertow&quot;, &quot;Lateralus&quot; and &quot;Fear Inoculum)&quot; or sections of songs (&quot;10,000&quot; &quot;Days).&quot;

Many regional versions stated the track times for tracks 3 and 4 in reverse. This is noted on all pressings from Australia, UK, and Europe.

==Artwork==
The packaging for &quot;Ænima&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. North American pressings of the album were packaged in a custom lenticular jewel case (called a &quot;Multi-Image CD case&quot; in the liner notes) for the cover and interior disc tray. The cover art and other images in the liner notes can be set behind the lenticular &quot;lens&quot; to create an effect of sequential animation. European pressings of the CD featured a standard case, and the insert contained a catalog of sixteen fictional and humorously titled &quot;other albums available by Tool&quot;.

The special images used for the lenticular effect are:
* Cam de Leon&#x27;s painting &quot;Smoke Box&quot;, with animated smoke and encompassing eyes.
* A touched-up version of Cam de Leon&#x27;s painting &quot;Ocular Orifice&quot;, with the pupil of the eye animated to rotate completely around.
* A photo of contortionist Alana Cain with her legs wrapped behind her head appearing to be performing cunnilingus on herself. Shown sitting on a couch to the right are Danny Carey (nude) and Justin Chancellor. Adam Jones is squatting next to them while Maynard James Keenan, also nude, gets up to throw a single rose on the ground in front of Cain with his left hand covering his genitals. Another image of the contortionist can be seen on the disc itself.
* An image of California before and after a major earthquake is shown in the tray behind where the disc lies – a reference to the song &quot;Ænema&quot; and the &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; sketch by Bill Hicks. The inlay image of the US incorrectly depicts the Oklahoma Panhandle with Cimarron County being in the state of Texas. It is unknown whether or not this was intentional.

==Release and reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Ænima&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews by mainstream music critics, citing the band&#x27;s innovation and ambitions within the album&#x27;s sound. Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it was &quot;one of 1996&#x27;s strangest and strongest alt-metal records&quot;, while &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen wrote that &quot;Tool moves to the front of the alterna-metal shop on its third and best release&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Sandy Masuo found that the band had successfully incorporated exotic instrumentation and sampling into their &quot;raw, gripping rock&quot; to give it &quot;an even more exhilarating edge&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that Tool &quot;shove their iron-spike riffing and shock-therapy polemics right up the claustrophobic dead end of so-called alternative metal in the name of a greater metaphysical glory&quot;, calling the album &quot;very admirable&quot; and &quot;even a bit impressive&quot;. In a retrospective review of &quot;Ænima&quot;, AllMusic writer Rob Theakston stated that on the album, &quot;Tool explore the progressive rock territory previously forged by such bands as King Crimson. However, Tool are conceptually innovative with every minute detail of their art, which sets them apart from most bands&quot;.

Among mixed reviews, Chuck Eddy of &quot;Spin&quot; found that while Jones had progressed as a guitarist, Keenan&#x27;s vocal range remained limited: &quot;[He] only knows how to get intense by turning ugly; his vocals stretch only toward bullying low notes. In his upper register, instead of soaring, he settles for just mumbling blandly&quot;. Greg Kot, writing in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, found it inferior to later Tool albums: &quot;With &quot;Ænima&quot;, the band&#x27;s ambitions nearly get the best of them. The increasing density of their relentlessly downcast music, augmented by occasional electronic noises, begins to feel ponderous. &#x27;I&#x27;ve been wallowing in my own chaotic insecure delusions,&#x27; Maynard James Keenan mutters, and the music indulges him. The claustrophobic production doesn&#x27;t help.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dismissed &quot;Ænima&quot; as a &quot;dud&quot;.

===Accolades===
The album appeared on lists of the best albums of 1996 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. The track &quot;Ænema&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. In 2003, &quot;Ænima&quot; was ranked the 6th most influential album of all time by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; In 2006, it placed 14th on a Guitar World readers poll that attempted to find the best 100 guitar albums. In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted it the third greatest drumming album in the history of progressive rock.

<text>Burgess Hill () is a town and civil parish in West Sussex, England, close to the border with East Sussex, on the edge of the South Downs National Park, south of London, north of Brighton and Hove, and northeast of the county town, Chichester. It had an area of and a population of 30,635 at the 2011 Census, making it the fourth most populous parish in the county (behind Crawley, Worthing and Horsham) and the most populous in the Mid Sussex District. Other nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the northeast and Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, to the southeast.

Burgess Hill is just on the West Sussex side of the border dividing the two counties, although parts of the World&#x27;s End district are across the county boundary in the Lewes district of East Sussex. On its northwest border lies the Bedelands Farm Nature Reserve.

Burgess Hill is twinned with Schmallenberg in Germany and Abbeville in France.

== History ==

===Early history===
The London to Brighton Way was built connecting London to the South coast and passing through what is now Burgess Hill, and although a Roman road, there is no evidence that the Romans settled there.

Burgess Hill originated in the parishes of Clayton, Keymer, and Ditchling – all of them mentioned in the Domesday Book. The town&#x27;s name comes from the Burgeys family when the name John Burgeys appeared in the tax rolls. The name of Burgeys stood for &#x27;bourgeois&#x27;, the inhabitant of a borough. By the Elizabethan period, a community had established itself there, and many buildings dating from this era still stand.

The hill in the town&#x27;s name is taken to mean different things to different people. Many believe that the hill in question is the hill on which the railway station currently stands, but there is a Burgess Farm on a hill in the south-east of the town, in Folders Lane. Whether this is the hill referred to in the town&#x27;s name is not known.

The few buildings in the area were the two farmhouses, at Hammonds Ridge (still standing as a residence) and one at Queen&#x27;s Crescent, in the west of what is now Burgess Hill. Until the nineteenth century, however, the town was known as St John&#x27;s Common, and much of what is now the town centre was common land used by the tenants of Clayton and Keymer manors for grazing and as a source of fuel. Buildings which supported the common land were the King&#x27;s Head pub (now demolished), a blacksmith&#x27;s forge, and several cottages.

From the fourteenth century or earlier, the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24 June, the feast of the birth of St John the Baptist. The last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913.

With the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway, those in the business soon realised that transporting sheep by train was more cost effective and easier than using the old roadways. Most livestock trading began to centre on railside markets such as those at Hassocks, Haywards Heath, and Lewes railway stations. By the dawn of the 20th century, livestock trading had all but ceased in the Burgess Hill area.

===1700 to 1900===
By the early seventeenth century small scale brick and tile manufacture was flourishing and during this time parcels of common land were allocated for house building and small businesses. By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two alehouses established on the common. Craftsmen such as smiths, shoemakers and weavers also worked there. Brickmaking by hand was still undertaken until very recently, by Keymer Tiles (formerly the Keymer Brick and Tile Company) whose tiles can be found in buildings such as St. James Church, Piccadilly and Manchester Central Station (now G-Mex).

The arrival of the London and Brighton Railway in the 1840s (the line was officially opened to Brighton from Haywards Heath on 21 September 1841) was an important milestone in the Town&#x27;s history and development, despite the station remaining a request stop on the route for a number of years after opening. The influx of trades associated with railway construction and operation, including many navvies changed the demography of the town. The Railway Tavern in Station Road was constructed to provide accommodation for all who needed it on Railway business. The arrival of the railway shaped the traffic pattern of the Town and continues to this day; all road traffic has to cross the line either in the South on Station Road or in the North on Leylands Road. The opening of the Lewes Branch connected the Keymer Brick and Tile Company to the railway network providing access to greater markets. Wivelsfield railway station was originally built nearby on the Lewes branch.

The arrival of the railway and the proximity of Burgess Hill to Brighton, itself expanding as a result of the arrival of the railway, led to an influx of professional people looking for places to live. Not far from the station, the common was ripe for development with the result that the Keymer and Clayton portions were enclosed in 1828 and 1855 respectively. Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from an insignificant rural settlement to a town of 4,500 residents.

In 1857, in an area now known as either &#x27;the top of the town&#x27;, or Hoadley&#x27;s Corner, the Hoadley family of Heathfield established a large department store, of which the original building still stands, on the corner of Station Road and Junction Road. This successful business also had branches at nearby Ditchling, and Seaford too, but it was in Burgess Hill that the head offices were based.

In 1876, a large house known as Wynnstay was constructed opposite Hoadley&#x27;s store in Junction Road, and became the principal residence of Sampson Copestake. Copestake later provided land and money and to build a new Church in World&#x27;s End, which later became the parish of St Andrew&#x27;s in its own right.

Wynnstay eventually became the Wynnstay Hydropathic Institution, known as the Hydro for short. The property was bought up and converted by a Professor Weidhaus when Copestake moved on, and converted to a nature cure establishment. It is thought that the views from the property, along with the fresh country air and proximity to Burgess Hill railway station, were the reasons for this enterprise. The Hydro remained until 1909, when the business was moved to Franklands, a large property to the south of the town. By 1914 Wynnstay had become a hotel and by the 1950s it was known as St Joseph&#x27;s Convent and became a convent and school for Catholic children.

In 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local Edwin Street, a well-known farmer and butcher. The gardens were opened in honour of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, and contained a large lake, which covered , and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster, known as a switchback (an alternative general term for a roller coaster). The lake was used for boating in the summer, and skating in the winter. The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street, a man of 23 stone, before being used in the winter. This area is now the Victoria Business Park, an industrial estate.

===1900 to present day===
On 12 July 1944 a Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire fighter crashed at Greenlands Farm, off the Keymer Road, killing the Belgian pilot.

The town continued to grow, experiencing its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961, when the population of about 7,000 residents almost doubled. This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the South East. By 1956, the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed, and has since expanded. It now contains the British headquarters of two substantial international companies. In 1986 a smaller industrial estate in the North of the town developed, known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate. Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks.

In the seventies and eighties several new housing estates were built, namely the Folders Lane estate (formerly known as Oakwood), the Oak Hall Park estate and the Sheddingdean estate. The 1980s saw the largest single development in the town&#x27;s history; new housing was created in the northwest of the town with a development known as West End Meadows. Along with this a link road to the A23 was built, easing traffic on the previous route along Gatehouse Lane and Jobs Lane.

Bedelands Farm Nature Reserve to the northwest was designated a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) at around this time, preserving at least this area from the otherwise relentless building, but further development took place to the South and West of the Town in the early 1990s. This became the Hammonds Ridge estate (known colloquially as the &#x27;Tesco estate&#x27; due to its proximity to the supermarket) which was built at the time.

The Triangle, a large leisure and conference centre, was built in the Northwest of the town and opened by the Queen in 1999. In 2005 St Paul&#x27;s Catholic College moved from Haywards Heath to their new site opposite the Triangle.

In 2004 Mid-Sussex District Council announced the Burgess Hill Master Plan, a scheme arranged with Thornfield Properties plc to massively redevelop Burgess Hill Town Centre. The Master Plan was part of a larger scheme that would have seen the redevelopment of Haywards Heath and East Grinstead town centres.

The plan would result in the complete reconstruction of most of the town centre, and the redevelopment of the Victorian era train station. However early in 2010 Thornfield Properties was reported to be in financial difficulties and ultimately the scheme did not move forward. Many of the proposed changes were included by New River Retail in their redevelopment plans for the town centre.

As well as the aforementioned developments, there have been two more housing estates built in the town – one in the town&#x27;s north east, and the other in the area known as Folders Meadow in the east.

Some of the areas currently being developed are the old Keymer Tileworks and around the south east off Folders Lane. Almost 1,000 houses will be built on these sites over the next few years.

===Future of the town===
Mid Sussex District Council put forward its master plan for the development of the town in 2006. The town approved its Neighbourhood Plan in 2015. With the proposed housing quota for the area high, it is expected to grow further in the 21st century, and new housing will be created in the town centre in the form of flats as a result of the redevelopment plans put forward by New River Retail and for which planning has been approved. Town centre development includes the redevelopment of the Martlets Shopping Centre to add a ten-screen cinema complex, hotel, new shops and parking. The gasometer in Leylands Road has been removed and replaced with a Lidl supermarket.

The town is set for the development of 3,500 new houses as part of the Northern Arc development. Three schools as well as community facilities will be included and the planning of the development is at an advanced stage with the county, district and town councils working together to finalise this development, which is being promoted by the government&#x27;s housing agency Homes England. In addition a science park and industrial park are planned along the A2300.

==Governance==
Burgess Hill is in the constituency of Mid Sussex. The Member of Parliament representing Mid Sussex is currently Mims Davies, elected in the 2019 General Election. Davies succeeded Sir Nicholas Soames, who was first elected during the May 1997 election. It was in the historic county of Sussex, and in 1974 swapped from the administrative county of East Sussex to the shire county of West Sussex, under the Local Government Act 1972.

A small residential area in the northeast of the town, as well as land which may be developed for housing in the future, lie on the East Sussex side of the county boundary, which otherwise runs beyond the eastern edge of the urban area. Both Mid Sussex District Council and Lewes District Council, under whose control this area falls, have raised concerns that planning decisions made at a regional level do not take it into account properly.

===Town Council===
Following the enactment of the West Sussex (Electoral Changes) Order 2016, Burgess Hill is divided into ten different wards; the most of any settlement in Mid Sussex. These wards (with numbers of councillors representing each denoted in parentheses) are Dunstall (1), Gatehouse (1), Franklands (3), Hammonds (1), Leylands (3), Meeds (2), Norman (1), St Johns (1), St Andrews (3) and Victoria (2). A total of eighteen councillors represent the town of Burgess Hill and its surroundings. As of May 2019, a majority of eleven councillors are representatives of the Liberal Democrat Party. They are followed by four councillors from the Green Party. The Leader of the Town Council is Councillor Robert Eggleston and the Town Mayor is Councillor Roger Cartwright.

===District Council===
From each of the six wards, two councillors are elected to represent their ward in the District Council. 7 are Liberal Democrat, 2 are Green, 2 are Conservative and 1 sits as an independent, The representatives for Burgess Hill residents whose homes lie within the Lewes district are Conservative.

===County Council===
Burgess Hill is split into three electoral divisions that send representatives to West Sussex County Council; Burgess Hill North and Burgess Hill East, and Hassocks &amp; Burgess Hill South, which covers the villages of Clayton, Hassocks and Keymer as well as the Victoria town council ward of Burgess Hill. Three councillors in total were elected to represent the three divisions in the West Sussex county council, all of whom are Conservatives. The part of Burgess Hill in East Sussex, which lies in the Chailey electoral division, is also represented by a Conservative at the county level.

==Geography==
Burgess Hill is situated in the Sussex Weald, north of Brighton, and about south of Haywards Heath. Lewes, in East Sussex, is southeast of Burgess Hill, and the larger town of Horsham is to the northwest. Crawley, a major settlement, is to the north, and Gatwick Airport is in the same direction.

The amenities and shopping services in Burgess Hill are also well used by the surrounding villages. The larger villages of Hassocks and Hurstpierpoint are 5 to 10 minutes&#x27; drive away from the town centre, to the south and southwest respectively.

Burgess Hill is home to the offices of many national and international companies, many based at one of the four business parks in and around the town, organised by the Burgess Hill Business Parks Association. Altogether the Business Parks Association, representing about 200 companies, employs approximately 8000 people, with a combined yearly turnover of 2 billion pounds. Victoria Business Park is the larger of the two parks in the town, to the south west, with the smaller Sheddingdean Business Park to the north. The town&#x27;s residents may also commute to Ditchling Common Industrial Estate, another small business park just over the county border, or the Bolney Business Park, located off the A2300 between Burgess Hill and Hickstead. Both of these are also associated with the aforementioned organisation.

Filofax has its UK headquarters in the town, Technetix has its global headquarters in the town, and Roche&#x27;s offices in Burgess Hill are the UK diagnostics headquarters. American Express, CAE, Honeywell, Porsche and Rockwell Collins also all have offices in the town. Almost half of those employed in Burgess Hill&#x27;s are residents of the town. Many residents commute to nearby towns such as Horsham, Lewes or Haywards Heath, where 11% of Burgess Hill&#x27;s population work, or larger employment centres like Crawley and Gatwick (11%), London (8%) or Brighton and Hove (7%). Similarly, people from surrounding villages and towns commute into Burgess Hill, particularly Brighton and Hove, where 14% of Burgess Hill&#x27;s workers come from, Haywards Heath (5%) and Hassocks (3%).

The town has two shopping centres, the Market Place and the Martlets as well as shops in Church Road, Church Walk, Cyprus Road, Junction Road, Keymer Road, London Road, Lower Church Road, Mill Road, and Station Road. There are several local commercial districts around the town, at Maple Drive, World&#x27;s End, Weald Road and Sussex Way.

== Historic buildings ==

Hammonds Place, to the west of London Road as it leaves the town to the south, is a handsome Elizabethan residence which was substantially re-built by the Michelbourne family in 1565, the date engraved on its porch. Part of a structure dating from about 1500 was retained with the house. Grove Farm House, just south of Station Road, can be dated to about 1600 and was built about the same time as Farthings in Keymer Road.

Chapel Farm House and Walnut Tree Cottages on Fairplace Hill are on medieval sites and the present buildings date from the late Tudor period, as do Pollards Farm and Freckborough Manor House on the eastern boundary of the town.

High Chimneys in Keymer Road is a handsome farmhouse once called Woodwards, Fowles Farm, a 17th-century dwelling is now called Old Timbers and West End Farm is now the Woolpack Pub. They were all built, or, more correctly, rebuilt, in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The farm from which the town derives its name, referred to as Burgeshill Land in the 16th century, is now the site of the Burgess Hill Academy and the Chanctonbury Estate. The farmhouse itself is long demolished.

Almost all the Victorian detached houses and workmen&#x27;s terraced cottages built in the second half of the nineteenth century (when the town was renowned as a health resort) have survived.

==Transport==
Road: In 1770 the road from Cuckfield to Brighton across St John&#x27;s Common was turnpiked. The A23 is the London-Brighton Trunk road and runs to the west of the town and is largely a high quality dual carriageway. The A23 is connected to Burgess Hill via the A2300 which was built as a single carriageway road in the 1990s, and widened in 2021 to a dual carriageway. The A273 runs along the former turnpike connecting to Pyecombe on the A23 to the south and Haywards Heath on the A272 to the North, it follows the course of Jane Murray Way, directing traffic around the town centre. The A272 road runs north of Burgess Hill, from Winchester to near Uckfield. The B2112 runs east of Burgess Hill, going north–south, and both the B2036 and the B2113 pass through the town heading north–south and west–east respectively.

Bus services: Compass Travel operate a number of bus services across Burgess Hill, and to surrounding towns and villages. Compass runs the current town service, the 35A &amp; 35C (Clockwise and Anti-Clockwise) They also operate other services, serving other towns and villages, including service 33 which runs from Hurstpierpoint to Haywards Heath via Burgess Hill, the 100 which runs to Horsham via Henfield, Steyning, Storrington, Pulborough, Billingshurst and Slinfold before arriving into Horsham. They also run the 167 and 168 &quot;Village Rider&quot; services, running only a couple of times a week in some cases, serving Hassocks, Ditchling, and Plumtpton, with the 167 continuing to Lewes and the 168 returning to Burgess Hill in a loop.

Metrobus operate three services in Burgess, with the 270, 271 and 272 all heading to Brighton southbound, with the 270 running to Churchill Square and the 271 and 272 running to the Royal Sussex County Hospital. Northbound, the 270 runs through Haywards Heath, Lindfield, Horsted Keynes and Danehilll before arriving at East Grinstead Station. This service connects to the Bluebell Railway. The 271 and 272 both run to Crawley, the 271 via Haywards Heath, Cuckfield, Staplefield and Handcross, while the 272 runs via Haywards Heath, Lindfield, Ardingly and Turners Hill.

Railway: The opening of the London to Brighton railway in 1841 triggered a further expansion of the town, although Burgess Hill railway station was for many years a request stop and not a regular station. In 1877 the present station replaced the original one; some of the former buildings remain, however. Wivelsfield railway station serves the north end of Burgess Hill and was opened in 1886. Thameslink and Southern provide regular train services towards London and Brighton from both Burgess Hill stations. In addition, from Burgess Hill, one can travel on the branch of the West Coastway Line to , and Portsmouth, and from Wivelsfield, one can travel on a branch of the East Coastway Line towards .

<text>A reverse hierarchy (or inverted pyramid) is a conceptual organizational structure that attempts to &quot;invert&quot; or otherwise &quot;reverse&quot; the classical pyramid of hierarchical organizations.

In the proposed structure, key decisions are made by the employees in direct contact with customers, while progressively senior management positions provide support and help to the customer-facing employees.

==History and examples==
The term &quot;invert the pyramid&quot; is attributed to Jan Carlzon, who transformed SAS airlines by giving front line employees authority to make decisions on the spot. The creation of the reverse hierarchy has been attributed to the Nordstrom retail organization. Other notable adopters of this structure include the United Parcel Service and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

<text>Suzy Eddie Izzard ( ; born Edward John Izzard, 7 February 1962, often known professionally as Eddie Izzard), is a British stand-up comedian, actor and activist. Her comedic style takes the form of what appears to the audience as rambling whimsical monologues and self-referential pantomime.

Izzard&#x27;s stand-up comedy tours have included &quot;Live at the Ambassadors&quot; (1993), &quot;Definite Article&quot; (1996), &quot;Glorious&quot; (1997), &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; (1998), &quot;Circle&quot; (2000), &quot;Stripped&quot; (2009), &quot;Force Majeure&quot; (2013) and &quot;Wunderbar&quot; (2022). She starred in the television series &quot;The Riches&quot; (2007–2008) and has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007), &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008), &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot; (2015) and &quot;Six Minutes to Midnight&quot; (2020). Izzard has also worked as a voice actor on films such as &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (2004), &quot;The Wild&quot; (2006), &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017) and the Netflix original series &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; (2019). Among various accolades, she won two Primetime Emmys for &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; and was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway performance in &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;.

In 2009, Izzard completed 43 marathons in 51 days for Sport Relief, despite having no history of long-distance running. In 2016, she ran 27 marathons in 27 days in South Africa in honour of Nelson Mandela, raising £1.35 million. In addition to her native English, she has performed stand-up in Arabic, French, German, Russian and Spanish, and is an active supporter of Europeanism and the European Union.

A dedicated Labour Party activist, Izzard twice ran unsuccessfully for the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee and then joined as the most successful initially non-elected person after Christine Shawcroft resigned in March 2018. In 2022 and 2023, Izzard attempted to become the party&#x27;s prospective parliamentary candidate (for Sheffield Central and Brighton Pavilion respectively); she was not selected in the members&#x27; ballots.

==Early life and education==
Edward John Izzard was born in Aden (then in Aden Colony and now in Yemen) on 7 February 1962, to English parents Dorothy Ella Izzard (1927–1968) and Harold John Michael Izzard (1928–2018). Their surname is of French Huguenot origin. Dorothy was a midwife and nurse, while Harold was an accountant who was working in Aden for British Petroleum at the time of Edward&#x27;s birth. A brother, Mark, was born two years earlier.

When Izzard was a year old, the family moved to Northern Ireland and settled in Bangor, where they lived until Izzard was five. The family then moved to Wales, where they lived in Skewen.

Izzard was six when her mother died of cancer. The siblings built a model railway to occupy their time while their mother was ill, which was later donated to Bexhill Museum in 2016. Following the death, Izzard attended the private St John&#x27;s School in Newton, St Bede&#x27;s Prep School in Eastbourne, and Eastbourne College. She has said that she knew she was transgender at the age of four, after watching a boy being forced to wear a dress by his sisters, and knew she wanted to be an actor at the age of seven.

She studied drama at the University of Sheffield.

==Career==
===Comedy===

Izzard began to toy with comedy while at university with her friend Rob Ballard. The two took their act to the streets, often in the Covent Garden district of London. After splitting with Ballard, Izzard spent a great deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. She says that she developed her comedic voice by talking to the audience while doing solo escape acts. She then moved her act to the stand-up comedy venues of Britain, performing her routine for the first time at the Banana Cabaret in London&#x27;s Balham area.

In 1987, Izzard&#x27;s first stage appearance was at the Comedy Store in London. She refined her comedy material throughout the 1980s and began earning recognition through improvisation in the early 1990s, in part at her own club, Raging Bull in Soho. Her breakthrough came in 1991 after she performed her &quot;raised by wolves&quot; routine on the televised &quot;Hysteria 3&quot; AIDS benefit.

In 2000, for the comedy special &quot;Dress to Kill&quot;, Izzard won two Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program and Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program, while the special was nominated for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special.

Izzard is fluent in French and has performed stand-up shows in the language; since 2014, she has also started to perform in Arabic, German, Russian and Spanish, languages that she did not previously speak.

===Acting===
In 1994, Izzard&#x27;s West End drama debut as the lead in the world premiere of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; with Lindsay Duncan, in the production at London&#x27;s Comedy Theatre. The success of that role led to a second starring role, in David Beaird&#x27;s black comedy &quot;900 Oneonta&quot;. In 1995, she portrayed the title character in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;.

In 1998, Izzard appeared briefly on stage with Monty Python in &quot;The American Film Institute&#x27;s Tribute to Monty Python&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot;). As part of an inside joke, she walked on stage with the five surviving Pythons and was summarily escorted off by Eric Idle and Michael Palin when attempting to participate in a discussion about how the group got together. In July 2014, she appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; as the special guest in their &quot;Blackmail&quot; sketch.
Izzard portrayed comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1999 production of Julian Barry&#x27;s 1971 play &quot;Lenny&quot;. In 2001, she replaced Clive Owen in Peter Nichols&#x27; 1967 play &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; at the Comedy Theatre. Izzard and Victoria Hamilton repeated their lead roles when the show was brought to Broadway in 2003 in the Roundabout Theatre Company production. The revival received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of a Play, Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress for its stars Izzard and Hamilton in their Broadway debuts, and Best Direction for Laurence Boswell. In June 2010, she replaced James Spader in the role of Jack Lawson in David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;Race&quot; on Broadway.

Izzard has appeared in numerous films, starting with &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; in 1996, and has appeared as several real-life individuals, including Charlie Chaplin in &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;, actor Gustav von Wangenheim in &quot;Shadow of the Vampire,&quot; General Erich Fellgiebel in &quot;Valkyrie&quot; and wartime pioneer of radar Robert Watson-Watt in the BBC drama film &quot;Castles in the Sky&quot;. Other roles have included Mr Kite in &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, Lussurioso in &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot; and criminal expert Roman Nagel in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot;. Her voice work has included the titular &quot;It&quot; in &quot;Five Children and It&quot;, Nigel in &quot;The Wild&quot; and the mouse warrior Reepicheep in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;. Izzard declined to reprise the role as Reepicheep, a role understudied by Simon Pegg in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. Izzard has stated that she felt she learned to act while working on the film &quot;Circus&quot;.

In 2009, Izzard was the subject of Sarah Townsend&#x27;s documentary &quot;Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story&quot;, which addresses BBC&#x27;s Watchdog reporting of &quot;recycling material from an old tour&quot;.

Izzard appeared in the 2009 BBC science fiction miniseries &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, based on the 1951 novel, alongside Jason Priestley, Vanessa Redgrave, Joely Richardson, Dougray Scott and Brian Cox. She played Dr. Hatteras, a sceptical psychology professor, in the Showtime series &quot;United States of Tara&quot; and appeared in six episodes of the 2013–15 American psychological horror television series &quot;Hannibal&quot; as Dr. Abel Gideon. In 2021, she appeared in the television series &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot; based on Dan Brown&#x27;s 2009 novel of the same name.

At the London 2012 Paralympic Games, Izzard presented the medals to the athletes who had won the 800m T54 race, including gold medalist David Weir.

She has appeared on a number of episodes of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and as a guest on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. In 2017, she read excerpts from her autobiography &quot;Believe Me&quot; for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot;.

From 25 January to 3 March 2024, Izzard performed a one-person version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, adapted by her brother Mark and directed by Selina Cadell, at the Greenwich House Theater in New York. The run was extended three times. The show transferred to Riverside Studios, London, with previews from 23 May 2024.

==Charity work==
On 27 July 2009, with only five weeks&#x27; training and no significant prior running experience, Izzard began seven weeks of back-to-back marathon runs (with Sundays off) across the UK to raise money for Sport Relief. She ran from London to Cardiff to Belfast to Edinburgh and back to London, carrying the flag of the country—England, Scotland, or Wales—in which she was running. In Northern Ireland, she carried a self-designed green flag bearing a white dove. The blog &quot;Eddie Iz Running&quot; documented the 43 marathons in 51 days, covering at least 27 miles per day (totalling more than 1,100 miles), ending on 15 September 2009. Izzard received a special award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2009 for these achievements. In March 2010, she took part in the Sport Relief Mile event.

On 16 February 2016, the BBC announced that Izzard would attempt to run 27 marathons in 27 days through South Africa for Sport Relief. The significance of the number 27 came from the number of years Nelson Mandela was held in prison. In total, she would aim to run more than 700 miles in temperatures of up to 40 °C. Izzard had attempted such a project in South Africa in 2012, but withdrew due to health concerns. She completed the first marathon on 23 February 2016, completing the marathon challenge on 20 March 2016 at the statue of Mandela in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Because she had spent a day in hospital, she had to run two consecutive marathons on this last day. She raised more than £1.35M for Sport Relief. A BBC documentary detailing the feat was broadcast on 28 March.

On 8 December 2020, Izzard announced that she would attempt to run 31 marathons and perform 31 stand-up gigs, in the 31 days of January 2021 to raise money for a range of charities including Fareshare, Walking With The Wounded, Care International, United to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases and Covenant House. The series of marathons raised in excess of £275,000.

==Activism==
===Political views===

Izzard is a vocal supporter of Europeanism and European integration, and has campaigned in support of the European Union. In May 2005, she appeared on the BBC&#x27;s political debate show &quot;Question Time&quot;, describing herself as a &quot;British-European&quot;, comparing this with other cultural identities such as &quot;African-American&quot;. As part of her campaigning, Izzard was one of the first people to spend a euro in London. This pan-European approach has influenced her work, regularly performing in French and occasionally in German. On a June 2017 episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, she claimed to be working in English, French, German and Spanish.

Izzard campaigned in favour of replacing first-past-the-post with the alternative vote as a system for electing MPs in a 2011 referendum and is a supporter of the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform. She is also a proponent of British republicanism, believing that the UK should have a democratically elected head of state instead of a monarchy. She has stated that she is a social democrat, but not a socialist. During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Izzard led a campaign encouraging Scottish people not to vote for independence and said the rest of the UK would feel a &quot;deep sense of loss&quot; if Scotland were to leave.

Izzard campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the departments of Drama and Languages, Linguistics and Translation at the University of East Anglia, although the department of Drama was later reprieved.

===Labour Party===

Izzard joined the Labour Party in 1995 and in 1998 was listed as one of the largest private donors to the party. In 2008, she donated nearly £10,000 to it. She appeared in party political broadcasts for the Labour Party in the run-up to the 2005 general election and 2009 European election, as well as a 2010 election video entitled &quot;Brilliant Britain&quot;. During the 2015 general election, she attended a rally with fellow comedian Ben Elton and actor Sally Lindsay. Expressing support for Labour in the 2017 general election, she said that the then-leader of the party Jeremy Corbyn &quot;believes in what he says&quot;.

At various times, Izzard said she would run for Mayor of London in 2020. When asked on the comedy panel show &quot;The Last Leg&quot; why she would be elected, Izzard replied, &quot;Boris Johnson.&quot; However, she was not a candidate for the delayed 2021 London mayoral election. Izzard unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 2016 and 2018. After Christine Shawcroft resigned in March 2018, Izzard replaced her as the next runner-up, but failed to secure re-election that summer.

On 25 August 2022, Izzard stated in an interview on BBC Radio Sheffield that she would like to ask the local Constituency Labour Party to stand in Sheffield Central, replacing the incumbent MP Paul Blomfield, who is standing down at the 2024 election. Local reaction, according to the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; newspaper, was mixed. She launched her election campaign on 11 October. On 5 December, it was reported that a local Sheffield City councillor had been selected as the party&#x27;s candidate for the safe seat, with Izzard coming second in the members&#x27; vote.

In August 2023, Izzard announced her campaign to become the Labour candidate for Brighton Pavilion at the next general election, following the decision of the incumbent Green MP Caroline Lucas not to recontest the seat. On 17 December 2023, it was announced that Izzard had not been selected as a Labour candidate at the next general election and that Tom Gray would be contesting Brighton Pavilion on behalf of the Labour Party instead.

==Comedic style==
Izzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps between topics, saying in a 2004 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;it&#x27;s the oral tradition [...] human beings have been doing it for thousands of years&quot;. Her bent towards the surreal went so far as to produce a sitcom called &quot;Cows&quot; in 1997 for Channel 4, a live-action comedy with actors dressed in cow suits. She has cited Monty Python as her biggest influence, and Python member John Cleese once referred to her as &quot;the lost Python&quot;.

==Personal life==
Izzard identifies as genderfluid and calls herself &quot;somewhat boy-ish and somewhat girl-ish&quot;. She uses the word &quot;transgender&quot; as an umbrella term. When asked in 2019 what pronouns she preferred, Izzard responded, &quot;either &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she and explained, &quot;If I am in boy mode, then &#x27;he&#x27;, or girl mode, &#x27;she&#x27;&quot;. In 2020, she requested she/her pronouns for an appearance on the TV show &quot;Portrait Artist of the Year&quot; and said she wants &quot;to be based in girl mode from now on&quot;. In March 2023, she announced that she would begin using the name Suzy in addition to Eddie, saying that she is &quot;going to be Suzy Eddie Izzard&quot;. Explaining that she had wanted to use the name Suzy since she was 10 years old, she added that people &quot;can choose&quot; which name they want to use to refer to her, and that she would keep using Eddie Izzard as her public name since it is more widely recognised.

In the past, Izzard identified as a transvestite and has also called herself &quot;a lesbian trapped in a man&#x27;s body&quot; and &quot;a complete boy plus half girl&quot;. According to her memoir &quot;Believe Me&quot;, she first cross-dressed in public at the age of 23 with the help of a lesbian friend, an experience which ended in a verbal confrontation with three 13-year-old girls who had followed Izzard home from a public toilet.

She started to publicly identify as transvestite in venues such as the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992. She states that the way she dresses is neither part of her performance, nor a sexual fetish: &quot;I don&#x27;t call it drag; I don&#x27;t even call it cross-dressing. It&#x27;s just wearing a dress. It&#x27;s not about artifice. It&#x27;s about me just expressing myself.&quot; She remarks in &quot;Unrepeatable&quot;, &quot;Women wear what they want and so do I.&quot; She has expressed a personal conviction that being transgender is caused by genetics and that, someday, this will be scientifically proven. In preparation for that day, she has had her own genome sequenced.

Izzard keeps her romantic life private, citing the wishes of her companions not wanting to become content for her show. She once dated Irish singer Sarah Townsend, whom Izzard first met while running a venue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1989. Townsend later created the documentary &quot;Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story&quot;.

Izzard is an atheist. During the 2008 &quot;Stripped&quot; tour, she said, &quot;I was warming the material up in New York, where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didn&#x27;t believe in God at all. I just didn&#x27;t think there was anyone upstairs.&quot; She has since described herself as a spiritual atheist, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in the guy upstairs, I believe in us.&quot;

Izzard supports Crystal Palace and became an associate director at the club on 16 July 2012. She is also a train modeller.

==Honours==
In 2003, Izzard received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, for her work promoting &quot;modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles&quot;, and for having &quot;transcended national barriers&quot; with humour. She has also received honorary doctorates from the University of Sunderland in 2012, York St John University in 2018, and the University of Sheffield in 2006, where she had spent a year on an Accounting and Financial Management course in the early 1980s and established the now-defunct Alternative Productions Society in the Union of Students with the aim of promoting fringe-based arts. She was elected Honorary President of Sheffield&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union in 2010.

Izzard&#x27;s website won the Yahoo People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2004 and a Webby Award in 2005.

In 2007, Izzard was listed as number 3 of the 100 Greatest British National Comedians (behind Peter Kay at number 2 and Billy Connolly at number 1) as part of British television station Channel 4&#x27;s ongoing &quot;100 Greatest ...&quot; series, and was ranked 5th in 2010.

In 2013, Izzard received the 6th Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, which is presented at Harvard University each year by the Humanist Community at Harvard, the American Humanist Association and the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics.

In 2015, Izzard was chosen by readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as their 2014 public language champion. The award was announced at the Guardian and British Academy 2014 Schools Language Awards as part of the annual Language Festival.

<text>The Sudan Peace Act () is a United States federal law sponsored by Thomas Tancredo condemning Sudan for genocide. President George W. Bush signed the Act into law on October 21, 2002.

The Act was passed to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the Second Sudanese Civil War, and condemns violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict; the government&#x27;s human rights record; the slave trade; government use of militia and other forces to support slaving, including enslavement and slave trading; and aerial bombardment of civilian targets.

It authorized the U.S. Government to spend $100 million in the years 2003, 2004, and 2005 to assist the population in areas of Sudan outside Sudanese government control.

The U.S. president must certify within 6 months of enactment, and each 6 months thereafter, that the Sudan Government and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement are negotiating in good faith and that negotiations should continue. If the Sudanese government did not do so or if it interfered with humanitarian efforts, the Act authorized the President of the U.S. to seek a UN Security Council resolution for an arms embargo and to actively seek other financial and diplomatic methods to influence the conduct of the Sudanese Government. Various members of the U.S. Cabinet must report on a regular basis about any measures that U.S. federal departments takes to make the Sudanese Government comply with the measures in the Act.

The Act stated that the U.S. president should seek to end Sudanese veto power over and manipulation of United Nations humanitarian relief efforts carried out through Operation Lifeline Sudan, and that the U.S. administration should make contingency plans for relief through other channels.

The Act requires that the president should collect information about incidents which may constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes, and other violations of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict. The Secretary of State must report every six months on the steps taken to collect information and on the information collected including any findings or determinations made by the State Department.

The first reference to Bexhill, or Bexelei as it was originally called, was in a charter granted by King Offa of Mercia in 772 AD. It is recorded that Offa had &quot;defeated the men of Hastings&quot; in 771 AD.

At this time, the term Hastings would have referred to this whole area rather than the town itself as it does today. In the charter, Offa established a church and religious community in Bexhill.

During the Norman Conquest of 1066, it appears that Bexhill was largely destroyed. The Domesday survey of 1086 records that the manor was worth £20 before the conquest, was &quot;waste&quot; in 1066 and was worth £18 10s in 1086. King William I used the lands he had conquered to reward his knights and gave Bexhill manor to Robert, Count of Eu, with most of the Hastings area. Robert&#x27;s grandson, John, Count of Eu, gave back the manor to the bishops of Chichester in 1148 and it is probable that the first manor house was built by the bishops at this time. The later manor house, the ruins of which can still be seen at the Manor Gardens in Bexhill Old Town, was built about 1250, probably on the instructions of St. Richard, Bishop of Chichester. St Richard&#x27;s Catholic College, the local Catholic school, was duly for said Bishop. The Manor House was the easternmost residence owned by the bishops and would have been used as a place to stay while travelling around or through the eastern part of their diocese. There were often disputes between the Bishops of Chichester and the Abbots of Battle Abbey, usually about land ownership in this area. In 1276 a large portion of Bexhill was made into a park for hunting and in 1447 Bishop Adam de Moleyns was given permission to fortify the Manor House.

In 1561, Queen Elizabeth I took possession of Bexhill Manor and three years later she gave it to Sir Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset. The Earls, later Dukes, of Dorset owned Bexhill until the mid-19th century. Their main residences were Buckhurst Place in Sussex and Knole House in Kent.

In 1804, soldiers of the King&#x27;s German Legion were stationed in barracks at Bexhill. These troops were Hanoverians who had escaped when their country was overrun by Napoleon&#x27;s French Army. As King George III was also the Elector of Hanover, he welcomed them and they fought as part of the British Army. At about this time, defensive Martello towers were built along the south east coast, some near Bexhill, in order to repel any French invasion. In 1814 the soldiers of the King&#x27;s German Legion left Bexhill, eventually playing an important part in the Battle of Waterloo the following year. The German troops had been here to protect Bexhill from the French. However, many of the local people were actively trading with the enemy by way of smuggling. The best known of the local smugglers were in the Little Common Gang and the most famous incident was the infamous Battle of Sidley Green in 1828.

In 1813, Elizabeth Sackville married the 5th Earl De La Warr, and when the male line of the Dukes of Dorset died out in 1865 she and her husband inherited Bexhill.

It was the 7th Earl De La Warr who decided to transform the small rural village of Bexhill into an exclusive seaside resort. He contracted the builder, John Webb, to construct the first sea wall and to lay out De La Warr Parade. Webb, in part payment for his work, was given all the land extending from Sea Road to the Polegrove, south of the railway line.
Opened in 1890, the luxurious Sackville Hotel was built for the 7th Earl De La Warr and originally included a house for the use of his family. In 1891 Viscount Cantelupe, his eldest surviving son, married Muriel Brassey, the daughter of Sir Thomas and the late Annie, Lady Brassey of Normanhurst Court near Bexhill. The Manor House was fully refurbished so that Lord and Lady Cantelupe could live in style as Lord and Lady of the Manor. Finally, the 7th Earl De La Warr transferred control of his Bexhill estate to Viscount Cantelupe when the 7th Earl De La Warr died in 1896.

Viscount Cantelupe became the 8th Earl De La Warr. At this time he organised the building on the sea front of the Kursaal, a pavilion for refined entertainment and relaxation. He also had a bicycle track made, with a cycle chalet, at the eastern end of De La Warr Parade. These amenities were provided to promote the new resort. Meanwhile, many independent schools were being attracted to the expanding town due to its health-giving reputation.
The railway came through Bexhill in 1846, the first railway station being a small country halt situated roughly where Sainsbury&#x27;s car park is today. This was some distance from the village on the hill. A new station, north of Devonshire Square, was opened in 1891 to serve the growing resort. In 1902 the current railway station was opened and a Bexhill West Station was built for the newly built Crowhurst Branch Line.

1902 was the year that Bexhill became an Incorporated Borough. This was the first Royal Charter granted by Edward VII. Bexhill was the last town in Sussex to be incorporated and it was the first time a Royal Charter was delivered by motorcar. To celebrate the town&#x27;s newfound status and to promote the resort, the 8th Earl De La Warr organised the country&#x27;s first ever motorcar races along De La Warr Parade in May 1902. The town was scandalised at this time by the divorce of Earl De La Warr.

Muriel had brought the action on the grounds of adultery and abandonment. She was granted a divorce and given custody of their three children. Muriel, with her children, Myra, Avice and Herbrand, went back to live with Earl Brassey at Normanhurst Court. The 8th Earl De La Warr remarried but was again divorced for adultery. He also suffered recurrent and well-publicised financial difficulties.
At the start of the First World War in 1914 the Earl bought a Royal Naval commission. He died of fever at Messina in 1915.

Herbrand Edward Dundonald Brassey Sackville became the 9th Earl De La Warr. He is best known for championing the construction of the De La Warr Pavilion, which was built and opened in 1935. The 9th Earl also became Bexhill&#x27;s first socialist mayor. He died in 1976.

The Second World War caused the evacuation of the schools and substantial bomb-damage to the town. Many schools returned to Bexhill after the war but there was a steady decline in the number of independent schools in the town. The break-up of the British Empire and in particular the Independence of India in 1947 hastened the process. Most of the schools were boarding and catered largely for the children of the armed forces overseas and of the colonial administration. Although the number of schools decreased, many of the parents and former pupils had fond memories of the town and later retired to Bexhill.

== Governance ==

Due to local governance reform in 1974, Bexhill became part of Rother District Council, thereby losing its Town Council. In its place, Bexhill became a Charter Trustees town, represented by the Bexhill councillors of Rother District Council. A quarterly forum is held to provide a voice to the community at a local level.

Bexhill Town Hall is the seat of Rother District Council, for which elections are held every four years. In total, thirty-eight Councillors are elected for Rother, eighteen coming from Bexhill&#x27;s nine wards.

In 2017, local campaigners initiated a public consultation on the issue of regaining a town council for Bexhill. 9,227 people participated in the consultation, of whom 93.5% expressed a preference for a town council. The consultation was non-binding and, at a meeting in December 2017, Rother District Councillors voted against the formation of such a council by 18 to 13. The meeting was fully attended. Those who voted against the consultation&#x27;s outcome mostly expressed concerns about the added burden to local taxpayers that a town council would bring. On 1 April 2021 a civil parish was formed.

At the local elections in May 2013, the Conservatives had a nett loss of fifteen seats, leaving the Rother district council composed of fourteen Conservatives, thirteen Independents, seven Liberal Democrats, one Green, and three Labour councillors. The changes have meant that the issue of a town council for Bexhill has been reopened. The Independents, supported by Labour and others, assented to a motion that would have a Bexhill Town Council up and running by 2021.

Above Rother, the next level of government is the East Sussex County Council, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Highways, Civil Registration, Trading Standards, and Transport. Elections to the County Council are also held every four years. For these elections, Bexhill is divided into four divisions: North, East, South and West.

The latest County Council election was held on 4 May 2017. Following the result of a by-election in 2019, Bexhill has two Independent and two Conservative county councillors.

The Parliamentary Constituency of Bexhill and Battle, created in 1983, includes the nearby town of Battle. Its Member of Parliament was Charles Wardle until the 2001 election, when he left the Conservatives and was replaced by Gregory Barker. He was the Member until the 2015 General Election, when he was replaced by Huw Merriman, re-elected in 2019. However, Huw Merriman stood down for the 2024 United Kingdom general election, where he was replaced by the Conservative Kieran Mullan.

At the European level, Bexhill was part of the South-East England constituency, which had ten seats in the European Parliament. The 2019 election returned four Brexit Party MEPs, three Liberal Democrat, one Labour, one Conservative and one Green. They ceased to hold office when the country left the EU.

As with most other areas along the South Coast, in the 2016 referendum the Rother district voted heavily to leave the EU. Leave won in Rother by a margin of 58.5% to 41.5%.

==Landmarks==

The most notable landmark in Bexhill-on-Sea is the De La Warr Pavilion. The De La Warr Pavilion is a Grade I listed building, located on the seafront at Bexhill-on-Sea. The seafront building was the result of an architectural competition initiated by Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, after whom the building was named.
The 9th Earl, a committed socialist and Mayor of Bexhill, persuaded Bexhill council to develop the site as a public building. The competition was announced in &quot;The Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; in February 1934, with a programme that specified an entertainment hall to seat at least 1500 people; a 200-seat restaurant; a reading room; and a lounge. Initially, the budget for the project was limited to £50,000, although this was later raised to £80,000. Run by the Royal Institute of British Architects, this competition attracted over 230 entrants, many of them practising in the Modernist style.
Shapes tend towards streamlined, industrially-influenced designs. The architects selected for the project, Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff, were leading figures in the Modern Movement.

The aesthetics employed in the International Style proved especially suited to the building, tending towards streamlined, industrially-influenced designs, often with expansive metal-framed windows, and eschewing traditional brick and stonework in favour of concrete and steel construction. Among the building&#x27;s most innovative features was its use of a welded steel frame construction, pioneered by structural engineer Felix Samuely. Construction of the De La Warr Pavilion began in January 1935.

The building was opened on 12 December of the same year by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth).
During World War II, the De La Warr Pavilion was used by the military. Bexhill and Sussex in general were vulnerable if the Germans decided to mount an invasion (Operation Sea Lion). Among those who served at the Pavilion during the War was Spike Milligan, later a noted comedian. The building suffered minor damage to its foundations when the Metropole hotel adjacent to the building&#x27;s western side was destroyed by German bombers.
After the War, management of the Pavilion was taken over by Bexhill Corporation (which later became Rother District Council). Changes were made to the building, many of which were inconsistent with the original design and aesthetic of the building. Lack of funds also resulted in an ongoing degradation of the building&#x27;s fabric.
In 1986, the De La Warr Pavilion was granted a Grade I listed building status, essentially protecting the building from further inappropriate alteration. 1989 saw the formation of the Pavilion Trust, a group dedicated to protecting and restoring the building.

Playwright David Hare notioned that the site be used as an art gallery as opposed to an expected privatised redevelopment. In 2002, after a long application process the De La Warr Pavilion was granted £6 Million by the Heritage Lottery Fund &amp; the Arts Council, to restore the building and turn it into a contemporary arts centre. Work began in 2004 on the De La Warr Pavilion&#x27;s regeneration and a transfer of the buildings ownership from Rother District Council to the De La Warr Pavilion Charitable Trust.
In 2005, after an extensive programme of restoration and regeneration, the De La Warr Pavilion reopened as a contemporary arts centre, encompassing one of the largest galleries on the south coast of England. A small collection of archival materials related to the De La Warr Pavilion is collected in the Serge Chermayeff Papers held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City.
The Art Deco and International Style building was designed by the architects Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff and constructed in 1935. Although sometimes claimed to be the first major Modernist public building in Britain, it was in fact preceded by some months by the Dutch-influenced Hornsey Town Hall.

A Site of Special Scientific Interest lies within the Bexhill district—High Woods. It is of biological importance because it is the only known sessile oak &quot;Quercus petraea&quot; woodland in East Sussex. Fossils are also commonly found in Bexhill. In 2009 the world&#x27;s oldest spider web was found encased in amber in the town. It was 140 million years old. In June 2011 it was reported that the world&#x27;s smallest dinosaur had been discovered at Ashdown Brickworks near the town. A single vertebra was found. Beeches Farm is a Grade II listed building.

The wreck of the &quot;VOC Amsterdam&quot;, an eighteenth century cargo ship that ran aground between Bexhill and St Leonards, can be seen at low tide.

== Economy ==
Reginald Sackville, seventh Earl De La Warr, decided to transform what was then a village on a hill around its church into an exclusive seaside resort, which he named Bexhill-on-Sea. He was instrumental in building a sea wall south of the village, and the road above it was then named De La Warr Parade. Large houses were built inland from there, and the new town began.

In 1890, the luxurious Sackville Hotel was built.

Bexhill was the location for the first motor race in the United Kingdom, in May 1902. Signs at the town&#x27;s outskirts have the text &quot;Birthplace of British Motor Racing&quot; appended below the town&#x27;s name. The Bexhill 100 Festival of Motoring, held on Bexhill&#x27;s seafront, celebrated this important milestone in motoring history from 1990 until 2002. This final festival commemorated the Centenary of the original &quot;Races&quot;. During the life of the festival, in 1999, the organisers launched the Bexhill 100 Motoring Club, so although the Festival no longer exists, the club still exists, and their committee organises each year, the Bexhill 100 Motoring Club Classic Car Show held on August bank holiday Monday in the Polegrove, Bexhill.

The De La Warr Pavilion, brainchild of the ninth Earl De La Warr, opened in 1935 as one of the earliest examples of Modern architecture in a major British public building. It closed for major restoration work in December 2003 and reopened in October 2005.

During the Second World War, Bexhill was named as a point to attack as part of Operation Sea Lion by Nazi Germany.

The town, like many other English seaside resorts, is now much more a settled community. Although there is a small entertainment area on the seafront, it now has a large retired population, like much of the south coast. Efforts are being made to increase tourism in Bexhill, including annual events such as the &#x27;Festival of the Sea&#x27; and, formerly, &#x27;Roaring Twenties Day&#x27;, each held during the summer.

The last remaining cinema was sold to the Wetherspoon pub chain on 1 December 2014.

==Transport==
Bexhill is on the A259 road which forms the coast road between Folkestone and Brighton. Plans of an A259 Bexhill and Hastings bypass have repeatedly been postponed over the past 40 years but the plans were cancelled due to environmental concerns.
A new road was approved in 2012 and completed in 2016 at a cost of £100m 

The town is served by the coastal railway line between Ashford and Brighton and has three railway stations, including Cooden Beach, Collington, and Bexhill. Regular trains run to Ashford, Brighton and London Victoria.

Bexhill is served by 13 bus routes including school routes which serve the surrounding areas like Hastings, Battle, Conquest Hospital, Eastbourne and Pevensey Bay Asda (Free bus on Wednesdays). The area with the most bus services is between Sidley and Bexhill which has the route 2 (Asda free bus), 95, 97 &amp; 98.

The railway built by the Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway (later part of the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway) arrived on 27 June 1846, although the present station was not built until 1891, when the town had become popular as a resort. A second line, this time built by the South Eastern Railway and approaching the town from the north, was a branch line from Crowhurst via an intermediate station at Sidley to a terminus at Bexhill West. The line opened on 1 June 1902 and closed on 15 June 1964. The branch was also closed temporarily between 1 January 1917 and 1 March 1919 as an economy measure during the First World War.

== Sport and leisure ==
Bexhill has three Non-League football clubs Bexhill United F.C. who play at The Polegrove Little Common F.C. who play at The Oval in Eastbourne and Sidley United F.C. who play at Little Common Recreation Ground.

Bexhill also share a Rugby Union club with Hastings, known as Hasting and Bexhill Rugby Football Club. They play at ARK William Parker Academy. Bexhill-on-Sea also has a sports and social club - Bexhill Amateur Athletic Community Association. This club is located on Little Common Road, and also has a football club, Judo, Keepfit classes and a fully equipped gym

Bexhill is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

Bexhill-on-Sea Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1890. It closed at the time of WW2.

Bexhill is home to the Little Common Ramblers Cricket Club playing at the Recreation Ground. The &#x27;Ramblers&#x27; have 3 adult teams playing in the East Sussex Cricket League. In 2018, the Ramblers 1st XI was promoted to the Sussex County League for the first time in its history. Bexhill-on-Sea is also the home of Rother Swim Academy, offering swimming lessons to children. Founded in 1990 and family run.

Marina Court Garden officially opened on 6 July 2015 with the Bexhill Rotary Club Wheel Coin collector (Bexhill Observer). The open space on the Marina, next to the De la Warr Pavilion will provide an area to sit and relax. Rother District Council Chairman opened the Garden and President Raouf Oderuth of Bexhill Rotary Club unveiled the Coin Collector. The proceeds will fund local nominated Charities.

== Culture ==
In 2013, the BBC conducted a survey into &#x27;Englishness&#x27;. The results of this survey for the Rother area, in which Bexhill is found, revealed that 68% of people living in Rother were &#x27;proud to be English&#x27; - 11% above the national average of 57%.

Bexhill also holds the world record for the greatest number of mermaids in one area (325), a feat achieved in September 2017 at the annual &#x27;Festival of the Sea&#x27;. The town also held the record for the largest Charleston dance, which took place as part of the &#x27;Bexhill Roaring 20s&#x27; festival, formerly held every summer, though it was overtaken by Shrewsbury in 2018.

<text>The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG), or the Genocide Convention, is an international treaty that criminalizes genocide and obligates state parties to pursue the enforcement of its prohibition. It was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as a crime, and the first human rights treaty unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, on 9 December 1948, during the third session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951 and has 153 state parties .

The Genocide Convention was conceived largely in response to World War II, which saw atrocities such as the Holocaust that lacked an adequate description or legal definition. Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who had coined the term genocide in 1944 to describe Nazi policies in occupied Europe and the Armenian genocide, campaigned for its recognition as a crime under international law. Lemkin also linked colonialism with genocide, mentioning colonial genocides outside of Europe in his writings. In a 1946 resolution, the General Assembly recognized genocide as an international crime and called for the creation of a binding treaty to prevent and punish its perpetration. Subsequent discussions and negotiations among UN member states resulted in the CPPCG.

The Convention defines genocide as any of five &quot;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.&quot; These five acts include killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. Victims are targeted because of their real or perceived membership of a group, not randomly. The convention further criminalizes &quot;complicity, attempt, or incitement of its commission.&quot; Member states are prohibited from engaging in genocide and obligated to pursue the enforcement of this prohibition. All perpetrators are to be tried regardless of whether they are private individuals, public officials, or political leaders with sovereign immunity.

The CPPCG has influenced law at both the national and international level. Its definition of genocide has been adopted by international and hybrid tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court, and incorporated into the domestic law of several countries. Its provisions are widely considered to be reflective of customary law and therefore binding on all nations whether or not they are parties. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has likewise ruled that the principles underlying the Convention represent a peremptory norm against genocide that no government can derogate. The Genocide Convention authorizes the mandatory jurisdiction of the ICJ to adjudicate disputes, leading to international litigation such as the Rohingya genocide case and dispute over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Definition of genocide==
Article 2 of the Convention defines genocide as:

Article 3 defines the crimes that can be punished under the convention:

The convention was passed to outlaw actions similar to the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust.

The first draft of the Convention included political killing, but the USSR along with some other nations would not accept that actions against groups identified as holding similar political opinions or social status would constitute genocide, so these stipulations were subsequently removed in a political and diplomatic compromise.

Early drafts also included acts of cultural destruction in the concept of genocide, but these were opposed by former European colonial powers and some settler countries. Such acts, which Lemkin saw as part and parcel of the concept of genocide, have since often been discussed as cultural genocide (a term also not enshrined in international law). In June 2021, the International Criminal Court issued new guidelines for how cultural destruction, when occurring alongside other recognized acts of genocide, can potentially be corroborating evidence for the intent of the crime of genocide.

The Genocide Convention establishes five prohibited acts that, when committed with the requisite intent, amount to genocide. Genocide is not just defined as wide scale massacre-style killings that are visible and well-documented. International law recognizes a broad range of forms of violence in which the crime of genocide can be enacted.

=== Killing members of the group &quot;Article II(a)&quot; ===
While mass killing is not necessary for genocide to have been committed, it has been present in almost all recognized genocides. In certain instances, men and adolescent boys are singled out for murder in the early stages, such as in the genocide of the Yazidis by Daesh, the Ottoman Turks&#x27; attack on the Armenians, and the Burmese security forces&#x27; attacks on the Rohingya. Men and boys are typically subject to &quot;fast&quot; killings, such as by gunshot. Women and girls are more likely to die slower deaths by slashing, burning, or as a result of sexual violence. The jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), among others, shows that both the initial executions and those that quickly follow other acts of extreme violence, such as rape and torture, are recognized as falling under the first prohibited act.

A less settled discussion is whether deaths that are further removed from the initial acts of violence can be addressed under this provision of the Genocide Convention. Legal scholars have posited, for example, that deaths resulting from other genocidal acts including causing serious bodily or mental harm or the successful deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction should be considered genocidal killings.

=== Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group &quot;Article II(b)&quot; ===
This second prohibited act can encompass a wide range of non-fatal genocidal acts. The ICTR and International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) have held that rape and sexual violence may constitute the second prohibited act of genocide by causing both physical and mental harm. In its landmark Akayesu decision, the ICTR held that rapes and sexual violence resulted in &quot;physical and psychological destruction&quot;. Sexual violence is a hallmark of genocidal violence, with most genocidal campaigns explicitly or implicitly sanctioning it. It is estimated that 250,000 to 500,000 women were raped in the three months of the Rwandan genocide, many of whom were subjected to multiple rapes or gang rape. In Darfur, a systemic campaign of rape and often sexual mutilation was carried out and in Burma public mass rapes and gang rapes were inflicted on the Rohingya by Burmese security forces. Sexual slavery was documented in the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Turks and Daesh&#x27;s genocide of the Yazidi.

Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, when committed with the requisite intent, are also genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. The ICTY found that both experiencing a failed execution and watching the murder of one&#x27;s family members may constitute torture. The Syrian Commission of Inquiry (COI) also found that enslavement, removal of one&#x27;s children into indoctrination or sexual slavery, and acts of physical and sexual violence rise to the level of torture, as well. While it was subject to some debate, the ICTY and, later, the Syrian COI held that under some circumstances deportation and forcible transfer may also cause serious bodily or mental harm.

=== Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction &quot;Article II(c)&quot; ===

The third prohibited act is distinguished from the genocidal act of killing because the deaths are not immediate (or may not even come to pass), but rather create circumstances that do not support prolonged life. Due to the longer period of time before the actual destruction would be achieved, the ICTR held that courts must consider the duration of time the conditions are imposed as an element of the act. In the 19th century the United States federal government supported the extermination of bison, which Native Americans in the Great Plains relied on as a source of food. This was done for various reasons, primarily to pressure them onto reservations during times of conflict. Some genocide experts describe this as an example of genocide that involves removing the means of survival.

The ICTR provided guidance into what constitutes a violation of the third act. In Akayesu, it identified &quot;subjecting a group of people to a subsistence diet, systematic expulsion from homes and the reduction of essential medical services below minimum requirement&quot; as rising to genocide. In Kayishema and Ruzindana, it extended the list to include: &quot;lack of proper housing, clothing, hygiene and medical care or excessive work or physical exertion&quot; among the conditions. It further noted that, in addition to deprivation of necessary resources, rape could also fit within this prohibited act. In August 2023, founding chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Luis Moreno Ocampo published a report presenting evidence that Azerbaijan was committing genocide against the ethnic Armenians of Artsakh Nagorno-Karabakh under Article II(c) of the Genocide Convention by placing their historic land under a comprehensive blockade, cutting all access to food, medical supplies, electricity, gas, internet, and stopping all movement of people to and from Armenia.

=== Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group &quot;Article II(d)&quot; ===

The fourth prohibited act is aimed at preventing the protected group from regenerating through reproduction. It encompasses acts affecting reproduction and intimate relationships, such as involuntary sterilization, forced abortion, the prohibition of marriage, and long-term separation of men and women intended to prevent procreation. Rape has been found to violate the fourth prohibited act on two bases: where the rape was committed with the intent to impregnate a woman and thereby force her to carry a child of another group (in societies where group identity is determined by patrilineal identity) and where the person raped subsequently refuses to procreate as a result of the trauma. Accordingly, it can take into account both physical and mental measures imposed by the perpetrators.

=== Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group &quot;Article II(e)&quot; ===

The final prohibited act is the only prohibited act that does not lead to physical or biological destruction, but rather to destruction of the group as a cultural and social unit. It occurs when children of the protected group are transferred to the perpetrator group. Boys are typically taken into the group by changing their names to those common of the perpetrator group, converting their religion, and using them for labor or as soldiers. Girls who are transferred are not generally converted to the perpetrator group, but instead treated as chattel, as played out in both the Yazidi and Armenian genocides.

==Parties==
, there are 153 state parties to the Genocide Convention—representing the vast majority of sovereign nations—with the most recent being Zambia in April 2022; one state, the Dominican Republic, has signed but not ratified the treaty. Forty-four states have neither signed nor ratified the convention.

Despite its delegates playing a key role in drafting the convention, the United States did not become a party until 1988—a full forty years after it was opened for signature—and did so only with reservations precluding punishment of the country if it were ever accused of genocide. These were due to traditional American suspicion of any international authority that could override US law. U.S. ratification of the convention was owed in large part to campaigning by Senator William Proxmire, who addressed the Senate in support of the treaty every day it was in session between 1967 and 1986.

===Reservations===

====Immunity from prosecutions====
Several parties conditioned their ratification of the Convention on reservations that grant immunity from prosecution for genocide without the consent of the national government:
====Application to non-self-governing territories====
Several countries opposed this article, considering that the convention automatically also should apply to Non-Self-Governing Territories:
* Albania
* Belarus
* Bulgaria
* Hungary
* Mongolia
* Myanmar
* Poland
* Romania
* Russian Federation
* Ukraine

The opposition of those countries were in turn opposed by:
* Australia
* Belgium
* Brazil
* Ecuador
* China
* Netherlands
* Sri Lanka
* United Kingdom

(However, exceptionally, Australia did make such a notification at the same time as the ratification of the convention for Australia proper, 8 July 1949, with the effect that the convention did apply also to all territories under Australian control simultaneously, as the USSR &quot;et alii&quot; had demanded. The European colonial powers in general did not then make such notifications.)

== Litigation ==
===United States===

One of the first accusations of genocide submitted to the UN after the Convention entered into force concerned the treatment of Black Americans. The Civil Rights Congress drafted a 237-page petition arguing that even after 1945, the United States had been responsible for hundreds of wrongful deaths, both legal and extra-legal, as well as numerous other supposedly genocidal abuses. Leaders from the Black community and left activists William Patterson, Paul Robeson, and W. E. B. Du Bois presented this petition to the UN in December 1951. It was rejected as a misuse of the intent of the treaty. Charges under We Charge Genocide entailed the lynching of more than 10,000 African Americans with an average of more than 100 per year, with the full number being unconfirmed at the time due to unreported murder cases.

=== Yugoslavia ===
The first state and parties to be found in breach of the Genocide Convention were Serbia and Montenegro, and numerous Bosnian Serb leaders. In &quot;Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro,&quot; the International Court of Justice presented its judgment on 26 February 2007. It cleared Serbia of direct involvement in genocide during the Bosnian war. International Tribunal findings have addressed two allegations of genocidal events, including the 1992 ethnic cleansing campaign in municipalities throughout Bosnia, as well as the convictions found in regards to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 in which the tribunal found, &quot;Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide, they targeted for extinction, the 40,000 Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica ... the trial chamber refers to the crimes by their appropriate name, genocide ...&quot; However, individual convictions applicable to the 1992 ethnic cleansings have not been secured. A number of domestic courts and legislatures have found these events to have met the criteria of genocide, and the ICTY found the acts of, and intent to destroy to have been satisfied, the &quot;dolus specialis&quot; still in question and before the MICT, a UN war crimes court, but ruled that Belgrade did breach international law by failing to prevent the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, and for failing to try or transfer the persons accused of genocide to the ICTY, in order to comply with its obligations under Articles I and VI of the Genocide Convention, in particular in respect of General Ratko Mladić.

===Myanmar===

Myanmar has been accused of genocide against its Rohingya community in Rakhine State after around 800,000 Rohingya fled at gunpoint to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2016 and 2017, while their home villages were systematically burned. The International Court of Justice has given its first circular in 2018 asking Myanmar to protect its Rohingya from genocide. Myanmar&#x27;s civilian government was overthrown by the military on 1 February 2021; since the military is widely seen as the main culprit of the genocide, the coup presents a further challenge to the ICJ.

=== Russia ===
==== Russian accusations of genocide by Ukraine ====

In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, claiming that it acted, among other reasons, in order to protect Russian-speaking Ukrainians from genocide. This unfounded and false Russian charge has been widely condemned, and has been called by genocide experts accusation in a mirror, a powerful, historically recurring, form of incitement to genocide.

==== Russian atrocities in Ukraine ====

Russian forces committed numerous atrocities and war crimes in Ukraine, including all five of the potentially genocidal acts listed in the Genocide Convention. Canada, Czechia, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine have accused Russia of genocide. In April 2022 Genocide Watch issued a genocide alert for Ukraine. A May 2022 report by 35 legal and genocide experts concluded that Russia has violated the Genocide Convention by the direct and public incitement to commit genocide, and that a pattern of Russian atrocities implies the intent to destroy the Ukrainian national group, and the consequent serious risk of genocide triggers the obligation to prevent it on signatory states.

===Israel===
In December 2023 South Africa formally accused Israel of violating the Genocide Convention, filing the case &quot;South Africa v. Israel (Genocide Convention)&quot;, due to Israel&#x27;s actions during the Israel-Hamas War. In addition to starting the litigation process, South Africa also asked the International Court of Justice to demand that Israel cease their military operations in the Gaza Strip as a provisional measure.

<doc id="143992" wikidata="Q1650296" url="?curid=143992" title="Instrumental rock">
<text>Instrumental rock is rock music that emphasizes instrumental performance and features very little or no singing. Examples of instrumental music in rock can be found in practically every subgenre of the style. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as Bill Doggett Combo, The Fireballs, The Shadows, The Ventures, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Spotnicks. Surf music had many instrumental songs. Many instrumental hits had roots from the R&amp;B genre. The Allman Brothers Band feature several instrumentals. Jeff Beck also recorded two instrumental albums in the 1970s. Progressive rock and art rock performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s did many virtuosic instrumental performances.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists, including Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen and Steve Vai. The 2000s gave way to a new style of instrumental performer. For example, John Lowery (a.k.a. John 5), released a series of solo instrumental albums. The 2000s also saw the rise of instrumental music by bands that have been labeled post-rock.

== Early history ==
Instrumental rock was most popular during rock and roll&#x27;s first decade (mid-1950s to mid-1960s), before the British Invasion.

One notable early instrumental was &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; by the Bill Doggett Combo, with its slinky beat and sinuous saxophone-organ lead. Jazz musicians who scored pop hits include Earl Bostic and Arnett Cobb. Several rhythm and blues sax players had hit instrumental songs, including Big Jay McNeeley, Red Prysock, and Lee Allen, whose &quot;Walking with Mr. Lee&quot; was quite popular. There were several notable blues instrumental songs during the 1950s; Little Walter&#x27;s rollicking &quot;Juke&quot; was a #1 R&amp;B hit.

Instrumental hit songs could emphasize electronic organ (the Tornados&#x27; &quot;Telstar&quot;, Dave &quot;Baby&quot; Cortez&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Organ&quot;, Johnny &amp; the Hurricanes&#x27; &quot;Red River Rock&quot;), or the saxophone (the Champs&#x27; &quot;Tequila&quot;, Bill Black&#x27;s Combo&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, the Piltdown Men&#x27;s &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Cave&quot;), but the guitar was most prominent. Duane Eddy scored several hits (his best known probably being &quot;Rebel-&#x27;Rouser&quot;). Eddy was the first rock &amp; roll artist to release an album in stereo.

The Fireballs, featuring the distinctive guitar work of George Tomsco, began their career in the late 1950s with instrumental hits such as &quot;Torquay&quot; and &quot;Bulldog.&quot; The band pioneered the guitar/guitar/bass/drums configuration, paving the way for the Ventures, the Shadows, and the surf music scene. The Fireballs were one of a few instrumental bands that successfully transitioned into vocal music, having the biggest hit of 1963 in the US (&quot;Sugar Shack&quot;). B Bumble &amp; the Stingers gained hit &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;.

The Shadows, from the UK, had several hit singles from 1960 onwards, including &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; and &quot;Apache&quot;. The Shadows (alone and accompanying Cliff Richard) featured heavily in the UK charts until 1963 when Beatlemania arrived, combined with DJ indifference to non-vocal singles.

The Ventures&#x27; precise guitar work was a major influence on many later rock guitarists; they also helped shape surf music. The band reached chart success with songs such as &quot;Walk-Don&#x27;t Run&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. In the U.S. they greatly escalated the guitar instrumentals and use of the vibrato bar on the lead guitar.

Surf music was quite popular in the early 1960s, and was generally rather simple and melodic—one exception being Dick Dale, who gained fame for his quick playing, often influenced by the music of the Middle East, and frequently using exotic scales.

Around the time of the British Invasion, rock changed appreciably, and instrumental hits came mostly from the R&amp;B world. Notable artists include Booker T. &amp; the MG&#x27;s and saxophonist Junior Walker.

Just before the British Invasion, Lonnie Mack&#x27;s version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Memphis&quot; reached #5 on the Billboard Pop chart in June 1963. Employing both the blues scale and distortion, it ushered in the era of blues rock guitar of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The early incarnation of Fleetwood Mac with bandleader Peter Green achieved number one chart positions with the guitar-based instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; in February 1969. Previously, only three other rock guitar instrumentals had cracked Billboard&#x27;s top five: the Virtues&#x27; &quot;Guitar Boogie Shuffle&quot; in 1959, and Duane Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot; and the Ventures&#x27; &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; in 1960.

In August 1964, Checker Records released the album &quot;Two Great Guitars&quot;, recorded by rock and roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, which is one of rock music&#x27;s first recorded guitar jam sessions.

== 1970s ==
During the 70s, some musicians released instrumental records such as Dennis Coffey&#x27;s &quot;Scorpio&quot;(1971), Booker T &amp; the MGs&#x27; &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, Incredible Bong Band&#x27;s &quot;Apache&quot;, Hot Butter&#x27;s &quot;Popcorn&quot;(1972) and Rhythm Heritage &quot;Theme from S.W.A.T.&quot;(1976). The Allman Brothers Band is often not considered an instrumental rock band, but they play many instrumentals and include long instrumental passages in longer versions of their songs. A good example is the 22-minute version of Whipping Post in &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; LP. Their instrumentals, &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; and &quot;Jessica&quot; are popular, with &quot;Jessica&quot; being featured as theme for both the 1977 and 2002 formats of &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

Jeff Beck also recorded two entirely instrumental albums in the 1970s: &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;. Successful among mainstream audiences, both have strong jazz influences, the latter featuring a cover of Charles Mingus&#x27;s jazz standard &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;.

Several progressive rock and art rock performers of the 1960s and 1970s featured virtuosic instrumental performances (and occasional instrumental songs), but many of their compositions also featured vocals. Early 70s, EL&amp;P gained cover hit &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;. King Crimson gained a massive cult following in the late 1960s and 1970s with their explosive instrumental output that merged rock, jazz, classical and heavy metal styles, though their albums also included songs with vocals, Genesis also had multiple instrumental parts in their long songs, and when Peter Gabriel left the band the drummer Phil Collins suggested continuing as an instrumental act, but the other members didn&#x27;t like the idea. Alan Parsons Project had instrumentals on every album, especially on early releases. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; by Mike Oldfield, a progressive rock album released in 1973, was all instrumental (save for some brief spoken words) and is one of the best-selling instrumental albums ever, with 16 million copies sold. A portion of it was used in the soundtrack of the Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

One of the most acclaimed albums of the band Camel, 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, was entirely instrumental. Many of Pink Floyd&#x27;s early compositions were largely instrumental pieces containing structured jams fusing psychedelic, progressive and space rock. Frank Zappa was known for intermixing instrumental rock tracks with his novelty songs on his albums.

The jazz rock of the 1970s often had considerable stylistic cross-over with rock with groups such as Colosseum, Soft Machine, Nucleus, Brand X, Chicago, Chase, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears and Affinity. Surf rock&#x27;s &quot;2nd Wave&quot; began in the late 1970s with the release of Edie &amp; the Hot Rods&#x27; first single.

== 1980s ==
During the 1980s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists. Swedish virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen made a name for himself in 1984 by playing in the popular band Alcatrazz, and then by releasing his debut solo album &quot;Rising Force&quot; later that year, reaching #60 on the Billboard Charts. Joe Satriani&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Surfing With The Alien&quot; was a surprise hit, containing the popular instrumental ballad &quot;Always With Me, Always With You&quot;, and the blues boogie inflected &quot;Satch Boogie&quot; — both staples for guitarists learning their craft. Satriani released a follow-up album, &quot;Flying in a Blue Dream&quot;, two years later.

After Malmsteen left Alcatrazz, he was replaced by the extravagant Steve Vai, who had previously been playing with the Frank Zappa band. Continuing the tradition (and following a brief stint in David Lee Roth&#x27;s band from 1986 to 1988), Vai went on to release a number of solo albums; one of the best-known of these was his 1990 release, &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;.

Jason Becker released two albums with Cacophony. Cacophony were a primarily instrumental group featuring Becker and Marty Friedman (the latter of whom went on to play with the thrash metal band Megadeth). After the release of Cacophony&#x27;s second album &quot;Go Off!&quot; in 1988, Becker released two solo albums before being diagnosed with ALS. He now uses a wheelchair and is completely unable to play.

Pepeu Gomes, a Brazilian electric guitar player, was considered in 1988 by American magazine &quot;Guitar World&quot; one of the ten best guitar players in the world. Although he has pure instrumental rock songs with no Brazilian flavour, he mixes the Brazilian rhythms and tunes from well known popular songs, or simply composes by himself using Samba, Choro, Maracatu etc.

== 1990s ==
In 1990, Steve Vai released &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;. A fusion of rock, jazz, classical and Eastern tonalities, &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; was a technical break-through in regards to what could be achieved in the field of guitar composition. This was followed up by the 1995 trio album &quot;Alien Love Secrets&quot; and &quot;Fire Garden&quot;, released a year after.

In 1995, Michael Angelo Batio of Nitro released his CD &quot;No Boundaries&quot;, which began his solo career. His albums predominantly feature instrumental rock, but have occasionally featured vocals by himself and other vocalists.

During the 1990s, instrumental music flourished among indie-rock groups and with the popularity of post rock groups like Tortoise, Mogwai and Cul de Sac.

Don Caballero gained notice for their instrumental math rock, as did neo-surf-rockers the Mermen and Man or Astro-man?.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; made heavy use of rock instrumentals on its soundtrack, spurring some interest in classic instrumentals, and revitalizing Dick Dale&#x27;s career.

With the rise of grunge, guitar-orientated instrumental rock of the type popular in the 1980s became less popular, and there were few artists who continued to thrive in that style.

== 2000s ==
There have been many new releases of instrumental rock albums in the 2000s. The majority of the popular performers from the 1980s have made rejuvenated and generally well-received comebacks, with a revitalized sound apparent on their recent releases. Artists such as Steve Morse, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, Ron Jarzombek and Joe Satriani have continued releasing instrumental rock music and touring with success. Les Fradkin has popularized the Beatles&#x27; music catalog as guitar-based instrumental rock on the Apple iTunes music download service.

The 2000s gave way for a new style of performer. John Lowery (a.k.a. John 5) released a solo instrumental album after leaving Marilyn Manson in 2003. &quot;Vertigo&quot; is composed of a fusion of metal, rockabilly, rock and roll, and bluegrass musical styles. The album was a success, and the album after that, &quot;Songs for Sanity&quot;, which features guest appearances by Steve Vai and Albert Lee, became one of the top selling records on the record label Shrapnel. He followed this in 2007 with The Devil Knows My Name, which features Joe Satriani, Jim Root, and Eric Johnson.

The 2000s saw a rise in the popularity of bands that have been labeled post-rock; many of these bands have created instrumental rock songs. Constellation Records has released some of the best-known examples of instrumental post-rock, such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Do Make Say Think. Other examples include Austin TV, Mogwai, The Cancer Conspiracy, the Mercury Program, 65daysofstatic, God Is An Astronaut, Russian Circles and Explosions in the Sky.

Within the indie rock label, bands such as Ratatat and Delicate Steve are popular instrumental rock acts.

Guitarist Omar Rodriguez Lopez&#x27;s solo albums typically are instrumental (&quot;Old Money&quot;) or mostly instrumental (&quot;Se Dice Bisonte, No Bufalo&quot;).

In the late 2000s a new style of heavy metal called djent emerged. Some of the leading bands in the scene such as Animals as Leaders are instrumental acts, while many others started as instrumental acts before later acquiring vocalists.

A number of Math Rock artists, such as Toe, mainly use instrumentals in their music without many vocals and are thus instrumental acts.

<doc id="143993" wikidata="Q7439337" url="?curid=143993" title="Scruggs style">
<text>Scruggs style is the most common style of playing the banjo in bluegrass music. It is a fingerpicking method, also known as three-finger style. It is named after Earl Scruggs, whose innovative approach and technical mastery of the instrument have influenced generations of bluegrass banjoists ever since he was first recorded in 1946. It contrasts with earlier styles such as minstrel, classic, or parlor style (a late 19th-century finger-style played without picks), clawhammer/frailing/two-finger style (played with thumb and nail of the first or middle finger), jazz styles played with a plectrum, and more modern styles such as Keith/melodic/chromatic/arpa style and single-string/Reno style. The influence of Scruggs is so pervasive that even bluegrass players such as Bill Keith and Don Reno, who are credited with developing these latter styles, typically work out of the Scruggs style much of the time.

==Technique==

Scruggs-style banjo is played with picks on the thumb, index, and middle fingers; the pinky and ring fingers are typically braced against the head (top) of the instrument. The strings are picked rapidly in repetitive sequences or rolls; the same string is not typically picked twice in succession. Melody notes are interspersed among arpeggios, and musical phrases typically contain long series of staccato notes, often played at very rapid tempos. The music is generally syncopated, and may have a subtle swing or shuffle feel, especially on mid-tempo numbers. The result is lively, rapid music, which lends itself both as an accompaniment to other instruments and as a solo.


Beginning with his first recordings with Bill Monroe and His Blue Grass Boys, and later with Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys, Earl Scruggs introduced a vocabulary of &quot;licks&quot;, short musical phrases that are reused in many different songs. Because these licks were widely copied (with variations) by later players, they have become one of the defining attributes of the style, and give it its characteristic sound. These licks often contain fretting-hand embellishments such as slides, chokes (bends), hammer-ons, or plucking the strings with the fretting hand (left hand pizzicato), which add to the harmonic and rhythmic complexity. Many licks also make use of blue notes, giving the music a bluesier feel.

==Influence==
Some have debated how much of the &quot;Scruggs style&quot; was actually &quot;invented&quot; (instead of merely popularized) by Scruggs. For example, Scruggs names Snuffy Jenkins as a major influence. Either way, no one doubts that Scruggs did more to popularize the elements of his eponymous style than any of his contemporaries; it is hard to overstate his influence. In 1968, the instructional manual &quot;Earl Scruggs and the 5-String Banjo&quot; (revised in 2005 under ) was published. This made Scruggs&#x27; technique more widely accessible, and as one of the earliest books of its kind for bluegrass banjo, helped spread Scruggs&#x27; influence considerably. The style was also popularized by Scruggs&#x27; recording of the theme song of the television program &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971), &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot;, as well as the use of &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; in the film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967).

On , a Google Doodle paid homage to Scruggs by featuring a &quot;close-up&quot; animated demonstration of the &quot;Scruggs style&quot;.

<doc id="143994" wikidata="Q637202" url="?curid=143994" title="Zaphod Beeblebrox">
<text>Zaphod Beeblebrox () is a fictional character in the various versions of the comic science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams.

He is from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and is a &quot;semi-half-cousin&quot; of Ford Prefect, with whom he &quot;shares three of the same mothers&quot;. Because of &quot;an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine&quot;, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather are actually his direct descendants (see Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth).

== Appearance ==
This character is described across all versions as having two heads and three arms, though explanations of how he came to receive the extra appendages differs between versions. The original radio version never explained the second head, but did explain that Zaphod &quot;grew&quot; the third arm in the six months between meeting the character of Trillian on Earth, and the start of the series. The third radio series implies that he had a third arm when growing upthe fifth has him offer to Trillian that &quot;I&#x27;d grow my third arm back for you, baby&quot;, when they first meet. In the novel, he said the third arm was &quot;recently ... fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.&quot; According to the original &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; radio series script book, an ad libbed comment by Mark Wing-Davey in the eighth radio episode (&quot;Put it there, and there, and there, and there! Whoa!&quot;) would suggest that Zaphod had grown a fourth arm. In the television series, Ford Prefect simply remarks to Zaphod that &quot;the extra arm suits you.&quot; Eoin Colfer wrote and published an official 6th book for the Hitchhiker&#x27;s series, in which it is implied Zaphod&#x27;s third arm may have originally been grown so that he would have one hand for each of Eccentrica Galumbits&#x27;s breasts.

In Infocom&#x27;s text adventure game version of the story, Zaphod blends in on Earth by hiding his second head in a covered bird cage (an alternate Trillian also refers to this in &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;). In the novel &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, the ghost of Zaphod&#x27;s great-grandfather also has two heads. This and other information presented in the narrative prose seem to indicate that having two heads is a common – possibly even universal – trait of Zaphod&#x27;s species.

For the 2005 film, it is hinted that Zaphod &quot;created&quot; the second head himself when shutting off the parts of his mind that contain portions of his personality that &quot;are not presidential&quot;, but he wanted to keep these traits, so he hid his second head under his neck and wears a large collar or scarf to keep it hidden. As such, the film is also the only version that explains the second head. In this filmed version, the second head appears underneath the first, roughly between his chin and the top of his chest, popping up when the first head is flipped backwards. The third arm is hidden underneath Zaphod&#x27;s clothing, appears to be controlled by the second head, and only appears a few times, such as for tormenting Arthur Dent, piloting the spaceship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, or preparing a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. The second head was sawed off by Humma Kavula during the film.

In &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, Colfer&#x27;s addition to the book series, a photo is mentioned which shows Zaphod with the second head replaced by that of a woman. It is implied that Zaphod may have surgically attached this woman&#x27;s head to himself, before realising he liked the idea of a second head better than he liked her, and swapping her for a reproduction of his original head.

&quot;And Another Thing...&quot; is also the only book in the series in which Zaphod has only one head. His left head is said to have been removed so that &#x27;Left Brain&#x27; (or &#x27;LB&#x27;) can function as the new computer of the &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot;

Zaphod wears unique clothing that contains a mixture of bright and contrasting colours to make him stand out and be the centre of attention wherever he goes. In the television series, he wears the same outfit throughout each of the episodes; however, in the film, his clothes, their style and their colour scheme change several times.

== Achievements ==
Zaphod invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. He was voted &quot;Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe&quot; seven consecutive times. He&#x27;s been described as &quot;the best Bang since the Big One&quot; by Eccentrica Gallumbits, and as &quot;one hoopy frood&quot; by others. In the seventh episode of the original radio series, the narrator describes Beeblebrox as being the &quot;owner of the hippest place in the universe&quot; (his own left cranium), as voted on in a poll of the readers of the fictional magazine &quot;Playbeing&quot;.

He was briefly the President of the Galaxy (a role that involves no power whatsoever, and merely requires the incumbent to attract attention so no one wonders who&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; in charge, a role for which Zaphod was perfectly suited). He is the only man to have survived the Total Perspective Vortex, though it was established (in the books and first two radio series) that he survived only because he was in an Electronically Synthesised Universe created especially for him, thus making him the most important being in that universe and thus uniquely equipped to survive its version of the Vortex. His brain-care specialist, Gag Halfrunt, also said, &quot;Vell, Zaphod&#x27;s just zis guy, you know?&quot; He used his position as President of the Galaxy to steal the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, a spaceship taking advantage of Infinite Improbability Drive, at its unveiling.

Early in Zaphod&#x27;s career (whilst heading &quot;The Beeblebrox Salvage and Really Wild Stuff Corporation&quot;) he joined forces with the &quot;Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration&quot; to investigate the loss of the &quot;Starship Billion Year Bunker&quot;, on which were stored compounds so powerful a teaspoonful could blow up/infect/irradiate a whole planet, and by-products of The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation synthetic personalities programme.

== As a character ==
As a character, Zaphod is hedonistic and irresponsible, self-centered almost to the point of solipsism, and often extremely insensitive to the feelings of those around him. In the books and radio series, he is nevertheless quite charismatic which causes many characters to ignore his other flaws. Douglas Adams claimed that he based Zaphod on an old friend of his from Cambridge University called Johnny Simpson, who &quot;had that nervous sort of hyperenergetic way of trying to appear relaxed.&quot;

In (at least) the books, he is, according to screening tests that he ran on himself in the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;″s medical bay, &quot;clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn&#x27;t have guessed&quot; (&quot;Ultimate Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, page 98). In the movie, however, he is not very bright, and perhaps even more boorish than his previous portrayals. He is portrayed as a vacuous California surfer-type, and Sam Rockwell, the actor who played him in the film, cited Bill Clinton, Elvis Presley and George W. Bush as influences. Zaphod in the film is very much immature (in contrast to the books where he was immature, but had a lot of power and was smart and devious), acting very eager about everything, eating messily with his hands, throwing temper tantrums, and doing things without reason, such as pressing the Improbability Drive button just because it was large and shiny.

Throughout the book and radio versions of the story, Zaphod is busy carrying out some grand scheme, has no clue as to what it is and is unable to do anything but follow the path that he laid out for himself. Zaphod&#x27;s grand schemes have included, over time, a second-hand ballpoint pen business (which may or may not have been established with the help of Veet Voojagig). He was forced to section off portions of both brains that stored the plan so that scans of his mind, which would be necessary for him to become president, would not reveal his plan, which included his being President of the Galaxy and subsequently stealing the prototype Infinite Improbability Drive starship. However, in his altered state of mind he follows the path he left only reluctantly and very much wishes to go off and lie on beaches rather than see the scheme through. In the second radio series and the book version of &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, we learn (and so does Zaphod) that the object of his plan was to find the man who &quot;actually&quot; ruled the universe – who turns out to be a man living in a shack with his cat who does not believe anything is real or certain except that which he is seeing and hearing at that moment.

In the 1986 prequel story &quot;Young Zaphod Plays It Safe,&quot; Zaphod is working as a salvage ship operator, hired by a bureaucratic organization to retrieve the sunken wreck of a starship that had been carrying extremely dangerous materials intended for disposal in a black hole. Since this story is set at a time before his decision to run for President of the Galaxy, he displays a noticeably different personality, exhibiting concern over the hazards posed by the cargo to himself, the crew, and living creatures in general.

== In non-print media ==
In both the radio and television versions of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; Zaphod was played by Mark Wing-Davey. The jokes about Zaphod having two heads and more than two arms were written for the original radio version, where the details could be filled in by the listener&#x27;s imagination. In the television version Wing-Davey wore a false arm (when the arm was required to gesture it was replaced by the arm of Mike Kelt, designer of the animatronic head, standing behind Wing-Davey), and a radio-controlled second head with an eye-patch. Unfortunately, the second head&#x27;s mechanics seldom worked properly and so for most of the time it just sat on Zaphod&#x27;s shoulder looking inanimate, although in one scene it manages to have a brief conversation with Wing-Davey&#x27;s real head, before being told to &quot;go back to sleep&quot;. Wing-Davey also suggested to the TV series&#x27; costume designer that Zaphod&#x27;s costume should be made to indicate that the character has two penises. Special padding was thus arranged, though the first attempt was deemed to be &quot;too long&quot; and was &quot;cut back&quot; for the final version. This was referenced in the film version when Arthur Dent says to Trillian &quot;So, two heads is what does it for a girl?...Anything else he&#x27;s got two of?&quot;

Zaphod is played by Sam Rockwell in the film version of the story that was released in April 2005. In that version, his second head occasionally pops out to express the parts of his personality that are (as the main head puts it) &quot;less than Presidential.&quot; Rockwell performed Zaphod as a blend of Vince Vaughn and Elvis taking additional influence from George W. Bush and Bill Clinton among others.

&quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; has him portrayed by Francis Johnson.

When Mark Wing-Davey&#x27;s academic commitments prevented him resuming the role of Zaphod for the 2013 tour of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Live Radio Show&quot;, comedian, songwriter and author Mitch Benn was cast in the part.

To coincide with the April 2005 release of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; film, a &quot;campaign music video&quot; was released on the Internet. The music, &quot;Beeblebrox for President&quot; by Joby Talbot, comes from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, though it is not heard in the film itself.

==Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster==
Zaphod is the inventor of the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, a fictional cocktail based on Janx Spirit. The series describes the drink as &quot;the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging – expensive and bad for the head&quot; and states that the effect of one &quot;is like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick&quot;. In the television series, two Gargle Blaster drinkers collapse in open-eyed unconsciousness after drinking while the spilled drink burns a hole in the floor; in the film, after the Guide is done explaining what the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster is and its effects, Ford and Zaphod yell in pain. &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; gives the recipe as follows:
:&quot;Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol&#x27; Janx Spirit.
:Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V
:Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
:Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it (in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia).
:Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones.
:Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian suns deep into the heart of the drink.
:Sprinkle Zamphuor.
:Add an olive.
:Drink...but &quot;very carefully.&quot;&quot;

The Guide also implies that there are multiple voluntary organisations available to rehabilitate those who would try the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. Real versions of the drink have been made available at some stage shows of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, as well as bars such as Zaphod Beeblebrox in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In an interview, Douglas Adams stated that there are a number of environmental and weapons treaties, as well as laws of physics, which prevent the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster from being mixed on Earth.

== Cultural references ==
There are many references to the character in video games and other media, some of the more notable examples are: 

The head male meerkat on the Animal Planet television series &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot; was named after him.

In the Mac game &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;, there is a planet called Beeblebrox in the Zaphod system. Upon landing, the planet has the description &quot;Beeblebrox is a wild world, a world of wild parties and wild people. If you have two heads, three arms, and an ego problem, don&#x27;t travel to Beeblebrox; you will be laughed at and considered boring and unoriginal.&quot;

A nightclub named Zaphod Beeblebrox existed in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, billed as &quot;the nightclub at the edge of the universe.&quot; Opened in the early 1990s, it hosted an assortment of artists including Jewel, The Sheepdogs and Alanis Morissette, who previewed &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; with a concert there. The Rolling Stones shot part of their video for the song &quot;Streets of Love&quot; in the club in 2005. The venue closed on 14 May 2017.

Species named after Zaphod are the viviparous brotula &quot;Bidenichthys beeblebroxi&quot; (described in 1995) and the fungus moth &quot;Erechthias beeblebroxi&quot; (named in 1993). They both have a remarkable color pattern resembling a second head, which presumably helps to confuse would-be predators.

Mathematician Andrew Granville published a paper titled &quot;Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s Brain and the Fifty-ninth Row of Pascal&#x27;s Triangle&quot; in The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 99, (1992), pp. 318–331.

In 2016, during season 4 of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, the group travels to a Cantina in outer space belonging to someone named Zaphod.

Sun Microsystems manuals published in the 1980s named the computers in their network diagrams Zaphod, Beeble and Brox.

<text>Jakob Balde (January 4, 1604 – August 9, 1668) was a German poet who wrote primarily in Neo-Latin rather than in his native German language, was born at Ensisheim in Alsace.

== Biography ==

Driven from Alsace by the marauding bands of Count Mansfeld, he fled to Ingolstadt where he began to study law. A love disappointment, however, turned his thoughts to the church, and in 1624 he entered the Society of Jesus. Continuing his study of the humanities, he became in 1628 professor of rhetoric at Innsbruck, and in 1635 at Ingolstadt, whither he had been transferred by his superiors in order to study theology. In 1633 he was ordained a priest.

His lectures and poems had now made him famous, and he was summoned to Munich where, in 1638, he became court chaplain to the elector Maximilian I. He remained in Munich till 1650, when he went to live at Landshut and afterwards at Amberg. In 1654 he was transferred to Neuburg on the Danube, as court preacher and confessor to the count palatine. He remained at Neuburg for the rest of his life. 

A collected edition of Balde&#x27;s works in 4 vols was published at Cologne in 1660; a more complete edition in 8 vols at Munich, 1729; also a good selection by L. Spach (Paris and Strasbourg, 1871). An edition of his Latin lyrics was edited by Benno Müller in 1844 in Munich and another edition also appeared at Regensburg in 1884. There are translations into German of some of his odes by Johann Gottfried Herder (1795), his satires by Johannes Neubig (Munich, 1833) and J. Schrott and M. Schleich (Munich, 1870). See G. Westermayer, &quot;Jacobus Balde, sein Leben und seine Werke&quot; (1868); J. Bach, &quot;Jakob Balde&quot; (Freiburg, 1904). Various odes have been translated into English by Karl Maurer.

<doc id="143996" wikidata="Q381001" url="?curid=143996" title="Total quality management">
<text>Total quality management (TQM) is an organization-wide effort to &quot;install and make a permanent climate where employees continuously improve their ability to provide on-demand products and services that customers will find of particular value.&quot; &quot;Total&quot; emphasizes that departments in addition to production (for example sales and marketing, accounting and finance, engineering and design) are obligated to improve their operations; &quot;management&quot; emphasizes that executives are obligated to actively manage quality through funding, training, staffing, and goal setting. While there is no widely agreed-upon approach, TQM efforts typically draw heavily on the previously developed tools and techniques of quality control. TQM received widespread attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s before being overshadowed by ISO 9000, Lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma.

==History==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the developed countries of North America and Western Europe suffered economically in the face of stiff competition from Japan&#x27;s ability to produce high-quality goods at competitive cost. For the first time since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the United Kingdom became a net importer of finished goods. The United States undertook its own soul-searching, expressed most pointedly in the television broadcast of &quot;If Japan Can... Why Can&#x27;t We?.&quot; Firms began reexamining the techniques of quality control invented over the past 50 years and how those techniques had been so successfully employed by the Japanese. It was in the midst of this economic turmoil that TQM took root.

The exact origin of the term &quot;total quality management&quot; is uncertain. It is almost certainly inspired by Armand V. Feigenbaum&#x27;s multi-edition book &quot;Total Quality Control&quot; () and Kaoru Ishikawa&#x27;s &quot;What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way&quot; (). It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the Department of Trade and Industry during its 1983 &quot;National Quality Campaign&quot;. Or it may have been first coined in the United States by the Naval Air Systems Command to describe its quality-improvement efforts in 1985.

===Development in the United States===
In the spring of 1984, an arm of the United States Navy asked some of its civilian researchers to assess statistical process control and the work of several prominent quality consultants and to make recommendations as to how to apply their approaches to improve the Navy&#x27;s operational effectiveness. The recommendation was to adopt the teachings of W. Edwards Deming. The Navy branded the effort &quot;Total Quality Management&quot; in 1985.

From the Navy, TQM spread throughout the US Federal Government, resulting in the following:
*The creation of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in August 1987
*The creation of the Federal Quality Institute in June 1988
*The adoption of TQM by many elements of government and the armed forces, including the United States Department of Defense, United States Army, and United States Coast Guard

The US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Underground Storage Tanks program, which was established in 1985, also employed Total Quality Management to develop its management style. The private sector followed suit, flocking to TQM principles not only as a means to recapture market share from the Japanese, but also to remain competitive when bidding for contracts from the Federal Government since &quot;total quality&quot; requires involving suppliers, not just employees, in process improvement efforts.

==Features==
There is no widespread agreement as to what TQM is and what actions it requires of organizations, however a review of the original United States Navy effort gives a rough understanding of what is involved in TQM.

The key concepts in the TQM effort undertaken by the Navy in the 1980s include:
*&quot;Quality is defined by customers&#x27; requirements.&quot;
*&quot;Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement.&quot;
*&quot;Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work processes.&quot;
*&quot;Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the organization.&quot;

The Navy used the following tools and techniques:
*The PDCA cycle to drive issues to resolution
*Ad hoc cross-functional teams (similar to quality circles) responsible for addressing immediate process issues
*Standing cross-functional teams responsible for the improvement of processes over the long term
*Active management participation through steering committees
*Use of the Seven Basic Tools of Quality to analyze quality-related issues

===Notable definitions===
While there is no generally accepted definition of TQM, several notable organizations have attempted to define it. These include:

====United States Department of Defense (1988)====
&quot;Total Quality Management (TQM) in the Department of Defense is a strategy for continuously improving performance at every level, and in all areas of responsibility. It combines fundamental management techniques, existing improvement efforts, and specialized technical tools under a disciplined structure focused on continuously improving all processes. Improved performance is directed at satisfying such broad goals as cost, quality, schedule, and mission need and suitability. Increasing user satisfaction is the overriding objective. The TQM effort builds on the pioneering work of Dr. W. E. Deming, Dr. J. M. Juran, and others, and benefits from both private and public sector experience with continuous process improvement.&quot;

====British Standards Institution standard BS 7850-1:1992====
&quot;A management philosophy and company practices that aim to harness the human and material resources of an organization in the most effective way to achieve the objectives of the organization.&quot;

====International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 8402:1994====
&quot;A management approach of an organisation centred on quality, based on the participation of all its members and aiming at long term success through customer satisfaction and benefits to all members of the organisation and society.&quot;

====The American Society for Quality====
&quot;A term first used to describe a management approach to quality improvement. Since then, TQM has taken on many meanings. Simply put, it is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. TQM is based on all members of an organization participating in improving processes, products, services and the culture in which they work. The methods for implementing this approach are found in the teachings of such quality leaders as Philip B. Crosby, W. Edwards Deming, Armand V. Feigenbaum, Kaoru Ishikawa and Joseph M. Juran.&quot;

====The Chartered Quality Institute====
&quot;TQM is a philosophy for managing an organization in a way which enables it to meet stakeholder needs and expectations efficiently and effectively, without compromising ethical values.&quot;

==== Baldrige Excellence Framework ====
In the United States, the Baldrige Award, created by Public Law 100–107, annually recognizes American businesses, education institutions, health care organizations, and government or nonprofit organizations that are role models for organizational performance excellence. Organizations are judged on criteria from seven categories:
#Leadership
#Strategy
#Customers
#Measurement, analysis, and knowledge management
#Workforce
#Operations
#Results

Example criteria are:
*How do you obtain information on your customers’ satisfaction relative to their satisfaction with your competitors?
*How do you select, collect, align, and integrate data and information for tracking daily operations?
*How do you manage your workforce, its needs, and your needs to ensure continuity, prevent workforce reductions, and minimize the impact of workforce reductions, if they do become necessary?

Joseph M. Juran believed the Baldrige Award judging criteria to be the most widely accepted description of what TQM entails.

===Standards===
During the 1990s, standards bodies in Belgium, France, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom attempted to standardize TQM. While many of these standards have since been explicitly withdrawn, they all are effectively superseded by ISO 9000:

==Legacy==
Interest in TQM as an academic subject peaked around 1993.

The Federal Quality Institute was shuttered in September 1995 as part of the Clinton administration&#x27;s efforts to streamline government. The European Centre for Total Quality Management closed in August 2009.

TQM, as a vaguely defined quality management approach, was largely supplanted by the ISO 9000 collection of standards and their formal certification processes in the 1990s. Business interest in quality improvement under the TQM name also faded as Jack Welch&#x27;s success attracted attention to Six Sigma and Toyota&#x27;s success attracted attention to lean manufacturing, though the three share many of the same tools, techniques, and significant portions of the same philosophy.

TQM lives on in various national quality awards around the globe.

<text>Bernardino Baldi (5 June 1553 – 10 October 1617) was an Italian mathematician, poet, translator and priest.

== Biography ==
Baldi descended from a noble family from Urbino, Marche, where he was born. He pursued his studies at Padua, and is said to have spoken about sixteen languages during his lifetime, though according to Tiraboschi the inscription on his tomb limits the number to twelve.

The appearance of the plague at Padua forced him to return to his native city. Shortly afterwards he was called to act as tutor to Ferrante Gonzaga, from whom he received the rich abbey of Guastalla. The oldest biography of Nicolaus Copernicus was completed on 7 October 1588 by him. He held office as abbot for 25 years, and then returned once again to Urbino. In 1612, he was employed by the duke as his envoy to Venice. Baldi died at Urbino on 12 October 1617.

He is said to have written upwards of a hundred different works, the chief part of which have remained unpublished. His various works show his abilities as a theologian, mathematician, geographer, antiquary, historian and poet. His &quot;Cronica dei Matematici&quot;, a collection of lives of mathematicians, from antiquity to his own time, was conceived in emulation of Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, and was intended to contain the lives of more than two hundred mathematicians. The work was not published in the Renaissance, but an abridgement appeared in Urbino in 1707. His life has been written of by Ireneo Affò and Giammaria Mazzucchelli, among others.

<text>Ernst Gottfried Baldinger (13 May 1738 – 21 January 1804), German physician, was born in Großvargula near Erfurt.

He studied medicine at Erfurt, Halle and Jena, earning his MD in 1760 under the guidance of Ernst Anton Nicolai and in 1761 was entrusted with the superintendence of the military hospitals connected with the Prussian encampment near Torgau.

He published a treatise in 1765, &quot;De Militum Morbis,&quot; which met with a favourable reception. In 1768, he became professor of medicine at Jena, which he left in 1773 for Göttingen, and in 1785 he moved to Marburg, where he died of apoplexy on 21 January 1804.

Among his pupils were Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, Albrecht Thaer, and Johann Christian Wiegleb. He wrote approximately 84 separate treatises, in addition to numerous papers scattered through various collections and journals. He corresponded with Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus and was the author of some plant names. He was the editor of &quot;Auszüge aus den neuesten Dissertationen über die Naturlehre, Arzneiwissenschaft und alle Theile derselben&quot;

<doc id="144004" wikidata="Q41549" url="?curid=144004" title="Coat of arms of Canada">
<text>The coat of arms of Canada, also known as the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada or, formally, as the Arms of His Majesty The King in Right of Canada is the arms of dominion of the Canadian monarch and, thus, also the official coat of arms of Canada. In use since 1921, it is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.

The maple leaves in the shield, blazoned &quot;proper&quot; (i.e., in natural colour), were originally drawn &quot;vert&quot; (green), but were redrawn &quot;gules&quot; (red) in 1957 and a circlet of the Order of Canada was added to the arms for limited use in 1987. The arms are registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority and protected under Crown copyright; they are used to signify national sovereignty and the federal government uses the arms to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Elements of the coat of arms are also used in other designs, with the shield being used in the various royal standards belonging to members of the royal family and the crest of the arms serving as the focal point of the governor general&#x27;s flag.

==History==
Prior to Confederation in 1867, the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom served in Canada as the symbol of royal authority. Arms had not been granted to any of the colonies in British North America, apart from 17th century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Arms were then granted by royal warrant, on 26 May 1868, to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. (That Nova Scotia had previously been granted arms was forgotten and it took until 1929 for the historic arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated.) In that warrant, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada. While this was not done for the first Great Seal, it was through that reference that the arrangement became the &quot;de facto&quot; arms for Canada until 1921, which were used on the first Red Ensign carried by Canadian troops at Vimy Ridge in 1917.

As more provinces and territories joined Canada, the original four arms were marshalled with the arms of the new members of Confederation, eventually resulting in a shield with nine quarterings. This occurred by way of popular and even Canadian governmental usage; flag-makers took to using the complex shield on Canadian Red Ensigns. None of those shields, besides the original four-segment version of 1868, were ever official in any sense, nor were any of these shields a national &quot;coat of arms&quot;, as they had never been approved by the monarch.

Heraldists considered nine quarterings on a shield as too convoluted for a national symbol and, by 1915, a push had begun to design a new coat of arms for Canada. A committee, which included Dominion Archivist Arthur Doughty, was formed in 1919 to pursue the issue, eventually agreeing that the elements of the new arms would reference the royal arms of England, Ireland, Scotland, and France, with maple leaves representing Canada, though there was at the time no consensus on how the leaves were to be used. A 1917 proposal by Edward Marion Chadwick (who had designed the crest, supporters, and motto of the coat of arms of Ontario) sparked a discussion about featuring First Nations figures as supporters. Though Chadwick had depicted the clothing and regalia accurately, Joseph Pope rejected the idea, stating, &quot;I myself do not see any necessity for commemorating the Indians at all.&quot;

The arms&#x27; design was settled by the following year and the committee conferred with the College of Arms in London, only to face resistance to the use of the UK&#x27;s royal arms from the Garter King of Arms, as well as concern over whether the inclusion of the fleurs-de-lis would imply Canada claimed sovereignty over France. The Canadian Commissioner-General in Paris discreetly confirmed with French officials that the coat of arms would not spark a diplomatic spat. A counter-proposal from the college added the flags to the supporters and a crown to the lion, as in the British arms, and placed the three fleurs-de-lis between two green maple leaves in the fifth charge on the shield, below the four charges of the arms of the UK.

After some manoeuvring, including the personal intervention of Winston Churchill, the new arms of Canada were eventually formally requested by an order-in-council on 21 April 1921 and adopted on 21 November of the same year, by proclamation of King George V, as the Arms or Ensigns Armorial of the Dominion of Canada;. the committee records were preserved with Library and Archives Canada. The new layout closely reflected the arms of the United Kingdom, with the addition of maple leaves in the base and the reference to the French royal arms in the fourth quarter.

Eugène Fiset, the Deputy Minister of Defence, claimed in 1918 that the design of the arms would determine the national colours of Canada and an unnamed member of the committee stated, &quot;the colours of the shield will become the national colours of the Dominion [...] the red maple leaf has been used in service flags to denote men who have sacrificed their lives for the country [...] The case for white is that it contains an allusion to snow, which is characteristic of our climate and our landscape in certain seasons.&quot; In the 1940s, military historian Archer Fortescue Duguid suggested King George V had chosen red and white as Canada&#x27;s official colours because those were the colours in the wreath and mantling on the arms. However, Forrest Pass, a curator at Library and Archives Canada, determined there is no record of either the King or the committee giving much importance to the mantling and the royal proclamation of the coat of arms makes no mention of national colours, specifically.

With the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, Canada and other Dominions became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms for particular uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in courtrooms and on government buildings to represent the reigning monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of King George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for Queen Elizabeth II, on which the title &quot;Queen of Canada&quot; is used.

By 1957, the arms were redrawn by Alan Beddoe so as to have red leaves and to change the royal crown from a Tudor design to one more resembling St Edward&#x27;s Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended the last vestiges of the British parliament&#x27;s role in amending the constitution, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada—at the time, the country&#x27;s highest civilian honour for merit—be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms displayed in Canada—holdovers from the time of French, Scottish, and English colonisation—on which a symbol of those countries&#x27; highest national order of honour appeared around the shield (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter, the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Ancien Régime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Order of Canada&#x27;s founding, in 1992; an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.

It took until 1994 for the Queen to approve the new design for general use; though, the Canadian Heraldic Authority, established by the Queen in 1988, began to allow for its limited use beginning in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians. These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada—&quot;Desiderantes meliorem patriam&quot;. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full achievement was redesigned for use by the federal government within the Federal Identity Program. The present design of the arms of Canada was drawn by Cathy Bursey-Sabourin, Fraser Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

Member of Parliament Pat Martin introduced, in June 2008, a motion into the House of Commons calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada&#x27;s First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, as Chadwick had suggested in 1917. After the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on 6 May 2023, the Canadian Heraldic Authority revealed a new Canadian Royal Crown featuring maple leaves, a snowflake, and symbols with meaning to Canada&#x27;s Indigenous peoples. The authority stated changes will take place in due course. 

===Armorial evolution===
==Use==
The coat of arms, being those of the sovereign and the state, is used to signify national sovereignty and ownership. The federal government uses the arms to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program and as a mark of authority for various government agencies and representatives, including Cabinet, and the prime minister within it, and the Supreme Court, as well as the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). In the latter two, the most senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the arms as a badge of rank, representing the fact that they have received the King&#x27;s warrant (as opposed to the King&#x27;s Commission for officers).

The arms of Canada is also present on all pre-polymer denominations of Canadian banknotes—printed on each bill in a way that functions as a security feature,—as well as the 50¢ coin and on the cover of Canadian passports. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.

The full achievement of the coat of arms has been used by the Canadian government on occasion on a plain red flag, such as in 1967 for the country&#x27;s centennial celebrations. It is also used on a flag in its full achievement in military ceremonies, such as Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo performances.
As the royal arms are personal to the sovereign, they cannot be used without the King&#x27;s consent. The coat of arms &quot;as designed in 1921 and revised in 1957 [...] [and] in 1994&quot; are &quot;protected under the &quot;Trade-marks Act&quot; and the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; and cannot be used or reproduced without authorization.&quot; Further, &quot;marks and designs similar to the official symbols are pursued as a copyright or trade-mark infringement.&quot; The &quot;Trade-marks Act&quot; further states that, &quot;no person shall adopt in connection with a business, as a trade-mark or otherwise, any mark consisting of, or so nearly resembling as to be likely to be mistaken for [...] the arms, crest, or flag adopted and used at any time by Canada.&quot; In addition, under Crown copyright, &quot;permission is always required when the work is being revised, adapted, or translated, regardless if the purpose of the reproduction is for personal or public non-commercial distribution.&quot;

===Designs derived from the arms===
The banner of the arms was in 2023 also made the sovereign&#x27;s flag, for use by the monarch in Canada and when representing Canada abroad. Between 1962 and 2022, the banner of arms defaced with a variant of the Queen&#x27;s cypher formed the Queen&#x27;s Personal Canadian Flag, for use by Queen Elizabeth II. Six additional standards for use by other members of the Canadian royal family were created in the 2010s, all using a similar design with the banner of the arms as their base. The personal flag of the governor general has, since 1981, featured the crest of the royal arms of Canada on a blue background.
With the support of former Speakers of the House of Commons John Fraser and Gilbert Parent, Bruce Hicks campaigned for the Canadian Parliament to have a distinct heraldic symbol, along the lines of the portcullis (variations of which are used by the Commons and Lords in the British Parliament). In response, Member of Parliament Derek Lee tabled a motion calling for a committee to be struck, which passed and Hicks and Robert Watt, the first Chief Herald of Canada, were called as the only two expert witnesses; though, Senator Serge Joyal joined the committee &quot;ex-officio&quot;, on behalf of the Senate. The Commons&#x27; Speaker, Peter Milliken, then asked the Canadian Heraldic Authority to design such a symbol and, on 15 February 2008, the Governor General authorized the House of Commons to begin using a badge, consisting of the shield of the royal arms superimposed on the ceremonial mace (assigned to the House of Commons as a symbol of the royal authority under which it operates). Following the Commons example, the Senate then requested and obtained, exactly two months later, a similar badge for itself, with the shield of the royal arms surmounted on the mace assigned to the Senate.

==Blazon==
The heraldic blazon of Canada&#x27;s coat of arms, as declared in the 1921 proclamation, is:

Tierced in fesse the first and second divisions containing the quarterly coat following, namely, 1st, gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or, 2nd, Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory gules, 3rd, azure a harp Or stringed argent, 4th, azure, three fleurs-de-lis Or, and the third division argent three maple leaves conjoined on one stem proper. And upon a royal helmet mantled argent doubled gules the crest, that is to say, on a wreath of the colours argent and gules a lion passant guardant Or imperially crowned proper and holding in the dexter paw a maple leaf gules. And for supporters on the dexter a lion rampant Or holding a lance argent, point Or, flying therefrom to the dexter the Union Flag, and on the sinister, a unicorn argent armed crined and unguled Or, gorged with a coronet composed of crosses-patée and fleurs-de-lis a chain affixed thereto reflexed of the last, and holding a like lance flying therefrom to the sinister a banner azure charged with three fleurs-de-lis Or; the whole ensigned with the Imperial Crown proper and below the shield upon a wreath composed of roses, thistles, shamrocks and lillies a scroll azure inscribed with the motto .

The circlet of the Order of Canada was added around the shield for limited use in 1987 and for general use in 1994.

<text>Filippo Baldinucci (3 June 1625 – 10 January 1696) was an Italian art historian and biographer.
==Life==
Baldinucci is considered among the most significant Florentine biographers/historians of the artists and the arts of the Baroque period. Patronised by the Medici, he aspired to become the new Vasari by renewing and expanding his biographies of artists, to which Baldinucci added lives of French and Flemish artists omitted by Vasari. His most important work was this biographical dictionary of artists, &quot;Artists in biographies by Filippo Baldinucci&quot;, of which the publication began in 1681 and continued after his death.

His biography of Gian Lorenzo Bernini was published in 1682.

Baldinucci came from a prominent and wealthy family of the Florentine merchant elite. As well as writing he drew portraits in chalk and modeled in clay; many of his deft and lively chalk portraits of friends are in the collection of the Uffizi. For Cardinal Leopoldo de&#x27; Medici, brother of Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and a scholar and patron of the arts, he began as bookkeeper in 1664 and developed, after the Cardinal&#x27;s death, into virtually the curator of the Grand Ducal collections. In this way Baldinucci made a name as one of Italy&#x27;s leading connoisseurs. His work recataloguing and adding to the Medici collections, first of drawings and then of paintings, was groundbreaking, using new ideas about organisation and completeness to make these the most modern collections of the time—collections in large part the foundation of the Uffizi&#x27;s art holdings.

This meticulous work was based on an ability to distinguish between the hands of different painters—an idea then new and untested, and one that opened up the field of connoisseurship that enabled the attributions of Italian drawings, which are generally unsigned. In his &quot;Vocabolario&quot;, the first dictionary of artistic terms, Baldinucci provided fourteen definitions of style using eighty different terms, and applied some of his terms to &quot;bad&quot; art.

From this grew his &quot;Notizie&quot;, in which he consciously intended to build upon the &quot;Vite&quot; of Giorgio Vasari; Baldinucci&#x27;s was the first art history to trace the lives and work of artists not only of one region (Vasari was prejudiced towards Tuscan artists) but all Italy, and indeed beyond. He studied closely the stylistic debts of the great masters to one another, and in this, and his meticulous use of documentation and archives, he was centuries ahead in the discipline of art history.

In his &quot;Vocabolario&quot; (1681) he presented terms of art and technical terms, not only for the fine arts but for goldsmith&#x27;s work, &quot;pietre dure&quot;, color pigments and tools.

In other ways Baldinucci was very much a man of his time, of the Counter-Reformation and of the Baroque. Educated at a Jesuit school, he was intensely pious—before marrying, he completed the whole of Ignatius of Loyola&#x27;s &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; to discover whether he should in fact devote himself to a single life. Three of his sons went into the church, and one, Antonio, was a Jesuit missionary later beatified.

He had great appreciation of the Baroque, and wrote in a periodic style which reflected it, each phrase opening from the preceding, full of periphrasis and other flourishes of rhetoric, though flowing. His understanding of art stemmed largely from his religion, for he believed that it came as divine inspiration into special lives, the lives of the artists he so painstakingly recorded.

Baldinucci&#x27;s son wrote the first biography of his father; Baldinucci&#x27;s notes are conserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence (MSS Fondo Nazionale II.II.110)

<text>Jeffrey Bruce Atkins (born February 29, 1976), better known by his stage name Ja Rule (), is an American rapper, singer, and actor. Born and raised in New York City, Ja Rule became known for blending gangsta rap with pop and R&amp;B sensibilities. He signed with Irv Gotti&#x27;s Murder Inc Records, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings to release his debut studio album &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; (1999), which spawned his first hit single, &quot;Holla Holla&quot;. In 2001, he peaked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on three occasions with his single &quot;Always on Time&quot; (featuring Ashanti) and his guest appearances on Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s songs &quot;I&#x27;m Real (Murder Remix)&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny&quot;.

Commercially successful, &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was followed by his second and third albums, &quot;Rule 3:36&quot; (2000) and &quot;Pain Is Love&quot; (2001), both of which peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. With over 15 million combined sales, both also received triple platinum certifications by the RIAA and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten singles &quot;Put It on Me&quot; (featuring Lil&#x27; Mo and Vita) and &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot; (featuring Case). He followed up with his fourth, fifth and sixth albums &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; (2002), &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot; (2003), and &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot; (2004); &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; received platinum certification and spawned the top two-single &quot;Mesmerize&quot; (featuring Ashanti), while &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot; received gold certification and spawned the top five-single &quot;Wonderful&quot; (featuring R. Kelly and Ashanti). Ja Rule has been nominated for two American Music Awards and four Grammy Awards with respective collaborators Lil&#x27; Mo, Vita, Ashanti and Case. From 1999 to 2005 Ja Rule had seventeen Hot 100 hits, chiefly produced by Irv Gotti, and as of 2018, Ja Rule has sold 30 million records worldwide.

Outside of music, Ja Rule was met with scrutiny for his involvement in the fraudulent Fyre Festival, which he co-founded with con artist Billy McFarland. In November 2019, he was cleared of any legal wrongdoing from his role in the festival. Earlier that year, he joined the main cast of WeTV&#x27;s &quot;Growing Up Hip Hop: New York&quot;. As an actor, he has also starred in films such as &quot;Turn It Up&quot; (2000), &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001), &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; (2002), &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003), &quot;The Cookout&quot; (2004), &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;, &quot;Back in the Day&quot; (both in 2005), &quot;Furnace&quot; (2007), and &quot;Wrong Side of Town&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Jeffrey Bruce Atkins was born on February 29, 1976, in Hollis, a section of the Queens borough of New York City. Atkins&#x27; father left the family when he was very young. Atkins was raised as an only child, as his younger sister, Kristen, died in the womb when Atkins was 5. His mother, Debra, was a healthcare worker, and due to the amount of time she spent working, Atkins was largely raised by his grandparents as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Atkins&#x27; mother left the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness religion when he was twelve and was therefore shunned by her former congregation including her parents, meaning she was no longer allowed to see her son. Atkins and his mother decided they would rather live together even if it meant struggling to pay bills. Not long after moving in with his mother, Atkins began selling drugs in Hollis.

==Career==
===Cash Money Click (1994–95)===
Atkins began his rap career in 1994 with the hip hop group Cash Money Click alongside members Chris Black and O-1. He took the stage name &quot;Ja Rule&quot;, telling MTV News that the name came from a friend who addressed him by that name; other friends simply called him &quot;Ja&quot;. Together they worked with producer DJ Irv to produce a number of songs, releasing their debut single &quot;Get Tha Fortune&quot; independently in 1994. After the group signed with TVT Records, the song was re-released through the label later that year as the B-side to their second single, &quot;4 My Click&quot;. &quot;4 My Click&quot; featured Mic Geronimo and became popular on pirate radio, eventually receiving airplay on Yo! MTV Raps. Plans for the release of the group&#x27;s eponymous debut studio album were brought to a halt in 1995 after Chris Black was sentenced to five years in prison and the group was dropped from TVT, which led to their third single &quot;She Swallowed It&quot; never officially being released, however it was later bootlegged. With no label, the group disbanded shortly after being dropped.

===Solo career and &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; (1995–1999)===
After being dropped from TVT, Ja Rule maintained a close relationship with DJ Irv, who was working as an executive producer for Def Jam at the time. DJ Irv, now known as Irv Gotti, was hired as an A&amp;R for the label and was able to get Ja Rule a contract with Def Jam. In 1995, he made his first solo appearance on Mic Geronimo&#x27;s &quot;Time to Build&quot; alongside Jay-Z and DMX, who were also in the early stages of their careers. He later appeared on the song &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; from Mic Geronimo&#x27;s second album &quot;Vendetta&quot; in 1997, alongside The Lox, DMX and Tragedy Khadafi. He also had a brief cameo in the video for &quot;Walk in New York&quot; by Queens hardcore rap group Onyx. Later in 1997, Irv Gotti was granted his own imprint from Def Jam, known as Murder Inc. Records. Ja Rule was promoted as the label&#x27;s flagship artist, and he continued to make guest appearances on songs by other artists, including Method Man, Redman, Nas, DMX, LL Cool J and Dru Hill. He later appeared on Jay-Z&#x27;s 1998 hit single &quot;Can I Get A...&quot;, for which he wrote the hook. It was originally planned to be Ja Rule&#x27;s debut single until Jay-Z heard the track and requested it for himself. During this time, he rapped under the slightly modified stage name Jah.

Returning to the Ja Rule name, his debut single &quot;Holla Holla&quot; was released in March 1999 and became a hit, peaking at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Fueled by the success of &quot;Holla Holla&quot;, Ja Rule&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot;, was released in 1999, peaking at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 184,000 copies sold in its first week. It eventually reached platinum status in the US due to the popularity of &quot;Holla Holla&quot;. A remix of &quot;Holla Holla&quot; was later released, featuring Jay-Z, Vita, Cadillac Tah, Black Child, Memphis Bleek and Busta Rhymes.

===&quot;Rule 3:36&quot;, &quot;Pain Is Love&quot;, and &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; (2000–2002)===

Ja Rule&#x27;s second single, &quot;Between Me and You&quot;, featuring Christina Milian, was released in June 2000 as the first single from his second studio album and became his first major crossover hit, earning Top 40 airplay and reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album&#x27;s next single, &quot;Put It on Me&quot;, featuring Vita and Lil&#x27; Mo, was released in December 2000 and became one of the biggest hits of 2001, reaching number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming the first top-10 hit for both Ja Rule and Vita. The video for &quot;Put It on Me&quot; also topped the MTV Video Countdown for a week, and became the first music video to be retired on BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; after spending more than 60 days on the countdown. The video also ranked number 1 on BET&#x27;s &quot;Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2001&quot;.

Ja Rule&#x27;s second album, &quot;Rule 3:36&quot;, was released on October 10, 2000, and went in a much different stylistic direction from &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot;, changing his almost trademark hardcore hip-hop sound to mainstream-oriented pop-rap, debuting at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 276,000 copies sold in its first week, making it Ja Rule&#x27;s first number-one album. The album later went on to be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A week later, Ja Rule featured on Cuban Link&#x27;s song &quot;Murda Murda&quot; from Cuban&#x27;s &quot;24K&quot; album. It was released on October 22, 2000, by Atlantic Records and Terror Squad Entertainment as the B-side to Cuban&#x27;s &quot;Still Telling Lies&quot; single.

The success of &quot;Rule 3:36&quot; promoted Ja Rule to international status, and made Murder Inc. one of the biggest labels in the United States. The same success followed with his third album, which spawned three top-10 singles, two of them reaching number 1. The first, &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, featuring Case, was released in July 2001 and reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also achieved success in the United Kingdom, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Always on Time&quot;, was released in October 2001 and marked the first major guest appearance for Murder Inc&#x27;s youngest artist Ashanti, and became both Ja Rule and Ashanti&#x27;s first song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The remix of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot; featuring Ja Rule was included on the album and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, beginning September 8, 2001, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song was a staple of R&amp;B/hip hop and pop radio during the summer and fall of 2001, spending fifteen weeks total in the top five of the Hot 100. In 2009 the single was named the 30th most successful song of the 2000s, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Down Ass Bitch&quot; featuring Charli Baltimore was also successful, reaching number 21 on the Hot 100.

Ja Rule released his third studio album, &quot;Pain Is Love&quot;, on October 2, 2001. Like its predecessor, &quot;Pain Is Love&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 361,000 copies and is certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The album also received a Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Rap Album. By 2007, 3.6 million copies of &quot;Pain Is Love&quot; had been sold.

&quot;The Last Temptation&quot;, Ja Rule&#x27;s fourth album, was released on November 19, 2002. It spawned two hit singles, &quot;Thug Lovin&#x27;&quot;, featuring Bobby Brown, which peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Mesmerize&quot;, a duet with Ashanti that peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;The Last Temptation&quot; debuted at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 237,000 copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2002.

===50 Cent feud, &quot;Blood in My Eye,&quot; and &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot; (2003–2004)===
Shortly after the release of his fourth studio album, Ja Rule&#x27;s ongoing beef with fellow Queens rapper 50 Cent reached its peak, with both artists taking to radio stations almost daily to trade insults and diss tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://hiphopdx.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2003, the Murder Inc. offices were raided by FBI agents and NYPD officers due to accusations of money laundering and drug trades toward Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff, who was associated with Irv Gotti. Due to the federal investigation, Ja Rule had a late response in his beef with 50 Cent. By association, 50 Cent&#x27;s labelmates Eminem, Obie Trice, D12, and Ja Rule&#x27;s former friends and associates DMX and Busta Rhymes were brought into the feud too. Ja Rule released the diss track &quot;Loose Change&quot; in April 2003, where he attacks 50 Cent, as well as Eminem, Busta Rhymes and Dr. Dre. 50 Cent eventually responded with &quot;Hail Mary&quot;, which used the beat from 2Pac&#x27;s song of the same name and featured Eminem and Busta Rhymes. The beef continued to be highly publicized throughout 2003, and eventually led to Ja Rule meeting with Minister Louis Farrakhan in October, who wanted to intervene and prevent escalating violence in the feud.

Ja Rule&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot;, was released on November 4, 2003, under the Murder Inc. label, which renamed itself &quot;The Inc.&quot; several days after the album release. The material was intended simply as a mixtape, but was released as an album to fulfill Ja Rule&#x27;s contractual commitment to Murder Inc. to release one annually. The album was described as a &quot;hate&quot; album directed at various rappers, including 50 Cent, G-Unit, Eminem, Proof, Dr. Dre, DMX, Busta Rhymes and others, and marked a return to the hardcore style Ja Rule had used in his earlier career. It spawned one hit single, &quot;Clap Back&quot;, which reached number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won a Source Award for &quot;Fat Tape&quot; song of the year. It peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200, selling 139,000 copies in its first week of release, and had sold over 468,000 copies in the U.S. by 2008.

Ja Rule&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot;, was released in November 2004, debuting at number 7 and selling 166,000 copies in its first week of release. Its lead single, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, featuring R. Kelly and Ashanti, peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was followed by the street anthem &quot;New York&quot;, featuring Fat Joe and Jadakiss, which charted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The third single was the love song &quot;Caught Up&quot;, featuring Lloyd, which failed to make an impact on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The RIAA certified &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot; Gold on January 14, 2005, and by October 2007 the album had sold 658,000 copies.

===Hiatus, departure from Def Jam, decline of The Inc. Records (2005–2009)===

On December 6, 2005, The Inc. released &quot;Exodus&quot;, a greatest hits album whose only new tracks were the song &quot;Me&quot; and intro and outro tracks. &quot;Exodus&quot; was the last album on Ja Rule&#x27;s contract with The Inc. After its release, Ja Rule took a hiatus from recording music. Meanwhile, The Inc. Records was still under investigation because of alleged drug trades with Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff. This led to Def Jam Recordings refusing to renew The Inc.&#x27;s contract. From 2005 to 2006, Gotti searched for other labels, finally reaching a deal with Universal Records (part of the same company as Def Jam). A few years later The Inc. left Universal Records due to business issues and failure to secure funds for projects. In 2007, Ja Rule founded record label Mpire Music Group.

===&quot;Pain Is Love 2&quot;, prison, and release (2011–2013)===
In February 2011, it was announced that Ja Rule had started working on a new album, &quot;Pain Is Love 2&quot;, to be produced by the producers of the original &quot;Pain Is Love&quot; album to &quot;recreate magic&quot;. Most of the production was to be done by 7 Aurelius (who co-produced &quot;Down Ass Bitch&quot;), while Irv Gotti was to be executive producer. Ja Rule had planned on releasing it on June 7, 2011, but decided to delay the release in order to allow more time to perfect the &quot;level and quality of the records&quot; and to avoid &quot;doing an injustice to [his] fans&quot;. A revised release date of October 11, 2011, was also pushed back. During the delay, Ja Rule released a new track, &quot;Falling to Pieces&quot;, produced by 7 Aurelius, which samples The Script&#x27;s &quot;Breakeven&quot;. On October 2, 2011, another track, &quot;Spun a Web&quot;, was released, also produced by 7 Aurelius and sampling Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Trouble&quot;. The following day a teaser video premiered on YouTube, and the official video was released on October 11. &quot;Pain Is Love 2&quot; was finally released on February 28, 2012, by which time Ja Rule was serving a two-year sentence in prison for gun possession and tax evasion.

Ja Rule was released from prison on May 7, 2013. Alongside Lil Wayne and Birdman, he appeared on the remix of the track &quot;She Tried&quot;, which appeared on the N.O.R.E album &quot;Student of the Game&quot;. On September 18, 2013, Ja Rule released a track titled &quot;Fresh Out Da Pen&quot;. The track had first premiered on Hot 97. A few days later he released &quot;Everything&quot;. Both tracks were produced by Visionary producers Reefa and Myles William. On September 27, 2013, both tracks were released on iTunes for digital download. In September 2013, it was confirmed that Ja Rule and Gotti had relaunched Murder Inc Records.

===Memoir, reality show and future projects (2014–present)===
In 2014, Ja Rule released a memoir, &quot;Unruly: The Highs and Lows of Becoming a Man&quot;, in which he reflected on his past struggles with a difficult adolescence in New York City and everything that followed, from breakout success and destructive rivalries to fatherhood and a two-year prison sentence. In July 2014, Ja Rule announced his eighth studio album, which was eventually pushed back to a 2016 release. Also in 2014, MTV announced that Ja Rule and his family would star in the upcoming reality show &quot;Follow the Rules&quot; which was co-produced by Queen Latifah. A sneak peek trailer of the show surfaced on the internet in September 2014 and the show premiered on October 26, 2015. In October 2015, Rule announced that he and Gotti had partnered with Paramount Pictures on a TV drama series based on the history of Murder Inc., set to premiere in 2016. In February 2016, Ja Rule announced that his upcoming eighth studio album would be titled &quot;Coup De Grâce&quot; and would be his last album. In December 2016, he appeared on &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot;, rapping Hamilton&#x27;s verse in Ashanti&#x27;s performance of &quot;Helpless&quot;, referencing Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s impression of him in the last line of that verse. On June 26, 2018, Ashanti confirmed that she and Ja Rule are working on a collaborative album.

On October 15, 2021, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the release of his third studio album, &quot;Pain is Love&quot;, Ja Rule released the single, &quot;Sincerely, Jeffrey&quot; for all streaming platforms.

===Acting===

His first film was a buddy movie with Pras, &quot;Turn It Up&quot;; he appeared in a minor role in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. He appeared in several movies including &quot;Back in the Day&quot; with Ving Rhames and Pam Grier and &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; as Steven Seagal&#x27;s co-star. He also starred in the movies &quot;The Cookout&quot; with Queen Latifah and &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;. In 2013, he starred in &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Church Girl&quot;.

===Other ventures===
In 2004, Ja Rule and Gotti launched an urban clothing line called ErvinGeoffrey. In 2006, Ja Rule launched a liquor company, The Mojito.

In May 2015, Ja Rule partnered with Billy McFarland, the CEO of the credit card service company Magnises, to become its creative head and spokesman. In August 2015, Ja Rule collaborated with footwear businessman Steve Madden on a new line of men&#x27;s sneakers called Maven x Madden, which were released for sale by fall 2015.

In 2016, Ja Rule co-founded Fyre Media, Inc., a talent booking agency, with Billy McFarland. In April 2017, the venture touted its Fyre Festival in Hamilton, Bahamas, as a luxury event, but it was fraudulent, disappointing hundreds of ticket-buyers. Rule and McFarland faced a $100 million class action suit.

In 2020, Ja Rule developed a live-streaming app called Iconn Live. The app debuted on Apple TV in November 2022.

In 2021, Ja Rule partnered with a team of software engineers to launch Flipkick, a platform focusing on selling physical works of art as non-fungible tokens. Flipkick claims to be &quot;the first company to offer cryptographic authentication of physical works of art sold as and linked to NFTs.&quot; To inaugurate the platform, Ja Rule listed for auction a painting he commissioned in 2012 by artist Tripp Derrick Barnes depicting the Fyre Media Inc logo. The painting was listed with an estimate of $600,000.

In June 2023, Ja Rule launched a premium wine label called Rose Vine Cellars.

==Personal life==
Atkins earned his GED while in prison in February 2012. In February 2021, Atkins completed an online course at Harvard Business School and shared a photo of his certificate of completion on Twitter.

===Family===
In April 2001, Ja Rule married Aisha Murray. The couple have three children.

===Religion===
Raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness for most of his childhood, Ja Rule identifies as a Christian. He &quot;reconnected with God&quot; in 2013 while promoting the movie &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Church Girl&quot;. He was baptized, along with his wife, in 2013.

==Legal issues==
In 2003, he allegedly punched a man in Toronto, who later sued. He received a $1,200 fine after pleading guilty to assault.

In 2004, police investigated whether a feud involving Murder Inc. led to a fatal shooting outside a nightclub party hosted by Ja Rule and Leon Richardson.

On July 1, 2004, Ja Rule was arrested for driving with a suspended license and possessing marijuana.

In July 2007, Ja Rule was arrested for gun and drug possession charges along with Lil Wayne, who served eight months in prison during 2010 for attempted possession of a weapon stemming from the arrest. The court rejected Ja Rule&#x27;s argument that the gun was illegally obtained evidence.

On December 13, 2010, Ja Rule received a two-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to attempted possession of a weapon after the aforementioned 2007 arrest. On March 8, 2011, Ja Rule&#x27;s surrender date for his two-year prison sentence was set for June 8. He was first sent to Rikers Island, then later to a state facility in Upstate New York.

In July 2011, Ja Rule received an additional 28-month prison sentence for tax evasion, to run concurrently with his state term, failing to pay taxes on more than $3 million in earnings between 2004 and 2006. He was released from state prison on February 21, 2013, but was immediately taken into federal custody for the tax case, for which he had less than six months remaining on his sentence. Ja Rule was held in Brooklyn&#x27;s Metropolitan Detention Center and was set to be released on July 28, 2013. Ja Rule was released from prison early on May 7, 2013.

By July 1, 2017, Ja Rule faced more than a dozen lawsuits filed by ticket buyers and investors in the failed Fyre Festival and his partner in the venture, Billy McFarland, had been indicted for fraud. In November 2019, charges were reportedly dropped against Ja Rule in connection with the lawsuits.

On February 28, 2024, Ja Rule was denied entry into the United Kingdom, days before his UK tour was due to start in Cardiff. He cited his criminal record as the reason for the refusal.

==Feuds==
===50 Cent===
Before signing with Interscope Records, rapper 50 Cent engaged in a well-publicized feud with Ja Rule and his label Murder Inc. Records. 50 Cent claimed that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who robbed him of his jewelry and also because Ja Rule was &quot;trying to be Tupac&quot;. However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in Queens because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule &quot;getting so much love&quot; from the neighborhood. 50 Cent indirectly confirmed this in an interview with &quot;XXL Magazine&quot;, where 50 Cent states he was upset with Ja Rule for being under the aegis of Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff. A confrontation occurred in Atlanta in which Ja Rule claims he struck 50 Cent with a baseball bat, later his crew stepping in to beat up 50 Cent. Another confrontation occurred in 2000 while in The Hit Factory where rapper Black Child, a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, causing a wound requiring four stitches.

In his book, 50 Cent details how Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff tried to resolve the conflict between him and Ja Rule. Allegedly, McGriff asked 50 Cent to leave them alone because of the money involved.

Since then, Black Child and other Murder Inc. rappers such as Cadillac Tah publicly insulted 50 Cent with &quot;There&#x27;s a Snitch in the Club&quot; by Cadillac Tah, and &quot;The Real Wanksta&quot; by Black Child. In both songs, Black Child details violent actions directed toward 50 Cent. The exchange of insult tracks released from both parties culminated in Ja Rule&#x27;s &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot;, which was an album that returned additional insults to 50 Cent. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent&#x27;s labelmates Eminem, Dr. Dre, Obie Trice, D12, DMX, Busta Rhymes, and the rest of the members of G-Unit, also became involved and released tracks which insulted Ja Rule.

Ja Rule later released &quot;R.U.L.E.&quot; which included the successful single &quot;New York&quot;, featuring Jadakiss and Fat Joe, in which Ja Rule obliquely attacked 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists, reflected in his response, &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;.

Although it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track titled &quot;21 Gunz&quot;. In response, Lloyd Banks and 50 Cent released the track &quot;Return of Ja Fool&quot; on Lloyd Banks&#x27; mixtape &quot;Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now&quot;.

In an interview with MTV, Ja Rule stated, in reference to his album, &quot;The Mirror&quot;:

In May 2011, it was confirmed that both Ja Rule and 50 Cent had ended the feud. Ja Rule said, &quot;I&#x27;m cool. We ain&#x27;t beefing no more. We&#x27;ll never collaborate. That&#x27;s just what it is. You don&#x27;t have to be at war with somebody, but it&#x27;s also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don&#x27;t gotta go to war, but we&#x27;re not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He&#x27;s doing him, and he&#x27;s not thinking about me, and I&#x27;m doing me and I&#x27;m not thinking about him.&quot;

In September 2013, in an interview with Angie Martinez on The Angie Martinez show on HOT 97, both Rule and Irv Gotti acknowledged 50 Cent not only took a toll on Ja Rule&#x27;s prominence, but along with the federal indictment, damaged Murder, Inc., as a music label. They told Martinez their immediate reaction on hearing 50 Cent&#x27;s single, &quot;In Da Club&quot;, on the radio was that it was &quot;so dope&quot; and that they had a problem with it. They also disclosed that they had been blackballed from various award shows where 50 Cent was to perform due to their feud. Notwithstanding seeing 50 Cent as a hustler, they liked his entrepreneurial mentality, and no longer had a problem with him 10 years after their feud. Ja Rule indicated he had plans to write a book surrounding the whole experience.
In early 2018, after four years of taunting Ja Rule, 50 Cent reiginited the beef after he publicly dissed him on &quot;Big Boy&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;, leading to Ja Rule retaliating on Twitter the next day.

====Shady/Aftermath====

The conflict started after 50 Cent signed to Shady Records and Aftermath in 2002. Ja Rule and Irv Gotti expressed dissatisfaction with Eminem and Dr. Dre for signing an artist with whom they were in conflict and threatened to take action against them if they released any 50 Cent tracks deprecatory of Murder Inc.

The conflict escalated when Ja Rule released &quot;Loose Change&quot; attacking 50 Cent, Eminem and Dr. Dre. The song also includes lyrics that insulted Eminem&#x27;s family (most notably his then 7-year-old daughter Hailie Jade) and acquaintances. In response, Eminem, D12, and Obie Trice released the deprecatory track &quot;Hailie&#x27;s Revenge (Doe Rae Mi)&quot; featuring vocals from Eminem&#x27;s daughter.

Busta Rhymes joined the conflict when he was featured on the track &quot;Hail Mary 2003&quot; with Eminem and 50 Cent. The song, which is a remake of 2Pac&#x27;s song &quot;Hail Mary&quot;, was done partially as a response to Ja Rule&#x27;s remake of another 2Pac track, &quot;Pain&quot; (re-titled &quot;So Much Pain&quot;) and because they felt Ja Rule was “imitating” 2Pac. Eminem prevented Ja Rule from appearing on any of the &quot;new&quot; 2Pac songs he produced, including those on &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;.

===DMX===
After Murder Inc. broke up in 1999 due to animosity between DMX and Jay-Z, DMX accused Ja Rule of copying his signature &quot;gruff style&quot;, and the two subsequently fell out. On the single &quot;Where the Hood At?&quot;, DMX disses Ja Rule by replicating lyrics from other Ja Rule songs, referring to Ja Rule&#x27;s controversy of being labeled as homophobic in the lyrics such as &quot;I show no love to homo thugs&quot; or &quot;Last time I checked, you niggas having sex with the same sex&quot;. Ja Rule responded with several disses on his album, &quot;Blood in My Eye&quot;, including &quot;Clap Back&quot;. DMX said that he wanted the dispute to end when he was released from jail in 2005: &quot;[Irv] Gotti came to me in jail and said I want to make peace with you and him. I was like, &#x27;All right, Gotti, let&#x27;s do it man.&quot; DMX and Ja Rule finally ended their feud at VH1&#x27;s 2009 Hip Hop Honors.

====Kurupt====
By his association with DMX, Ja Rule was brought into the beef between DMX and Kurupt, being dissed on Kurupt&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;Callin&#x27; Out Names&quot;. Ja Rule responded with &quot;Still INC&quot; featuring Black Child and Cadillac Tah, a freestyle over Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot; beat. The two eventually squashed their beef on the set of the movie &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; in 2002.

===Foxy Brown===
In October 2002, rapper Foxy Brown dismissed reports of recording a track with rivals Nas and Ja Rule that was &quot;potentially&quot; deprecatory of Jay-Z. During a Thanksgiving week interview in 2002, while on &quot;Doug Banks In the Morning&quot;, Ja Rule stated that he &quot;[couldn&#x27;t] stand Foxy Brown.&quot; Brown reportedly heard Ja Rule&#x27;s comments via a radio while she was helping her mother clean her house. Going against her manager&#x27;s wishes, during her own interview with Doug Banks, Brown informed Banks that she was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by Rule&#x27;s comments. Brown explained she was particularly angry at Rule&#x27;s response, having never met him.

The incident provoked Brown to record the unreleased, &quot;Get Off Me&quot;. In the record, Brown targeted Ja Rule and Eve with homophobic remarks. In 2005, Ja Rule and his two bodyguards were initial suspects in the killing of Willie &quot;Willie Bang Bang&quot; Clark, whom authorities linked as a &quot;revenge&quot; that stemmed back to a robbery case involving Foxy Brown&#x27;s brother.

In September 2009, Ja Rule and Foxy Brown ended their beef at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors, where they celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of their former label, Def Jam Recordings. The feud was squashed after both rappers shared a photo with ex-labelmates DMX and Ludacris.

===Lil&#x27; Mo===
In January 2003, while co-hosting &quot;106 &amp; Park: Prime&quot;, singer Lil&#x27; Mo sent a shout-out to 50 Cent, just seconds after she premiered a Ja Rule video. Ja Rule and the Murda, Inc., clique were outraged. In response, Ja Rule released &quot;Loose Change&quot;, a track deprecatory of Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Chris Lighty and Lil&#x27; Mo. Rule rechristened Mo a &quot;bitch&quot;, and credited himself with causing her popularity. In May 2003, Mo released a freestyle track attacking Ja Rule, where she interpolated the &quot;Used to be my homie, used to be my ace, now I can&#x27;t stand you, yeah I wanna slap the taste out your mouth.&quot; lyrics Dr. Dre used in his 1993 Eazy-E diss track &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day&quot;.

In April 2003, Lil&#x27; Mo sparked additional controversy, complaining of receiving neither recognition nor payment for her contributions to Rule&#x27;s records &quot;I Cry&quot; and &quot;Put It on Me&quot;. Mo told &quot;MTV News&quot;, &quot;Those two records [&quot;I Cry&quot;, &quot;Put It on Me&quot;] ruled 2001. The whole world knows that ... If I speak the truth, I can&#x27;t apologize. I helped that brother sell 3 million records, and I don&#x27;t have a plaque [for &quot;Rule 3:36&quot;].&quot; By way of contrast, she highlighted Jay-Z&#x27;s having given her recognition, a plaque, a thank you card and a bottle of Cristal for her work on his &quot;Parking Lot Pimpin&#x27;&quot;. In 2005, Lil&#x27; Mo filed a lawsuit against Ja Rule, Murda Inc. and Def Jam Records for over $15 million. In 2010, the two reconciled. Lil&#x27; Mo stated that she ended the dispute as Ja Rule&#x27;s career was in decline and noted that &quot;life is too short ... You just never know what people are going through.&quot; In 2011, the two reunited and recorded a track together titled, &quot;U &amp; Me&quot;.

<text>Kish (Sumerian: Kiš; transliteration: Kiški; cuneiform: ; , near modern Tell al-Uhaymir) is an important archaeological site in Babil Governorate (Iraq), located south of Baghdad and east of the ancient city of Babylon. The Ubaid period site of Ras al-Amiyah is away. It was occupied from the Ubaid period to the Hellenistic period. In Early Dynastic times the city&#x27;s patron deity was Ishtar with her consort Ea. Her temple, at Tell Ingharra, was (E)-hursag-kalama. By Old Babylonian times the patron deities had become Zababa, along with his consort, the goddess Bau and Istar. His temple Emeteursag (later Ekišiba) was at Uhaimir.
==History==

Kish was occupied from the Ubaid period (c.5300–4300 BC), gaining prominence as one of the pre-eminent powers in the region during the Early Dynastic Period when it reached its maximum extent of 230 hectares.
===3rd Millennium BC===
The &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot; states that Kish was the first city to have kings following the deluge. The 1st dynasty of Kish begins with Ĝushur. Ĝushur&#x27;s successor is called Kullassina-bel, but this is actually a sentence in Akkadian meaning &quot;All of them were lord&quot;. Thus, some scholars have suggested that this may have been intended to signify the absence of a central authority in Kish for a time. The names of the next nine kings of Kish preceding Etana are Nanĝišlišma, En-tarah-ana, Babum, Puannum, Kalibum, Kalumum, Zuqaqip, Aba, Mašda, and Arwium. Archaeological finds from the Uruk period indicate that the site was part of the Uruk Expansion and hence originally Sumerian language speaking. Ignace Gelb identified Kish as the center of the earliest East Semitic culture which he calls the Kish civilization, however the concept has been challenged by more recent scholarship.

Of the twenty-first king of Kish on the list, Enmebaragesi, who is said to have captured the weapons of Elam, is the first name confirmed by archaeological finds from his reign. He is also known through other literary references, in which he and his son Aga of Kish are portrayed as contemporary rivals of Dumuzid, the Fisherman, and Gilgamesh, early rulers of Uruk.

Some early kings of Kish are known through archaeology, but are not named on the &quot;SKL&quot;. It can be difficult to determine if these are actually rulers of Kish or had merely adopted the common appellation &quot;King of Kish&quot;. This includes Mesilim, who built temples in Adab and Lagash, where he seems to have exercised some control. Two other examples were the sleeve of an Early Dynatic II bronze sword found at Girsu which read &quot;Lugal-namni[r]-sum (is) king of Kis&quot; and a statue fragment found at Nippur which read &quot;Enna-il, king of Kis&quot;.
After its early supremacy, Kish declined economically and militarily, but retained a strong political and symbolic significance. Its influence reached as far west as the city of Ebla near the Mediterranean Sea, as shown by the Ebla tablets. According to the Ebla tablets, Kish was defeated in the time of Ebla ruler Ishar-Damu, probably by Uruk. Shortly afterward Kish joined Ebla in defeating Mari, followed by the marriage of the Eblan princess Keshdut to a king of Kish. Just as with Nippur to the south, control of Kish was a prime element in legitimizing dominance over the north of Mesopotamia. Because of the city&#x27;s symbolic value, strong rulers later claimed the traditional title &quot;King of Kish&quot;, even if they were from Akkad, Ur, Assyria, Isin, Larsa or Babylon. One of the earliest to adopt this title upon subjecting Kish to his empire was King Mesannepada of Ur.

Sargon of Akkad, the founder of the Akkadian Empire, came from the area near Kish, called Azupiranu according to a much later Neo-Assyrian text purporting to be an autobiography of Sargon.
===Old Babylonian period===
By the early part of the First Dynasty of Babylon Kish was under the control of Babylon with the tenth year name of ruler Sumu-abum (c. 1897–1883 BC) being &quot;Year in which (Sumu-abum) made for Kish its city wall (reaching) heaven&quot; (repeated in following year). Not long afterward, Kish was conquered by Sumuel of Larsa as reflected in his eleventh year name &quot;Year the army of Kisz was smitten by weapons&quot;, repeated in the following three year names. In the 13th year of Sumu-la-El he reports destroying Kish (repeated in following four years) and then destroying the city wall of Kish in his 19th year and in his 30th year &quot;Year the temple of Zababa, the Emeteursag / the house, ornament of the heros (Zababa), was built&quot;. At this point Kish came under the control of the city-state of Eshnunna under rulers DIpiq-Adad II and DNaram-Sin. By the time of Babylon ruler Sin-Muballit (c. 1813–1792 BC), father of Hammurabi, Kish was firmly under the control of Babylon and would stay that way until the waning days of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The rulers of Babylon at its peak of power, Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna, are known to have done extensive construction at Kish, including rebuilding the city wall. By this time, the eastern settlement at Hursagkalama had become viewed as a distinct city, and it was probably not included in the walled area.

At some period or periods within the Old Babylonian period, Kish was under the control of a series of rulers generally called the Manana Dynasty. Most of what is known comes from two illicitly excavated archive thought to be from the town of Damrum, near Kish. These rulers include Iawian, Halium, Abdi-Erah, Manana, and four others. Several year names of Iawium are known including &quot;Year Sumu-ditana died&quot;. Samsu-Ditana was the last ruler of the First Dynasty of Babylon. One ruler, Ashduniarim is known from a long inscription on a clay foundation cone found at Kish.
===Later history===
The succeeding Kassite dynasty moved the capital from Babylon to Dur-Kurigalzu and Kish was diminished. There is some evidence of Kassite activity in Kish. Afterward Kish appears to have significantly declined in importance, as it is only mentioned in a few documents from the later second millennium BC. During the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, Kish is mentioned more frequently in texts. However, by this time, Kish proper (Tell al-Uhaymir) had been almost completely abandoned, and the settlement which texts from this period call &quot;Kish&quot; was probably Hursagkalama (Tell Ingharra).

After the Achaemenid period, Kish completely disappears from the historical record; however, archaeological evidence indicates that the town remained in existence for a long time thereafter. Although the site at Tell al-Uhaymir was mostly abandoned, Tell Ingharra was revived during the Parthian period, growing into a sizeable town with a large mud-brick fortress. During the Sasanian period, the site of the old city was completely abandoned in favor of a string of connected settlements spread out along both sides of the Shatt en-Nil canal. This last incarnation of Kish prospered under Sasanian and then Islamic rule, before being finally abandoned during the later years of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258).

==Archaeology==
Kish is located east of the ancient city of Babylon and south of modern Baghdad. The Kish archaeological site is an oval area roughly , transected into east and west sections by the dry former bed of the Euphrates River, encompassing around 40 mounds scattered over an area of about 24 square kilometers, the largest being Uhaimir and Ingharra.
After irregularly excavated tablets began appearing at the beginning of the twentieth century, François Thureau-Dangin identified the site as being Kish. Those tablets ended up in a variety of museums. Because of its close proximity to Babylon (of which early explorers believed it was part) the site was visited by a number of explorers and travelers in the 19th century, some involving excavation, most notably by the foreman of Hormuzd Rassam who dug there with a crew of 20 men for a number of months. Austen Henry Layard and also Julius Oppert dug some trenches there in the early 1852 though the finds were lost in the Qurnah Disaster. None of this early work was published. The name of the site as Kish was determined by George Smith in 1872 based on an inscribed brick of Adad-apla-iddina which had been discovered 60 years before. A French archaeological team under Henri de Genouillac excavated at Tell Uhaimir for three months in January 1912, finding some 1,400 Old Babylonian tablets which were distributed to the Istanbul Archaeology Museum and the Louvre. He also excavated at a Neo-Babylonian monumental building on Tell Ingharra. At Tell Bander he uncovered Parthian materials.

Later, a joint Field Museum and University of Oxford team under Stephen Langdon excavated from 1923 to 1933, with the recovered materials split between Chicago and the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. Seventeen different mounds were excavated but the main focus of the excavations was at Tell Ingharra and Tell Uhaimir. The actual excavations at Tell Uhaimir were led initially by E. MacKay and later by L. C. Watelin. Work on the faunal and flora remains was conducted by Henry Field. Even by the standards of the day, the documentation of this excavation (findspots provenance etc.), were sorely lacking. This was compounded by the death of the principals within a few years and the beginning of World War II. In recent decades there has been a major effort to recreate the data from all the old field notes and finds. A bone awl from Phase 2 in the YWN area, the transition between Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods, was accelerator radiocarbon dated to 2471–2299 BC (3905 ± 27 C14 years BP).

A surface survey of Kish and the area around it was conducted in 1966–1967. It showed that there were villages at Uhaimir and Ingharra in the Ubaid and Protoliterate periods. These expanded into two cites in ED I and reached a peak in Ed III with Ingharra becoming the larger city at that time. The site was lightly occupied in the Akkadian period with modest towns on Ingharra and Mound W. During Ur III, Isin-Larsa, and Old Babylonian times there was a revival mostly centered around Uhaimir. The later half of the 2nd millennium BC showed light occupation, all on Mound W. In the Neo-Babylonian period the rivercourse shifted from north to west, with Uhaimir having a large temple with associated fort, a major temple on Ingharra, and a major town on Mound W. The Achaemenid/Seleucid settlement was limited to the western end of Uhaimir. The Parthian and Sassanian periods showed light occupation, except for Tell Bandar. As part of this survey soundings were made at Umm-el-Jir (the site named Umm el-Jerab that Oriental Institute had found Old Akkadian tablets in 1932) 27 kilometers from Kish.

More recently, a Japanese team from the Kokushikan University led by Hideo Fuji and Ken Matsumoto excavated at Tell Uhaimir in 1989–89, 2000, and 2001. The final season lasted only one week. Work was focused mainly on Tell A with some time spent at the plano-convex building.

In February 2022 Iraqi archaeaologists conducted Ground Penetrating Radar and Electrical Resistivity scans of a test 30 meter by 30 meter section at Kish.

In the Chicago expedition to Kish in 1923–1933, several other sections are included:
*Tell Ingharra – Twin ziggurats and Neo-Babylonian Temple Complex.
*Area P: Located in the Northern part of Kish which the Plano-convex Building resided
*Mound A, which includes a palace and a cemetery
*Tell H, identified roughly as &quot;The Sasanian Settlement&quot;
===Tell Uhaimir===
This site consists of three subtells (T, X, and Z). Tell Z was the location of one of the main ziggurats and where temples had been built and rebuilt from the Old Babylonian to the Neo-Babylonian periods. At Tell X a 1st Millennium BC fort was uncovered and at Tell T some Old Babylonian structures were found. Between Uhaimir and Ingharra are three smaller tells and further east Tell W where Neo-Assyrian tablets as well as an entire Neo-Babylonian archive was found consisting of about 1000 tablets.
===Tell Ingharra===
Located in the eastern side of the ancient Kish, Tell Ingharra was extensively explored during the Chicago excavation and provided the best known archaeological sequence in the 3rd millennium BC site. The site consists of several subtells (A, B, D, E, F, G, H, and Tell Bandar which is made up of Tells C and V). In particular, the 1923 excavation concentrated heavily on mound E with its twin ziggurats, while the roughly 130 meter square Neo-Babylonian temple, built on an Early Dynastic plano-copnvex platform, was one of the two buildings that was properly described in a published report.

The twin ziggurats were built of small plano-convex bricks in a herringbone fashion on the summit of Tell Ingharra. The larger one is located on the south-west side of the temple and the smaller one on the south-east side. The excavation report mainly focused on the larger ziggurat while there had been only one report on the smaller one by Mackay. Based on the findings from the larger ziggurat, it is suggested that the structures were built at the end of the Early Dynastic IIIa period to commemorate the city. The fascination of the ziggurats was interesting to the excavators as it was the only Early Dynastic structure that was not destroyed or obscured by later reconstructions, which was why it provided valuable evidence of that time period.

As for the temple complex, the findings of the temple had determined that the mound was part of the city of Hursagkalama. It was used as an active religious centre until after 482 BC. They also had identified the builder as Nabonidus or Nebuchadnezzar II based on the bricks with inscriptions and barrel cylinder fragments reported in the temple.

An Early Dynastic I/IIIa cemetery extended to the south towards Mound A with a number of high status graves containing multiple burials and carts drawn by equids or bovids and are considered as predecessors to the royal burials at Ur.
===Area P===

This area, north of tell W, was unearthed during the second excavation season (1923–1924) led by Mackay, which uncovered the &#x27;Plano-convex building&#x27; (PCB). But outstanding discoveries in Palace A rapidly overshadowed the contemporary excavation here, and the building remained partially uncovered.

Revealed by its stratigraphy and pottery assemblage was the existence of three distinct architectural phases. The earliest archaeological occupation dates back to the ED II period. Above it, rested the massive ED III construction – the PCB. Multiple rooms in the PCB exhibited layers of ashes and charcoals with arrowheads and copper blades, attested that the PCB suffered significant destruction twice during the late ED III period. After its destruction, the PCB was abandoned. Located above later floors of the PCB were scattered burials during the Akkadian period.
====The &#x27;Plano-convex building&#x27;====

The Plano-convex building was a fortified construction built extensively with plano-convex bricks. It displayed the socio-economic dynamics at Kish during the ED III period. No characteristic linking the building to a religious construct. Instead, the Plano-convex building is recognized as a public building associated with the economical production of beer, textile and oil. The PCB might have also housed the administrative center powered by the elites. First recognized by Margueron, scholars have divided the building into four main sectors based on the architectural layout:
*Sector A: Production area
*Sector B: Inconclusive but arguably an administration area
*Sector C: Unknown but exhibit a high degree of segregation
*Sector D: Private, domestic area for housing activities
===Mound A===
Mound A, which includes a cemetery and an Early Dynastic III palace, was discovered during 1922–1925 excavations conducted by Ernest Mackay, under the Field Museum and Oxford University. Although it was earlier a part of the Ingharra mounds lying about 70 meters to the north, it is now separated by an alluvial valley. The seals and other artifacts found in the graves, dating back to a later age than the palace, show that the site was used as a cemetery from the end of the Early Dynastic period until the early Akkadian Empire period.
====The Sumerian Palace====
The palace, which was unearthed beneath the mound, had fallen into decay and was used as a burial ground during Early Dynastic III. It comprises three sections – the original building, the eastern wing and stairway, and the annex. The original building, which was composed of unbaked plano-convex bricks (23 × 15 × 3.5–6 cm), had extremely thick walls, while the annex, which was added later to the south of the building, had comparatively thinner walls. A 2.30 m wide passage was constructed within the outer wall of the original building to prevent invaders from entering the structure.

The archaeological findings within the palace lack pottery items, the most remarkable among them was a fragment of slate and limestone inlay work, which represents the scene of a king punishing a prisoner.
===Tell H===

In the 1923–1933 Expedition, Tell H became the focus of its final three seasons (1930–1933). For personal reasons of the excavators, the Kish material in this section remained selective, mainly yielding Sasanian pottery, coins, incantation bowls and so on. The dating of this section crossed a range of periods, with layer upon layer built on the site. Evidence shows that in the Early Dynastic III Period, there once even existed a twin city. Therefore, the city occupies a relatively unsettled presence in chronology. But from the excavation, eight buildings were identified as from the Sasanian period, thus making this place primarily identified as the Sasanian Settlement. Researchers suspect that some of the buildings might function together as a complex serving different purposes, including royal residence, storage, and administration.

The most prominent finding is the stucco decoration in the first two buildings, while the 1923–1933 team also figured out the floor plan and architectural structure of others. It was partly through these stucco decorations that researchers identified the royal resident to be Bahram V (420–438 AD)—Sasanian kings had their distinctive crowns separately, and the unique crown pattern on stucco served as evidence to support this argument. In Kish, which once functioned as a transfer station between Ctesiphon and Hira, Bahram V built palaces for summer entertainment, which explains why one of the buildings has a huge water tank in the middle, probably functioning to cool down the court in summers. Around Bahram V&#x27;s palaces, a group of Sasanian people also took residence and developed a system of settlement and commercial activities.

==List of rulers==
The &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot; lists only 39 rulers among four dynasties of Kish. A fifth dynasty is known and it was an Amorite dynasty unnamed on the &quot;SKL&quot;. The following list should not be considered complete:

<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Nuno Álvares Pereira, OCarm (; 24 June 1360 – 1 November 1431) was a very successful Portuguese general who had a decisive role in the 1383–1385 Crisis that assured Portugal&#x27;s independence from Castile. He later became a mystic and was beatified by Pope Benedict XV in 1918, and canonised by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009.

Nuno Álvares Pereira is often referred to as the Saint Constable () or as Saint Nuno of Saint Mary (), his religious name. He was count of Barcelos, Ourém and Arraiolos.

==Family==

Nuno Álvares Pereira was born on 24 June 1360 in Cernache do Bonjardim, central Portugal, the illegitimate son of Dom Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, prior of Crato and Iria Gonçalves do Carvalhal. His grandfather was Dom Gonçalo Pereira, the archbishop of Braga from 1326 until 1349. He was descended from the oldest Portuguese and Galician nobility.

About a year after his birth, the child was legitimised by royal decree and so he was able to receive a knightly education typical of the offspring of the noble families of the time.

At 13 years of age he became page to Queen Leonor. At age 16, he married Leonor de Alvim, a rich young widow. Three children were born to the union, two boys who died early in life, and a girl, Beatriz, who married Afonso, son of King John I and founder of the House of Aviz.

== Military life ==
Álvares Pereira began military service in 1373, when he was only 13, and helped stop an invasion from Castile. However, according to his own words, his first military campaigns were no more than skirmishes on the borders of Portugal. He was an impetuous and brave young man who soon showed himself to be an excellent leader.

When King Ferdinand I of Portugal died in 1383, his only heir was Beatrice, married to King John I of Castile. In order to preserve Portuguese independence, the nobles supported the claim of King Ferdinand&#x27;s half-brother John, Master of Aviz to the throne. After his first victory over the Castilians, in the Battle of Atoleiros (April 1384), John of Aviz named Nuno Álvares Pereira protector and constable of Portugal, in practice supreme commander of Portugal&#x27;s armies, and count of Ourém. He was only 24 years old.

Álvares Pereira used guerrilla tactics trying to dislodge the Castilian army besieging Lisbon in 1384 but plague finally drove them away.

In April 1385, John of Aviz was recognized as king by the Cortes. This triggered an invasion of the country by King John I of Castile in support of his wife&#x27;s rights to the throne. Nuno Álvares Pereira was engaged against the northern cities loyal to the Castilians. During this time of war, he fed the hungry populations of his Castilian opposition at his own expense.
On 14 August 1385, at Aljubarrota he led 6,500 volunteers to victory against a Castilian force of over 30,000, thus ending the threat of annexation. He attributed the victory to the Blessed Virgin, whose name, Maria, was inscribed on his sword. Dedicated to Mary, he fasted on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The banner he chose as his personal standard bore the image of the cross, of Mary and of the saintly knights James and George. At his own expense he built numerous churches and monasteries, among which was the Carmelite church in Lisbon and the church of Our Lady of Victories at Batalha.

After the 1383-1385 Crisis, Álvares Pereira was made the count of Arraiolos and Barcelos, which, along with the previous title, were the only three countships existing at the time and which had been taken from nobles who had taken the part of Castile. He was also made the major majordomo of the realm.

Not wanting to give the enemy room to manoeuvre, the king of Portugal and his supreme general took the offensive and raided several Castilian towns, defeating once again a much larger Castilian army at the Battle of Valverde. He continued to watch out for the king of Castile until his death in 1390. When hostilities ended, he gave the bulk of his wealth to the veterans.

== Religious life ==

After the death of his wife, he became a Carmelite friar (he joined the Order in 1423) at the Carmo Convent (Lisbon) which he had founded in fulfilment of a vow, and took the name of Friar Nuno of Saint Mary (). There he lived until his death on 1 November 1431. He was noted for his prayer, his practise of penance and his filial devotion to the Mother of God. Nuno suffered from debilitating arthritis.

During the last year of his life, King John I went to visit and embrace him for the last time. He wept for he considered Nuno Álvares Pereira his closest friend, the man who had put him on the throne and saved his country&#x27;s independence.

Nuno Álvares Pereira&#x27;s tomb was lost in the famous 1755 Lisbon earthquake. His epitaph read:

== Legacy ==

Álvares Pereira was beatified on 23 January 1918 by Pope Benedict XV. He was celebrated liturgically on 1 April as an obligatory memorial by the Order of Carmelites and as an optional memorial by the Order of Discalced Carmelites.

Álvares Pereira had been on the point of being canonised by decree in 1940 by Pope Pius XII. According to a recent statement by the postulator general of the Carmelite Order, his canonisation was postponed for diplomatic reasons (the Portuguese ambassador indicated that the time was not right).

On 3 July 2008 Pope Benedict XVI signed two decrees in Rome, promulgating the heroic virtues of Nuno Álvares Pereira and the authenticity of a miracle that had already been previously confirmed as such by medical and theological commissions. By this act, the pope formally canonised Friar Nuno de Santa Maria Álvares Pereira. The public celebration of his canonisation took place on 26 April 2009 in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square in the Vatican City. The Carmelites now celebrate St Nuno on 6 November; the date also appointed for his feast in Portugal.

The Blessed Nuno Society is a mission society and prayer apostolate officially recognized by the Catholic Church as a diocesan Private Association of the Christian Faithful and affiliated with, the Catholic Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota.

<doc id="144015" wikidata="Q76985" url="?curid=144015" title="Samson Raphael Hirsch">
<text>Samson Raphael Hirsch (; June 20, 1808 – December 31, 1888) was a German Orthodox rabbi best known as the intellectual founder of the &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; school of contemporary Orthodox Judaism. Occasionally termed &quot;neo-Orthodoxy&quot;, his philosophy, together with that of Azriel Hildesheimer, has had a considerable influence on the development of Orthodox Judaism.

Hirsch was rabbi in Oldenburg, Emden, and was subsequently appointed chief rabbi of Moravia. From 1851 until his death, Hirsch led the secessionist Orthodox community in Frankfurt am Main. He wrote a number of influential books, and for a number of years published the monthly journal &quot;Jeschurun&quot;, in which he outlined his philosophy of Judaism. He was a vocal opponent of Reform Judaism, Zionism, and similarly opposed early forms of Conservative Judaism.

== Early years and education ==
Hirsch was born in Hamburg, which was then a part of Napoleonic France. His father, Raphael Arye Hirsch, though a merchant, devoted much of his time to Torah studies; his grandfather, Mendel Frankfurter, was the founder of the Talmud Torah schools in Hamburg and unsalaried assistant rabbi of the neighboring congregation of Altona; and his granduncle, Yehudah Leib (Löb) Frankfurter Shapira (1743-1846), was the author of several Hebrew works, including the Torah commentary &quot;Harechasim le-Bik&#x27;ah&quot; (הרכסים לבקעה).

Hirsch was a student of &quot;Chacham&quot; Isaac Bernays, and the Biblical and Talmudical education which he received, combined with his teacher&#x27;s influence, led him to determine not to become a merchant, as his parents had desired, but to choose the rabbinical vocation. In furtherance of this plan, he studied Talmud from 1828 to 1829 in Mannheim under Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger. He received &quot;semicha&quot; (ordination) from Rabbi Ettlinger in 1830, at the age of 22. He then entered the University of Bonn, where he studied at the same time as his future antagonist, Abraham Geiger.

==Career==



=== Oldenburg ===
In 1830, Hirsch was elected chief rabbi (&quot;Landesrabbiner&quot;) of the Principality of Oldenburg. During this period, he wrote his &quot;Neunzehn Briefe über Judenthum,&quot; (&quot;Nineteen Letters on Judaism&quot;) which were published under the pseudonym of &quot;Ben Usiel&quot; (or &quot;Uziel&quot;), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it was &quot;something new — a brilliant, intellectual presentation of Orthodox Judaism in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances&quot;.

One of the young intellectuals strongly influenced by the &quot;Nineteen Letters&quot; was Heinrich Graetz. Following a personal letter that Graetz wrote to Hirsch, Hirsch offered Graetz to host him at his own house for the continuation of his studies. Graetz then lived at Hirsch&#x27;s house in Oldenburg from 1837 to 1840, as a pupil, companion, and amanuensis.&quot;
Hirsch&#x27;s major works are discussed in further detail below.

In 1838, Hirsch published, &quot;as a necessary concomitant&quot; of the &quot;Letters&quot;, his &quot;Horeb, oder Versuche über Jissroel&#x27;s Pflichten in der Zerstreuung&quot;, as a text-book on Judaism for educated Jewish youth. He had written &quot;Horeb&quot; first, but his publishers doubted that a work defending traditional Judaism would find a market in those times with reform in vogue.

In 1839, he published &quot;Erste Mittheilungen aus Naphtali&#x27;s Briefwechsel&quot;, a polemical essay against the reforms in Judaism proposed by Geiger and the contributors to the latter&#x27;s &quot;Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für jüdische Theologie&quot; (such as Michael Creizenach); and in 1844, he published &quot;Zweite Mittheilungen aus einem Briefwechsel über die Neueste Jüdische Literatur&quot;, also polemical in tendency and attacking Holdheim&#x27;s &quot;Die Autonomie der Rabbinen&quot; (1843).

=== Emden ===
Hirsch remained in Oldenburg until 1841 when he was elected chief rabbi of the Hanoverian districts of Aurich and Osnabrück, with his residence in Emden. During this five-year post, he was taken up almost completely by communal work and had little time for writing. He did, however, found a secondary school with a curriculum featuring both Jewish studies and a secular program, for the first time employing his motto &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; (&quot;The Torah is maximalized in partnership with worldly involvement&quot;).

In 1843, Hirsch applied for the post of Chief Rabbi of the British Empire. Out of 13 candidates, mostly from Germany, he reached the shortlist of four: Nathan Marcus Adler, Hirsch Hirschfeld, Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, and Hirsch. Adler won the position on December 1, 1844. With 135 communities having one vote each, Adler received 121 votes, Hirschfeld 12, and Hirsch 2.

=== Nikolsburg ===
In 1846, Hirsch was called to the rabbinate of Nikolsburg in Moravia, and in 1847, he became chief rabbi of Moravia and Austrian Silesia. In Austria, he spent five years in the re-organization of the Jewish congregations and the instruction of numerous disciples; he was also, in his official capacity as chief rabbi, a member of the Moravian &quot;Landtag&quot;, where he campaigned for more civil rights for Jews in Moravia.

In Moravia, Hirsch had a difficult time, on the one side receiving criticism from the Reform-minded, and on the other side from a deeply traditional Orthodox element, which found some of his reforms too radical. Hirsch placed a much stronger emphasis on a deep study of the entire Hebrew Bible, rather than just the Torah and selected Bible readings, in addition to Talmud, as had been the custom of religious Jews up until then.

=== Frankfurt am Main ===
In 1851, he accepted a call as rabbi of an Orthodox separatist group in Frankfurt am Main, a part of the Jewish community of which had otherwise largely accepted classical Reform Judaism. This group, known as the &quot;Israelite Religious Society&quot; (&quot;Israelitische Religions-Gesellschaft&quot;, or IRG), became, under his administration, a great congregation, numbering about 500 families. Hirsch remained rabbi of this congregation for the rest of his life.

Hirsch organized the &quot;Realschule&quot; and the &quot;Bürgerschule&quot;, in which thorough Jewish training was provided, along with those aspects of secular training deemed true according to the Torah (&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot;). He also founded and edited the monthly magazine &quot;Jeschurun&quot; (1855–1870; new series, 1882 et seq); most of the pages of the Jeschurun were filled by himself.
During this period he produced his commentaries on &quot;Chumash&quot; (Pentateuch), &quot;Tehillim&quot; (Psalms) and &quot;siddur&quot; (prayer book).

====&quot;Austritt&quot;====
In 1876, Edward Lasker (a Jewish parliamentarian in the Prussian Landtag) introduced the &quot;Secession Bill&quot; (&quot;Austrittsgesetz&quot;), which would enable Jews to secede from a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether &quot;Austritt&quot; (secession) was required by Jewish law. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated &quot;Main Community&quot; (&quot;Grossgemeinde&quot;). His contemporary Isaac Dov (Seligman Baer) Bamberger, Rabbi of Würzburg, argued that as long as the &quot;Grossgemeinde&quot; made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many hurt feelings, and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.

=== Final years ===
During the final years of his life, Hirsch put his efforts in the founding of the &quot;Freie Vereinigung für die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums&quot;, an association of independent Jewish communities. During the 30 years after his death, this organization would be used as a model for the formation of the international Orthodox Agudas Yisrael movement. Hirsch had a great love for the Land of Israel, which is apparent from his writings, but was opposed to the proto-Zionist activities of Zvi Hirsch Kalischer. He opposed any movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era. In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.

From reports of his family members, it seems likely that Hirsch contracted malaria while in Emden, which continued to plague him during the rest of life with febrile episodes.

Hirsch died in 1888 in Frankfurt am Main, and is buried there.

Hirsch&#x27;s son Mendel Hirsch (1833–1900) was a scholar and writer; his granddaughter Rahel Hirsch (1870–1953) became the first female professor of medicine in Prussia.

== Works==


===Commentary on the Torah===
Hirsch&#x27;s innovative and influential commentary on the Pentateuch 

(&quot;Uebersetzung und Erklärung des Pentateuchs&quot;, &quot;Translation and explanation of the Pentateuch&quot;; 5 volumes published 1867–78), has been &quot;hailed as a classic&quot; since the publication of the first volume, &quot;Bereshit&quot;.
According to Hirsch, the goal of the commentary was to expound the text by ascertaining the exact meaning of the words, their etymology, philology, and origin, and, this achieved, &quot;to establish, on the basis of halakhic and aggadic interpretations, the Jewish &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;&quot;.

A feature of the commentary is its analysis of the meanings and symbols in the religious precepts (&quot;mitzvot&quot;); see further below. This analysis, too, builds on the discussion of the Hebrew, while at the same time, it draws on the treatment of each &quot;mitzvah&quot; in the Oral Torah, intentionally consistent with the final application in Halakha. 
The commentary gained worldwide popularity for its scope of insight and information offered to scholar and layman alike, and is still widely referenced.

===Nineteen Letters===
Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Letters on Judaism&quot; (&quot;Neunzehn Briefe über Judenthum&quot;), published in 1836 under the pseudonym &quot;Ben Uziel&quot;, offered an intellectual presentation of Orthodox Judaism in classical German and a &quot;fearless, uncompromising defense&quot; of all its institutions and ordinances. (See under Oldenburg above.)
It was written in the form of a fictional correspondence between a young rabbi/philosopher and a youthful intellectual. 
The first letter, the intellectual&#x27;s, outlines the challenges that emancipation created for modern Jews, and questions the continued relevance of Judaism. The rabbi responds in the subsequent letters, discussing, in a structured sequence, God, man, and Jewish history; leading to a discussion of the &quot;mitzvot&quot; and their classification (as employed in &quot;Horeb&quot;). 
The work made a profound impression on German Jewish circles and has been republished and translated several times; it is still influential and often taught.

===&quot;Horeb&quot;===
&quot;Horeb&quot; (subtitled &quot;Versuche über Jissroel&#x27;s Pflichten in der Zerstreuung&quot;, “Essays on the Duties of the Jewish People in the Diaspora”), published 1838, is Rabbi Hirsch&#x27;s presentation of Jewish law and observances, with particular emphasis on their underlying ideas, capturing the &quot;unifying ideological threads&quot;; 
these discussions are still regularly taught and referenced.

The title is a reference to the (Ten) Commandments; Mount Horeb, , is another name for Mount Sinai.
&quot;Horeb&quot; is organized into six sections, according to Hirsch&#x27;s classification of the commandments. 
As for the &quot;Letters&quot;, its historical background is the enlightenment, and particularly the beginnings of Reform Judaism, and it thus constituted an attempt &quot;to lead the young generation of Jewry back to the Divine law.&quot;
See also below.
In it Hirsch shows that the Torah&#x27;s &quot;mitzvot&quot;, are not mere &quot;ceremonies&quot;, but &quot;duties&quot; of Israel. 
It was then, to some extent, &quot;a necessary concomitant of the Letters&quot;.
It was conceived, also, to deal with the practical observances of Judaism - providing summarised Halachot relevant to each sub-section.

===Commentary on the &quot;Siddur&quot; and Psalms===
Rabbi Hirsch left in manuscript at the time of his death a translation and explanation of the prayer-book, which was subsequently published. 
His commentary on Pirkei Avot here, has been republished separately. 
His commentary on the book of Psalms (&quot;Uebersetzung und Erklärung der Psalmen&quot;, 1882) is still widely read; it underpins much of his &quot;siddur&quot; commentary.

===Works of activism===
Works here (besides similar mentioned above) include:
* Pamphlet: &quot;Jüdische Anmerkungen zu den Bemerkungen eines Protestanten&quot; (anon.), Emden, 1841- response to a provocative and anti-Semitic pamphlet by an anonymous Protestant
* Pamphlet: &quot;Die Religion im Bunde mit dem Fortschritt&quot; (anon.), Frankfurt am Main, 1854 - response to provocations from the side of the Reform-dominated &quot;Main Community&quot;
* Pamphlets during the Secession Debate:
** &quot;Das Princip der Gewissensfreiheit&quot; (The principle of freedom of conscience), 1874
** &quot;Der Austritt aus der Gemeinde&quot; (Leaving the community), 1876
* &quot;Ueber die Beziehungen des Talmuds zum Judenthum&quot; (On the Talmud&#x27;s Relationships with Judaism), 1884 - a defense of Talmudic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia

===Translations and collections===
Most of Hirsch&#x27;s writings have been translated into English and Hebrew by his descendants, starting with &quot;Horeb&quot; in the 1950s (by Dayan Isidor Grunfeld of London) and his Torah commentary in the 1960s (by his grandson Isaac Levi, also of London). Horeb was translated into Hebrew already in 1892.

The publication, in several volumes, of his collected writings (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; or &quot;Nachalath Zwi&quot;) was begun in 1902. The bulk of these, that had previously been published in German in 1902-1912 under the title &quot;Nachalath Zwi&quot;, were translated between 1984 and 2012 by the &quot;Rabbi Dr. Joseph Breuer Foundation&quot; (established to perpetuate the memory of Breuer, Hirsch&#x27;s grandson, via publication of Hirsch&#x27;s (and Breur&#x27;s) writings).
Many of the &quot;Collected Writings&quot; are available online and linked here.

&quot;Nineteen Letters&quot; was translated into English by Bernard Drachman in 1899 and 1960 by Jacob Breuer based on Drachman&#x27;s translation. The latest translation to English was prepared by Karin Paritzky and revised by Joseph Elias (who states that they &quot;benefited greatly from the two earlier editions&quot;). Elias glosses Breuer&#x27;s edition as &quot;very readable&quot; while panning it as an achievement reached &quot;by the omission or simplification of a good many passages, so that the reader does not obtain the full meaning that the author intended.&quot;

== Themes in his work ==
Hirsch lived in the post-Napoleonic era, an epoch when Jews had been granted civil rights in a large number of European countries, leading to a call for reform. A large segment of his work focuses on the possibilities for Orthodox Judaism in such an era, when freedom of religion also meant the freedom to practice Torah precepts without persecution and ridicule.

The principle of &quot;Austritt&quot;, an independent Orthodoxy, flows naturally from his view on the place of Judaism in his epoch: If Judaism is to gain from these civil liberties, it has to be able to develop independently — without having to lend implicit or explicit approval to efforts at reformation.

His other major work involves the symbolic meaning of many Torah commandments and passages. Indeed, his work &quot;Horeb&quot; (1837) focuses to a large degree on the possible meanings and symbols in religious precepts. This work was continued in his Torah commentary and his articles in the Jeschurun journal (&quot;Collected Writings&quot;, vol. III, is a collation of these articles).

A final area of his work, which has only recently been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the Hebrew language. Most of this work is contained in his Torah commentary, where he analyses and compares the &quot;shorashim&quot; (three-letter root forms) of a large number of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a phonetic similarity, have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well. Although this effort was, in his own words, &quot;totally unscientific&quot;, it has led to the recent publication of an &quot;etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language&quot;.

Although Hirsch does not mention his influences (apart from traditional Jewish sources), later authors have identified ideas from the Kuzari (Yehuda Halevi), Nahmanides, and the Maharal of Prague in his works. Nevertheless, most of his ideas are original.

In a 1995 edition of Hirsch&#x27; Nineteen Letters, commentator Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch&#x27; sources in Rabbinic literature, parallels in his other works and those of other post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers. Elias also attempts to refute particular interpretations of his philosophy, such as the notion that much of his thinking was rooted in Kantian secular philosophy.

While the Zionist movement was not founded during his lifetime, it is clear from his responses to Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era. In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.

== Influence and controversy ==
There is considerable controversy over Hirsch&#x27;s legacy; this is a matter of debate amongst three parties: Haredi (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), Modern Orthodox, and Hirsch&#x27;s descendants. While it is undisputed that his &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; was his real innovation, the exact implementation has been greatly debated.

Those on Orthodoxy&#x27;s right wing hold that Hirsch himself approved of secular studies as a &quot;Horaas Sha&#x27;ah&quot;, or temporary dispensation, only in order to save Orthodox Jewry of the nineteenth century from the threat posed by assimilation. While a &quot;yeshiva&quot; student in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Shimon Schwab obtained the opinions of various Poskim (authorities in Jewish law) to this effect (see Selected Writings, &quot;These and Those&quot;, where Schwab himself disagrees).

At the other end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews understand Hirsch in the sense of Torah Umadda, meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its own sake (this view is propagated in several articles in &quot;Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought&quot;, published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their own sake.

In contrast, a third, middle opinion is proposed.
It is held by Hirsch&#x27;s son-in-law and successor Rabbi Solomon Breuer, his grandson Rabbi Joseph Breuer, the latter&#x27;s successor Rabbi Shimon Schwab, his great-grandson Professor Mordechai Breuer (historian), Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, Rabbi Joseph Elias in his commentary to &quot;The Nineteen Letters&quot;, and some Jewish historians that both of these understandings of Hirsch&#x27;s philosophy are misguided, and improper historical revisionism.
* In response to the &quot;temporary dispensation&quot; theory: Hirsch in &quot;Collected Writings&quot; continually stresses the philosophical and religious imperative of &quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; for all times. Hirsch himself directly addressed this contention: &quot;&quot;Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.&quot; 
* In response to the &quot;Torah Umadda&quot; theory: Hirschian philosophy demands the domination of Torah over secular knowledge, not a separate synthesis. On this basis, then, many adherents of Hirsch&#x27;s philosophy have preferred the natural sciences over the humanities as a subject of secular study, seemingly because they are easier to judge through the prism of Torah thought than the more abstract humanities.

<text>Samuel Holdheim (1806 – 22 August 1860) was a German rabbi and author, and one of the more extreme leaders of the early Reform Movement in Judaism. A pioneer in modern Jewish homiletics, he was often at odds with the Orthodox community.

== Early life ==
Holdheim was born at Kempen in South Prussia in 1806. The son of rigidly traditional parents, Holdheim was early inducted into rabbinical literature according to the methods in vogue at the Talmudical yeshivas. Before he was able to speak German with even moderate correctness, he had become a master of Talmudic argumentation, and his fame had traveled far beyond the limits of his native place. This reputation secured for him employment as teacher of young boys in private families both in Kempen and in larger cities of his native province. It was while thus engaged that he began to supplement his store of rabbinical knowledge by private studies in the secular and classical branches.

Holdheim went to Prague and subsequently to Berlin to study philosophy and humanities; and his keen intellect, combined with his eagerness to learn, made it possible for him to reach his goal in an incredibly short time, though the lack of preliminary systematic preparation left its imprint upon his mind, to a certain degree, to the last. Under Samuel Landau of Prague he continued also his Talmudical studies. While still a young man it became his ambition to occupy a rabbinical position in a larger German town; for he desired to show the older rabbis that secular and philosophical scholarship could well be harmonized with rabbinical erudition. But he had to wait until 1836, when, after several disappointments elsewhere, he was called as rabbi to Frankfurt an der Oder. Here he remained until 1840, encountering many difficulties, due both to the distrust of those within the congregation who suspected the piety of a rabbi able to speak grammatical German, and who was a graduate of a German university, and to the peculiar legislation which in Prussia under Frederick William III regulated the status of the Jewish congregations.

== Attitude toward government ==
Holdheim&#x27;s purpose was to bring about a change in this state of affairs. In the preface to his &quot;Gottesdienstliche Vorträge&quot; (Frankfurt (Oder), 1839) he appealed both to the government to accord the modern rabbinate the dignity due to it, and to the congregations to cease regarding the rabbi as an expert in Jewish casuistry mainly charged with the duty of answering &quot;she&#x27;elot&quot; (ritual questions) and inquiries concerning dietary laws. He insisted upon the recognition of the rabbi as preacher and teacher, who at the same time gives attention to the practical requirements of his office as the expert in Talmudical law.

While in Frankfurt, Holdheim scrupulously decided every question according to the halakha. In his pulpit discourses belonging to this period the intention is plain to steer clear of mere rationalistic moralizing, on the one hand, and dry legalizing and unscientific speculation (in the style of the old &quot;derashah&quot;), on the other. Holdheim thus deserves to be remembered as one of the pioneers in the field of modern Jewish homiletics, who showed what use should be made of the &quot;Midrashim&quot; and other Jewish writings. He also repeatedly took pains to arouse his congregation to help carry out Abraham Geiger&#x27;s and Ludwig Philippson&#x27;s project of founding a Jewish theological faculty. Judaism even then had ceased for Holdheim to be an end unto itself. He had begun to view it as a force in the larger life of humanity.

== Progressive views ==
Holdheim now became a contributor to the Jewish periodicals (e.g., Philippson&#x27;s &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums&quot; and Jost&#x27;s &quot;Israelitische Annalen&quot;). Two of his articles are especially noteworthy. One (in &quot;Allg. Zeit. des Jud.&quot; ii, Nos. 4-9) discusses the essential principles of Judaism, arriving at the conclusion that Judaism has no binding dogmas; the other (Jost&#x27;s &quot;Annalen,&quot; 1839, Nos. 30-32) treats of the oath demanded of Jewish witnesses in criminal procedures. In the former of these papers Holdheim formulates the principle which is basic to his position and that of other Reformers: Judaism is not a religion of dead creed, but of living deeds. In the latter essay he utilizes his Talmudic juridical erudition to demonstrate the injustice done to the Jews by the Prussian courts. Another of his Frankfurt publications bears the title &quot;Der Religiöse Fortschritt im deutschen Judenthume&quot; (Leipzig, 1840). The occasion which called forth this booklet was the controversy raging around Geiger&#x27;s election as rabbi in Breslau. Holdheim pleads for progress, on the ground that at all times the Torah has been taught, in accordance with the changing conditions of succeeding ages; but this progress he holds to be a gradual development, never a noisy opposition to recognized existing standards.

In the meantime Holdheim had received the degree of PhD from the University of Leipzig, and had come to be looked upon by congregations as well as by Jewish scholars as a leader (see &quot;Orient. Lit.&quot; 1840, No. 35 et passim; Jost&#x27;s &quot;Annalen&quot;, 1840, No. 39). Frankfurt having become too restricted a sphere for him, he accepted a call to Schwerin as Landesrabbiner of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, leaving Frankfurt on August 15, 1840.

== Hamburg Temple controversy ==
In his new field Holdheim gave his first attention to the founding of schools for Jewish children. The Hamburg Temple controversy led him to take part in the discussion (see &quot;Annalen&quot;, 1841, Nos. 45, 46). He hailed the new movement as an important augury of the quickening influences of modern views. He defended the Hamburg program as thoroughly founded in Judaism and in the very line of the synagogue&#x27;s own history, though he was not blind to its inconsistencies. Yet, even though authority of tradition was denied and recognized at one and the same time, the movement stood for the differentiation of the Jewish national from the Jewish religious elements. He also wrote an opinion (&quot;Gutachten&quot;) on the prayer-book of the Hamburg Temple (Hamburg, 1841), justifying its departures from the old forms by appealing to Talmudical precedents (&quot;Soṭah&quot; vii.1; &quot;Ber&quot;. 10a, 27b, 33a; Maimonides, &quot;Yad&quot;, &quot;Tefillah&quot;, xi.9). Among the many rejoinders which Ḥakam Bernays&#x27; excommunication of this prayer-book evoked, Holdheim&#x27;s deserves to be ranked as the most thorough and incisive.

== More controversies ==
Soon after, the most important work by Holdheim appeared under the title &quot;Die Autonomie der Rabbinen&quot; (Schwerin and Berlin, 1843). In this, he pleads for the abolition of the antiquated Jewish marriage and divorce regulations mainly on the ground that the Jews do not constitute a political nation. The Jewish religious institutions must be rigidly kept distinct from the Jewish national ones, to which the latter belong the laws of marriage and divorce. The laws of the modern states are not in conflict with the principles of the Jewish religion; therefore these modern laws, and not the Jewish national laws of other days, should regulate Jewish marriages and divorces (see Samuel Hirsch in &quot;Orient. Lit.&quot;, 1843, No. 44). The importance of this book is attested by the stir it created among German Jewish communities, many members of which found in its attitude the solution of the problem of how loyalty to Judaism could be combined with unqualified allegiance to their German nationality. Evidence of its incisive character is furnished also by the polemical literature that grew out of it. In these discussions such men as A. Bernstein, Mendel Hess, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Zecharias Frankel, Raphael Kirchheim, Leopold Zunz, Leopold Löw, and Adolf Jellinek took part.

The foundation of the &quot;Reform Verein&quot; in Frankfurt am Main led to another agitation in German Jewry. Einhorn, Stein, Samuel Hirsch, and others deplored the rise of the &quot;Verein&quot; as a step toward schismatic separation. The obligatory character of the rite of circumcision was the focal issue discussed by no less than forty-one rabbis. Holdheim, in his &quot;Ueber die Beschneidung zunächst in religiös-dogmatischer Beziehung&quot; (Schwerin and Berlin, 1844), takes the position that circumcision is not, like baptism, a sacrament of initiation, but is merely a command like any other. Nevertheless, he classifies it not as a national but as a Jewish law, and pleads for its retention. Indeed, he was not unreservedly an adherent of the program of the Frankfurt Reform Verein. This is clear from his &quot;Vorträge über die mosaische Religion für denkende Israeliten&quot; (Schwerin, 1844). While the &quot;Verein&quot; assumed unlimited possibilities of development, according to Holdheim the Mosaic element, after the elimination of the national, is eternal. Religion must be placed above all temporal needs and desires. To yield to the spirit of the age would make that spirit the supreme factor and lead to the production of a new 19th century Talmud as little warranted as was the Talmud of the 5th century.

Mosaism as contained in the Bible is the continuous religion of Judaism. The belief in this revelation is the constant factor in all variants of Judaism. This is also the main thesis of &quot;Das Ceremonialgesetz im Messiasreich&quot; (Schwerin and Berlin, 1845). He shows the inconsistency of Talmudism, which, assuming the inviolability of all biblical laws, still recognizes the suspension of many. Hence the Talmudic insistence on the restoration of the Jewish state. Some ceremonial laws were meant to assure the holiness of the people; others to assure that of the priests. These ceremonies lose their meaning and are rendered obsolete the moment Israel no longer requires special protection for its monotheistic distinctness. As soon as all men have become ethical monotheists, Israel is nowhere in danger of losing its own monotheism; nor is its distinctness further required. Hence in the Messianic time, the ceremonies will lose all binding or effective force. This book, too, called forth much discussion, in which Reform rabbis like Levi Herzfeld took a stand opposed to Holdheim&#x27;s. Answering some of his critics&#x27; objections, Holdheim insisted upon being recognized as an adherent of positive historic Judaism. The doctrines, religious and ethical, of biblical Judaism are, he claimed, the positive contents of Judaism; and a truly historical reform must, for the sake of these positive doctrines, liberate Judaism from Talmudism.

Holdheim took part in the rabbinical conferences at Braunschweig (1844), Frankfurt am Main (1845), and Breslau (1846). The stand taken by the last with regard to the Sabbath did not satisfy him. He rightly held it to be a weak compromise. For him the essential element of a true Sabbath was not worship, but rest (see his &quot;Offene Briefe über die Dritte Rabbinerversammlung&quot;, in &quot;Israelit&quot;, 1846, Nos. 46-48). The debates at these conferences had touched on vital subjects. Holdheim felt prompted to treat some of these at greater length, and therefore in quick succession he published the following essays: &quot;Was lehrt das Rabbinische Judenthum über den Eid?&quot; 1844; &quot;Ueber Auflösbarkeit der Eide&quot;, Hamburg, 1845; &quot;Vorschläge zu einer zeitgemässen Reform der jüdischen Ehegesetze&quot;, Schwerin, 1845; &quot;Die religiöse Stellung des weiblichen Geschlechts im talmudischen Judenthum&quot;, ib. 1846; &quot;Prinzipien eines dem gegenwärtigen Religionsbewusstsein entsprechenden Cultus&quot;, 1846.

Holdheim, consulted among others when the &quot;Jüdische Reformgenossenschaft&quot; was founded in Berlin, was called to be its rabbi and preacher in 1847, leaving Mecklenburg. As leader of the Reformgenossenschaft he had a share in the editing of its prayer-book. He instituted the radical rejection of keeping Saturday as the Jewish Sabbath, and instead moved its observance to Sunday to keep the behavior of Reform Jews in line with Christian thought. Under his rule, the observance of the second days of the holy days (except the second day of &quot;Rosh ha-Shanah&quot;) were abolished.

He officiated at so-called &quot;mixed&quot; marriages (see his &quot;Gemischte Ehen zwischen Juden und Christen&quot;, Berlin, 1850). He had to defend his congregation against many attacks (see his &quot;Das Gutachten des Herrn L. Schwab, Rabbiner zu Pesth&quot;, ib. 1848). Though engaged in many ways in the development of his society and in the organization of its institutions, during the thirteen years of his stay in Berlin he wrote a text for schools on the religious and moral doctrines of the &quot;Mishnah&quot; (Berlin, 1854), a criticism of Friedrich Julius Stahl (&quot;Ueber Stahl&#x27;s Christliche Toleranz&quot;, ib. 1856), and a catechism (&quot;Jüdische Glaubens- und Sittenlehre&quot;, ib. 1857). He also wrote a history of the Reformgenossenschaft (&quot;Geschichte der Jüdischen Reformgemeinde&quot;, 1857) and a more ambitious work (in Hebrew) on the rabbinical and Karaite interpretations of the marriage laws (&quot;Ma&#x27;amar ha-Ishut&quot;, 1860).

Holdheim died suddenly at Berlin on 22 August 1860. Sachs objected to his interment in the row reserved for rabbis in the Jewish cemetery, but Oettinger granted permission for the burial. Holdheim was laid to rest among the great dead of the Berlin congregation, Abraham Geiger preaching the funeral oration.

<doc id="144022" wikidata="Q362480" url="?curid=144022" title="Dean Barkley">
<text>Dean Malcolm Barkley (born August 31, 1950) is an American attorney and politician who briefly served as a United States Senator from Minnesota from 2002 to 2003 as a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota. The founder and chair of the Minnesota Reform Party (later renamed the Independence Party), he was the chairman of Jesse Ventura&#x27;s successful upset bid for governor of Minnesota in 1998. Ventura subsequently appointed him director of the state&#x27;s Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning. After Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash just weeks before the 2002 election, Ventura appointed Barkley to fill Wellstone&#x27;s Senate seat. His brief tenure ended when Republican Norm Coleman was elected and sworn in to fill the seat.

Barkley has run for office four times. Inspired by Ross Perot&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign, he first ran for Congress as an independent in that year&#x27;s election in Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district, but lost. He unsuccessfully ran three times for the U.S. Senate: in Minnesota’s 1994 Senate election, in 1996, and in 2008. He received 5%, 7%, and 15% of the vote in each election, respectively.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Barkley was born in Annandale, Minnesota, on August 31, 1950, and graduated from Annandale High School in 1968. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Minnesota in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1976. During his university years, Barkley volunteered for George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign because of his opposition to the Vietnam War.

==Career==
After graduating from law school, he practiced law and in 1988 became president of Dayton&#x27;s Furniture in Annandale, a position he held until 1991.

A founder of the Minnesota Reform Party, Barkley ran for the U.S. House in 1992, a run inspired by Ross Perot&#x27;s presidential campaign, and received 16% of the vote, thanks in part to Perot voters. He was also a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1994 and 1996.

===Ventura administration and the United States Senate===

Barkley was chairman of Jesse Ventura&#x27;s successful gubernatorial campaign in 1998. In January 1999, Ventura appointed Barkley as director of the Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning (known as Minnesota Planning).

On November 4, 2002, Ventura appointed Barkley to complete the Senate term of Paul Wellstone, who died in a plane crash on October 25. The appointment was announced during the Senate debate between Republican Norm Coleman and Democrat Walter Mondale, who had taken Wellstone&#x27;s place on the ballot; Ventura intended to upstage the debate. Barkley served until the 107th United States Congress ended on January 3, 2003, when he was replaced by Coleman, who won the election. Ventura had previously stated that he would not appoint a replacement for Wellstone, but said he changed his mind out of disgust at Wellstone&#x27;s memorial service, which he felt was used as a rally for the Democratic Party, and because the major parties refused to take the third-party senatorial candidate seriously or to allow him to participate in the debates.

During his weeks as senator, Barkley helped pass legislation establishing a memorial for Wellstone and provided a pivotal vote in clearing the final passage of the Homeland Security Act.

===After Ventura administration===
After leaving office, Barkley did a stint in St. Paul as a state government lobbyist for a tobacco company, a casino, and the private prison industry. Beginning in April 2005, Barkley served as director and chief strategist for Texas independent Kinky Friedman&#x27;s 2006 gubernatorial campaign.

In a June 2007 interview with &quot;Minnesota Monitor&quot;, Barkley confirmed that he had been approached by Democrats in Minnesota&#x27;s 6th congressional district about a possible challenge to Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann. Barkley indicated he would consider running if the DFL would support him as an independent candidate.

As of May 2008 Barkley was working part-time as a bus driver for the elderly and disabled. He said he enjoyed the job and saw it as a public service.

===2008 U.S. Senate campaign===
Both Barkley and Ventura considered challenging Norm Coleman for reelection to the U.S. Senate seat that Barkley previously held. On July 14, 2008, Ventura announced that he would not seek the seat, prompting Barkley to announce his candidacy. Ventura supported Barkley and donated $500 to the campaign.

Despite entering the race late, Barkley was polling as high as 19% by October 1. The campaign also produced two statewide radio ads featuring Barkley and Ventura. Barkley, unlike many third-party and independent candidates, was included in public debates with the major party nominees; the first of five three-way debates took place October 5. He received the endorsement of former U.S. Representative Tim Penny. Numerous polls showed that Barkley would affect the outcome of the race. Barkley raised $163,358 for his campaign (less than 1% of each of his opponents&#x27; totals). He received over 435,000 votes, about 15% of the total, significantly affecting a race in which Franken defeated Coleman by only 312 votes.

===2012 Minnesota Supreme Court campaign===
Barkley ran against Minnesota Supreme Court Associate Justice G. Barry Anderson in the 2012 election. Anderson was appointed to the court by Governor Tim Pawlenty in 2004, was elected to a six-year term in 2006, and was reelected in 2012.

==Post-political career==

Barkley returned to law practice in Bloomington, with a general practice. He later focused on estate planning law and continues to advise unaffiliated political candidates, such as Kinky Friedman&#x27;s Texas gubernatorial campaign.

==Papers==

Dean Barkley&#x27;s senatorial papers are in the library of the Minnesota Historical Society. They include biographical files, press releases and speeches, legislative files, and issue mail.
