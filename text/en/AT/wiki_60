<text>Duke Nukem Forever is a 2011 first-person shooter game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. It is the fourth main installment in the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; series and the sequel to &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (1996). Players control Duke Nukem as he comes out of retirement to battle an alien invasion. Like its predecessor, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; features pop culture references, toilet humor, and adult content.

&quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; began development under 3D Realms and underwent a severely protracted development that lasted 14 years. Announced in 1997 following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, it was delayed several times, which was attributed to engine changes, understaffing, and a lack of a development plan. After 3D Realms downsized in 2009, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was finished by Triptych Games, Gearbox Software, and Piranha Games. It holds the Guinness world record for the longest development for a video game.

&quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was released on June 14, 2011, and received mostly negative reviews. Critics found the design dated, identified performance problems and found its humor misogynistic and crass. It did not meet sales expectations but was deemed profitable by Take-Two Interactive, the owner of 2K Games. An additional episode, &quot;The Doctor Who Cloned Me&quot;, was released as downloadable content later in the year. Early versions of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; were leaked in 2022.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; is a first-person shooter that combines combat, exploration and puzzle-solving. The game also switches to a third-person view when in vehicle use. Players control Duke Nukem, a 1980s-style action hero, as he battles alien invaders through three main locations: Las Vegas, a highway and Hoover Dam. Some areas feature boss fights, fetch quests and driving sequences; in one sequence, Duke is shrunk to a miniature size and drives a toy car. Minigames include air hockey, whack-a-mole and pinball.

&quot;Forever&quot; is slower than previous &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; games. As in the &quot;Halo&quot; series, players can only carry two weapons at a time, and Duke&#x27;s health regenerates automatically. The weapons include a shotgun, trip mines, a shrink ray (which shrinks enemies so Duke can stomp on them) and a freeze ray (which freezes enemies so Duke can shatter them). Like &quot;Duke Nukem 3D, Forever&quot; includes pop culture references, toilet humor and adult content, such as strip clubs and the ability to urinate. In the multiplayer mode, players compete in games such as deathmatch, capture the flag and king of the hill.

==Plot==
Twelve years after he saved the Earth from an alien invasion, Duke Nukem has become a celebrity multimillionaire. After playing a game based on &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, he arrives on the set of a talk show for an interview. On his way to the show, Duke witnesses a news broadcast announcing that aliens have returned. Unlike previous encounters, the aliens initially appear peaceful and at first, seem to pose no harm to the humans of Earth.

Duke&#x27;s talk show appearance is canceled to allow television stations to cover the alien invasion, and Duke retires to the &quot;Duke Cave&quot;, his home. There, he receives a call from the president and General Graves of the Earth Defense Force (EDF). The president orders Duke not to harm the invaders and adds that he is in diplomatic talks with the alien overlord. 

When Duke is attacked by hostile aliens, Duke is forced to disobey the president&#x27;s orders and fight his way through the alien hordes. While fighting through his casino, Duke witnesses the aliens abducting women, including his two pop-star girlfriends. Graves tells Duke that the women are being held in the Duke Dome and that the aliens have a vendetta to settle with Duke. He also warns Duke that the aliens are using Hoover Dam to power a wormhole so more aliens can come through. Duke travels to the Duke Dome, using a wrecking ball to damage the building to gain access. Inside, he finds swarms of Octabrains and the missing women, who have been impregnated with alien spawn. Duke&#x27;s girlfriends die after bearing alien babies, infuriating Duke. Duke finds the Alien Queen in control of the Duke Dome and kills her, but is wounded in the process and blacks out.

After regaining consciousness, Duke fights Pigcops and aliens through the Duke Burger. He travels to the Hoover Dam in his monster truck. After battling through the dam, he finds his old friend Dylan, mortally wounded. Dylan tells Duke that the reborn Cycloid Emperor is at the dam and that the only way to shut down the portal is to completely destroy it. Before dying, he gives Duke his demolition charges and wishes him luck. Duke places the explosives and destroys the dam, but the currents nearly drown him.

Duke is revived by an EDF soldier and awakens to find the portal gone. The president, who was also at the dam, rages at Duke for ruining his plans to work with the Cycloid Emperor. The president was actually intending to have the aliens kill Duke so he could control the Earth with Cycloid Emperor. He has ordered a nuclear strike at the site of the dam to wipe out the remaining aliens, intending to leave Duke there to die. The Cycloid Emperor emerges and kills the president and his security detail; he intended to kill the president after the deal. Duke kills the Cycloid Emperor and is rescued by Graves as the nuclear bomb explodes. In a press conference, Duke announces his intent to run for President of the United States.

===&quot;The Doctor Who Cloned Me&quot;===
In the downloadable content &quot;The Doctor Who Cloned Me&quot;, Duke wakes up after the nuclear explosion and finds himself trapped in a strange laboratory while video recordings of himself declaring his bid for Presidency play on monitors. After escaping, Duke discovers that not only are the aliens continuing their invasion, but his old nemesis Dr. Proton (the antagonist of the original &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; game) has returned and is building an army of robotic Duke clones to fight the aliens and conquer Earth himself.

Duke infiltrates Proton&#x27;s laboratory in Area 51 by posing as one of the clones. Eventually, Proton spots him and attacks Duke but he escapes and is reunited with Dylan (revealed as still alive). With Dylan&#x27;s help, Duke locates and kills Dr. Proton. General Graves then communicates with Duke to inform him that the aliens are being bred by an Alien Empress that is nesting on the moon. After finding a teleporter leading up to the moon, Duke commandeers a moon rover and destroys the Alien Empress, saving Earth and its women once again.

==Development==
=== Announcement ===
In 1996, 3D Realms released &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. Set apart from other first-person shooter games by its adult humor and interactive world, it received acclaim and sold around 3.5 million copies. The 3D Realms co-founder George Broussard announced the sequel, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, on April 27, 1997, which he expected to be released by Christmas 1998. It was widely anticipated. The 3D Realms co-founder Scott Miller said the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; franchise would last for decades across many iterations, like &quot;James Bond&quot; or &quot;Mario&quot;. Broussard and Miller funded &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; using the profits from &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and other games. They gave the marketing and publishing rights to GT Interactive, taking only a $400,000 advance. 3D Realms also began developing a 2D version of &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; &quot;Forever,&quot; which was canceled due to the rising popularity of 3D games.

=== Engine changes and delays ===
Rather than create a new game engine, 3D Realms began development using id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake II&quot; engine. They demonstrated the first &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; trailer at the E3 convention in May 1998. Critics were impressed by its cinematic presentation and action scenes, with combat on a moving truck. According to staff, Broussard became obsessed with incorporating new technology and features from competing games and could not bear for &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; to be perceived as outdated. Weeks after E3, he announced that 3D Realms had switched to Unreal Engine 1, a new engine with better rendering capabilities for large spaces, requiring a reboot of the project. In 1999, they switched engines again, to a newer version of Unreal Engine 1.

By 2000, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was still far from complete. A developer who joined that year described it as a series of chaotic tech demos, and the staff felt that Broussard had no fixed idea of what the final game would be. As the success of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; meant that 3D Realms did not require external funding, they lacked deadlines or financial pressure that could have driven the project. Broussard became defiant in response to questions from fans and journalists, saying it would be released &quot;when it&#x27;s done&quot;. In December 2000, the rights to publish &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; were purchased by Take-Two Interactive, which hoped to release it the following year. By 2001, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was being cited as a high-profile case of vaporware, and &quot;Wired&quot; gave it the &quot;vaporware of the year&quot; award.

At E3 2001, 3D Realms released another trailer, the first public view of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; in three years. It received a positive response, and the team was elated, feeling that they were ahead of their competitors. However, Broussard still failed to present a vision for a final product. One employee felt that Miller and Broussard were developing &quot;with a 1995 mentality&quot;, with a team much smaller than other major games of the time. By 2003, only 18 people were working on &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; full time. In a 2006 presentation, Broussard told a journalist the team had &quot;fucked up&quot; and had restarted development. By August 2006, around half the team had left, frustrated by the lack of progress.

According to Miller, the Canadian studio Digital Extremes was willing to take over the project in 2004, but the proposal was rejected by others at 3D Realms. Miller later described this as a &quot;fatal suicide shot&quot;. In 2007, 3D Realms hired Raphael van Lierop as the new creative director. He was impressed by the game and felt it could be finished within a year, but Broussard disagreed. 3D Realms hired aggressively to expand the team to about 35 people. Brian Hook, the new creative lead, became the first employee to push back against Broussard.

=== Layoffs and Gearbox takeover ===
In 2009, with 3D Realms having exhausted its capital, Miller and Broussard asked Take-Two for $6 million to finish the game. After no agreement was reached, Broussard and Miller laid off the team and ceased development. A small team of ex-employees, which later became Triptych Games, continued development from their homes.

In September 2010, Gearbox Software announced that it had bought the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; intellectual property from 3D Realms and would continue development of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever.&quot; The Gearbox team included several members of the 3D Realms team, but not Broussard. On May 24, 2011, Gearbox announced that &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; had &quot;gone gold&quot; after 15 years. It holds the Guinness world record for the longest development for a video game, at 14 years and 44 days, though this period was exceeded in 2022 by &quot;Beyond Good and Evil 2&quot; and in 2024 by &quot;Kien&quot;.

In 2022, Miller released a blog post on the Apogee website about 3D Realms&#x27; failure to complete &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;. He attributed it to understaffing, repeated engine changes and a lack of planning. On Twitter, Broussard responded that Miller&#x27;s claims were &quot;nonsense&quot;, described him as manipulative and narcissistic, and accused him of blaming others. He blamed Miller for the loss of 3D Realms and the &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; intellectual property.

==Marketing and release==
The &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; launch trailer was released on June 2, 2011. A playable demo was released on June 3, 2011. &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was released in a special &quot;Balls of Steel&quot; edition, with items including a five-inch bust of Duke Nukem, a 100-page artbook, a comic, stickers and poker chips. Themes and avatars were also sold for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

2K Games launched a website titled &quot;Boob Tube&quot; to promote the game. On May 19, 2011, a Flash game was released on the website, &quot;Duke Nudem,&quot; whereby players shoot targets against a woman. If successful, her clothing is removed until she is topless. 2K released a &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; soundboard for iOS, including a number of Duke Nukem&#x27;s phrases. &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; was made available a day early on June 9 from all retailers after the street date was broken. It was released in Japan on March 29, 2012.

==Downloadable content==

===&quot;Duke&#x27;s Big Package&quot;===
In North America, the video game retailer GameStop promised exclusive in-game content for customers pre-ordering &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;. The exclusive content, known as &quot;Duke&#x27;s Big Package&quot;, allowed the player from the start of the game to access &quot;Big Heads&quot;, the &quot;Ego Boost&quot;, and custom in-game T-shirts. A code printed on the final receipt could, at the time of release, be activated over Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam.

===&quot;Hail to the Icons Parody Pack&quot;===
&quot;Duke Nukem Forever: Hail to the Icons Parody Pack&quot; contains three new game modes, and four new multiplayer maps, each with new weapons. It is available on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam. It was released on October 11, 2011.

===&quot;The Doctor Who Cloned Me&quot;===
A new single-player campaign, &quot;The Doctor Who Cloned Me&quot;, was released on December 13, 2011. It sees the return of Duke&#x27;s nemesis from the original &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; game, Dr. Proton, and adds new weapons, enemies, bosses and multiplayer maps. It holds a score of 52/100 on Metacritic for PC and 58/100 for Xbox 360. &quot;GameSpy&quot; rated it a 1.5/5, &quot;OXM&quot; rated it 4/10 and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; rated it 5/10, writing: &quot;Duke&#x27;s trying his best, but there&#x27;s still too much of the past hanging around and holding him back.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregation site Metacritic, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; has a range score between 49–54/100, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; on the PC and PlayStation 3 versions and &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot; on the Xbox 360 version. Criticism focused on the long loading times, clunky controls, offensive humor and dated design. The critics Elton Jones of &quot;Complex&quot;,&quot;&quot; James Stephanie Sterling of &quot;Destructoid&quot; and Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw, creator of &quot;Zero Punctuation&quot;, named it among the worst games of the year.

Many critics disliked the level design and shooting. Kevin VanOrd of &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt that the &quot;joy&quot; of the &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; combat had been &quot;flattened&quot;, with &quot;little sense of impact&quot;, and found the design tedious. He called &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; a &quot;bad, boring, bargain bin kind of game&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; wrote that the locations lacked the &quot;exploration and excitement that made &quot;Duke 3D&quot; such a memorable experience&quot;, and that the levels were too linear, with &quot;huge chunks of the game are spent simply walking from one fight to another through uninspired corridors&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; felt the shooting was &quot;simple fun&quot;, but criticized the platforming sequences, which &quot;make up an unnecessarily large percentage of the story mode&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; concluded that the &quot;world-record development time has produced an ugly, buggy shooter that veers back and forth between enjoyably average and outright boring, with occasional surges of greatness along the way&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; felt that &quot;unexpected moments ... are really the game&#x27;s biggest strengths. But they&#x27;re few and far between.&quot;

Many reviewers questioned the design choices in comparison to &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, with &quot;Kotaku&quot; writing: &quot;Old-school shooters, and this is definitely trying to be one of those with its basic AI and lack of cover mechanics, always had two great things going for them: speed and a ridiculous arsenal of weapons... &quot;Forever&quot; eschews this in favour of a plodding pace and two guns.&quot; &quot;The Escapist&quot; agreed: &quot;Having been almost cryo-frozen for more than a decade, then awoken and peppered with modern touches, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; feels so out of place.&quot;

Another common criticism was with the game&#x27;s lack of technical sophistication, including inconsistent graphics and unacceptably long loading times, which &quot;GameTrailers&quot; called &quot;unholy&quot;; Eric Neigher of &quot;GameSpy&quot; found the console versions took up to 40 seconds to load a level. Neigher also criticized the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode as unplayable without serious lag spikes. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that &quot;the myriad technical shortcomings – particularly prevalent on the console ports – only get worse the further you progress into the campaign&quot;, a view echoed by &quot;Game Revolution&quot;: &quot;when they started on the design, that tech was already outdated&quot;. The PC version has since been patched to greatly decrease loading times and to add two optional inventory slots.

The use of the series&#x27; trademark humor received a mixed response. In one regard, some critics such as &quot;Team Xbox&quot; praised the voice work of Jon St. John, who did an &quot;excellent job as always with Duke&#x27;s persona&quot;, while others such as Machinima.com appreciated the comedic gameplay tips and pop culture references. However, the same critic also noted that &quot;parts of the narrative and dialogue show clear evidence of the game&#x27;s elongated development. Many pop culture references refer to media in the early 2000s, with one-liners co-opted from &#x27;guy&#x27; movies like &quot;Old School&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot;, and &quot;Commando&quot;, which in itself could cause blank stares from most of the current potential audience.&quot; The Australian website &quot;PALGN&quot; felt the game was &quot;saved only by its humor and nostalgic value&quot;. 

Several critics objected to the depiction of women; &quot;X-Play&quot; described it as &quot;creepy&quot; and hateful. &quot;Joystiq&quot; wrote that the multiplayer mode &quot;Capture the Babe&quot;, which involves spanking women, &quot;really is as painful as it sounds&quot;. The hive level, in which Duke encounters abducted women who have been forcibly impregnated with aliens, attracted particular criticism. The level and its inclusion of disembodied &quot;wall boobs&quot;, which the player can slap, were listed in GamesRadar&#x27;s &quot;8 worst moments in &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;&quot;. Croshaw found that the level was &quot;as jarring a shift of tone as you can get without splicing five minutes of &quot;The Human Centipede&quot; into the middle of &quot;Mallrats&quot;&quot;. &quot;Destructoid&quot; wrote: &quot;Duke does not come across as cool, witty or likeable in the least. He comes across as a vile, callous, thoroughly detestable psychopath ... According to Gearbox, seeing women tortured was funny enough.&quot; &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; UK thought that the humor was not &quot;so much offensive or misogynistic as just suffering from an adolescent fixation with boobs and crowbarred-in innuendo&quot;. The Kusoge of the Year Wiki named &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; one of the worst games of 2012. 

Critics cited the long development time as a factor in the finished product. In a positive review &quot;PC Gamer&quot; noted that &quot;years of anticipation will spoil &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; for some&quot;, adding, &quot;There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot;, while disappointed in the game, concluded: &quot;I&#x27;m glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch.&quot; &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; concluded that for those &quot;part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; for yourself. But I&#x27;d practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you&#x27;re not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on.&quot; Jake Denton of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the &quot;5 most underrated games of 2011&quot;, while admitting the game&#x27;s overall faulty structure. Joseph Milne of &quot;FPSguru.com&quot; featured the game on his list of &quot;Top 5 underrated games&quot; at number 4 on the list.

===Sales===
According to research firm NPD, &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; sold 376,300 units in its first month, not including digital copies. Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of 2K Games, revealed in July 2011 that the game sales were half of their initial expectations. However, in an earnings call on August 8, 2011, Take-Two said that &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; would prove profitable.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Escapist&quot; included &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; in its 2016 list of the worst games ever, calling it &quot;an example of what happens when the hype is far greater than the quality of the game&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Destructoid&quot; wrote that reactions had &quot;ranged from negative to &#x27;I guess it could have been worse,&#x27;&quot; and that much of the failure was down to its imitation of the first-person shooter games and that it lacked &quot;self-awareness&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; attributed the negative reaction to the long development, and that the series&#x27; humor had become less acceptable.

=== Leaks ===
On May 9, 2022, an unfinished version of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; from 2001, including the level editor and the full source code, leaked online. Broussard confirmed its authenticity on Twitter, stating that he did not know who had leaked it and that &quot;there is no real game to play&quot;. Miller, in a post on the Apogee website, wrote that &quot;anyone expecting much of a playable game will be disappointed&quot;. The leak includes a version of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; first level that ends with a sequence taken from the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

Covering the leak for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, Sam Machkovech found that the gunfights were &quot;surprisingly solid&quot;, with &quot;punchy sound design and powerful weapons&quot;, and resembled the &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; series. He wrote that the large environments, such as casinos, were built to a realistic scale and &quot;play out like a confused team coming to grips with brand-new engine technology, simply building out larger-than-usual levels without yet getting to the crucial stages of balancing&quot;. 

A fan mod, the &quot;Duke Nukem Forever Restoration Project&quot;, aims to update the leak to a more complete state. The first was released in December 2022. A version of the canceled 2D version of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; from 1996 leaked that month.

<doc id="143841" wikidata="Q2915439" url="?curid=143841" title="Hapag-Lloyd Flug">
<text>Hapag-Lloyd Flug GmbH (marketed as &quot;Hapagfly&quot; between 2005 and 2007) was a German leisure airline headquartered in Langenhagen, Lower Saxony, that was originally founded by Hapag-Lloyd and later became a subsidiary of TUI Group. It operated scheduled and charter passenger flights mainly to holiday resorts in Europe. Its successor is today&#x27;s TUI fly Deutschland.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
The original HAPAG company first became involved in the aviation industry in 1910, sponsoring Zeppelin flights.

Hapag-Lloyd Flug was established in July 1972, two years after HAPAG merged with Norddeutscher Lloyd, when the Hapag-Lloyd shipping group bought a few Boeing 727s to fly its cruise passengers from Germany to the ports of call for the cruises. It began operations on 30 March 1973. With the boom of the holiday charter flight market in the 1970s, it quickly adopted charter flights to popular holiday destinations in the Mediterranean Sea area and the Canary Islands as well and soon became one of the biggest German charter airlines. Throughout the years, the airline added regular passenger flights to its schedule, as well as new airplanes, such as the Boeing 737-100 and Airbus A310 aircraft. In 1979, Bavaria Germanair, a charter air carrier operating Airbus A300B4 and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 400 and 500 jets, was merged into Hapag-Lloyd Flug.

In 1998, it became the first airline in the world to adopt the Boeing 737-800.

===Mergers and rebrandings===
Since 1997, it had been a subsidiary of TUI AG, which also includes the Hapag-Lloyd cargo container line and cruise line. When TUI released their new &quot;big smile&quot; logo in 2002, the Hapag-Lloyd livery that had remained unchanged for almost 30 years was completely changed to a new, light blue, white and red scheme with the new TUI logo on the tail to represent TUI&#x27;s new corporate design. 2002 also saw the founding of Hapag-Lloyd Express, a low-cost airline that was to compete with the likes of Ryanair.

In November 2005, the airline changed its name to Hapagfly due to the new marketing strategy of the TUI Group. In January 2007 in a restructuring, it combined its operations with Hapag-Lloyd Express to become TUIfly, for which it operated all flights, while Hapag-Lloyd Express marketed them until TUIfly got its own license.

==Destinations==
Hapag-Lloyd operated services mainly to European holiday resorts in the Mediterranean Sea area and on the Canary Islands. Most of them are now operated by TUIfly.

==Fleet==
Over the course of its life, Hapag-Lloyd Flug operated all of the following aircraft, primarily through aircraft leasing from companies such as ILFC and GECAS. It is also the first operator of the most popular Boeing 737-800 Next Generation series that first commenced operations in 1998.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 12 July 2000, Hapag-Lloyd Flight 3378, an Airbus A310 flying from Chania to Hanover, suffered fuel exhaustion caused in part by the crew&#x27;s decision to continue the flight despite faulty landing gear that had partially retracted, which resulted in an emergency crash landing at Vienna Airport. The aircraft was written off, and 26 people were injured. Although it was the first (and remained the only) incident in Hapag-Lloyd&#x27;s history in which an aircraft was damaged and people were injured, it caused much criticism in the media. In 2004, a Hanover district court convicted Captain Wolfgang Arminger of &quot;dangerous interference into air traffic,&quot; saying he was &quot;endangering others&#x27; lives&quot; mainly by failing to divert to Zagreb, and sentenced him with a six-month suspended prison sentence.

<doc id="143843" wikidata="Q413512" url="?curid=143843" title="Salvinorin A">
<text>Salvinorin A is the main active psychotropic molecule in &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;. Salvinorin A is considered a dissociative hallucinogen.

It is structurally distinct from other naturally occurring hallucinogens (such as DMT, psilocybin, and mescaline) because it contains no nitrogen atoms; hence, it is not an alkaloid (and cannot be rendered as a salt), but rather is a terpenoid. It also differs in subjective experience, compared to other hallucinogens, and has been described as dissociative.

Salvinorin A can produce psychoactive experiences in humans with a typical duration of action being several minutes to an hour or so, depending on the method of ingestion.

Salvinorin A is found with several other structurally related salvinorins. Salvinorin is a &quot;trans&quot;-neoclerodane diterpenoid. It acts as a kappa opioid receptor agonist and is the first known compound acting on this receptor that is not an alkaloid.

== History ==

Salvinorin A was first described and named in 1982 by Alfredo Ortega and colleagues in Mexico. They used a combination of spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to determine the chemical structure of the compound, which was shown to have a bicyclic diterpene structure. Around the same time, Leander Julián Valdés III independently isolated the molecule as part of his PhD research, published in 1983. Valdés named the chemical &quot;divinorin&quot;, and also isolated an analog that he named divinorin B. The naming was subsequently corrected to salvinorin A and B after the work was published in 1984. Valdés later isolated salvinorin C.

== Pharmacology ==

Salvinorin A is a &quot;trans&quot;-neoclerodane diterpenoid with the chemical formula C23H28O8. Unlike other known opioid-receptor ligands, salvinorin A is not an alkaloid, as it does not contain a basic nitrogen atom. Salvinorin A has no action at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, the principal molecular target responsible for the actions of &#x27;classical&#x27; psychedelics such as LSD and mescaline. Salvinorin A has also been shown to have effect on cannabinoid CB1 receptors. It significantly increases prolactin and inconsistently increases cortisol. It causes dysphoria by stopping release of dopamine in the striatum. Salvinorin A increases activity of DAT while decreasing activity of SERT.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Salvinorin A is effectively deactivated by the gastrointestinal system, so alternative routes of administration must be used for better absorption. It is absorbed by oral mucosa.
It has a half-life of around 8 minutes in non-human primates.

=== Potency and selectivity ===

Salvinorin A is active at doses as low as 200 μg. Synthetic chemicals, such as LSD (active at 20–30 μg doses), can be more potent. Research has shown that salvinorin A is a potent κ-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist (Ki = 2.4 nM, EC50 = 1.8 nM). It has a high affinity for the receptor, indicated by the low dissociation constant of 1.0 nanomolar (nM). In addition, salvinorin A has been found to act as a D2 receptor partial agonist, with an affinity of 5–10 nM, an intrinsic activity of 40–60%, and an EC50 of 48 nM. This suggests that the D2 receptor may also play an important role in its effects.

Salvinorin A shows atypical properties as an agonist of the KOR relative to other KOR agonists.

=== Effect on intestinal motility ===

Salvinorin A is capable of inhibiting excess intestinal motility (e.g. diarrhea), through its potent κ-opioid-activating effects. The mechanism of action for salvinorin A on ileal tissue has been described as &#x27;prejunctional&#x27;, as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions, but not those of exogenous acetylcholine. A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction-reducing properties of ingested salvinorin A on gut tissue is that it is only pharmacologically active on inflamed and not normal tissue, thus reducing possible side-effects.

=== Solubility ===

Salvinorin A is soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone, but not especially so in water.

=== Detection in urine ===

Researchers found that humans who smoked 580 μg of the pure drug had urine salvinorin A concentrations of 2.4–10.9 μg/L during the first hour; the levels fell below the detection limit by 1.5 hours after smoking.

== Research ==

Salvinorin A has only been administered to humans in a few studies, one showing that its effects peaked at about 2 minutes, that its subjective effects may overlap with those of serotonergic psychedelics, and that it temporarily impairs recall and recognition memory. Like most other agonists of kappa opioid receptors, salvinorin A produces sedation, psychotomimesis, dysphoria, anhedonia, and depression. Salvinorin A has been screened for its possible use as a structural &quot;scaffold&quot; in medicinal chemistry in developing new drugs for treating psychiatric diseases such as cocaine dependence.

== Synthesis ==
=== Biosynthesis ===

The biogenic origin of salvinorin A synthesis has been elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance and ESI-MS analysis of incorporated precursors labeled with stable isotopes of carbon (carbon-13 13C) and hydrogen (deuterium 2H). It &quot;is biosynthesized via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway&quot;, rather than the classic mevalonate pathway, consistent with the common plastidial localization of diterpenoid metabolism.

Terpenoids are biosynthesized from two 5-carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The NMR and MS study by Zjawiony suggested that the biosynthesis of salvinorin A proceeds via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway. In the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, the intermediates of the glycolysis, are converted into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via decarboxylation. Subsequent reduction with NADPH generates 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate, via the intermediates 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate, which then lead to IPP and DMAPP.

Subsequent addition of three 5-carbon IPP units to a single 5-carbon DMAPP unit generates the 20-carbon central precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Bicyclization of GGPP by the class II diterpene synthase, &quot;ent&quot;-clerodienyl diphosphate synthase (SdCPS2), produces a labdanyl diphosphate carbocation, which is subsequently rearranged through a sequence of 1,2-hydride and methyl shifts to form the &quot;ent&quot;-clerodienyl diphosphate intermediate. SdCPS2 catalyzes the first committed reaction in the biosynthesis of salvinorin A by producing its characteristic clerodane scaffold. A series of oxygenation, acylation and methylation reactions is then required to complete the biosynthesis of salvinorin A.

Similar to many plant-derived psychoactive compounds, salvinorin A is excreted via peltate glandular trichomes, which reside external to the epidermis.

=== Chemical synthesis ===
A total asymmetric synthesis of salvinorin A, which relies on a transannular Michael reaction cascade to construct the ring system, was achieved as a 4.5% overall yield over 30 steps, then revised using 24 steps to yield salvinorin A in 0.15% yield. An approach to the &quot;trans&quot;-decalin ring system of salvinorin A used an intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction/Tsuji allylation strategy, and a total synthesis of salvinorin A was achieved using the intramolecular Diels-Alder / Tsuji allylation approach, combined with an asymmetric late-stage addition of the furan moiety.

== Associated compounds ==
Salvinorin A is one of several structurally related salvinorins found in the &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; plant. Salvinorin A is the only naturally occurring salvinorin that is known to be psychoactive. Salvinorin A can be synthesized from salvinorin B by acetylation, and de-acetylated salvinorin A becomes analog to salvinorin B.

Research has produced a number of semi-synthetic compounds. Most derivatives are selective kappa opioid agonists as with salvinorin A, although some are even more potent, with the most potent compound salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether being ten times stronger than salvinorin A. Some derivatives, such as herkinorin, reduce kappa opioid action and instead act as mu opioid agonists.

The synthetic derivative RB-64 is notable because of its functional selectivity and potency. Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether is seven times more potent than salvinorin A at KOPr in GTP-γS assays.

== Natural occurrence ==
Salvinorin A occurs naturally in several &quot;Salvia&quot; species:

* &quot;S. divinorum&quot; (0.89 mg/g to 3.70 mg/g). 
* &quot;S. recognita&quot; (212.9 μg/g).
* &quot;S. cryptantha&quot; (51.5 μg/g).
* &quot;S. glutinosa&quot; (38.9 μg/g).

Salvinorin B has been detected in &quot;S. potentillifolia&quot; and &quot;S. adenocaulon&quot;, however these species do not contain a measureable amount of salvinorin A.

== Legal status ==
Salvinorin A is sometimes regulated together with its host, &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, due to its psychoactive and analgesic effects.

===United States===

Salvinorin A is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States. Its molecular structure is unlike any Schedule I or II drug, so possession or sales is unlikely to be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.

====Florida====
&quot;Salvinorin A&quot; is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. There is an exception however for &quot;any drug product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration which contains salvinorin A or its isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers, if the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts is possible within the specific chemical designation.&quot;

===Australia===
Salvinorin A is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified salvinorin A (and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;) as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of April 1, 2006, in their regulation SFS 2006:167 listed as &quot;salvinorin A&quot;, making it illegal to sell or possess.

<doc id="143845" wikidata="Q3568268" url="?curid=143845" title="Wilkins Micawber">
<text>Wilkins Micawber is a fictional character in Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1850 novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. He is traditionally identified with the optimistic belief that &quot;something will turn up.&quot;

==His role in the story==
Micawber was incarcerated in debtors&#x27; prison (the King&#x27;s Bench Prison) after failing to meet his creditors&#x27; demands. His long-suffering wife, Emma, stands by him despite his financial exigencies that force her to pawn all of her family&#x27;s heirlooms. She lives by the maxims, &quot;I will never desert Mr. Micawber!&quot; and &quot;Experientia does it!&quot; (from &quot;Experientia docet&quot;, &quot;One learns by experience.&quot;)

Micawber is responsible for a major financial setback to another character. The hardworking, reliable Tommy Traddles, who is saving to furnish a home for the young woman he hopes to marry, allows his optimism to overcome his common sense. He &quot;lends his name&quot; to Micawber by co-signing for his rent, and when Micawber fails to pay, Micawber&#x27;s creditors seize all of the Micawber family&#x27;s furniture and personal effects, along with those of Traddles. Although Traddles eventually recovers the little round table and flower pot that symbolize his hopes for future happiness, he hampers himself financially by paying off Micawber&#x27;s debt.

Micawber is hired as a clerk by the scheming Uriah Heep, who assumes wrongly that Micawber&#x27;s debts arise from dishonesty. But working for Heep allows Micawber to expose his boss as a forger and a cheat. To start anew, Micawber and his family emigrate to Australia with Daniel Peggotty and Little Em&#x27;ly, where Micawber becomes manager of the Port Middlebay Bank and a successful government magistrate. Prior to leaving, Micawber repays the money Traddles spent settling his loan.

In Hablot Knight Browne&#x27;s illustrations for the first edition, Micawber is shown wearing knee-breeches, a top hat, and a monocle. Micawber was modelled on Dickens&#x27; father, John Dickens.

==Popular culture==
Micawber is known for asserting his faith that &quot;something will turn up.&quot; His name has become synonymous with someone who lives in hopeful expectation. This has formed the basis for the Micawber Principle, based upon his observation in Chapter 12:

Written in full, the expenditure amounts are nineteen pounds, nineteen shillings and sixpence (£19/19/6) and £20/0/6, the pre-decimal equivalents of £19.97 and £20.02 in modern British currency.

The character was played by W.C. Fields in the 1935 screen classic, &quot;Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger&quot;. Bob Hoskins took the role in a 1999 BBC serial. Peter Capaldi played Micawber in the 2019 Armando Iannucci film &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;.

Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones named one of his guitars (an early 1950s Fender Telecaster with a Gibson PAF humbucking pickup installed in the neck position) &quot;Micawber&quot;; Richards is known to be a fan of Dickens. &quot;There&#x27;s no reason for my guitar being called Micawber, apart from the fact that it&#x27;s such an unlikely name. There&#x27;s no one around me called Micawber, so when I scream for Micawber everyone knows what I&#x27;m talking about.&quot;

The character formed the basis of &quot;Micawber&quot;, a 2001 ITV drama series written by John Sullivan and starring David Jason in the title leading role. In the U.S. Supreme Court opinion of &quot;Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly&quot;, 550 U.S. 544, 562 (2007), Justice Souter criticized the court for an approach to pleading that &quot;would dispense with any showing of a reasonably founded hope that a plaintiff would be able to make a case; Mr. Micawber&#x27;s optimism would be enough.&quot;

==Entry into general English==
The character of Wilkins Micawber has given rise to the English noun &quot;Micawber&quot; and the adjectives &quot;Micawberish&quot; and &quot;Micawberesque.&quot; The &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; defines a Micawber as &quot;one who is poor but lives in optimistic expectation of better fortune.&quot; Judge David Halpern described Craig Whyte&#x27;s legal arguments in a case heard in 2013 as &quot;pure Micawberism.&quot;

==Quotations==
Besides the Micawber Principle, Micawber is notable for a number of memorable quotations:
* I have no doubt I shall, please Heaven, begin to be more beforehand with the world, and to live in a perfectly new manner, if—in short, anything turns up. (Chapter 11)
* Every happiness and prosperity! If, in the progress of revolving years, I could persuade myself that my blighted destiny had been a warning to you, I should feel that I had not occupied another man&#x27;s place altogether in vain. (Chapter 12)
* You HEEP of infamy! (Chapter 52)
* I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation -of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon, combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre. I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent Naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objectives, &quot;FOR ENGLAND, HOME AND BEAUTY.&quot; Remaining always, &amp;c, &amp;c, Wilkins Micawber.
* Welcome poverty!...Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!

==Film and television portrayals==

===Quotations from the 1935 film===
* Boy, as I have frequently had occasion to observe: &quot;When the stomach is empty, the spirits are low!&quot;
* Remember my motto &quot;Nil Desperandum! -Never despair!&quot;

===Quotation from the BBC TV/&quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; production===
* (featuring Bob Hoskins as Micawber) &quot;I could not depart this metropolis without paying a valedictory visit to my dear friend Copperfield, in whose debt I shall forever remain (I speak metaphorically of course!)&quot;

<doc id="143846" wikidata="Q2343249" url="?curid=143846" title="Old boy network">
<text>An old boy network (also known as old boys&#x27; network, old boys&#x27; club) is an informal system in which wealthy men with similar social or educational backgrounds help each other in business or personal matters. The term originally referred to social and business connections among former pupils of male-only elite schools, though the term is now also used to refer to any closed system of relationships that restrict opportunities to within the group. The term originated from much of the British upper-class having attended certain fee-charging public schools as boys, thus former pupils are &quot;old boys&quot;. 

This can apply to the network between the graduates of a single school regardless of their gender. It is also known as an &quot;old boys&#x27; society&quot; and is similar to an alumni association. It can also mean a network of social and business connections among the alumni of various prestigious schools. In popular language, &quot;old boy network&quot; or &quot;old boys&#x27; society&quot; has come to be used for the preservation of social elites in general; such connections within the British Civil Service formed a primary theme in the BBC&#x27;s satirical comedy series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. The phrase &quot;It&#x27;s not what you know, it&#x27;s who you know&quot; is associated with this tradition.

==Australia==

In Australia, the term &quot;Old Boy&quot; is used to describe a male alumnus of some prestigious state and private schools. The term &quot;Old Girl&quot; is similarly used for a female alumna of such schools. Both &quot;Old Girl&quot; and &quot;Old Boy&quot; are sometimes used as a reference to someone&#x27;s parents.

==Canada==

The term is also used in Canada, where the alumni of such schools as St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Trinity College School, Crescent School, St George&#x27;s School, Vancouver College, Stratford Hall, Bishop&#x27;s College School, Hillfield Strathallan College, Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, Lower Canada College, and Upper Canada College are known as Old Boys. Other influential private schools with powerful alumni networks may have become co-ed, such as Appleby College or University of Toronto Schools, but operate similarly in which large numbers of alumni all work for the same organization.

==Finland==

In Finland, the Finnish term hyvä veli -verkosto (literally &quot;dear brother network&quot;) is used to refer to the alleged informal network of men in high places whose members use their influence to pervert or circumvent official decision-making processes to the members&#x27; mutual benefit. As such, the term is pejorative.

The term derives from the salutation &quot;Hyvä veli!&quot;, or &quot;Dear brother!&quot;, traditionally used to open a letter to a not quite intimate friend. The implication is that since the elites of all fields are drawn from a fairly small pool of people who are mostly more or less acquainted with each other, they can and often do manage public and private affairs amongst themselves, off the record, and outside public scrutiny as they like. As the word &quot;brother&quot; implies, the network is usually presumed to consist of males, and thus the term is also sometimes used to refer to the marginalization of women and their exclusion from high positions in both the public and private spheres. There is an equivalent term, &quot;hyvä sisko&quot; (&quot;dear sister&quot;), used about informal networks of women in high positions.

President Urho Kekkonen was notable for directly communicating with senior officials (past his cabinets) through letters, which famously began with the salutation &quot;Hyvä veli&quot;. These have been published in three volumes.

==Hong Kong==

The term can also refer to the networks that are set up in the more elite secondary schools, such as Diocesan Boys&#x27; School, Queen&#x27;s College, Ying Wa College, La Salle College and Saint Joseph&#x27;s College.

==India==
The Doon School maintains its own old boys&#x27; society (The Doon School Old Boys&#x27; Society) for social connections and fundraising on behalf of the School. Graduates of The Doon School are known as &quot;Doscos&quot;, or simply, Old Boys.

Former students of the Welham Boys School refer to their society as the Welham Old Boys Society. Though the school was founded in 1937, the society was not founded until 1983. The group is intended to encourage Welham graduates to aid in the school&#x27;s success through their union; they have established scholarships and bursaries for deserving students. The Welham Old Boys Network has established definite membership criteria, as well as requiring a subscription fee.

Former pupils of Bishop Cotton School are referred to as Old Cottonians. The Old Cottonians Association was started in 1910 when 17 Old Cottonians assembled in the Freemason&#x27;s Hall in Shimla. The Old Cottonians Association is spread all over the world.

Similarly, the Old Boys of Sainik School Rewa in Madhya Pradesh call their Old Boys Association as &quot;Sainwinians&quot;.

Aligarh Muslim University Alumni had established AMU alumni associations all over India and elsewhere.

Some of the other schools to use the term are La Martiniere Calcutta, Calcutta Boys&#x27; School, La Martinière College Lucknow, Mayo College, Mayo College Girls School, St. Paul&#x27;s School Darjeeling, St. Edward&#x27;s School Shimla, The Lawrence School Sanawar, Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School.

== New Zealand ==

In New Zealand, many schools maintain old boys/girls/students associations, but the term &quot;old boy network&quot; is typically used about the elite public and private secondary schools such as Auckland Grammar School, King&#x27;s College, Sacred Heart College, Christ&#x27;s College and Scots College.

==Switzerland==

In Switzerland, the term can be used for the networks set up by the alumni organizations of private boarding schools such as Institut Le Rosey, Aiglon College, College Alpin International Beau Soleil, and College du Leman. These elite Swiss private schools are considered to have among the most prestigious alumni registries, with Switzerland having the highest private school fees in the world; these institutions attract the children of royalty, celebrities, political leaders, and business executives. Strong old boys/girls network also exist in private universities, notably École hôtelière de Lausanne and Les Roches International School of Hotel Management.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the &quot;old boy network&quot; is seen as existing primarily among those educated at the fee-paying independent schools (public schools) of the Eton Group and the Rugby Group including, but not limited to, Charterhouse School, Eton College, Harrow School, Oundle School, Radley College, Rugby School, Sherborne School, Bedford School, Shrewsbury School, Stowe School, Wellington College, Westminster School and Winchester College, as well as at the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, although to some extent such networks exist for all institutions producing large numbers of &quot;old boys&quot; and girls. The existence of &quot;old boy&quot; networks is often blamed for the high proportion of former pupils of high-status schools and universities in high-status positions in government, business, and other professions. For instance, between them, Harrow and Eton have 26 British prime ministers among their old boys. In practice, attendance at certain educational institutions is typical of the British &quot;ruling class&quot; and upper middle class, and where nepotism exists it may be driven more often by personal relationships than by educational networks.

An organisation called Future First promotes the use of such networks among those educated at state schools.

==United States==
In the United States, the &quot;Old Boys Network&quot; is a term more focused on the inside track with connections to powerful and ambitious individuals formed through work, professional and community service organizations, and private clubs. However, the original term of being associated with education has sometimes also been used in this context.

<text>The pudus (Mapudungun &quot;püdü&quot; or &quot;püdu&quot;, , ) are two species of South American deer from the genus Pudu, and are the world&#x27;s smallest deer. The chevrotains (mouse-deer; Tragulidae) are smaller, but they are not true deer. The name is a loanword from Mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuche people of central Chile and south-western Argentina. The two species of pudus are the [[northern pudu]] (&quot;Pudu mephistophiles&quot;) from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and the [[southern pudu]] (&quot;Pudu puda&quot;; sometimes incorrectly modified to &quot;Pudu pudu&quot;) from southern Chile and south-western Argentina. Pudus range in size from tall, and up to long. The southern pudu is classified as near threatened, while the northern pudu is classified as Data Deficient in the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pudu&quot; was first erected by English naturalist John Edward Gray in 1850. &quot;Pudua&quot; was a Latinized version of the name proposed by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1877, but was ruled invalid. Pudus are classified in the New World deer subfamily Capreolinae within the deer family Cervidae. The term &quot;pudú&quot; itself is derived from the language of the Mapuche people of the Los Lagos Region of south-central Chile. Because they live on the slopes of the Andes Mountain Range, they are also known as the &quot;Chilean mountain goat&quot;.

Two similar species of pudús are recognised:


==Description==
The pudus are the world&#x27;s smallest deer, with the southern pudu being slightly larger than the northern pudu. It has a stocky frame supported by short and slender legs. It is high at the shoulder and up to in length. Pudus normally weigh up to , but the highest recorded weight of a pudu is . Pudus have small, black eyes, black noses, and rounded ears with lengths of . Sexual dimorphism in the species includes an absence of antlers in females. Males have short, spiked antlers that are not forked, as seen in most species of deer. The antlers, which are shed annually, can extend from in length and protrude from between the ears. Also on the head are large preorbital glands. Pudus have small hooves, dewclaws, and short tails about in length when measured without hair. Coat coloration varies with season, sex, and individual genes. The fur is long and stiff, typically pressed close to the body, with a reddish-brown to dark-brown hue. The neck and shoulders of an aged pudu turn a dark gray-brown in the winter.

==Habitat and distribution==
The pudú inhabits temperate rainforests in South America, where the dense underbrush and bamboo thickets offer protection from predators. Southern Chile, south-west Argentina, Chiloé Island, and northwest South America are home to the deer. The northern pudú is found in the northern Andes of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru, from above sea level. The southern species is found in the slope of the southern Andes from sea level to .

The climate of the pudú&#x27;s habitat is composed of two main seasons: a damp, moderate winter and an arid summer. Annual precipitation in these areas of Argentina and Chile ranges from .

==Behavior==

===Social===
The pudú is a solitary animal whose behavior in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature. Pudús are crepuscular, most active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their home range generally extends about , much of which consists of crisscrossing pudú-trodden paths. Each pudú has its own home range, or territory. A single animal&#x27;s territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pudú deer. Pudús do not interact socially, other than to mate. An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear. Its fur bristles and the pudú shivers when angered.

Predators of the pudús include the horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, and other small cats. The pudú is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a proficient climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued. The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10 years in the wild. The longest recorded lifespan is 15 years and 9 months. However, such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age, from a wide range of causes. Maternal neglect of newborns, as well as a wide range of diseases, can decrease the population. A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree, pudús die from fear-induced cardiac complications.

===Diet===
The pudús are herbivorous, consuming vines, leaves from low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit. They can survive without drinking water for long periods due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diets.

Pudús have various methods of obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and cautious nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food to stand on their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.

===Reproduction===
Pudús are solitary and only come together for rut. Mating season is in the Southern Hemisphere autumn, from April to May. Pudú DNA is arranged into 70 chromosomes. To mate, the pudú male rests his chin on the female&#x27;s back, then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind, holding her with his fore legs. The gestation period ranges from 202 to 223 days (around 7 months) with the average being 210 days. A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring, from November to January. Newborns weigh with the average birth weight being . Newborns less than or more than die. Females and males weigh the same at birth. Fawns have reddish-brown fur and southern pudú fawns have white spots running the length of their backs. Young are weaned after 2 months. Females mature sexually in 6 months, while males mature in 8–12 months. Fawns are fully grown in 3 months, but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12 months.

==Status and conservation==

The southern pudu is currently listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, mainly because of overhunting and habitat loss, while the northern pudu is currently classified as being &#x27;Data deficient&#x27;. &quot;Pudu puda&quot; is listed in CITES Appendix I, and &quot;Pudu mephistophiles&quot; is listed in CITES Appendix II. The southern species is more easily maintained in captivity than the northern, though small populations of the northern formerly existed in zoos. , more than 100 southern pudús are kept at Species360-registered institutions with the vast majority in European and US zoos. Pudús are difficult to transport because they are easily overheated and stressed. Pudús are protected in various national parks; parks require resources to enforce protection of the deer.

Efforts to preserve the pudú species are being taken in order to prevent extinction. An international captive-breeding program for the southern pudú led by Universidad de Concepcion in Chile has been started. Some deer have been bred in captivity and reintroduced into Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina. Reintroduction efforts include the use of radio collars for tracking. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has banned the international trading of pudús. The Wildlife Conservation Society protects their natural habitat and works to recreate it for pudús in captivity. Despite efforts made by the World Wildlife Fund, the size of the pudú population remains unknown. Threats to the pudús remain despite various conservation efforts.

===Threats===
Pudús are threatened due to the destruction of their rainforest habitat. The land is cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.
Habitat fragmentation and road accidents cause pudú deaths. They are taken from the wild as pets, as well as exported illegally.
They are overhunted and killed for food by specially trained hunting dogs.
The recently introduced red deer compete with pudús for food. Domestic dogs prey upon pudús and transfer parasites through contact. Pudús are very susceptible to diseases such as bladder worms, lungworms, roundworms, and heartworms.

<doc id="143853" wikidata="Q2026327" url="?curid=143853" title="Word divider">
<text>In punctuation, a word divider is a form of glyph which separates written words. In languages which use the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic alphabets, as well as other scripts of Europe and West Asia, the word divider is a blank space, or &quot;whitespace&quot;. This convention is spreading, along with other aspects of European punctuation, to Asia and Africa, where words are usually written without word separation.

In character encoding, word segmentation depends on which characters are defined as word dividers.

==History==
In Ancient Egyptian, determinatives may have been used as much to demarcate word boundaries as to disambiguate the semantics of words. Rarely in Assyrian cuneiform, but commonly in the later cuneiform Ugaritic alphabet, a vertical stroke 𒑰 was used to separate words. In Old Persian cuneiform, a diagonally sloping wedge 𐏐 was used.

As the alphabet spread throughout the ancient world, words were often run together without division, and this practice remains or remained until recently in much of South and Southeast Asia. However, not infrequently in inscriptions a vertical line, and in manuscripts a single (·), double (:), or triple (⁝) interpunct (dot) was used to divide words. This practice was found in Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and continues today with Ethiopic, though there whitespace is gaining ground.

===Scriptio continua===
The early alphabetic writing systems, such as the Phoenician alphabet, had only signs for consonants (although some signs for consonants could also stand for a vowel, so-called &quot;matres lectionis&quot;). Without some form of visible word dividers, parsing a text into its separate words would have been a puzzle. With the introduction of letters representing vowels in the Greek alphabet, the need for inter-word separation lessened. The earliest Greek inscriptions used interpuncts, as was common in the writing systems which preceded it, but soon the practice of &quot;scriptio continua&quot;, continuous writing in which all words ran together without separation became common.

== Types ==
===None===
Alphabetic writing without inter-word separation, known as &quot;scriptio continua&quot;, was used in Ancient Egyptian. It appeared in Post-classical Latin after several centuries of the use of the interpunct.

Traditionally, &quot;scriptio continua&quot; was used for the Indic alphabets of South and Southeast Asia and hangul of Korea, but spacing is now used with hangul and increasingly with the Indic alphabets.

Today Chinese and Japanese are the most widely used scripts consistently written without punctuation to separate words, though other scripts such as Thai and Lao also follow this writing convention. In Classical Chinese, a word and a character were almost the same thing, so that word dividers would have been superfluous. Although Modern Mandarin has numerous polysyllabic words, and each syllable is written with a distinct character, the conceptual link between character and word or at least morpheme remains strong, and no need is felt for word separation apart from what characters already provide. This link is also found in the Vietnamese language; however, in the Vietnamese alphabet, virtually all syllables are separated by spaces, whether or not they form word boundaries.

===Space===
Space is the most common word divider, especially in Latin script.


===Vertical lines===
Ancient inscribed and cuneiform scripts such as Anatolian hieroglyphs frequently used short vertical lines to separate words, as did Linear B. In manuscripts, vertical lines were more commonly used for larger breaks, equivalent to the Latin comma and period. This was the case for Biblical Hebrew (the paseq) and continues with many Indic scripts today (the danda).

===Interpunct, multiple dots, and hypodiastole===
As noted above, the single and double interpunct were used in manuscripts (on paper) throughout the ancient world. For example, Ethiopic inscriptions used a vertical line, whereas manuscripts used double dots (፡) resembling a colon. The latter practice continues today, though the space is making inroads. Classical Latin used the interpunct in both paper manuscripts and stone inscriptions. Ancient Greek orthography used between two and five dots as word separators, as well as the hypodiastole.

===Different letter forms===
In the modern Hebrew and Arabic alphabets, some letters have distinct forms at the ends and/or beginnings of words. This demarcation is used in addition to spacing.

===Vertical arrangement===

The Nastaʿlīq form of Islamic calligraphy uses vertical arrangement to separate words. The beginning of each word is written higher than the end of the preceding word, so that a line of text takes on a sawtooth appearance. Nastaliq spread from Persia and today is used for Persian, Uyghur, Pashto, and Urdu.

===Pause===
In finger spelling and in Morse code, words are separated by a pause.

==Unicode==
For use with computers, these marks have codepoints in Unicode:
* 
* 
* 

In Linear B script:

<doc id="143854" wikidata="Q1067693" url="?curid=143854" title="Interpunct">
<text>An interpunct , also known as an interpoint, middle dot, middot, centered dot or centred dot, is a punctuation mark consisting of a vertically centered dot used for interword separation in Classical Latin. (Word-separating spaces did not appear until some time between 600 and 800CE.) It appears in a variety of uses in some modern languages.

The [[#In mathematics and science|multiplication dot]] or &quot;dot operator&quot; is frequently used in mathematical and scientific notation, and it may differ in appearance from the interpunct.

==In written language==
Various dictionaries use the interpunct (in this context, sometimes called a hyphenation point) to indicate where to split a word and insert a hyphen if the word doesn&#x27;t fit on the line. There is also a separate Unicode character, .

=== English ===
In British typography, the space dot was once used as the formal decimal point. Its use was advocated by laws and can still be found in some UK-based academic journals such as &quot;The Lancet&quot;. When the pound sterling was decimalised in 1971, the official advice issued was to write decimal amounts with a raised point (for example, ) and to use a decimal point &quot;on the line&quot; only when typesetting constraints made it unavoidable. However, this usage had already been declining since the 1968 ruling by the Ministry of Technology to use the full stop as the decimal point, not only because of that ruling but also because it is the widely-adopted international standard, and because the standard UK keyboard layout (for typewriters and computers) has only the full stop. The space dot is still used by some in handwriting.

In the early modern era, full stops (periods) were sometimes written as interpuncts (for example in the depicted 1646 transcription of the Mayflower Compact).

In the Shavian alphabet, interpuncts replace capitalization as the marker of proper nouns. The dot is placed at the beginning of a word.

===Catalan===

The (&quot;flying point&quot;) is used in Catalan between two Ls in cases where each belongs to a separate syllable, for example , &quot;cell&quot;. This distinguishes such &quot;geminate Ls&quot; (), which are pronounced , from &quot;double L&quot; (), which are written without the flying point and are pronounced . In situations where the flying point is unavailable, periods (as in ) or hyphens (as in ) are frequently used as substitutes, but this is tolerated rather than encouraged.

Historically, medieval Catalan also used the symbol as a marker for certain elisions, much like the modern apostrophe (see Occitan below) and hyphenations.

There is no separate physical keyboard layout for Catalan: the flying point can be typed using in the Spanish (Spain) layout or with on a US English layout. On a mobile phone with a Catalan keyboard layout, the geminate L with a flying dot appears when holding down the key. It appears in Unicode as the pre-composed letters (U+013F) and (U+0140), but they are compatibility characters and are not frequently used or recommended.

===Chinese===
The interpunct is used in Chinese (which generally lacks spacing between characters) to mark divisions in words transliterated from phonogram languages, particularly names. Lacking its own code point in Unicode, the interpunct in Chinese shares the code point U+00B7 (), and it is properly (and in Taiwan formally) of full-width U+30FB (). When the Chinese text is romanized, the partition sign is simply replaced by a standard space or other appropriate punctuation. Thus, William Shakespeare is written as and George W. Bush as . Titles and other translated words are not similarly marked: Genghis Khan and Elizabeth II are simply and without a partition sign.

The partition sign is also used to separate book and chapter titles when they are mentioned consecutively: book first and then chapter.

=== Hokkien ===
In Pe̍h-ōe-jī for Taiwanese Hokkien, middle dot is often used as a workaround for the &quot;dot above&quot; right diacritic, since most early encoding systems did not support this diacritic. This is now encoded as . Unicode did not support this diacritic until June 2005. Newer fonts often support it natively; however, the practice of using middle dot still exists. Historically, it was derived in the late 19th century from an older barred-o with curly tail as an adaptation to the typewriter.

===Tibetan===

In Tibetan the interpunct, called (), is used as a morpheme delimiter.

=== Ethiopic ===
The Geʽez (Ethiopic) script traditionally separates words with an interpunct of two vertically aligned dots, like a colon, but with larger dots: (For example Starting in the late 19th century the use of such punctuation has largely fallen out of use in favor of whitespace, except in formal hand-written or liturgical texts. In Eritrea the character may be used as a comma.

===Franco-Provençal===
In Franco-Provençal (or Arpitan), the interpunct is used in order to distinguish the following graphemes:
* ch·, pronounced , versus ch, pronounced 
* j·, pronounced , versus j, pronounced 
* g· before &quot;e, i,&quot; pronounced , versus g before &quot;e, i,&quot; pronounced 

=== French ===
In modern French, the interpunct is sometimes used for gender-neutral writing, as in for (&quot;the employees [both male and female]&quot;).

=== Greek ===

Ancient Greek lacked spacing or interpuncts but instead ran all the letters together. By Late Antiquity, various marks were used to separate words, particularly the Greek comma.

In modern Greek, the ano teleia mark (; also known as ) is the infrequently-encountered Greek semicolon and is properly romanized as such. In Greek text, Unicode provides the code point , however, it is also expressed as an interpunct. In practice, the separate code point for ano teleia canonically decomposes to the interpunct.

The Hellenistic scholars of Alexandria first developed the mark for a function closer to the comma, before it fell out of use and was then repurposed for its present role.

=== Japanese ===

Interpuncts are often used to separate transcribed foreign names or words written in katakana. For example, &quot;Beautiful Sunday&quot; becomes (). A middle dot is also sometimes used to separate lists in Japanese instead of the Japanese comma. Dictionaries and grammar lessons in Japanese sometimes also use a similar symbol to separate a verb suffix from its root. While some fonts may render the Japanese middle dot as a square under great magnification, this is not a defining property of the middle dot that is used in China or Japan.

However, the Japanese writing system usually does not use space or punctuation to separate words (though the mixing of katakana, kanji and hiragana gives some indication of word boundary).

In Japanese typography, there exist two Unicode code points:
* , with a fixed width that is the same as most kana characters, known as &quot;fullwidth&quot;.

The interpunct also has a number of other uses in Japanese, including the following: to separate titles, names and positions: (Assistant Section Head · Suzuki); as a decimal point when writing numbers in kanji: ; as a slash when writing for &quot;or&quot; in abbreviations: ; and in place of hyphens, dashes and colons when writing vertically.

=== Korean ===
Interpuncts are used in written Korean to denote a list of two or more words, similarly to how a slash (/) is used to juxtapose words in many other languages. In this role it also functions in a similar way to the English en dash, as in , &quot;American–Soviet relations&quot;. The use of interpuncts has declined in years of digital typography and especially in place of slashes, but, in the strictest sense, a slash cannot replace a middle dot in Korean typography.

 () is used more than a middle dot when an interpunct is to be used in Korean typography, though &quot;araea&quot; is technically not a punctuation symbol but actually an obsolete Hangul &quot;jamo&quot;. Because &quot;araea&quot; is a full-width letter, it looks better than middle dot between Hangul. In addition, it is drawn like the middle dot in Windows default Korean fonts such as &quot;Batang&quot;.

=== Latin ===
The interpunct () was regularly used in classical Latin to separate words. In addition to the most common round form, inscriptions sometimes use a small equilateral triangle for the interpunct, pointing either up or down. It may also appear as a mid-line comma, similar to the Greek practice of the time. The interpunct fell out of use , and Latin was then written for several centuries.

=== Occitan ===
In Occitan, especially in the Gascon dialect, the interpunct (&quot;punt interior&quot;, literally, &quot;inner dot&quot;, or &quot;ponch naut&quot; for &quot;high / upper point&quot;) is used to distinguish the following graphemes:
* s·h, pronounced , versus sh, pronounced , for example, in &quot;des·har&quot; &#x27;to undo&#x27; vs &quot;deishar&quot; &#x27;to leave&#x27;
* n·h, pronounced , versus nh, pronounced , for example in &quot;in·hèrn&quot; &#x27;hell&#x27; vs &quot;vinha&quot; &#x27;vineyard&#x27;
Although it is considered to be a spelling error, a period is frequently used when a middle dot is unavailable: &quot;des.har, in.hèrn&quot;, which is the case for French keyboard layout.

In modern editions of Old Occitan texts, the apostrophe and interpunct are used to denote certain elisions that were not originally marked. The apostrophe is used with proclitic forms and the interpunct is used with enclitic forms:
* que·l (&quot;que lo&quot;, that the) versus qu&#x27;el (that he)
* From Bertran de Born&#x27;s &quot;Ab joi mou lo vers e·l comens&quot; (translated by James H. Donalson):
&quot;Bela Domna·l vostre cors gens&quot; 
&quot;E·lh vostre bel olh m&#x27;an conquis,&quot; 
&quot;E·l doutz esgartz e lo clars vis,&quot; 
&quot;E·l vostre bels essenhamens,&quot; 
&quot;Que, can be m&#x27;en pren esmansa,&quot; 
&quot;De beutat no·us trob egansa:&quot; 
&quot;La genser etz c&#x27;om posc&#x27;e·l mon chauzir,&quot; 
&quot;O no·i vei clar dels olhs ab que·us remir.&quot;

&quot;Domna·l&quot; = &quot;Domna, lo&quot; (&quot;Lady, the&quot;: singular definite article) 
&quot;E·lh&quot; = &quot;E li&quot; (&quot;And the&quot;: plural definite article) 
&quot;E·l&quot; = &quot;E lo&quot; (&quot;And the&quot;) 
&quot;E·l&quot; = &quot;E lo&quot; (&quot;And the&quot;) 
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;No·us&quot; = &quot;Non vos&quot; (&quot;(do) not... you&quot;: direct object pronoun) 
&quot;E·l&quot; = &quot;En lo&quot; (&quot;in the&quot;) 
&quot;No·i&quot; = &quot;Non i&quot; (&quot;(do) not... there&quot;) // &quot;Que·us&quot; = &quot;Que vos&quot; (&quot;that (I)... you&quot;)

O pretty lady, all your grace 
and eyes of beauty conquered me, 
sweet glance and brightness of your face 
and all your nature has to tell 
so if I make an appraisal 
I find no one like in beauty: 
most pleasing to be found in all the world 
or else the eyes I see you with have dimmed.
=== Old Irish ===
In many linguistic works discussing Old Irish (but not in actual Old Irish manuscripts), the interpunct is used to separate a pretonic preverbal element from the stressed syllable of the verb, e.g. &quot;gives&quot;. It is also used in citing the verb forms used after such preverbal elements (the prototonic forms), e.g. &quot;carries&quot;, to distinguish them from forms used without preverbs, e.g. &quot;carries&quot;. In other works, the hyphen (, ) or colon (, ) may be used for this purpose.

=== Runes ===
Runic texts use either an interpunct-like or a colon-like punctuation mark to separate words. There are two Unicode characters dedicated for this:
* 

==In mathematics and science==
Up to the mid twentieth century, and sporadically even much later, the interpunct could be found used as the decimal point in British publications, such as tables of constants (e.g., &quot;&quot;). Conversely the multiplication sign was a full stop (period).

In publications conforming to the standards of the International System of Units, as well as the multiplication sign (×), the centered dot (dot operator) or space (often typographically a non-breaking space) can be used as a multiplication sign. Only a comma or full stop (period) may be used as a decimal marker. The centered dot can be used when multiplying units, as in for the newton expressed in terms of SI base units. In the United States, the use of a centered dot for the multiplication of numbers or values of quantities is discouraged by NIST.

In mathematics, a small middle dot can be used to represent multiplication; for example, formula_1 for multiplying formula_2 by formula_3. When dealing with scalars, it is interchangeable with the multiplication sign (), as long as the multiplication sign is between numerals such that it would not be mistaken as variable formula_4. For instance, formula_5 means the same thing as formula_6. However, when dealing with vectors, the dot operator denotes a dot product (e.g. formula_7, a scalar), which is distinct from the cross product (e.g. formula_8, a vector).

Another usage of this symbol in mathematics is with functions, where the dot is used as a placeholder for a function argument, in order to distinguish between the (general form of the) function itself and the value or a specific form of a function evaluated at a given point or with given specifications. For example, formula_9 denotes the function formula_10, and formula_11 denotes a partial application, where the first two arguments are given and the third argument shall take any valid value on its domain.

The bullet operator, , U+2219, is sometimes used to denote the &quot;AND&quot; relationship in formal logic.

In computing, the middle dot is usually displayed (but not printed) to indicate white space in various software applications such as word processing, graphic design, web layout, desktop publishing or software development programs. In some word processors, interpuncts are used to denote not only hard space or space characters, but also sometimes used to indicate a space when put in paragraph format to show indentations and spaces. This allows the user to see where white space is located in the document and what sizes of white space are used, since normally white space is invisible so tabs, spaces, non-breaking spaces and such are indistinguishable from one another.

In chemistry, the middle dot is used to separate the parts of formulas of addition compounds, mixture salts or solvates (typically hydrates), such as of copper(II) sulphate pentahydrate, . The middle dot should not be surrounded by spaces when indicating a chemical adduct.

==The middot as a letter==

A middot may be used as a consonant or modifier letter, rather than as punctuation, in transcription systems and in language orthographies. For such uses Unicode provides the code point .

In Americanist phonetic notation, the middot is a more common variant of the colon used to indicate vowel length. It may be called a &quot;half-colon&quot; in such usage. Graphically, it may be high in the letter space (the top dot of the colon) or centered as the interpunct. From Americanist notation, it has been adopted into the orthographies of several languages, such as Washo.

In the writings of Franz Boas, the middot was used for palatal or palatalized consonants, e.g. for IPA [c].

In the Sinological tradition of the 36 initials, the onset 影 (typically reconstructed as a glottal stop) may be transliterated with a middot , and the onset 喻 (typically reconstructed as a null onset) with an apostrophe . Conventions vary, however, and it is common for 影 to be transliterated with the apostrophe. These conventions are used both for Chinese itself and for other scripts of China, such as ʼPhags-pa and Jurchen.

In the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, a middle dot ⟨ᐧ⟩ indicates a syllable medial ⟨w⟩ in Cree and Ojibwe, ⟨y⟩ or ⟨yu⟩ in some of the Athapascan languages, and a syllable medial ⟨s⟩ in Blackfoot. However, depending on the writing tradition, the middle dot may appear after the syllable it modifies (which is found in the Western style) or before the syllable it modifies (which is found in the Northern and Eastern styles). In Unicode, the middle dot is encoded both as independent glyph or as part of a pre-composed letter, such as in . In the Carrier syllabics subset, the middle dot Final indicates a glottal stop, but a centered dot diacritic on -position letters transform the vowel value to , for example: , .

<doc id="143856" wikidata="Q380933" url="?curid=143856" title="Space (punctuation)">
<text>In writing, a space () is a blank area that separates words, sentences, syllables (in syllabification) and other written or printed glyphs (characters). Conventions for spacing vary among languages, and in some languages the spacing rules are complex. Inter-word spaces ease the reader&#x27;s task of identifying words, and avoid outright ambiguities such as &quot;now here&quot; vs. &quot;nowhere&quot;. They also provide convenient guides for where a human or program may start new lines.

Typesetting can use spaces of varying widths, just as it can use graphic characters of varying widths. Unlike graphic characters, typeset spaces are commonly stretched in order to align text. A typewriter, on the other hand, typically has only one width for all characters, including spaces. Following widespread acceptance of the typewriter, some typewriter conventions influenced typography and the design of printed works.

Computer representation of text facilitates getting around mechanical and physical limitations such as character widths in at least two ways:

* Character encodings such as Unicode provide spaces of several widths, which are encoded using distinct numeric code points. For example, Unicode U+0020 is the &quot;normal&quot; space character, but U+00A0 adds the meaning that a new line should not be started there, while U+2003 represents a space with a fixed width of one em. Collectively, such characters are called Whitespace characters.

* Formatting and drawing languages and software commonly provide much more flexibility in spacing. For example, SVG, PostScript, and countless other languages enable drawing characters at specific (x,y) coordinates on a screen or page. By drawing each word at a specific starting coordinate, such programs need not &quot;draw&quot; spaces at all (this can lead to difficulties in extracting the correct text back out). Similarly, word processors can &quot;fully justify&quot; text, stretching inter-word spaces to make all lines the same length (as can mechanical Linotype machines). Precision is limited by physical capabilities of output devices.

==Use in natural languages==

===Between words===

Modern English uses a space to separate words, but not all languages follow this practice. According to Paul Saenger in &quot;Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading,&quot; Ancient Hebrew and Arabic did use spaces partly to compensate in clarity for the lack of written vowels when no was used for a vowel, though in the Middle Ages they sometimes omitted spaces when vowel points were marked. The earliest Greek script also used interpuncts to divide words rather than spacing, although this practice was soon displaced by the . In Latin, spaces and interpuncts came often to be dropped in favor of , and were not used to separate words again until roughly AD 600–800.

Word spacing was later used by Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, beginning after the creation of the Carolingian minuscule by Alcuin of York and the scribes’ adoption of it. Spacing would become standard in Renaissance Italy and France, and then Byzantium by the end of the 16th century; then entering into the Slavic languages in Cyrillic in the 17th century, and only in modern times entering modern Sanskrit.

CJK languages do not use spaces when dealing with text containing mostly Chinese characters and kana. In Japanese, spaces may occasionally be used to separate people’s family names from given names, to denote omitted particles (especially the topic particle &quot;wa&quot;), and for certain literary or artistic effects. Modern Korean, however, has spaces as an essential part of its writing system (because of Western influence), given the phonetic nature of the hangul script that requires word dividers to avoid ambiguity, as opposed to Chinese characters which are mostly very distinguishable from each other. In Korean, spaces are used to separate chunks of nouns, nouns and particles, adjectives, and verbs; for certain compounds or phrases, spaces may be used or not, as in the phrase for “Republic of Korea,” usually spelled without spaces as rather than with a space as .

Runic texts use either an interpunct-like or a colon-like punctuation mark to separate words. There are two Unicode characters dedicated for this: and .

===Between sentences===
Languages with a Latin-derived alphabet have used various methods of sentence spacing since the advent of movable type in the 15th century.

* One space (some times called &quot;French spacing&quot;, &quot;q.v.&quot;). This is a common convention in most countries that use the ISO basic Latin alphabet for published and final written work, as well as digital (World Wide Web) media. Web browsers usually do not differentiate between single and multiple spaces in source code when displaying text, unless the text is given a &quot;white-space&quot; CSS attribute. Without this being set, collapsing strings of spaces to a single space allow HTML source code to be spaced in a more machine-readable way, at the expense of control over the spacing of the rendered page.
* Double space (&quot;English spacing&quot;). It is sometimes claimed that this convention stems from the use of the monospaced font on typewriters. However, instructions to use more spacing between sentences than words date back centuries, and two spaces on a typewriter was the closest approximation to typesetters&#x27; previous rules aimed at improving readability. Wider spacing continued to be used by both typesetters and typists until the Second World War, after which typesetters gradually transitioned to word spacing between sentences in published print, while typists continued the practice of using two spaces.
* One widened space, typically one-and-a-third to slightly less than twice as wide as a word space. This spacing was sometimes used in typesetting before the 19th century. It has also been used in other non-typewriter typesetting systems such as the Linotype machine and the TeX system. Modern computer-based digital fonts can adjust the spacing after terminal punctuation as well, creating a space slightly wider than a standard word space.

There has been some controversy regarding the proper amount of sentence spacing in typeset material. The &quot;Elements of Typographic Style&quot; states that only a single word space is required for sentence spacing. Psychological studies suggest &quot;readers benefit from having two spaces after periods.&quot;

===Unit symbols and numbers===
The International System of Units (SI) prescribes inserting a space between a number and a unit of measurement (the space being regarded as an implied multiplication sign) but never between a prefix and a base unit; a space (or a multiplication dot) should also be used between units in compound units.

The only exception to this rule is the traditional symbolic notation of angles: degree (e.g., 30°), minute of arc (e.g., 22′), and second of arc (e.g., 8″).

The SI also prescribes the use of a space (often typographically a thin space) as a thousands separator where required. Both the point and the comma are reserved as decimal markers.

Sometimes a narrow non-breaking space or non-breaking space, respectively, is recommended (as in, for example, IEEE Standards and IEC standards) to avoid the separation of units and values or parts of compounds units, due to automatic line wrap and word wrap.

==Encoding==
Unicode defines many variants of a single whitespace character, with various properties; the more commonly encountered variations include:
* 
* 

In URLs, spaces are percent encoded with its ASCII/UTF-8 representation codice_1.

=== Types of spaces ===
* Figure space
* Non-breaking space
* Thin space
* Visible space
* Zero-width space

== See also ==
* Em (typography)
* En (typography)
* Halfwidth and fullwidth forms
* Internal field separator
* Sentence spacing in digital media
* Underscore
* Whitespace character

<doc id="143861" wikidata="Q2450622" url="?curid=143861" title="Traffic enforcement camera">
<text>A traffic enforcement camera (also a [[red light camera]], speed camera, road safety camera, bus lane camera, depending on use) is a camera which may be mounted beside or over a road or installed in an enforcement vehicle to detect motoring offenses, including speeding, vehicles going through a red traffic light, vehicles going through a toll booth without paying, unauthorized use of a bus lane, or for recording vehicles inside a congestion charge area. It may be linked to an automated ticketing system.

A worldwide review of studies found that speed cameras led to a reduction of &quot;11% to 44% for fatal and serious injury crashes&quot;. The UK Department for Transport estimated that cameras had led to a 22% reduction in personal injury collisions and 42% fewer people being killed or seriously injured at camera sites. The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; reported that speed cameras were effective at reducing accidents and injuries in their vicinity and recommended wider deployment. An LSE study in 2017 found that &quot;adding another 1,000 cameras to British roads could save up to 190 lives annually, reduce up to 1,130 collisions and mitigate 330 serious injuries.&quot; Research indicates that automated traffic enforcement alleviates biases associated with police stops.

The latest automatic number-plate recognition systems can be used for the detection of average speeds and raise concerns over loss of privacy and the potential for governments to establish mass surveillance of vehicle movements and therefore by association also the movement of the vehicle&#x27;s owner. Vehicle owners are often required by law to identify the driver of the vehicle and a case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights which found that human rights were not being breached. Some groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union in the US, claim that &quot;the common use of speed traps as a revenue source also undercuts the legitimacy of safety efforts.&quot;

==Types==

===Bus lane enforcement===
Some bus lane enforcement cameras use a sensor in the road, which triggers a number-plate recognition camera, which compares the vehicle registration plate with a list of approved vehicles and records images of other vehicles. Other systems use a camera mounted on the bus, for example in London where they monitor Red routes on which stopping is not allowed for any purpose (other than taxis and disabled parking permit holders).

On Monday, February 23, 2009, New York City announced testing camera enforcement of bus lanes on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan where a New York City taxi illegally using the bus lanes would face a fine of $150 adjudicated by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.

In October 2013, in Melbourne (Australia), Melbourne Airport introduced seven automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras in their bus forecourt to monitor bus lanes and provide charging points based on vehicle type and the dwell time of each vehicle. Entry and Exit cameras determine the length of stay and provide alerts for unregistered or vehicles of concern via onscreen, email, or SMS-based alerts. This system was the first of several Sensor Dynamics based ANPR solutions.
===Red light enforcement===

A red light camera is a traffic camera that takes an image of a vehicle that goes through an intersection where the light is red. The system continuously monitors the traffic signal and the camera is triggered by any vehicle entering the intersection above a preset minimum speed and following a specified time after the signal has turned red.

Red light cameras are also utilized in capturing texting-while-driving violators. In many municipalities, an officer monitors the cameras in a live command center and records all violations, including texting at a red light.

===Speed limit enforcement===

Speed enforcement cameras are used to monitor compliance with speed limits, which may use Doppler radar, LIDAR, stereo vision or automatic number-plate recognition. Other speed enforcement systems are also used which are not camera based.

Fixed or mobile speed camera systems that measure the time taken by a vehicle to travel between two or more fairly distant sites (from several hundred meters to several hundred kilometers apart) are called average speed cameras. These cameras time vehicles over a known fixed distance, and then calculate the vehicle&#x27;s average speed for the journey.

===Stop sign enforcement===

In 2007, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), in California, installed the first stop sign cameras in the United States. The five cameras are located in state parks such as Franklin Canyon Park and Temescal Gateway Park. The operator, Redflex Traffic Systems Inc., is paid $20 per ticket. The fine listed on the citation is $100. In 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against MRCA.

===Noise pollution camera (&quot;noise radar&quot;)===
Noise enforcement cameras are used to monitor and enforce compliance with local or national vehicle noise limits.

Noise cameras follow the same basic construction: a microphone linked to an ANPR video camera, mounted at a fixed location or on a mobile tripod. The ANPR camera is triggered when the microphone detects a passing vehicle emitting a sound signal above a pre-set decibel limit, capturing the vehicle registration and giving police or local government recourse to warn, fine, or prosecute the registered owner. These cameras have been designed to respond to mass complaints about vehicle noise (in 2020 New York City recorded over 99,000 noise complaints specifically related to vehicles).

Trials of noise cameras have been conducted in cities worldwide. In Taipei, fines range from US$65 to US$130, with additional fines for illegally modified exhausts of up to US$1000. The noise camera scheme won 90% voter approval; the national government then earmarked $4m to build a national network of noise cameras, including mobile cameras.

In 2020 the UK Department for Transport published a feasibility study commissioned from a joint venture between engineering consultancies Atkins and Jacobs. The Atkins/Jacobs noise camera setup was unable to consistently derive sound readings from cars travelling less than ten seconds apart from other vehicles. This camera was a trial unit that hasn&#x27;t since been deployed. Similar results were found in a trial in Edmonton, Canada undertaken in 2018. Local government cited technical shortcomings with the trial setup to explain spending $192,000 on noise cameras that recouped $98,000 in fines.

===Number-plate recognition systems===

Automatic number-plate recognition can be used for purposes unrelated to enforcement of traffic rules.

The world&#x27;s first all-weather, 24-hour, automatic number plate recognition system SAFE-T-CAM was developed in Australia for the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) by Telstra as the prime contractor and ICONIX and CSIRO as sub-contractors in 1991. In Australia&#x27;s SAFE-T-CAM system, ANPR technology is used to monitor long-distance truck drivers to detect avoidance of legally prescribed driver rest periods.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s police ANPR system logs all the vehicles passing particular points in the national road network, allowing authorities to track the movement of vehicles and individuals across the country.

In the UK, 80-year-old pensioner John Catt and his daughter Linda were stopped by City of London Police while driving in London in 2005. They had their vehicle searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and were threatened with arrest if they refused to answer questions. After they complained formally, it was discovered they were stopped when their car was picked up by the roadside ANPR CCTV cameras; it had been flagged in the Police National Computer database when they were seen near EDO MBM demonstrations in Brighton. Critics say that the Catts had been suspected of no crime, however, the police ANPR system led to them being targeted due to their association.

===Multipurpose camera===
In 2011, a multipurpose smart enforcement camera was tested in Finland.
This camera can check driving speeds, the driver wearing a seatbelt, the distance between cars, insurance, and tax payments.

Other multipurpose cameras can check vehicles passing over the railway crossing.

In 2016, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) implemented the No Contact Apprehension Policy in apprehending traffic violations such as disregarding traffic control signs and other violations via their closed-circuit television camera or other digital camera and/or other technologies. It was later adapted by other Metro Manila local government units such as Manila, Parañaque, Quezon City, Valenzuela, San Juan, Muntinlupa and Marikina, and also in provinces LGUs like Cauayan in Isabela and the whole province of Bataan.

===Other===
* Congestion charge cameras to detect vehicles inside the chargeable area which have not paid the appropriate fee
* High-occupancy vehicle lane cameras to identify vehicles violating occupancy requirements.
* Level crossing cameras to identifying vehicles crossing railways at grade
* Noise pollution cameras that record evidence of heavy vehicles that break noise regulations by using compression release engine brakes
* Parking cameras that issue citations to vehicles that are illegally parked or that were not moved from a street at posted times.
* Toll-booth cameras to identify vehicles proceeding through a toll booth without paying the toll
* Turn cameras at intersections where specific turns are prohibited on red. This type of camera is mostly used in cities or heavily populated areas.
* Automatic number-plate recognition systems can be used for multiple purposes, including identifying untaxed and uninsured vehicles, stolen cars, and potentially mass surveillance of motorists.
* Bus lane cameras that detect vehicles that should not be in the bus lane. These may be mounted on buses themselves as well as by the roadside.

Fixed camera systems can be housed in boxes, mounted on poles beside the road, or attached to gantries over the road, or to overpasses or bridges. Cameras can be concealed, for example in garbage bins.

Mobile speed cameras may be hand-held, tripod-mounted, or vehicle-mounted. In vehicle-mounted systems, detection equipment and cameras can be mounted to the vehicle itself, or simply tripod-mounted inside the vehicle and deployed out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not necessarily have to be stationary and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle&#x27;s relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle&#x27;s own speed to obtain its actual speed. The speedometer of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.

Some number-plate recognition systems can also be used from vehicles.

==Effectiveness==
Aside from the issues of legality in some countries and states and sometimes opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. Professor Stephen Glaister notes, &quot;What [studies have done] is to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – those who say that what little money there is can be better spent. [However, the] devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle.&quot;

The 2010 Cochrane Review of speed cameras for the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths reported that all 28 studies accepted by the authors found the effect of speed cameras to be a reduction in all crashes, injury crashes, and death or severe injury crashes. &quot;Twenty eight studies measured the effect on crashes. All 28 studies found a lower number of crashes in the speed camera areas after implementation of the program. In the vicinity of camera sites, the reductions ranged from 8% to 49% for all crashes, with reductions for most studies in the 14% to 25% range. For injury crashes the decrease ranged between 8% and 50% and for crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries the reductions were in the range of 11% to 44%. Effects over wider areas showed reductions for all crashes ranging from 9% to 35%, with most studies reporting reductions in the 11% to 27% range. For crashes resulting in death or serious injury reductions ranged from 17% to 58%, with most studies reporting this result in the 30% to 40% reduction range. The studies of longer duration showed that these positive trends were either maintained or improved with time. Nevertheless, the authors conceded that the magnitude of the benefit from speed cameras &quot;is currently not deducible&quot; due to limitations in the methodological rigor of many of the 28 studies cited, and recommended that &quot;more studies of a scientifically rigorous and homogenous nature are necessary, to provide the answer to the magnitude of effect.&quot;

The 2010 report, &quot;The Effectiveness of Speed Cameras A review of evidence&quot;, by Richard Allsop concludes &quot;The findings of this review for the RAC Foundation, though reached independently, are essentially consistent with the Cochrane Review conclusions. They are also broadly consistent with the findings of a meta-analysis reported in the respected Handbook of Road Safety Measures, of 16 studies, not including the four-year evaluation report, of the effects of fixed cameras on numbers of collisions and casualties.&quot;

While the articles above show the effectiveness of body cameras there is also a controversial side of things. Some states including Minnesota do not use traffic cameras for tickets while other neighboring states like Iowa do. This shows that traffic cameras are not usable the same way across jurisdictions and therefore making them less effective.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2001 the Nottingham Safety Camera Pilot achieved &quot;virtually complete compliance&quot; on the major ring road into the city using average speed cameras, across all Nottinghamshire SPECS installations, KSI (Killed / Seriously Injured) figures have fallen by an average of 65%.

In 2003 the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; reported that speed cameras were effective at reducing accidents and injuries and recommended wider deployment. In February 2005 the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; again reported that speed cameras were an effective intervention in reducing road traffic collisions and related casualties, noting however that most studies to date did not have satisfactory control groups. In 2003 Northumbria Police&#x27;s Acting Chief Inspector of motor patrols suggested that cameras did not reduce casualties but did raise revenue – an official statement from the police force later re-iterated that speed cameras do reduce casualties.

In December 2005 the Department for Transport published a four-year report into Safety Camera Partnerships which concluded that there was a 22% reduction in personal injury collisions and 42% fewer people being killed or seriously injured following the installation of cameras. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that this research showed that the department had been previous exaggerating the safety benefits of speed cameras but that the results were still &#x27;impressive&#x27;.

A report published by the RAC Foundation in 2010 estimated that an additional 800 more people a year could be killed or seriously injured on the UK&#x27;s roads if all speed cameras were scrapped. A survey conducted by The Automobile Association in May 2010 indicated that speed cameras were supported by 75% of their members.

The town of Swindon abandoned the use of fixed cameras in 2009, questioning their cost effectiveness with the cameras being replaced by vehicle activated warning signs and enforcement by police using mobile speed cameras: in the nine months following the switch-off there was a small reduction in accident rates which had changed slightly in similar periods before and after the switch off (Before: 1 fatal, 1 serious and 13 slight accidents. Afterwards: no fatalities, 2 serious and 12 slight accidents). The journalist George Monbiot said that the results were not statistically significant highlighting earlier findings across the whole of Wiltshire that there had been a 33% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured generally and a 68% reduction at camera sites during the previous 3 years. In 2012, the town had the fewest accident rates per 1,000 registered vehicles: a result linked by the Local Authority Member for Council Transformation, Transport and Strategic Planning to the removal of speed cameras and resultant additional funding for road safety, alongside close working with the police.

In Scotland, the introduction of average speed cameras significantly reduced speeding on the A9 and A96.

====Home Office Type Approval====
HOTA is an acronym for Home Office Type Approval, a testing and certification process by the Home Office in the United Kingdom that speed cameras must pass before evidence from them can be admissible in UK courts by way of certification in accordance with Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 (RTOA) (Amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). It is a misconception that speed enforcement devices must be Home Office Type Approved before they may be deployed on public roads to gather evidence of speeding offences however if the device does not have UK Type Approval then the evidence from the device is not able to be certified but must be adduced by a witness and perhaps an expert witness who is able to adduce evidence of its accuracy. The Road Traffic Offenders Act route via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court.

The Type Approval of devices that meet the definitions or more accurately &quot;prescriptions&quot; of types of devices in Statutory Instruments (forms of secondary legislation) is administered by the Home Office Road Crimes Section with the scientific scrutiny now performed by The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in conjunction with accredited technical laboratories. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) oversee a secretariat who coordinate police and laboratory testing of equipment in the process.

Only when DSTL scrutiny, laboratory testing and road testing is completed, and the equipment fully meets the specifications in the relevant Home Office Speedmeter Handbook will the equipment be recommended to the Secretary of State to be awarded UK Type Approval. Once recommended an administrative process takes place between the Home Office and the UK manufacturer or distributing agent in which a contract (Type Approval Agreement) is exchanged and agreed between both parties. When that contract is signed then a Type Approval Certificate is signed by a minister at the Home Office; the equipment can then be used to produce certifiable evidence, evidence of speeding that is admissible in UK courts without the support of a witness. There is no requirement to place the Type Approval Agreement or Certificate of Type Approval before Parliament because the Statutory Instrument defining the &quot;type&quot; of equipment has already been fully ratified by both Houses of Parliament.

The accuracies required to meet HOTA, as laid out in the Speedmeter Handbooks, are agreed internationally. They are not particularly challenging to meet for modern digital equipment however, HOTA requirements extend beyond accuracies; it is often the requirement that an instrument must not cause a violation record to be made when no violation exists that is the most difficult to meet. The Speedmeter Handbooks are freely and openly available to view, they provide guidance to manufacturers and the accredited test laboratories in the general requirements. DSTL and the Home Office may vary the requirements at any time and may adapt them depending upon the equipment that is to be assessed, the Handbooks being &quot;guidance&quot;.

Unlike approval systems in most countries, no equipment is approved without a police input into the testing. Rather than simply testing speed accuracy, the systems are all tested in real traffic situations some of which are created specifically to test a perceived weakness in the systems. Track and real road testing is always conducted so that all kinds of vehicles and traffic situations are used to stimulate the systems. Roadside equipment such as fixed cameras must pass environmental testing before deployment in road testing. The period used for road testing ensures that the systems are tested in all weather.

If one detection is made that is outside of the accuracy parameters or if one violation record is produced when no violation existed during any test, then the device will fail its approval until that error is rectified to the satisfaction of the Home Office and DSTL. When rectification is demonstrated testing may recommence.

=== United States ===
According to the 2003 NCHRP study on Red Light Running (RLR), &quot;RLR automated enforcement can be an effective safety countermeasure...[I]t appears from the findings of several studies that, in general, RLR cameras can bring about a reduction in the more severe angle crashes with, at worst, a slight increase in less severe rear-end crashes. However it noted that &quot;there is not enough empirical evidence based on proper experimental design procedures to state this conclusively.&quot;

A study conducted in Alabama and published in 2016 reveals that Red Light Cameras (RLCs) seem to have a slight impact on the clearance lost time; the intersections equipped with RLCs are half a second less in use compared with those without cameras; and highway capacity manual estimates a shorter lost time and thus may overestimate the intersection&#x27;s capacity.

A 2024 study found that automated traffic enforcement through speed cameras led to more equitable enforcement of speeding rules than police stops. Police stops were substantially more likely to target black drivers than automated traffic cameras were.

==Controversy==
===Legal issues===
Various legal issues arise from such cameras and the laws involved in how cameras can be placed and what evidence is necessary to prosecute a driver varies considerably in different legal systems.

One issue is the potential conflict of interest when private contractors are paid a commission based on the number of tickets they are able to issue. Pictures from the San Diego red light camera systems were ruled inadmissible as court evidence in September 2001. The judge said that the &quot;total lack of oversight&quot; and &quot;method of compensation&quot; made evidence from the cameras &quot;so untrustworthy and unreliable that it should not be admitted&quot;.

Some US states and provinces of Canada, such as Alberta, operate &quot;owner liability&quot;, where it is the registered owner of the vehicle who is legally responsible for paying all such fines, regardless who was driving the vehicle at the time of the offense, although they do release the owner from liability by identifying the actual driver and that person pays the fine, and in most such jurisdictions, convictions for such traffic offenses do not result in additional consequences for either drivers or owners (such as demerit points) besides the immediate financial consideration of the fine. In such jurisdictions, corporations that own vehicles (such as rental car companies) almost invariably require authorized drivers to agree in writing to assume financial responsibly for all such tickets.

In a few US states (including California), the cameras are set up to get a &quot;face photo&quot; of the driver. This has been done because in those states red light camera tickets are criminal violations, and criminal charges must always name the actual violator. In California, that need to identify the actual violator has led to the creation of a unique investigatory tool, the fake &quot;ticket&quot;. In Arizona and Virginia, tickets issued by cameras are unenforceable due to there being no penalty for ignoring them. However, acknowledging receipt of such ticket makes it valid and thus enforceable. Many states have outlawed the use of traffic enforcement cameras.

In April 2000, two motorists who were caught speeding in the United Kingdom challenged the &quot;Road Traffic Act 1988&quot;, which required the keeper of a car to identify the driver at a particular time as being in contradiction to the Human Rights Act 1998 on the grounds that it amounted to a &#x27;compulsory confession&#x27;, also that since the camera partnerships included the police, local authorities, Magistrates Courts Service (MCS) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which had a financial interest in the fine revenue that they would not get a fair trial. Their plea was initially granted by a judge then overturned but was then heard by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and the European Court of Justice (ECJ). In 2007 the European Court of Human Rights found there was no breach of article 6 in requiring the keepers of cars caught speeding on camera to provide the name of the driver.

===Accuracy===
In December 2012, Speed Camera Contractor Xerox Corporation admitted that cameras they had deployed in Baltimore city were producing erroneous speed readings and that 1 out of every 20 citations issued at some locations were due to errors. The erroneous citations included at least one issued to a completely stationary car, a fact revealed by a recorded video of the alleged violation.

In the city of Fort Dodge, Iowa, speed camera contractor Redspeed discovered a location where drivers of school buses, big panel trucks, and similar vehicles have been clocked speeding by the city&#x27;s mobile speed camera and radar unit even though they were obeying the 25 mph speed limit. The errors were due to what was described as an &quot;electromagnetic anomaly&quot;.

Where verification photos are recorded on a time sequence, allowing the calculation of actual speed, these have been used to challenge the accuracy of speed cameras in court. Motorists in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, have successfully challenged tickets from Optotraffic speed cameras where they were incorrectly ticketed at over 15 mph over the limit. However, Prince George County no longer allows time-distance calculations as a defense in cases where &quot;the equipment was calibrated and validated, or is self calibrating&quot;. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standards for &quot;across the road radar&quot; state that &quot;If the ATR device is to be considered for unattended operation, the manufacturer shall provide a secondary method for verifying that the evidential recorded image properly identifies the target vehicle and reflects this vehicle&#x27;s true speed, as described in §5.18.2. This may be accomplished by means of a second, appropriately delayed image showing the target vehicle crossing a specified reference line.&quot;

In January 2011 Edmonton, Alberta cancelled all 100,000 &quot;Speed On Green&quot; tickets issued in the previous 14 months due to concerns about camera reliability.

===Surveillance===

Police and governments have been accused of &quot;Big Brother tactics&quot; in over-monitoring of public roads, and of &quot;revenue raising&quot; in applying cameras in deceptive ways to increase government revenue rather than improve road safety.

Online websites, like Photo Radar Scam and BantheCams.org, have been created in reaction to the rising use of traffic cameras. Their primary goal, as stated by BantheCams.org, is to &quot;educate and equip local citizens with a way to combat the abuse of power now being exercised by local and state governments with the regards to the use of electronic surveillance devices.&quot;

Groups like NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) have encouraged the usage of automated speed enforcement to help improve general road safety and to decrease crash rates.

* Another issue that comes with people getting tickets in the mail due to traffic cameras is the lack of having officer interaction at this occurrence. When an officer pulls someone over to conduct a traffic stop they are able to look at the driver and for instance see if the drive may be impaired as well as looking at the car itself to see if a plain view search could be conducted. When this is taken away by a ticket through the mail someone committing a crime would not be caught in this incident as they would if they would have gotten pulled over in person.

===Revenue, not safety===
* In 2010, a campaign was set up against a speed camera on a dual carriageway in Poole, Dorset in a 30 mph area in the United Kingdom, which had generated £1.3m of fines every year since 1999. The initial Freedom of information request was refused and the information was only released after an appeal to the Information Commissioner.
* In May 2010, the new Coalition government said that the &#x27;Labour&#x27;s 13-year war on the motorist is over&#x27; and that the new government &#x27;pledged to scrap public funding for speed cameras&#x27; In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for the current year to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million, saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras for far too long and that he was pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result, the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country&#x27;s most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.
* In August 2010, the Oxfordshire, UK speed cameras were switched off because of lack of finance due to government funding policy changes. The cameras were switched back on in April 2011 after a new source of funding was found for them. Following rule changes on the threshold for offering &quot;Speed Awareness Courses&quot; as an alternative to a fine and licence points for drivers, and given that the compulsory fees charged for such courses go directly to the partnerships rather than directly to central government as is the case for fine revenues, the partnership will be able to fund its operations from course fees. Compared with the same period in the previous year with the cameras still switched on, the number of serious injuries that occurred during the same period with the cameras switched off was exactly the sameat 13and the number of slight injuries was 15 more at 70, resulting from 62 crashes2 more than when the cameras were still operating. There were no fatalities during either period.

===Unpopularity===
Claims of popular support are disputed by elections in the US, where the camera companies often sue to keep it off the ballot, and camera enforcement often loses by a wide margin . Automated enforcement is opposed by some motorists and motoring organizations as strictly for revenue generating. They have also been rejected in some places by referendum. Opinion polling in New York City, British Columbia, and Washington, DC have shown significant margins of approval for automatic speed enforcement. 

*The first speed camera systems in the US were in Friendswood, Texas, in 1986 and La Marque, Texas, in 1987. Neither program lasted more than a few months before public pressure forced them to be dropped.
*In 1991, cameras were rejected in referendum in Peoria, Arizona; voters were the first to reject cameras by a 2–1 margin.
*In 1992, cameras were rejected by voters in referendums in Batavia, Illinois.
*Anchorage, Alaska, rejected cameras in a 1997 referendum.
*In 2002, the state of Hawaii experimented with speed limit enforcement vans but they were withdrawn months later due to public outcry.
*A 2002 Australian survey found that &quot;The community generally believes that enforcement intensities should either stay the same or increase&quot;, with 40% of those surveyed saying that they thought that the number of speed cameras on the road should be increased, 43% saying that they thought the number should stay the same, and 13% saying that they thought that the number should be decreased. 
*In 2005, the Virginia legislature declined to reauthorize its red light camera enforcement law after a study questioned their effectiveness, only to reverse itself in 2007 and allow cameras to return to any city with a population greater than 10,000. Citations are not enforceable due to no penalty being in place if they are ignored.
*A 2007 literature review of the benefits and barriers to implementation of automated speed enforcement in the US. stated that &quot;In general, the results of [public opinion] surveys indicate that a majority of respondents support automated enforcement. However, the margins of support vary widely, from a low of 51 percent in Washington, D.C. to a high of 77 percent in Scottsdale, Arizona.&quot;
*In 2009, a petition was started in the town of College Station, Texas, which requested that all red light cameras be dismantled and removed from all of the town&#x27;s intersections. Enough signatures were captured to put the measure on the November 2009 general election ballot. After an extensive battle between the College Station city council and the opposing sides, both for and against red light cameras, the voters voted to eliminate the red light cameras throughout the entire city. By the end of November, the red light cameras were taken down.
*On May 4, 2010, an ordinance authorizing the use of speed cameras in the town of Sykesville, Maryland, was put to a referendum, in which 321 out of 529 voters (60.4%) voted against the cameras. The turnout for this vote was greater than the number of voters in the previous local Sykesville election for mayor where 523 voted.
*Arizona decided not to renew their contract with Redflex in 2011 following a study of their statewide 76 photo enforcement cameras. Reasons given included less than expected revenue due to improved compliance, mixed public acceptance and mixed accident data.

==Avoidance/evasion==
To avoid detection or prosecution, drivers may:
*Brake just before a camera in order to travel past its sensor below the speed limit. This is, however, a cause of collisions. Or brake suddenly, which results in rear-end crashes.
*Use GPS navigation devices, such as Waze, which contain databases of known camera locations to alert them in advance. These databases may, in some cases, be updated in near-realtime. The use of GPS devices to locate speed cameras is illegal in some jurisdictions, such as France. In Australia, the use of GPS devices within the category of intelligent speed adaptation are being encouraged.
*Install active laser jammer or radar jammer devices which actively transmit signals that interfere with the measuring device. These devices are illegal in many jurisdictions.
*Remove, falsify, obscure or modify vehicle license plate. Tampering with number plates or misrepresenting them is illegal in most jurisdictions.
*Damage or destroy the cameras themselves.

In August 2010, a fast-driving Swiss driver reportedly avoided several older model speed cameras, but was detected by a new model, as traveling at 300 km/h (186 mph), resulting in the world&#x27;s largest speeding fine to date.
In the past, it was possible to avoid detection by changing lanes when SPECS average speed cameras were in use as they measured a vehicle&#x27;s speed over distance in one lane only. Since 2007, measures were taken to mitigate this limitation. Although the cameras do operate in pairs on single lanes (it is a limitation of the technology not a restriction in the type approval) the authorities now install the cameras such that the monitored length of road overlaps between multiple camera pairs. The driver cannot tell which cameras are &#x27;entry&#x27; and which are &#x27;exit&#x27; making it difficult to know when to change lane.

==History==
The idea of the speed cameras dates back to the late 19th century: the 1894 science fiction novel &quot;A Journey in Other Worlds&quot;, set in the year 2000, includes a description of &quot;instantaneous kodaks&quot; used by police to enforce speed limits. In 1905, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported on a patent for a &quot;Time Recording Camera for Trapping Motorists&quot; that enabled the operator to take time-stamped images of a vehicle moving across the start and endpoints of a measured section of road. The timestamps enabled the speed to be calculated, and the photo enabled identification of the driver.

The Dutch company &quot;Gatsometer BV&quot;, which was founded in 1958 by rally driver Maurice Gatsonides, produced the &#x27;Gatsometer&#x27;. Gatsonides wished to better monitor his average speed on a race track and invented the device in order to improve his lap times. The company later started supplying these devices as police speed enforcement tools. The first systems introduced in the late 1960s used film cameras to take their pictures. Gatsometer introduced the first red light camera in 1965, the first radar for use with road traffic in 1971 and the first mobile speed traffic camera in 1982;

From the late 1990s, digital cameras began to be introduced. Digital cameras can be fitted with a network connection to transfer images to a central processing location automatically, so they have advantages over film cameras in speed of issuing fines, maintenance and operational monitoring. However, film-based systems may provide superior image quality in the variety of lighting conditions encountered on roads, and are required by courts in some jurisdictions. New film-based systems are still being sold, but digital pictures are providing greater versatility and lower maintenance and are now more popular with law enforcement agencies.

<text>The Moselle ( , ; ; ) is a river that rises in the Vosges mountains and flows through north-eastern France and Luxembourg to western Germany. It is a left bank tributary of the Rhine, which it joins at Koblenz. A small part of Belgium is in its basin as it includes the Sauer and the Our.

Its lower course &quot;twists and turns its way between Trier and Koblenz along one of Germany&#x27;s most beautiful river valleys.&quot; In this section the land to the north is the Eifel which stretches into Belgium; to the south lies the Hunsrück. The river flows through a region that was cultivated by the Romans. Today, its hillsides are covered by terraced vineyards where &quot;some of the best Rieslings grow&quot;. Many castle ruins sit on the hilltops above wine villages and towns along the slopes. Traben-Trarbach with its art nouveau architecture and Bernkastel-Kues with its traditional market square are two of the many tourist attractions on the Moselle river.

== Name ==
The name Moselle is derived from the Celtic name form, &quot;Mosela&quot;, via the Latin &quot;Mosella&quot;, a diminutive form of &quot;Mosa&quot;, the Latin description of the Meuse, which used to flow parallel to the Moselle. So the &quot;Mosella&quot; was the &quot;Little Meuse&quot;.

The Moselle is first recorded by Tacitus in Book 13 of his &quot;Annals&quot; and in Book 4 of his &quot;Histories&quot;.

The Roman poet Ausonius made it a literary theme as early as the 4th century. In his poem dated 371, called &quot;Mosella&quot;, which was published in 483 hexameters, this poet of the Late Antiquity and teacher at the Trier Imperial Court (&quot;Kaiserhof&quot;) described a journey from Bingen over the Hunsrück hills to the Moselle and then following its course to Trier on the road named after him, the Via Ausonia. Ausonius describes flourishing and rich landscapes along the river and in the valley of the Moselle, thanks to the policies of their Roman rulers.

The river subsequently gave its name to two French republican départements: Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle.

==Geography==

The source of the Moselle is at above sea level on the Col de Bussang on the western slopes of the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace in the Vosges. After it discharges into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at a height of above NHN sea level. The length of the river in France is , for it forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg, and is solely within Germany.

The Moselle flows through the Lorraine region, west of the Vosges. Further downstream, in Germany, the Moselle valley forms the division between the Eifel and Hunsrück mountain regions.

The average flow rate of the Moselle at its mouth is , making it the second largest tributary of the Rhine by volume after the Aare () and bigger than the Main and Neckar.

=== River sections ===
The section of the Moselle from the France–Germany–Luxembourg tripoint near Schengen to its confluence with the Saar near Konz shortly before Trier is in Germany known (geographically incorrectly) as the Upper Moselle. The section from Trier to Pünderich is the Middle Moselle, the section between Pünderich and its mouth in Koblenz as the Lower Moselle or Terraced Moselle (&quot;Terrassenmosel&quot;). Characteristic of the Middle and Lower Moselle are its wide meanders cut deeply into the highlands of the Rhenish Massif, the most striking of which is the &quot;Cochemer Krampen&quot; between Bremm and Cochem. Also typical are its vineyard terraces.

From the tripoint the Moselle marks the entire Saarland–Luxembourg border.

=== Catchment ===
The catchment area of the Moselle is in area. The French part covers , about 54 percent of the entire catchment. The German state of Rhineland-Palatinate has , the Saarland , Luxembourg , Wallonia in Belgium and North Rhine-Westphalia, .

=== Tributaries ===
The three largest tributaries of the Moselle are, in alphabetical order, the Meurthe, the Saar and the Sauer. The Meurthe was the old upper course of the Moselle, until the latter captured the former upper reaches of the Meuse and took it over. However, the Meuse only delivered a little more water than the Meurthe at its confluence. The Saar is the biggest of all the tributaries () as well as the longest (). The Sauer is the largest left-hand tributary and drains the region on either side of the German-Luxembourg border. The largest tributary relative to the Moselle at its confluence is the Moselotte, which is about 40% greater by volumetric flow and thus represents the main branch of the Moselle system. At its mouth, the Moselle delivers of water into the Rhine after flowing for .

=== Towns ===
Towns along the Moselle are:
* in France: Épinal, Toul, Pont-à-Mousson, Metz and Thionville
* in Luxembourg: Schengen, Remich, Grevenmacher and Wasserbillig
* in Germany: Konz, Trier, Schweich, Bernkastel-Kues, Traben-Trarbach, Zell, Cochem and Koblenz

=== Adjacent mountain ranges ===
From Trier downstream the Moselle separates the two Central Upland ranges of the Eifel (to the northwest) and the Hunsrück (to the southeast).

== Geology ==
The Vosges, the present source region of the Moselle, were formed about 50 million years ago. In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs the ancient Moselle (&quot;Urmosel&quot;) was already a tributary of the ancient Rhine (&quot;Ur-Rhein&quot;). When, in the Quaternary period, the Rhenish Massif slowly rose, the meanders of the Moselle were formed between the Trier Valley and the Neuwied Basin.

== Water levels ==

The highest navigable water level (HSW) is and normal level (NSt) is at the Trier Gauge (&quot;Pegel Trier&quot;).

High water:
* , Trier Gauge on 21 December 1993

== History ==

The Moselle was known to the Romans by the name of &quot;Flumen Musalla&quot; (in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;), and the river was romanticised by the poet Ausonius around 371. From 1815, the Moselle formed the border between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and Prussia (German Empire in 1871).

During World War II the Moselle was a barrier as the Allies advanced toward Berlin. In September 1944, the American Third Army in France mounted a drive to cross the Moselle at Dieulouard and split the German forces. Under the orders of Major General Manton S. Eddy, the 80th Infantry Division was given the objective of establishing a bridgehead that would allow Combat Command A (CCA) of the 4th Armored Division to advance into the rear of German forces and encircle the city of Nancy.

On September 13, 1944, the 80th Division launched their assault accompanied by extensive artillery and air support, which helped to suppress the German defenses. The division managed to establish a foothold on the east bank of the river, securing a bridgehead at Dieulouard.

With the bridgehead secured, Combat Command A of the 4th Armored Division crossed the Moselle and advanced towards Nancy, encircling the city and cutting off German supply lines. The 80th Division continued its advance, pushing towards the northeast and engaging in fierce combat with German forces.

The operations to capture Nancy continued until September 15 when the city was liberated by the combined efforts of the 80th Infantry Division and the 4th Armored Division. The successful crossing of the Moselle River and the capture of Nancy dealt a significant blow to German defenses in northeastern France and further contributed to the Allied advance towards Germany.

In the act of 10 April 1952 ratifying the treaty instituted by the ECSC, Article 2 charged the French Government &quot;to initiate, before the establishment of the Common Market, negotiations with the governments concerned in order to achieve a rapid implementation of the canalisation of the Moselle between Thionville and Koblenz.

The River was canalised between Metz and Thionville, via a canal opened in 1964 by the Grand Duchess, Charlotte of Luxembourg, the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Konrad Adenauer and their host, Charles de Gaulle, President of France.

It is on the Moselle, at the site of the France–Germany–Luxembourg tripoint, that the Schengen Agreement was signed in 1985, leading to the abolishment of border controls within the Schengen Area.

== Economy ==

The Moselle valley between Metz and Thionville is an industrial area, with coal mining and steel manufacturers.

The Moselle valley is famous for its scenery and wine. Most well-known is the German Mosel wine region, while the Luxembourg winegrowing region is called &quot;Moselle Luxembourgeoise&quot; and the French region is called &quot;AOC Moselle&quot;. Most notable among the wines produced here are Riesling, Elbling, Müller-Thurgau, Kerner, and Auxerrois. The German part of the Moselle is a tourist destination.

=== Navigation ===
After the Second World War, France pressed to be able to ply the Moselle with larger ships in order to be able to link the industrial regions of Lorraine. When, in 1955, the population on the Saar voted to belong to West Germany, France demanded as &quot;compensation&quot; an upgrade of the Moselle. On 27 October 1956 they concluded the Moselle Treaty with Germany and Luxembourg for a canalisation of the Moselle and conceded to Germany in return the extension of the Grand Canal d&#x27;Alsace on the Upper Rhine instead of an extension of the canal via Breisach. In 1958 work began and by 26 May 1964 the Moselle could be officially opened from Metz to Koblenz as a major waterway for shipping with 14 locks. France extended it by 1979 as far as Neuves-Maisons. With that, of the Moselle have been upgraded with a total of 28 locks. In the years 1992 to 1999 the navigable channel was deepened from to , which enables 1,500-tonne freighters to use the river, a 20% increase in capacity. The channel has a width of , more on the bends. The Moselle Commission, founded in 1962 with its head office in Trier, is responsible for navigation. The Moselle Shipping Police Act which it has produced is valid in all three participant states from Metz to Koblenz.

In 1921 the Moselle (Mo) became a Reich waterway, today it is a federal waterway (&quot;Bundeswasserstraße&quot;) from Apach at the tripoint to its mouth on the Rhine at kilometre point 592.29 in Koblenz. The waterway is long and managed by the Trier and Koblenz Water and Shipping Offices (&quot;Wasser- und Schifffahrtsämtern Trier und Koblenz&quot;). It is categorized as a European waterway of Class Vb. Its kilometrage begins at its mouth at kilometre point 0 and runs upstream. Since 1816 it has formed a long condominium from Apach, a common Germany–Luxembourg sovereign area with a division of responsibilities set out in a 1976 agreement. The International Moselle Company, initially set up in 1957 to finance the construction of the river&#x27;s upgrade, manages the shipping charges and the operation and maintenance of the waterway which they are used to fund.
Today the Moselle is navigable for large cargo ships up to long from the Rhine in Koblenz up to Neuves-Maisons, south of Nancy. For smaller ships it is connected to other parts of France through the Canal de la Meuse and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin. There are locks in Koblenz, Lehmen, Müden, Fankel, Sankt Aldegund, Enkirch, Zeltingen, Wintrich, Detzem, Trier, Grevenmacher, Palzem, Apach, Kœnigsmacker, Thionville, Richemont, Talange, Metz, Ars-sur-Moselle, Pagny-sur-Moselle, Blénod-lès-Pont-à-Mousson, Custines, Pompey, Aingeray, Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, Toul, Villey-le-Sec, and Neuves-Maisons.

By 1970 more than 10 million tonnes of goods were being transported on the Moselle, the majority on towed barges. Upstream freight mainly comprised fuel and ores; downstream the main goods were steel products, gravel and rocks. There is an inland port at Trier, a transshipment site in Zell (Mosel); and there are other ports in Mertert, Thionville, Metz and Frouard. In addition to freighters there are also pleasure boats for tourists between the very busy wine villages and small towns of the Middle and Lower Moselle.
There are also yachting or sports marinas in the following places: Koblenz, Winningen, Brodenbach, Burgen, Löf, Hatzenport, Senheim, Treis, Traben-Trarbach, Kues, Neumagen, Pölich, Schweich, Trier and Konz. The Moselle is linked near Toul via the Canal de la Marne au Rhin with &quot;inter alia&quot; the Meuse, the Saône and the Rhône. Other canals link the river to the North Sea and even the Mediterranean.

=== Locks and dams (weirs) ===

There is a total of 28 changes of level on the Moselle:
* 16 in France near Neuves-Maisons, Villey-le-Sec, Toul, Fontenoy-sur-Moselle, Aingeray, Frouard-Pompey, Custines, Blénod-lès-Pont-à-Mousson, Pagny-sur-Moselle, Ars-sur-Moselle, Metz, Talange, Richemont, Thionville, Kœnigsmacker and Apach
* 2 between Luxembourg and Germany near Stadtbredimus-Palzem and Grevenmacher-Wellen
* 10 in Germany near Trier, Detzem, Wintrich, Zeltingen, Enkirch, St. Aldegund, Fankel, Müden, Lehmen and Koblenz. Detzem is the highest lock – – and at the upstream reach is the longest on the river; it is the only lock to be built on a canal of some length excavated outside the river bed.

With the exception of Detzem, all the structures at each change in level are laid-out side by side; the lock is by one riverbank, the weir in the middle and the hydropower plant on the other bank. Between the lock and weir are a boat slipway and channel and boat lock, while between the weir and the power station is the fish ladder. The structures have been blended into the landscape through their low-level design; this was achieved by the choice of sector gates for the weir, vertically lowering upper gates and mitred lower lock gates. The water levels and hydropower works are controlled by the Fankel Central Control Station (&quot;Zentralwarte Fankel&quot;) of the RWE Power Company at Fankel.

=== Tourism ===

Through the Moselle valley run the Moselle Wine Route and the Moselle Cycleway, which may be cycled from Metz in France via Trier to Koblenz on the River Rhine, a distance of . 

Between Koblenz and Trier, large sections run on the trackbed of the old Moselle Valley Railway, far from the noise and fumes of motor vehicles. Every year on the Sunday after Pentecost, the of road between Schweich and Cochem is also car-free as part of Happy Moselle Day.

A number of notable castles and ruins adorn the heights above the Moselle valley and many are visible on a boat trip on the Moselle.

In 1910, a hiking trail, the Moselle Ridgeway, was established which runs for on the Eifel side and on the Hunsrück side. Another unusual trail runs from Ediger-Eller via the Calmont Trail to Bremm through the steepest vineyard in Europe.

Before the construction of barrages the Moselle was a popular route for folding kayaks which is why many of the weirs have boat channels. The river is still used today by canoeists, especially during the annual week-long lock closures when no commercial shipping is permitted.

In April 2014 the Moselle Trail was opened, a path running for from Perl on the Upper Moselle to Koblenz. Numerous Moselle Trail &quot;partner trails&quot;, the so-called side branches (&quot;Seitensprünge&quot;) and &quot;dream paths&quot; (&quot;Traumpfade&quot;) enhance the hiking network in the Moselle Valley.

The ADAC&#x27;s Rallye Deutschland has taken place since 2000 in the vineyards along the Moselle at Veldenz, Dhron, Piesport, Minheim, Kesten, Trittenheim, Fell, Ruwertal and Trier.

At Koblenz Locks the Mosellum offers exhibitions about the migration of fish in the Moselle as well as water ecology, navigation and power generation. With the construction of the visitor and information centre the most modern fish ladder along the Moselle was opened.

=== Wine ===

The Moselle winegrowing region lies along the Moselle with a cultivated area of about . The largest part, currently just under , is on German soil in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland; the Luxembourg part has an area of about (see Wine in Luxembourg). Upstream on the Moselle the vineyards extend into France as far as Seille in the region of Côtes de Moselle with an area of and to the region around Toul (Côtes de Toul) covering .

The German Moselle wine region, including its tributaries, bears the growing and manufacturing name of &quot;Mosel&quot;. For marketing reasons the agricultural authorities of the region have divided it into six winegrowing areas. The wine literature and specialist press, by contrast, divide the region into four areas based on geomorphological, micro-climatic and also historical reasons:

; Upper Moselle: The valley sides of the Upper Moselle (also called the Burgundy Moselle, &quot;Burgundermosel&quot;) with their overwhelmingly muschelkalk soils belong geologically to the so-called Paris Basin, which explains its low proportion of Riesling – only around 10% in 2010 – and the increasing cultivation of Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir grapes.

; Trier Region: Around the city of Trier and in the valleys of the Saar and Ruwer with their side valleys, the Riesling is the predominant grape on the shale soils, with over 80% of the crop. One climatic feature of this area is the frequent orientation of often small southwest-southeast facing locations in which the vegetation is exposed to stronger, cooler winds and, especially in the light of recent global warming, often achieve lower degrees of maturity than in the narrow, often deeply incised valley of the Middle and Lower Moselle.

; Middle Moselle: With around of vineyard the Middle Moselle is the largest winegrowing area of the Moselle. According to the wine experts and trade, the &quot;greatest&quot; wines of the Moselle, both in quantity and quality, are grown here on land that has been consolidated into large concerns with much vaunted steeply sloped vineyards.

; Lower Moselle: In the Lower Moselle Valley, there are a number of medieval castles, high above little villages, decorated with timber-framed houses, surrounded by steep slopes with small terraces in the narrow, winding valley. Here, cultivating vines is very labour-intensive and costly and it is difficult to make it economical. As a result, it is common for vineyards to fall into ruin here.

The wine industry on the German Moselle has been declining for decades. In 2005, statistics showed there were of vineyard; by 2012 this had fallen to just . The vineyards that have fallen fallow are mostly those on extremely steep hillsides. There has been a major decline in the number of so-called &quot;Nebenerwerbswinzer&quot; (vintners for whom it is a secondary occupation), and the small, family farming operations that, until the end of the 1960s formed the majority of wine businesses. Comparative figures by the Chamber of Agriculture for Rhineland-Palatinate for several wine villages on the Lower Moselle show that there were still 797 wine businesses in the early 1960s, but by the early 2000s there were only just under 100.

There has been the opposite trend amongst the established traditional wine estates and more recent vintners with a sound education in oenology and business management, who have increased their business through the reclamation of once renowned, but long forgotten sites. The end of the 20th century saw the rediscovery of the use of special terroir in order to improve quality and value, which has led to a more nuanced view of Moselle wine that, a few years before, had been characterised by overproduction, label scandals and cheap offers.

=== Moselle umbrella brand ===
On 10 November 2006 in Burg, the Moselle Regional Initiative was founded. The introduction of the Moselle as an umbrella brand was based on that of the Eifel region and covers products and services from the areas of agriculture, forestry, tourism, handicrafts and nature.

=== Moselle slate ===
Moselle slate (&quot;Moselschiefer&quot;) is a manufacturing and trade description for slate from the municipalities of Mayen, Polch, Müllenbach, Trier and its surrounding area. Today only products from the roofing slate mines of in Mayen and Margareta in Polch bear the name Moselle Slate. The name is derived from the historical transport route for this slate along the Moselle to the Lower Rhine.

=== Railways ===
The following railway lines run or ran along the river:

* Koblenz–Trier railway (&quot;Moselstrecke&quot;), between Koblenz and Bullay, and in Trier, mostly on the left (northern) bank
* Pünderich–Traben-Trarbach railway, for its entire length, on the left (northern) bank
* Moselle Railway, between Bullay and Trier, on the right (southern) bank. Closed in the 1960s.
* Trier West Railway, between Ehrang and Igel, on the left (northern) bank
* Thionville–Trier railway (&quot;Obermoselstrecke&quot;), for its entire length, on the right (eastern) bank
* CFL line 1a, between Wasserbillig and Grevenmacher, on the left (western) bank. No passenger service remains.
* Metz–Luxembourg railway, between Thionville and Metz, mainly on the left bank
* Lérouville–Metz railway, between Metz and Novéant, mainly on the left bank
* Frouard–Novéant railway, mainly on the left bank
* Paris–Strasbourg railway, between Frouard and Toul
* Blainville-Damelevières–Lure railway, between Bayon and Épinal
* Épinal–Bussang railway, between Épinal and Remiremont, on the left bank

*Thurant Castle: Above the town of Alken is Thurant Castle, built in the 13th century. It is the only twin-towered castle along the Moselle. The fortress was built by the Count Palatine Henry of the house of Guelph between 1198 and 1206. From 1246 to 1248, it was the two archbishops of Cologne and Trier. Following conquest, it was divided by a partition wall into two halves, each with a keep (tower). During the 19th century, Thurant disintegrated, becoming a ruin; and in 1911 was acquired by Privy Councilor, Dr. Robert Allmers, who had it rebuilt. Since 1973, the castle has been owned by the Allmers and Wulf families.

<text>Cosmopolitan (stylized in all caps) is an American quarterly fashion and entertainment magazine for women, first published based in New York City in March 1886 as a family magazine; it was later transformed into a literary magazine and, since 1965, has become a women&#x27;s magazine. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; is one of the best-selling magazines.

Formerly titled The Cosmopolitan and often referred to as Cosmo, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; has adapted its style and content. Its current incarnation was originally marketed as a woman&#x27;s fashion magazine with articles on home, family, and cooking. For some time it focused more on new fiction and written work, which included short stories, novels, and articles. Now it is more targeted towards women&#x27;s fashion, sports and modern interests. Eventually, editor-in-chief Helen Gurley Brown changed its attention to more of a women&#x27;s empowerment magazine. Nowadays, its content includes articles discussing relationships, sex, health, careers, self-improvement, celebrities, fashion, horoscopes, and beauty.

&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; is published by New York City–based Hearst Corporation. The magazine&#x27;s office in the Hearst Tower, 300 West 57th Street near Columbus Circle in Manhattan in New York City. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; has 21 international editions in Australia, China, Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Middle East, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

International editions previously existed for Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Central America, Chile, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mongolia, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Thailand, South Africa and Vietnam.

==History==


&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; originally began as a family and women&#x27;s magazine, first published based in New York City in March 1886 by Schlicht &amp; Field of New York as &quot;The Cosmopolitan&quot;.

Paul Schlicht told his first-issue readers inside of the front cover that his publication was a &quot;first-class family magazine&quot;. Adding on, &quot;There will be a department devoted exclusively to the concerns of women, with articles on fashions, on household decoration, on cooking, and the care and management of children. There was also a department for the younger members of the family.&quot;

&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; circulation reached 25,000 that year, but by November 1888, Schlicht &amp; Field were no longer in business. Ownership was acquired by John Brisben Walker in 1889. That same year, he dispatched Elizabeth Bisland on a race around the world against Nellie Bly to draw attention to the magazine.

Under John Brisben Walker&#x27;s ownership, E. D. Walker, formerly with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, took over as the new editor, introducing color illustrations, serials and book reviews. It became a leading market for fiction, featuring such authors as Annie Besant, Ambrose Bierce, Willa Cather, Theodore Dreiser, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, Edith Wharton, and H. G. Wells. The magazine&#x27;s press run climbed to 100,000 by 1892.

In 1897, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; announced plans for &quot;the Cosmopolitan University&quot; as a free correspondence school: &quot;No charge of any kind will be made to the student. All expenses for the present will be borne by the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. No conditions, except a pledge of a given number of hours of study.&quot; When 20,000 immediately signed up, Walker could not fund the school and students were then asked to contribute 20 dollars a year. Also in 1897, H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was serialized, as was his &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; (1900). Olive Schreiner contributed a lengthy two-part article about the Boer War in the September and October issues of 1900.

===Acquisition by Hearst===
In 1905, William Randolph Hearst purchased the magazine for US$400,000 () and brought in journalist Charles Edward Russell, who contributed a series of investigative articles, including &quot;The Growth of Caste in America&quot; (March 1907), &quot;At the Throat of the Republic&quot; (December 1907 – March 1908) and &quot;What Are You Going to Do About It?&quot; (July 1910 – January 1911).

Other contributors during this period included O. Henry, A. J. Cronin, Alfred Henry Lewis, Bruno Lessing, Sinclair Lewis, O. O. McIntyre, David Graham Phillips, George Bernard Shaw, Upton Sinclair, and Ida Tarbell. Jack London&#x27;s novella, &quot;The Red One&quot;, was published in the October 1918 issue (two years after London&#x27;s death), and a constant presence from 1910 to 1918 was Arthur B. Reeve, with 82 stories featuring Craig Kennedy, the &quot;scientific detective&quot;. Magazine illustrators included Francis Attwood, Dean Cornwell, Harrison Fisher, and James Montgomery Flagg.

Hearst formed Cosmopolitan Productions (also known as Cosmopolitan Pictures), a film company based in New York City from 1918 to 1923, then Hollywood until 1938. The vision for this film company was to make films from stories published in the magazine.

===&quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot;===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine was officially titled as &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International Combined with Cosmopolitan&quot; from 1925 until 1952, but was simply referred to as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. In 1911, Hearst had bought a middling monthly magazine called &quot;World To-Day&quot; and renamed it &quot;Hearst&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in April 1912. In June 1914 it was shortened to &quot;Hearst&#x27;s&quot; and was ultimately titled &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at San Simeon, Hearst merged the magazine &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; with &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; effective March 1925. But while the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; title on the cover remained at a typeface of eighty-four points, over time span the typeface of the &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points. After Hearst died in 1951, the &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.

With a circulation of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; had an advertising income of $5,000,000. Emphasizing fiction in the 1940s, it was subtitled &quot;The Four-Book Magazine&quot; since the first section had one novelette, six or eight short stories, two serials, six to eight articles and eight or nine special features, while the other three sections featured two novels and a digest of current non-fiction books. During World War II, sales peaked at 2,000,000.

The magazine began to run less fiction during the 1950s. Circulation dropped to slightly over a million by 1955, a time when magazines were overshadowed during the rise of paperbacks and television. The Golden Age of magazines came to an end as mass market, general interest publications gave way to special interest magazines targeting specialized audiences.

===Helen Gurley Brown arrives===
Cosmopolitan&#x27;s circulation continued to decline for another decade until Helen Gurley Brown became chief editor in 1965 and radically changed the magazine. Brown remodeled and re-invented it as a magazine for modern single career women, completely transforming the magazine into a racy, contentious, and successful magazine. As the editor for 32 years, Brown spent this time using the magazine as an outlet to erase stigma around unmarried women not only having sex, but also enjoying it. Known as a &quot;devout feminist&quot;, Brown was often attacked by critics due to her progressive views on women and sex. She believed that women were allowed to enjoy sex without shame in all cases. She died in 2012 at the age of 90. Her vision is still evident in the design of the magazine. The magazine eventually adopted a cover format consisting of a usually young female model (or prominent female celebrity), typically in a low cut dress, bikini, or some other revealing outfit.

The magazine set itself apart by frankly discussing sexuality from the point of view that women could and should enjoy sex without guilt. The first issue under Helen Gurley Brown, July 1965, featured an article on the birth control pill, which had gone on the market exactly five years earlier.

This was not Brown&#x27;s first publication dealing with sexually liberated women. Her 1962 advice book, &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot;, had been a bestseller. Fan mail begging for Brown&#x27;s advice on many subjects concerning women&#x27;s behavior, sexual encounters, health, and beauty flooded her after the book was released. Brown sent the message that a woman should have men complement her life, not take it over. Enjoying sex without shame was also a message she incorporated in both publications.

In Brown&#x27;s early years as editor, the magazine received heavy criticism. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can&quot;. These included copies of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; also ran a near-nude centerfold of actor Burt Reynolds in April 1972, causing great controversy and attracting much attention. The Latin American edition of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; was launched in March 1973.

In April 1978, a single edition of &quot;Cosmopolitan Man&quot; was published as a trial, targeted to appeal to men. Its cover featured Jack Nicholson and Aurore Clément. It was published twice in 1989 as a supplement to &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

In its January 1988 issue, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; ran a feature claiming that women had almost no reason to worry about contracting HIV long after the best available medical science indicated otherwise. The piece claimed that unprotected sex with an HIV-positive man did not put women at risk of infection and went on to state that &quot;most heterosexuals are not at risk&quot; and that it was impossible to transmit HIV in the missionary position. This article angered many educated people, including AIDS and gay rights activists. The protests organised in response to the article&#x27;s publication were turned into a 30-minute documentary titled &quot;Doctors, Liars and Women: AIDS Activists Say NO to Cosmo&quot; by two members of ACTUP, a New York City based collective of HIV/AIDS activists.

One of the articles in its October 1989 issue, &quot;The Risky Business of Bisexual Love&quot;, promoted the &#x27;bisexual bridge&#x27; theory. The &#x27;bisexual bridge&#x27; theory suggests that heterosexual women are unknowingly put at risk for contracting HIV through sexual contact with bisexual men who covertly have sex with other men (colloquially described as being &quot;on the down low&quot;). The New York Area Bisexual Network performed a successful letter-writing campaign against &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

==Today==
Since the 1960s, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; has discussed such topics as health, fitness, and fashion, as well as sex. The magazine has also featured a section called &quot;Ask Him Anything&quot;, where a male writer answers readers&#x27; questions about men and dating.
The magazine, in particular its cover stories, has become increasingly sexually explicit in tone. In 2000, the grocery chain Kroger, at the time the second largest in the US after Walmart, began covering up &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; at checkout stands because of complaints about sexually inappropriate headlines. The UK edition of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, which began in 1972, was the first &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine to be branched out to another country. It was well known for sexual explicitness, with strong sexual language, male nudity, and coverage of such subjects as rape. In 1999, &quot;CosmoGIRL!&quot;, a spinoff magazine targeting a teenage female audience, was created for international readership. It shut down in December 2008.

There are 64 worldwide editions of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and the magazine is published in 35 languages, with distribution in more than 100 countries making &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; the largest-selling young women&#x27;s magazine in the world. Some international editions are published in partnerships, such as licenses or joint ventures, with established publishing houses in each local market. 

During 2015, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; found popularity in a then-newfound medium, the &quot;discover&quot; section on Snapchat. At the time, Cosmopolitan&#x27;s &quot;discover&quot; had over 3 million readers a day.

In October 2018, Bauer Media Group announced that after 45 years, publication of the Australian edition of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; would stop due to the commercial viability of the magazine no longer being sustainable. In March 2022 the Russian edition, &quot;Cosmopolitan Russia&quot;, changed its title to &quot;Voice&quot; after Hearst revoked its affiliation following the invasion of Ukraine.

On the cover of its October 2018 issue, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; featured plus-sized model Tess Holliday. Some people, such as TV presenter Piers Morgan, criticized this choice, arguing that it amounted to promoting obesity. Editor of Cosmopolitan Farrah Storr called the cover choice a bold stance in favor of body positivity. In December 2020, actress Emma Roberts became the first pregnant celebrity to appear on the cover of the magazine.

==Awards and features==

&quot;Cosmopolitan Men&quot; released a video on The Making of the World&#x27;s Sexiest Calendar in 1994 followed by a 14-month Cosmopolitan Men Calendar. Photographer Richard Reinsdorf shot the entire Calendar and helped direct the video.

=== Anniversary Male Centerfolds ===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; releases a Male Centerfold issue every few years that features hot male celebrities from the United States. Here is a partial list of the men that have appeared in Cosmopolitan&#x27;s Centerfold Editions over the years: Burt Reynolds 1972, Jim Brown 1973, John Davidson 1975, Arnold Schwarzenegger 1977, Scott Brown 1982, David Hasselhoff 1990. Male super-model Tracy James was named Cosmopolitan&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Centerfold in 1995: his centerfold garnered so much attention that &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; printed an extra 500,000 copies to meet demand. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; Editor-in-Chief Helen Gurley Brown sat with James for interviews on &quot;America&#x27;s Talking&quot; and on &quot;Oprah&quot; with Oprah Winfrey, on how the magazine&#x27;s editors and scouts searched America over the course of a year, seeing thousands of men before deciding on James.

=== Bachelor of the Year ===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; November issue features the hottest bachelors from all 50 states. Pictures and profiles of all the bachelors are posted on www.cosmopolitan.com, where readers view and vote for their favorite, narrowing it down to six finalists. A team of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; editors then selects the Bachelor of the Year, who is announced at an annual party and media event in New York. The 50 bachelors generally appear on programs such as &quot;The Today Show&quot;.

===Practice Safe Sun===
In the May 2006 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, the magazine launched the Practice Safe Sun campaign, an initiative aimed at fighting skin cancer by asking readers to stop all forms of tanning other than tanning from a bottle. In conjunction with the campaign, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; editor-in-chief, Kate White, approached Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, known for her support of women&#x27;s health issues, with concerns that women were not fully aware of the dangers of indoor tanning and the effectiveness of the current warning labels. After careful review, the Congresswoman agreed that it was necessary to recommend that the FDA take a closer look. She and Representative Ginny Brown-Waite introduced the Tanning Accountability and Notification Act (TAN Act – H.R. 4767) on February 16, 2006. President Bush signed the act in September 2007, and the new federal law requires the FDA to scrutinize the warning labels on tanning beds and issue a report by September 2008.

===Cosmo Blog Awards===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; UK launched the Cosmo Blog Awards in 2010. The awards attracted more than 15,000 entries and winning and highly commended blogs were voted for in several categories including beauty, fashion, lifestyle, and celebrity. The 2011 awards launched in August 2011 and nominations are open until August 31, 2011. All UK-based bloggers and blogs written by British bloggers abroad with a British perspective can be entered.

===Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance===
In May 2015, Cosmopolitan UK announced they were launching their first ever fragrance. This is considered a first in the magazine industry. Named &#x27;Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance&#x27;, the perfume takes on the notion of their much-loved phrase &#x27;Fun, Fearless Female&#x27; and was set to launch in September.

==Politics==
===Seventeenth Amendment===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; played a role in passing the Seventeenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which allowed for the popular election of US Senators (previously they were elected by state legislatures). In 1906, William Randolph Hearst hired David Graham Phillips to write a series of articles entitled &quot;The Treason of the Senate&quot;. These articles, which were largely sensationalized, helped galvanize public support for this cause.

===Candidate endorsement===
In September 2014, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; began endorsing political candidates. The endorsements are based on &quot;established criteria&quot; agreed upon by the magazine&#x27;s editors. Specifically, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; will only endorse candidates that support equal pay laws, legal abortion, free contraceptives, gun control, and oppose voter identification laws. Amy Odell, editor of Cosmopolitan.com, has stated that under no circumstances will the magazine endorse a political candidate that is anti-abortion: &quot;We&#x27;re not going to endorse someone who is pro-life because that&#x27;s not in our readers&#x27; best interest.&quot; According to Joanna Coles, the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief, the endorsements of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; will focus on &quot;candidates in swing states or candidates who are strongly in favor of issues like contraception coverage or gun control.&quot; In the 2014 U.S. elections, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; officially endorsed twelve Democratic candidates. However, only two of them won their respective political campaigns.

=== Campaigns against &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; ===
Victoria Hearst, a granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst (founder of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; parent company) and sister of Patty Hearst, has lent her support to a campaign which seeks to classify &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; as harmful under the guidelines of &quot;Material Harmful to Minors&quot; laws. Hearst, the founder of an evangelical Colorado church called Praise Him Ministries, states that &quot;the magazine promotes a lifestyle that can be dangerous to women&#x27;s emotional and physical well being. It should never be sold to anyone under 18&quot;. According to former model Nicole Weider, who is also part of this campaign, the magazine&#x27;s marketing is subtly targeting children. Billboards have been hung in states such as Utah urging the state to ban sales of the magazine.

In 2018, Walmart announced that &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; would be removed from checkout lines after the anti-pornography organization National Center on Sexual Exploitation, formerly known as Morality in Media, labeled the magazine as &quot;sexually explicit material&quot;.

=== Cosmopolitan Australia ===
&quot;Cosmopolitan Australia&quot; was launched in May 1973.

In 2023 it was reported that Hearst wanted to relaunch Cosmopolitan in Australia. The publication was relaunched in August of 2024.

==== Editors ====
=== &quot;Cosmopolitan Italy&quot; ===
In 1973 there was a merger between &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and the Italian magazine &quot;Arianna&quot;, published by Mondadori since in 1957, assuming the name &quot;Cosmopolitan Arianna&quot;. From January 1976 the masthead changed to the current &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. In 1996 the magazine, owned by Della Schiava Editore, ended its publication, which resumed with Mondadori in 2000, with the editor Silvia Brena. In July 2010 &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; passed to the editorial Hearst Magazines Italia, becoming a monthly magazine.

<text>Vexillology ( ) is the study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags or, by extension, any interest in flags in general. 

A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, one who designs flags is a vexillographer, and the art of designing flags is called vexillography. A hobbyist or general admirer of flags is a vexillophile.

==Etymology==
The word vexillology is a synthesis of the Latin word (a kind of square flag which was carried by Roman cavalry) and the Greek suffix (&quot;study&quot;).

==History==
American scholar Whitney Smith is acknowledged for conceiving &quot;vexillology&quot; in 1957. He wrote, &quot;While the use of flags goes back to the earliest days of human civilization, the study of that usage in a serious fashion is so recent that the term for it did not appear in print until 1959.&quot; Before this time, the study of flags was generally considered a part of heraldry, the study of armorial bearings.

Vexillology was formalized by American scholar Smith in 1961 with the publication of &quot;The Flag Bulletin&quot;. During his lifetime, Smith organized various flag organizations and meetings including the first International Congress of Vexillology (ICV), the North American Vexillological Association, and the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV). 

Vexillology involves academic work in sociology, history, or design. It also includes contributions from the flag industry and interest from those passionate about flags. The ICV and local vexillological meetings often cover a wide range of interests in flags. Since 1969, an International Congress of Vexillology meeting has been organized every two years under the auspices of FIAV; papers presented at an ICV are published afterwards as the Congress&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot;.

==Vexillological organizations==
The International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV) is vexillology&#x27;s international umbrella organization. Notable constituent organizations include the North American Vexillological Association, (English: &#x27;German Society for Flag Studies&#x27;), and Flags of the World (FOTW).

All Scottish flags must, by law, be authorised by Lord Lyon for recording in the &#x27;Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland&#x27; and he appointed Philip Tibbetts from the UK Flag Institute to the newly created role of Honorary Vexillologist to the Court of the Lord Lyon in a rare example of a dedicated state mandated vexillologist.

<doc id="143875" wikidata="Q521902" url="?curid=143875" title="Sailor Venus">
<text>, better known as , is a fictional character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;&quot; manga series written by Naoko Takeuchi. Minako is her sailor form&#x27;s alternative human identity as part of the Sailor Guardians (of which she is their leader), female supernatural fighters who protect the Solar System from evil.

Minako is the fourth Sailor Guardian to be discovered by Usagi Tsukino, although she was the first Sailor Guardian to awaken her powers, even before Usagi did. She possesses powers associated with love and beauty, light, and golden material metal. In the manga and anime series, she dreams of becoming a famous idol, but in the live-action series, her character is already a well-known celebrity.

Minako is introduced as the protagonist of Naoko Takeuchi&#x27;s much-shorter manga series &quot;&quot;, the predecessor to &quot;Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon.&quot; In it (and the early part of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;), she goes by the pseudonym , short for &quot;Venus&quot;, and is given a personal backstory. The plot lines of &quot;Sailor V&quot; are generally compatible with the latter series, but are usually considered separate. Later, she co-stars with Rei Hino in a special short story titled &quot;Rei and Minako&#x27;s Girls School Battle&quot;.

==Profile==

===Manga and anime===
Minako is first introduced in the &quot;&quot; manga, of which she is the lead character. She is awakened as a Sailor Guardian by the white cat Artemis when she is thirteen years old and instructed that she has a duty to become the beautiful warrior, Sailor V. Artemis explains that Venus and Earth are &quot;twin planets&quot; of about the same size and weight, that Venus is her &quot;mother star,&quot; and that she must protect Earth from its enemies. He shows her Magellan Castle orbiting around Venus and says that it is hers, although the existence of these castles is not revealed to the other Sailor Guardians until late in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series. Artemis later reveals that Minako is an avatar of the goddess, Venus. She first dons her red hair bow during the first chapter of the story, on the recommendation of a handsome villain character that she defeats, and is almost never seen without it again.

Though Sailor Moon technically leads the team during the various incarnations of the franchise, she is actually not the team leader of Sailor Guardians; instead, that honor goes to Sailor Venus. Minako is depicted as athletic, friendly, romantic, resilient, and intelligent. She is also seen as graceful, clever, and refined at times. Minako is supernaturally strong, being able to wield a heavy sword with just one hand, and jumping from the ground to the top of a building in the ‘90s anime. Minako is as strong as Makoto, possibly even more than her, and like Sailor Mars, Minako also has large experience in hand-to-hand combat as she took on members of the “Dark Agency” in her own series &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot;. When &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; was enough of a hit to earn its own anime adaptation, Takeuchi was asked to expand the concept to include more girls, and when she did, she placed Usagi Tsukino as the protagonist, with Minako as a part of the team.
In the anime only, Minako spends some of her time as Sailor V in London, where she meets a young Interpol officer named Katarina who taught her English and acts as a big sister, and a young man called Alan, with whom she falls in love. One day Sailor V was the first to enter an abandoned warehouse but she was caught in an explosion after a criminal threw a grenade and assumed to be dead, Minako survives but she was injured she saw Alan and Katarina together and realizes that they had become a couple. She moves back to Japan shortly thereafter. She is also widely traveled in the manga, having visited Greece and China.

As a result of her past battles, when Minako meets the other Sailor Guardians she has a relatively serious personality and is very focused on their mission as a Sailor Guardian. In the manga, she even tells them she is the princess they have been searching for, although in fact she is merely serving as a decoy to protect the real princess, Usagi. Throughout the first story arc she has by far the strongest memories of their past life during the time of Silver Millennium.

Artemis lives in Minako&#x27;s home and is one of her closest friends. Minako lives with both her parents, although references to her family life are few in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series. Her family, like Usagi&#x27;s, is based on Takeuchi&#x27;s own family. For the first several story arcs, Minako attends a different junior high school from the others in Shiba Kōen. When the characters enter high school, she joins Usagi, Ami, and Makoto at Azabu-Jūban. One of her greatest talent is volleyball, as shown from the beginning of the first &quot;Sailor V&quot; chapter and throughout the rest of the series — she even considers quitting the Sailor Guardians to become a professional, and in high school joins the Volleyball club. Her favorite class is Physical Education, while in the manga her least favorites are mathematics and the English language. In the anime, having lived in England for some time, she is fluent in the language (in one episode it is shown her skills are more refined than Ami Mizuno&#x27;s), and Usagi begs Minako to teach her.

Minako&#x27;s other greatest love is pop culture. She desperately wants to be an idol, and so makes a hobby of chasing them and attending auditions in acting, dancing, and singing whenever possible. She takes her role as the &quot;Guardian of Love&quot; literally, and enjoys regaling friends and acquaintances with advice about romance. Despite her declared expertise, Minako herself has little personal experience in relationships (aside from a brief and ill-fated love in the &quot;Sailor V&quot; manga), but is enthusiastic about romantic opportunities — even to the point of two-timing a pair of the series&#x27; villains. She has a crush on Yaten Kou throughout the &quot;Sailor Stars&quot; anime storyline, and in one episode, the sinister idea of herself as a cat bathing with Yaten gives her a nosebleed — a common symbol of sexual arousal in anime. In the manga, by contrast, Minako suspects Yaten of being an enemy; while confronting the Starlights, she and Rei reaffirm that they do not need men because they have dedicated their lives to their duty of protecting Usagi.

===Live-action series===
While Minako dreams of being an idol in the manga and anime adaptations, the live-action series &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; depicts her as a famous singer whose fanbase includes Usagi Tsukino in particular as an enormous fan. Her second album, newly released at the start of the series, is called &quot;Venus&quot; and her most popular song is C&#x27;est La Vie, which is a Japanese pun: in Japanese (and, to some extent, in English as well), the French phrase and the name of her alter-ego, Sailor V, is pronounced almost identically (as &quot;sērāvī&quot;). Her first album, &quot;Imitation&quot;, was released prior to her meeting Artemis and becoming a Sailor Guardian, but its track listing, shown onscreen, foreshadows later plot developments: Origin of the Legend, Imitation, Don&#x27;t Lose! Christmas Girl, Love Versus Dream, Happily, Secret!, Orange Heart, White Rendezvous, and Make Up! Power!!.

In the live-action series, Minako secretly leads a double life as idol and heroine—famous as a singer, and equally well-known as Sailor V. She remains entirely separate from the other girls, but is aware of each of their civilian identities. As in the other series, she eventually discards the guise of Sailor V in favor of her true form, Sailor Venus; nevertheless, she becomes only slightly involved with the others, and frequently expresses disapproval of their effectiveness as Guardians. She is frustrated by their lack of focus and distances herself both for that reason and because, as revealed later, she has a terminal illness and does not want them to become close to her and then be saddened by her probable death.

When the other Guardians learn that Minako and Sailor V are the same person, they hide it from the irresponsible Usagi for some time. The character Minako is closest to being friends with is Rei Hino, with whom she has a conflicted relationship. Rei is supposed to be the secondary leader, but she is initially both less skilled than Minako and resentful of her advice. Although they often disagree and compete, they develop great respect for each other, to the point where Minako sometimes lets her guard down, and eventually confides to Rei about both her illness and what she feels is her destiny as a Sailor Soldier.

In terms of personality, the live-action Minako is deeply solemn and rarely smiles. Besides the complications from her unnamed illness (the doctors in one episode give her six months to live), her obsession with the collective past life makes her feel detached from the world, thinking of her current life as less important. However, she does seem to genuinely love singing, and shows a small mischievous side, especially in her relationship with Artemis.

As in the manga, she serves as a decoy Moon Princess for part of the series. She seems to be aware of her true position, often endangering herself to protect the real princess, Sailor Moon. In a twist, Usagi serves as a decoy of Minako, chasing away a group of autograph hounds. She does this because she figures Minako needed to be away from the trappings of stardom for a while. Minako is touched by this and cares about Usagi as a friend to the point of trying to protect her from Mio (whom she suspected is working with the Dark Kingdom to hurt Usagi).

Near the end of the series, it is revealed that there is a surgery that might either correct Minako&#x27;s condition or kill her early. She refuses to undergo the procedure, preferring to last as long as she can without it, but the other girls convince her to take any chance at life she can get. She is shown leaving for the hospital, and later that day, Artemis arrives at Rei&#x27;s temple to tell the girls that Minako has died. She did, however, leave each of them a note giving her goodbyes. Rei uses Minako&#x27;s weapon, Venus Dagger, in conjunction with her own Mars Dagger in the final battle. Though Minako dies before the final battle, Usagi&#x27;s use of the Silver Crystal in the finale gives her a second chance at life. This allows her to take part in the battle in the direct-to-DVD special, in which she uses her own weapon as well as Rei&#x27;s (who is in the hospital) in combat.

==Aspects and forms==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations, and a long lifetime virtually spanned between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century, Minako gains multiple aspects and aliases as the series progresses.

===Sailor Venus===
Minako&#x27;s primary Sailor Guardian identity is that of Sailor Venus. Sailor Venus wears a sailor suit colored in orange (choker, collar, center of front bow, elbow fittings on her gloves, skirt, earrings, and a matching set of orange ankle-strap heels), navy blue (front bow) and yellow (tiara gem and back bow), and retains the red bow she wears as a civilian. In the live-action series, this bow appears only when she is in one of her Guardian forms, and has a gem in the center. In the manga, live-action series, and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, she wears an item called the Wink Chain around her waist, which she sometimes uses as a weapon. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Guardian of Love, Guardian of Love and Hope, and Guardian of Light and Beauty. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although she must be Sailor Venus to access her celestial powers.

In Japanese, the name for the planet Venus is , the first kanji indicating a metal, especially gold, and the second indicating a celestial object. Unlike the other Sailor Guardians, her special abilities are not derived from the element in her planet&#x27;s name but are instead based on the concept of love, a reference to the Roman goddess of love, Venus, and the Mesopotamian goddess of love and war, Inanna, who has also deemed the personification of the planet Venus. Metal does appear in her use of a special chain as a weapon, and she also has a few attacks with &quot;crescent&quot; in their names, mainly acquired during her time as Sailor V.

Sailor Venus is the &quot;de jure&quot; leader of the Sailor Guardians in their mission to protect Princess Serenity. In the manga, as the leader, she is entrusted with the poisonous sword used to kill Queen Beryl, which turns the stone blade into a sword made of Silver Crystal.

In the live-action series only, upon her introduction, Sailor Venus&#x27;s sailor suit is slightly different, in order to represent her disguise as the Moon Princess. She bears the crescent moon symbol on her forehead in place of a tiara (just as she did when she was Sailor V) and wears a crown with a fake Silver Crystal on it. The latter disappears after the gem is revealed to be a fake, and she gains a normal tiara when Usagi is revealed as the real princess. Other characters refer to her in this form as Princess Sailor Venus. In the manga, she does not have a different title or a crown, but she does retain the crescent moon on her forehead until Usagi is revealed as the princess.

As she grows stronger, Sailor Venus gains additional powers, and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first takes place in Act 43 of the manga when she obtains the Venus Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event is divided between Episodes 143 and 154 of the anime, and she is given the name Super Sailor Venus. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Venus&quot;.

===Princess Venus===
In Silver Millennium, Sailor Venus was also the Princess of her home planet. She was the leader of those who protected Princess Serenity of the Moon Kingdom. As Princess Venus, she dwelt in Magellan Castle and wore a yellow gown—she appears in this form in the original manga, as well as in supplementary art. In &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot;, it is shown that she was loved by Adonis, a foot soldier in her army, who was later under the command of Endymion. His love went unnoticed by her, and he became a villain working for the Dark Agency after he was reborn.

Takeuchi once drew her in the arms of Kunzite, leader of the Four Kings of Heaven. In the &quot;Original Picture Collection Vol. I&quot;, Takeuchi expresses a desire to explore the possibility of such relationships; unlike the other characters, with Venus and Kunzite this is explored within the series. In one flashback, Minako blushes and seems flustered around Kunzite after a conversation about love, and in the last chapter of &quot;&quot;, Princess Venus is shown as having had an infatuation with Kunzite. In &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; it is established that Sailor Venus and Kunzite were in love at the time of the Moon Kingdom. This is also stated in the stage musicals, as well as in the &quot;Another Story&quot; video game.

===Sailor V===

A preliminary form, under which Minako fought alone before the other Sailor Guardians were awakened. She was used to distract the enemy into thinking she was the Moon Princess while trying to find the real one. She wore a different uniform under this name, most notably a red mask, and her appearance and powers incorporated the use of a crescent motif. In the early storyline of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, she is something of a celebrity figure, of whom Usagi Tsukino is a great fan. She called herself the Guardian of Justice. The V was short for Venus, and she would sometimes introduce herself as such, though no other character refers to this form as such. The form makes a return in two of Chibiusa&#x27;s Picture Diary side stories, namely the first and third, set during the second and fourth story arcs. The former was likely chosen due to her knowing one of the people she was rescuing was a Sailor V fan, the use of it in the latter is entirely without explanation.

Because Minako&#x27;s creation predates the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; metaseries, some aspects of her character are slightly incompatible with the other Sailor Guardians. For example, her magical attacks lack the strict elemental rules: Venus is typically associated with metal in Chinese astrology, but her attacks are mostly light or love related. The incorporation of the &quot;love element&quot; comes from the Roman goddess Venus.

Sailor V&#x27;s sailor suit is mostly blue and red and includes shoulder armor, quarter-length sleeves, and broad stripes of color. She wears a shirt rather than a leotard, as well as her characteristic red mask. Some of the details vary from version to version; in the manga and live-action series the shirt had sleeves and smooth gloves, but in the anime, it was sleeveless with ring-topped gloves. Occasionally in the manga, tiny, ornamental crescent moon charms were visible on the straps of the indigo high-heeled shoes accompanying this outfit, albeit the presence of these charms often varied from illustration to illustration. The anime added a second layer to her shoulder guards, omitted the crescent Moon that is normally visible on her forehead, and added a second stripe to her collar. In the live-action series, the bow on Sailor V&#x27;s chest was made dark pink, like the red parts of Sailor Moon&#x27;s costume, but her mask and hair bow are red.

==Special powers and items==

Minako is portrayed to have borderline superpower abilities in civilian form, such as jumping to the room of Usagi&#x27;s house from ground level in a single jump and outrunning a car after having her Pure Heart Crystal extracted from her body (something that had previously instantly knocked out the other Sailor Guardians and would later kill Neptune and Uranus). Despite this, like the other Sailor Guardians, she must transform in order to gain access to her special powers. To transform into Sailor Venus, she must first raise a special device (pen, bracelet, wand, or crystal) into the air and shout a special phrase, originally &quot;Venus Power, Make-up!&quot; As she becomes more powerful and obtains new transformation devices, this phrase changes to evoke Venus Star, Planet, or Crystal Power.
In the first anime, Sailor Venus&#x27;s transformation sequence evolves slightly over time, whether to update the background images or to accommodate changes to her uniform or a new transformation device, but the animations all involve a ribbon of stars which she whips around to form her outfit. The second anime has her first and second transformations involving orange ribbons, her third involving stars that she envelopes herself in and the fourth involving both.

Minako&#x27;s transformations into Sailor V are not clearly shown—in the Sailor V manga, she raises her transformation pen and shouts the phrase &quot;Moon Power Transform&quot;. By saying the word &quot;Crescent&quot; first, she can take on a disguise using her Crescent Compact, and this is used in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga as well. In the live-action series she is shown storing her uniform in a suitcase, but she is also shown changing instantaneously into Sailor V while running down the street. Although her true identity as Sailor Venus takes precedence over her temporary Sailor V guise, in her own manga series she used a number of powers unique to the form. Her most important item was the Crescent Compact, which she used to gain energy for her primary attack, &quot;Crescent Beam&quot; (a beam of light which strikes enemies). She is also given numerous physical attacks, which are references to her guardian planet, and comically named one-off powers. The Compact must be placed in the moonlight to charge. It can also be used as a sharp throwing weapon, and in the manga series she retains it even as Sailor Venus. In the live-action version, she has an identical item which does not double as a compact, called the Crescent Moon Cutter. The pen she uses to transform into Sailor V has an extendable antenna used to contact &quot;Boss,&quot; and no matter what is written with it, it will always be right. She later uses the same pen to transform into Sailor Venus. This form is not lost upon obtaining the Sailor Venus transformation, as shown in the side stories. She is also capable of unleashing poison gas, done in a hospital against a swarm of mosquitoes at a low concentration, composed of the atmosphere of Venus.

In the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime, Sailor Venus&#x27; first primary attack is again &quot;Crescent Beam&quot;, this time without the use of an item. She uses a similar power in the live-action series, without using an item or any special phrase, but nothing like it in the manga; instead, she uses &quot;Rolling Heart Vibration&quot;, which also makes a single appearance in the live-action series. Her first attack that is entirely consistent across the different adaptations is &quot;Venus Love-Me Chain&quot;, which in the manga and live-action series uses the chain wrapped around her waist. This remains her main attack for the rest of the second story arc, all of the third, and much of the fourth, and the chain itself is used in several variations, with the links taking on different shapes. The chain links are round in the manga and live-action series, but heart-shaped in the anime. &quot;Venus Wink Chain Sword&quot; (with heart-shaped links) appears in Manga Act 24, and &quot;Love-Me Moon Chain&quot; is her attack when disguised as Sailor Moon in anime episode 102.

When she takes on her second Sailor Guardian form (Super Sailor Venus in the anime), she gains the ability to use &quot;Venus Love and Beauty Shock&quot;, which is her most powerful attack. In the manga she also gains the Venus Crystal, which is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all of her power. In the live-action series, she is given a tambourine-like weapon (the Sailor Star Tambo) by Artemis. Also in the live-action series, once Minako discovers her true potential as a Guardian, she uses the attack &quot;Rolling Heart Vibration&quot;, a heart-shaped beam of rainbow energy, but only uses it once. She used the attack much earlier in the manga. 

==Development==
In the transition between the &quot;Sailor V&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series, Minako&#x27;s basic character design did not change— in fact, creator Naoko Takeuchi has written that the concept of Minako has barely changed at all from the first moment she created. The magazine that serialized &quot;Sailor V&quot;, Run-Run, intended to produce an OVA based on the character but went bankrupt before it could happen, so Minako was relegated to the sidelines as one of Sailor Moon&#x27;s costars, to Takeuchi&#x27;s regret.

In Minako&#x27;s new form as Sailor Venus, she would have a new uniform, and this went through many changes before settling to the one used in the publication. Early on, each of the Sailor Guardians had a fully unique costume, and Venus&#x27;s was inspired largely by the Sailor V outfit. It was colored mostly in dark blue, with orange used only for the chest ribbon (which was not bow-shaped), and included a crescent moon motif, prominent armor, and white- and red stripes. Her red hair ribbon and trademark Sailor V mask were present as well. Later, Takeuchi was surprised by these sketches and stated that she did not remember drawing them.

The kanji in Minako&#x27;s name translate as , , , , and . It is structured as a pun, as the syllable &quot;no&quot; indicates a possessive, so that her name can also be understood as &quot;Beautiful Child of Love.&quot; This pun with the name being based on the aspect of the planet, in this case Venus being the goddess of love in Roman Mythology, runs across all the Sailor Soldiers. As Minako was &quot;transplanted&quot; from her previous series, unlike the other Soldiers, her family name does not begin with the same kanji as her planet, which would have been . However, like them it is still a representation of her primary element, the &quot;inevitable&quot; connection with Venus, the Roman goddess of love. The characters of her given name can also, using unconventional but extant readings, be read as &quot;Binasu&quot;—a Japanese approximation of the name &quot;Venus&quot;.

===Actresses===
In the original Japanese version of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime series, Minako is voiced by Rika Fukami, with Nanae Sumitomo as a stand-in for portions of episode 163 of SuperS. Shizuka Itō voiced her from &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; onwards.

In the original English-language dub of Sailor Moon, her name was changed to &quot;Mina&quot; (originally a nickname used in the Japanese version) and she was voiced by Stephanie Morgenstern for the first two seasons and all three movies. Emilie-Claire Barlow provided her voice in Cloverway&#x27;s dub of episodes 90-166. In the Viz Media dub Minako is voiced by Cherami Leigh in Viz Media&#x27;s dub of the entire &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series (produced in association with Studiopolis). A &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; fan, Leigh read the female roles in California and was selected for Minako during her wedding in her homeland Texas.

In the stage musicals, Minako has been played by twenty one actresses: Nana Suzuki, Sakae Yamashita (&quot;Yume Senshi - Ai - Eien Ni&quot; soundtrack only and is not considered the 2nd actress to play her but the 2nd person to be cast since she was never in the musical performing as her), Chizuru Soya, Kanatsu Nakaya, Akiko Miyazawa, Miyu Otani, Nao Inada, Yuki Nakamura, Ayumi Murata, Mizuki Watanabe, Momoko Shibuya, half-American idol Erica, Shiori Sakata., Rimo Hasegawa, Hina Higuchi, Kana Nakada, Mayu Tamura, Sena, Yu Nakanishi, Saya Goto, Teresa Ikeda and Sakura Kawasaki.

In &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;, Minako is portrayed by Ayaka Komatsu.

==Reception and influence==
The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; character popularity polls listed Minako Aino, Sailor V, and Sailor Venus as separate entities. In 1992, readers ranked Venus as the second most popular character, Minako being tenth and Sailor V being ninth, out of thirty-eight choices. One year later, now with fifty choices, Minako was the fifth most popular character, Sailor Venus was seventh, and Sailor V was tenth. In 1994, with fifty one choices, Sailor Venus was the twelfth most popular character, Minako was the fourteenth, and Sailor V was the nineteenth most popular character. In early 1996, with fifty-one choices, Sailor Venus was the seventeenth most popular character, Minako was again the fourteenth most popular, and Sailor V did not place.

Minako has had her powers the longest of the Sailor Guardians, and because of this, Jennifer Brown suggests that her sense of self-worth is more connected to her confidence in her powers.

Writing about &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot;, Brigid Alverson describes Minako as more energetic than Usagi, stating that although she is not a good student, she is &quot;a lively girl with a strong spirit, someone who does nothing by half measures,&quot; describing her as leaping through the panels of the manga. Katherine Dacey praises Minako&#x27;s &quot;can-do spirit,&quot; noting that she wholeheartedly embraces her responsibilities as Sailor V. Ed Sizemore feels that Minako&#x27;s sporty nature makes her more confident than Usagi, feeling that she is much more self-sufficient. Sean Gaffney describes Minako as &quot;hyperactive and proactive.&quot;

Her sailor v form served as the basis for the Allenby’s Nobel Gundam design in Mobile Fighter G Gundam.

<text>&quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, also known as simply &quot;America&quot;, is an American patriotic song, the lyrics of which were written by Samuel Francis Smith. The song served as one of the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthems of the United States (along with songs like &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot;) before the adoption of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the official U.S. national anthem in 1931. The melody used is adapted from the national anthem of the United Kingdom, &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

==History==
Samuel Francis Smith wrote the lyrics to &quot;America&quot; in 1831 while a student at the Andover Theological Seminary in Andover, Massachusetts. The use of the same melody as the British royal anthem is a contrafactum which reworks this symbol of British monarchy to make a statement about American democracy.

Composer Lowell Mason had requested that Smith translate or provide new lyrics for a collection of German songs, among them one written to this melody. Smith gave Mason the lyrics he had written, and the song was first performed in public on July 4, 1831, at a children&#x27;s Independence Day celebration at Park Street Church in Boston. The first publication of &quot;America&quot; was in 1832.

==Lyrics==

An abolitionist version was written, by A.G. Duncan, 1843, with lyrics mentioning white and black races. For Washington&#x27;s Centennial celebration, another verse was added to the original version.

==Notable performances==
Marian Anderson performed the song at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939. Anderson, an African American singer, had been forbidden to perform at the DAR Constitution Hall due to its whites-only policy. After a national outcry, and with support from Eleanor Roosevelt, the concert was held on the steps of the memorial, and attracted a crowd of more than 75,000 in addition to a national radio audience of millions.

Martin Luther King Jr. recited the first verse of the song toward the end of his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963.

Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash performed the song on the first episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; that aired after the September 11 attacks in 2001.

On January 20, 2009, Aretha Franklin sang the song at the first inauguration of Barack Obama. Kelly Clarkson sang it at his second inauguration.

<text>The Ramsey–Lewis method is a method for defining terms found in theoretical frameworks (such as in scientific theories), credited to mathematician Frank P. Ramsey and philosopher David K. Lewis. By using this method, a set of theoretical terms appearing in a theory can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself.

==Overview==
A scientific theory which attempts to describe &quot;electrons&quot; is inherently abstract, as no one has ever observed an electron directly. Thus, the origin and content of the concept of &quot;electron&quot; is questionable. What does the word exactly signify? Ramsey and Lewis proposed that the meaning of the term &quot;electron&quot; is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it, via all its assertions about electrons. Electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true.

However, some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as &quot;charge&quot; or &quot;spin&quot;. For instance, &quot;Electrons attract protons&quot; and &quot;Electrons have negative charge&quot; employ the terms &quot;protons&quot; and &quot;negative charge&quot; (with the latter also implicitly using the concept of &quot;charge&quot;). These properties are formalized, statements (such as conditionals) are formed using them, and those statements taken together are the definition of the term.

Consider a sentence such as &quot;There&#x27;s an electron in the sink.&quot; This means something along the lines of: &quot;There exist some properties &quot;P&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;2, ..., &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; ( one for every theoretical property involved in the scientific theory, with &#x27;electronhood&#x27; (which roughly corresponds to the essence of an electron included as &quot;P&quot;1) such that... (a statement in the scientific theory, but with &quot;P&quot;1, ..., &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; substituted for the specific terms such as &#x27;charge&#x27;, &#x27;is an electron&#x27;, etc. employed by the theory), and there is something in the sink that has &quot;P&quot;1.&quot;

The process of converting the narrative form of a scientific theory into second-order logic is commonly called &quot;Ramsification&quot; (sometimes also spelled &quot;Ramseyfication&quot;).

Example: Suppose there are only three principles in our scientific theory about electrons (those principles can be seen to be statements involving the properties):

A1. Electrons (things that have P1) have charge (P2).

A2. Things with charge (P2) tickle you.

A3. Electrons (things that have P1) cause lightning.

Furthermore, we include the property of &quot;electronhood&quot;, as outlined above, to be designated by &quot;P&quot;1, and the property of &quot;charge&quot; to be designated by &quot;P&quot;2.

Then the meaning of a sentence such as &quot;I have an electron in my pocket&quot; is Ramsified into:

&quot;There are properties &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2 such that (things with &quot;P&quot;1 also have &quot;P&quot;2, and things with &quot;P&quot;2 tickle you, and things with &quot;P&quot;1 cause lightning, and there is a thing with &quot;P&quot;1 in my pocket).&quot; (, who cites .)

<text>Albert Ballin (15 August 1857 – 9 November 1918) was a German shipping magnate. He was the general director of the Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft (HAPAG) or Hamburg-America Line, which for a time was the world&#x27;s largest shipping company. Being the inventor of the concept of the cruise ship, he is known as the father of modern cruise ship travel. Albert Ballin was a risk-taker who was willing to challenge his colleagues, foreign competitors, and domestic politics in order to build a successful shipping company. He focused on British rivals and was determined to expand HAPAG&#x27;s global reach, he also worked closely with the Kaiser and supported expansion of the German navy.

, named after the German Empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein entered transatlantic service on 10 May 1889, from Hamburg to New York City via Southampton. Two years later, in 1891, she made the World&#x27;s first Mediterranean cruise.

In 1901, Ballin built the Emigration Halls on the Hamburg island of Veddel to accommodate the many thousands of people from all over Europe who arrived at the Port of Hamburg every week to emigrate to North and South America on his company&#x27;s ships. The island is now the &quot;BallinStadt&quot; Museum. In 1913, HAPAG owned three of the world&#x27;s biggest ocean liners; however all were later seized as part of World War I reparations.

Facing the loss of his company&#x27;s ships after World War I, Ballin committed suicide in Hamburg as the war ended. 

== Business ==
His father, Samuel Joseph Ballin (1804–1874), was a Danish Jew who had emigrated from Denmark. Samuel was part owner of an emigration agency that arranged passages to the United States, and when he died in 1874, young Albert took over the business. He developed it into an independent shipping line, saving costs by carrying cargo on the return trip from the US. This brought him to the attention of the Hamburg America Line; the line hired him in 1886 and made him general director in 1899.

Although extremely successful in developing the business, as a Jew, and only being the director, but not the owner of a company, he was not accepted by all of Hamburg society. Nevertheless, he was respected and admired by Kaiser Wilhelm II, by whom he was honoured with &quot;hoffähigkeit&quot; (right of presentation at court). Ballin&#x27;s home in Hamburg, which currently houses the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning, has a suite of rooms that were built specifically for the Kaiser, to be used when he visited Hamburg. Many different ship companies began to include ocean liners among their fleets to add luxury and comfort to sea travel. Due to bad weather conditions in the winter months, the transatlantic ocean liners could not operate at full capacity. Ballin developed a plan to increase occupancy by offering idle ships to travel agencies in Europe and America in the winter. 

The first modern cruise, which defined the journey not just as transport but as the actual reward, commenced on 22 January 1891, when &quot;Augusta Victoria&quot; sailed to cruise the Mediterranean for six weeks. Competitors at first ridiculed Ballin, who organized and supervised the voyage personally, but the project was a huge success. In order to accommodate the growing demand, another three of &quot;Auguste Victoria&quot;″s sister ships operated as cruise liners, and in 1899, the Hamburg-America Line commissioned Blohm &amp; Voss to construct the first purpose-built cruise ship, the &quot;Prinzessin Victoria Luise&quot;. It was the very first ship specifically built as a cruise ship, one exclusively tailored for the needs of well-to-do passengers.

Ballin further expanded the fleet in 1900 when he acquired fourteen steamships from A. C. de Freitas &amp; Co. In 1901, Ballin built the Emigration Halls (now the Museum &quot;BallinStadt&quot;) on the Hamburg island of Veddel to accommodate the many thousands of people from all over Europe who arrived at the Port of Hamburg every week to emigrate to North and South America on his company&#x27;s ships.

Ballin frequently traveled on the ships in his fleet and often spoke to other passengers to understand more about the ships and what improvements to make to Hamburg Amerika ships in the future. Ballin would take these ideas for improvements in hand and make sure they were implemented on both his current and future liners.

== World War I ==

Ballin acted as mediator between Great Britain and the German Empire in the tense years prior to the outbreak of World War I. Terrified that he would lose his ships in the event of naval hostilities, Ballin attempted to broker a deal whereby Britain and Germany would continue to race one another in passenger liners but desist in their attempts to best one another&#x27;s naval fleets. Working with his close friend the British financier Ernest Cassel, they convinced the governments in London and Berlin to negotiate a solution to the naval arms race through the Haldane Mission of 1912. Unfortunately it was a failure. Consequently, the outbreak of war deeply disillusioned him. Many of the Hamburg-America Line&#x27;s ships were lost or suffered considerable damage during the hostilities.

Completely distraught upon hearing the news of the abdication of his benefactor and protector, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Ballin committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills two days before the armistice ended World War I. Ballin&#x27;s fears were soon to be realized; the company&#x27;s flagships, the triumvirate , and &quot;Bismarck&quot;, were ceded as war prizes to Great Britain and the United States.

== Honors ==
The was named in his honor, as is the Ballindamm, a street in central Hamburg. A postage stamp was issued by the Deutsche Bundespost in 1957 in commemoration of Ballin&#x27;s 100th birthday.

<text>A fourth is a musical interval encompassing four staff positions in the music notation of Western culture, and a perfect fourth () is the fourth spanning five semitones (half steps, or half tones). For example, the ascending interval from C to the next F is a perfect fourth, because the note F is the fifth semitone above C, and there are four staff positions between C and F. Diminished and augmented fourths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (four and six, respectively).

The perfect fourth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the third and fourth harmonics. The term &quot;perfect&quot; identifies this interval as belonging to the group of perfect intervals, so called because they are neither major nor minor.

A perfect fourth in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 4:3, or about 498 cents (), while in equal temperament a perfect fourth is equal to five semitones, or 500 cents (see additive synthesis).

Until the late 19th century, the perfect fourth was often called by its Greek name, &quot;diatessaron&quot;. Its most common occurrence is between the fifth and upper root of all major and minor triads and their extensions.

An example of a perfect fourth is the beginning of the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (&quot;Treulich geführt&quot;, the colloquially-titled &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot;). Another example is the beginning melody of the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. Other examples are the first two notes of the Christmas carol &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; and &quot;El Cóndor Pasa&quot;, and, for a descending perfect fourth, the second and third notes of &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;.

The perfect fourth is a perfect interval like the unison, octave, and perfect fifth, and it is a sensory consonance. In common practice harmony, however, it is considered a stylistic dissonance in certain contexts, namely in two-voice textures and whenever it occurs &quot;above the bass in chords with three or more notes&quot;. If the bass note also happens to be the chord&#x27;s root, the interval&#x27;s upper note almost always temporarily displaces the third of any chord, and, in the terminology used in popular music, is then called a &quot;suspended fourth&quot;.

Conventionally, adjacent strings of the double bass and of the bass guitar are a perfect fourth apart when unstopped, as are all pairs but one of adjacent guitar strings under standard guitar tuning. Sets of tom-tom drums are also commonly tuned in perfect fourths. The 4:3 just perfect fourth arises in the C major scale between F and C. 

==History==
The use of perfect fourths and fifths to sound in parallel with and to &quot;thicken&quot; the melodic line was prevalent in music prior to the European polyphonic music of the Middle Ages.

In the 13th century, the fourth and fifth together were the &quot;concordantiae mediae&quot; (middle consonances) after the unison and octave, and before the thirds and sixths. The fourth came in the 15th century to be regarded as dissonant on its own, and was first classed as a dissonance by Johannes Tinctoris in his &quot;Terminorum musicae diffinitorium&quot; (1473). In practice, however, it continued to be used as a consonance when supported by the interval of a third or fifth in a lower voice.

Modern acoustic theory supports the medieval interpretation insofar as the intervals of unison, octave, fifth and fourth have particularly simple frequency ratios. The octave has the ratio of 2:1, for example the interval between a&#x27; at A440 and a&quot; at 880 Hz, giving the ratio 880:440, or 2:1. The fifth has a ratio of 3:2, and its complement has the ratio of 3:4. Ancient and medieval music theorists appear to have been familiar with these ratios, see for example their experiments on the monochord.
In the years that followed, the frequency ratios of these intervals on keyboards and other fixed-tuning instruments would change slightly as different systems of tuning, such as meantone temperament, well temperament, and equal temperament were developed.

In early western polyphony, these simpler intervals (unison, octave, fifth and fourth) were generally preferred. However, in its development between the 12th and 16th centuries:
*In the earliest stages, these simple intervals occur so frequently that they appear to be the favourite sound of composers.
*Later, the more &quot;complex&quot; intervals (thirds, sixths, and tritones) move gradually from the margins to the centre of musical interest.
*By the end of the Middle Ages, new rules for voice leading had been laid, re-evaluating the importance of unison, octave, fifth and fourth and handling them in a more restricted fashion (for instance, the later forbidding of parallel octaves and fifths).

The music of the 20th century for the most part discards the rules of &quot;classical&quot; Western tonality. For instance, composers such as Erik Satie borrowed stylistic elements from the Middle Ages, but some composers found more innovative uses for these intervals.

===Middle Ages===
In medieval music, the tonality of the common practice period had not yet developed, and many examples may be found with harmonic structures that are built on fourths and fifths. The &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; of the mid-10th century, a guidebook for musical practice of the time, described singing in parallel fourths, fifths, and octaves. This development continued, and the music of the Notre Dame school may be considered the apex of a coherent harmony in this style.
For instance, in one &quot;Alleluia&quot; (Listen) by Pérotin, the fourth is favoured. Elsewhere, in parallel &quot;organum&quot; at the fourth, the upper line would be accompanied a fourth below. Also important was the practice of &quot;Fauxbourdon&quot;, which is a three-voice technique (not infrequently improvisatory) in which the two lower voices proceed parallel to the upper voice at a fourth and sixth below. &quot;Fauxbourdon&quot;, while making extensive use of fourths, is also an important step towards the later triadic harmony of tonality, as it may be seen as a first inversion (or 6/3) triad.

This parallel 6/3 triad was incorporated into the contrapuntal style at the time, in which parallel fourths were sometimes considered problematic, and written around with ornaments or other modifications to the &quot;Fauxbourdon&quot; style. An example of this is the start of the Marian-Antiphon &quot;Ave Maris Stella&quot; (Listen) by Guillaume Dufay, a master of &quot;Fauxbourdon&quot;.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
The development of tonality continued through the Renaissance until it was fully realized by composers of the Baroque era.
As time progressed through the late Renaissance and early Baroque, the fourth became more understood as an interval that needed resolution. Increasingly the harmonies of fifths and fourths yielded to uses of thirds and sixths. In the example, cadence forms from works by Orlando di Lasso and Palestrina show the fourth being resolved as a suspension. (Listen)

In the early Baroque music of Claudio Monteverdi and Girolamo Frescobaldi triadic harmony was thoroughly utilized. Diatonic and chromatic passages strongly outlining the interval of a fourth appear in the &quot;lamento&quot; genre, and often in &quot;passus duriusculus&quot; passages of chromatic descent. In the madrigals of Claudio Monteverdi and Carlo Gesualdo the intensive interpretation of the text (word painting) frequently highlights the shape of a fourth as an extremely delayed resolution of a fourth suspension. Also, in Frescobaldi&#x27;s &quot;Chromatic Toccata&quot; of 1635 the outlined fourths overlap, bisecting various church modes.

In the first third of the 18th century, ground-laying theoretical treatises on composition and harmony were written. Jean-Philippe Rameau completed his treatise &quot;Le Traité de l&#x27;harmonie réduite à ses principes naturels&quot; (the theory of harmony reduced to its natural principles) in 1722 which supplemented his work of four years earlier, &quot;Nouveau Système de musique theoretique&quot; (new system of music theory); these together may be considered the cornerstone of modern music theory relating to consonance and harmony. The Austrian composer Johann Fux published in 1725 his powerful treatise on the composition of counterpoint in the style of Palestrina under the title &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; (The Steps to Parnassus). He outlined various types of counterpoint (e.g., &quot;note against note&quot;), and suggested a careful application of the fourth so as to avoid dissonance.

===Classical and romantic===
The blossoming of tonality and the establishment of well temperament in Bach&#x27;s time both had a continuing influence up to the late romantic period, and the tendencies towards quartal harmony were somewhat suppressed. An increasingly refined cadence, and triadic harmony defined the musical work of this era. Counterpoint was simplified to favour an upper line with a clear accompanying harmony. Still, there are many examples of dense counterpoint utilizing fourths in this style, commonly as part of the background urging the harmonic expression in a passage along to a climax. Mozart in his so-called &quot;Dissonance Quartet&quot; KV 465 (Listen) used chromatic and whole tone scales to outline fourths, and the subject of the fugue in the third movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Piano sonata op. 110&quot; (Listen) opens with three ascending fourths. These are all melodic examples, however, and the underlying harmony is built on thirds.

Composers started to reassess the quality of the fourth as a consonance rather than a dissonance. This would later influence the development of quartal and quintal harmony.

The &quot;Tristan chord&quot; is made up of the notes F, B, D and G and is the first chord heard in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

&lt;/score&gt;

The chord had been found in earlier works, notably Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 18, but Wagner&#x27;s usage was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional tonal harmony and even towards atonality, and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the &quot;sound&quot; or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its &quot;function&quot;, a notion which was soon after to be explored by Debussy and others.

Fourth-based harmony became important in the work of Slavic and Scandinavian composers such as Modest Mussorgsky, Leoš Janáček, and Jean Sibelius. These composers used this harmony in a pungent, uncovered, almost archaic way, often incorporating the folk music of their particular homelands. Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Piano Sonata in F-Major op. 12&quot; of 1893 used tremolo passages of near-quartal harmony in a way that was relatively difficult and modern. Even in the example from Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano-cycle &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; &quot;(Избушка на курьих ножках (Баба-Яга) – The Hut on Fowl&#x27;s Legs)&quot; (Listen) the fourth always makes an &quot;unvarnished&quot; entrance.

The romantic composers Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, had used the special &quot;thinned out&quot; sound of fourth-chord in late works for piano (&quot;Nuages gris&quot; (Grey Clouds), &quot;La lugubre gondola&quot; (The Mournful Gondola), and other works).

In the 1897 work &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice (L&#x27;Apprenti sorcier)&quot; by Paul Dukas, the repetition of rising fourths is a musical representation of the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to &quot;rise and rise&quot;. Quartal harmony in Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Sonatine&quot; and &quot;Ma Mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; (Mother Goose) would follow a few years later.

===20th century music===

====Western classical music====

In the 20th century, harmony explicitly built on fourths and fifths became important. This became known as quartal harmony for chords based on fourths and quintal harmony for chords based on fifths.
In the music of composers of early 20th century France, fourth chords became consolidated with ninth chords, the whole tone scale, the pentatonic scale, and polytonality as part of their language, and quartal harmony became an important means of expression in music by Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and others. Examples are found in Debussy&#x27;s orchestral work &quot;La Mer&quot; (The Sea) and in his piano works, in particular &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot; (The Sunken Cathedral) from his &quot;Préludes&quot; for piano, &quot;Pour les quartes&quot; (For Fourths) and &quot;Pour les arpéges composées&quot; (For Composite Arpeggios) from his &quot;Etudes&quot;.

====Jazz====
Jazz uses quartal harmonies (usually called &quot;voicing in fourths&quot;).

Cadences are often &quot;altered&quot; to include unresolved suspended chords which include a fourth above the bass:

<text>Xiamen, historically romanized as Amoy, is a sub-provincial city in southeastern Fujian, People&#x27;s Republic of China, beside the Taiwan Strait. It is divided into six districts: Huli, Siming, Jimei, Tong&#x27;an, Haicang, and Xiang&#x27;an. All together, these cover an area of with a population of 5,163,970 as of 2020 and estimated at 5.35 million as of 31 December 2024. The urbanized area of the city has spread from its original island to include most parts of all six of its districts, as well as 4 Zhangzhou districts (Xiangcheng, Longwen, Longhai and Changtai), which form a built-up area of 7,284,148 inhabitants. This area also connects with Quanzhou in the north, making up a metropolis of nearly ten million people. The Kinmen Islands (Quemoy) administered by the Republic of China (Taiwan) lie less than away separated by Xiamen Bay. As part of the Opening Up Policy under Deng Xiaoping, Xiamen became one of China&#x27;s original four special economic zones opened to foreign investment and trade in the early 1980s.

Xiamen Island possessed a major international seaport. The port of Xiamen is a well-developed first-class trunk line port in the Asia-Pacific region. It is ranked the 7th-largest container port in China and ranks 14th in the world. It is the 4th port in China with the capacity to handle 6th-generation large container ships. On 31 August 2010, Xiamen Port incorporated the neighboring port of Zhangzhou to form the largest port of China&#x27;s Southeast. Ever since the 12th century, Xiamen was also an important origin for many migrants to Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The overseas Chinese used to support Xiamen&#x27;s educational and cultural institutions. Xiamen is classified as a Large-Port Metropolis.

Xiamen is one of the top 40 cities in the world by scientific research as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is home to several major universities, including Xiamen University, one of China&#x27;s most prestigious universities as a member of the Double First Class Universities, Huaqiao, Jimei, Xiamen University of Technology and Xiamen Medical College. 

==Name==
Xiamen had always been known as Tong&#x27;an County since antiquity until Republic of China Era of the 20th century, followed by administrative zoning restructures and naming changes.

Tong&#x27;an County first appeared in Han dynasty records. Xiamen Island was described as Jiahe Islet of Tong&#x27;an County during the Song dynasty (960–1279). It received its present name from the Xiamen Defense Castle erected on the island by Zhou Dexing in 1387 during the Ming dynasty to meet the needs of coastal defense. The name was formerly written using, , and then changed into or &quot;Gate of China&quot;.

After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Zheng Chenggong, or Koxinga, a Ming loyalist and general, occupied Xiamen island as an anti-Qing base. In 1650, the seventh year of Emperor Shunzhi of the Qing dynasty, Zheng set a military base in Xiamen island and changed its name into , meaning &quot;Remembering the Ming&quot;.

When its port prospered under the Qing, especially during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, the island&#x27;s name was changed to again.

The island&#x27;s name of 思明 was in return restored after the Xinhai Revolution that inaugurated the republic in 1912.

The island&#x27;s name of 廈門 was restored in 1933, along with Xiamen being administratively planned as a city, the first of its kind in Fujian province. 思明 continues to be used as the name of one of its districts.

Xiamen is the atonal pinyin romanization of the characters&#x27; pronunciation in Mandarin. It has also been romanized as Hiamen. The older English name &quot;Amoy&quot; was based on the same name&#x27;s pronunciation in the Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien, &quot;Ē͘-mûi&quot;.

==Geography==


Xiamen is a sub-provincial city in southeastern Fujian whose urban core grew up from the port of Xiamen on southern Xiamen Island, now located within Siming District. It now also includes Gulangyu Island and the rugged coast of the mainland from the northeast bank of the Jiulong River in the west to the islands of Xiang&#x27;an in the east. Xiamen Island lies about one degree north of the Tropic of Cancer. It is divided between Huli District in the north and Siming District in the south. Siming also includes Gulangyu. Its mainland territory is divided among Haicang, Jimei, Tong&#x27;an, and Xiang&#x27;an districts.

In the 19th century, Xiamen&#x27;s harbor on Yundang Bay was considered one of the world&#x27;s great natural harbors. Land reclamation has since been used to fill in the mouth of this inlet, turning it into Siming District&#x27;s Yundang Lake. The municipal government is located on other reclaimed land beside it.

The nearest point of Liehyu in the Kinmen Islands, Republic of China (Taiwan), lies only off Xiamen Island.

Xiamen Island is the fourth largest island in Fujian province. It became a peninsula after the completion of the seawall in 1955. Xiamen waters include Xiamen Port, Outer Harbor Area, Maluan Bay, Tongan Bay, Jiulong River&#x27;s estuary area and the waterway on the east side. Outside the Xiamen Port, Big Kinmen, Little Kinmen, Dadan, Erdan and other island are arranged in a horizontal line. Inside, it has Xiamen Island, Gulangyu Island and other island barriers, making it a good natural port protected from storms.

===Climate===
Xiamen has a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), characterised by long, hot and humid summers (but moderate compared to much of the rest of the province) and short, mild and dry winters. The warmest month is July, with a 24-hour average of , and the coolest month is January, averaging ; the annual mean is . Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 24 January 2016 to on 9 August 2019. Spring, both by humidity and percentage of sunshine, is the dampest season but typhoons in late summer and early autumn can make the latter period wetter overall. Summer and autumn are marked by comparatively sunny conditions, while autumn is warm and dry. The annual rainfall is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 29% in March to 58% in July, the city receives 1,893 hours of bright sunshine annually. Frost occurs very rarely, and the last snowfall in the city took place in January 1893, when snow also fell at Guangzhou, Macau, in the inland parts of Hong Kong and in the hills of Taipei.

The area is known within China for its relatively low pollution.

==History==
The area of Xiamen was largely bypassed by the Qin and Han conquests and colonization of Guangdong, which passed west of Fujian down the Lingqu Canal between the Xiang and Li rivers. It was first organized as Tong&#x27;an County in AD282 under the Jin, but it lost this status soon afterwards. Tong&#x27;an County was again established in 933 under the Later Tang.

The settlement on the southeastern shore of Xiamen Island (now part of Siming District) developed as a seaport under the Song, although legal foreign trade was restricted to nearby Quanzhou, which administered the area. In 1387, attacks by the &quot;Japanese&quot; or &quot;dwarf&quot; pirates—many of them actually disaffected Chinese—prompted the Ming to protect the harbor with the fortress that gave Xiamen its name. The Portuguese first reached Xiamen in 1541. After the fall of the Ming to the Qing in 1644, Southern Ming loyalists including Koxinga used Xiamen as a base from which to launch attacks against the invading Qing-aligned Han Bannermen from 1650 to 1660. In 1661, Koxinga drove the Dutch from Taiwan and moved his operations there. His base on Xiamen fell to a combined Qing and Dutch invasion in 1663. The East India Company traded extensively with the port, constructing a factory there in 1678. It was raised to the status of a subprefecture in 1680, but the taxes and other restrictions placed on traders compelled the British to relocate to Canton and Fuzhou the next year. Trade resumed in 1685 and continued until the imposition of the Canton System. However, despite the Canton system which restricted Western trade to the port of Guangzhou, the Spanish were still allowed to trade in Xiamen. However, the Spanish rarely used this privilege as Chinese traders would ship their goods from Xiamen to Manila and vice versa, which was more profitable for both sides.

By the 19th century, the city walls had a circumference of around , with an inner and outer city divided by an inner wall and a ridge of hills surmounted by a well-built fort. The inner harbor on Yundang Bay was also well fortified and these defenses were further strengthened upon the outbreak of the First Opium War. Nonetheless, Xiamen was captured in 1841 between Guangzhou and Zhoushan. Rear Adm. Parker bombarded the Qing position to little effect, but the assault by the men under Lt. Gen. Gough caused the Chinese to flee their positions without a fight. The city was abandoned during the night and fell the next day on 27 August. The Chinese had spirited out the entire treasury of sycee bullion under the nose of the British by disguising it inside hollow logs. Xiamen being too large to garrison, a small force was left to hold Gulangyu. The next year, the Treaty of Nanjing made Xiamen one of the first five ports opened to British trade, which had previously been legally restricted to Guangzhou. Subsequent treaties opened the port to other international powers.

As the primary international port for Fujian, particularly Zhangzhou and its hinterland, Xiamen became a center of China&#x27;s tea trade, with hundreds of thousands of tons shipped yearly to Europe and the Americas. Its local dialect influenced a variety of translations of Chinese terms. Its principal exports during the period were tea, porcelain, and paper; it imported sugar, rice, cotton, and opium, as well as some manufactured goods. Xiamen was also a center of Protestant missionaries in China; the missions operated the city&#x27;s two hospitals. The merchants of Xiamen were thought among the richest and most entrepreneurial and industrious in China, but the city was widely accounted the dirtiest city in China. Owing to local belief in feng shui, the streets were &quot;as crooked as ram&#x27;s horns&quot; and averaged about in width to keep out sunlight and control public disturbances. Its population was estimated at 250,000 in the 1870s; by that point the island was largely barren and full of roughly 140 villages, with a total population around 400,000. European settlement in the port was concentrated on Gulangyu Island off Xiamen proper; it remains known for its colonial architecture.

By the 20th century, the local export economy had collapsed due to the success of British tea plantations in India. During the Qing and the early 20th century, many southern Fujianese emigrated to Taiwan and Southeast Asia, such as in the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, etc., spreading Hokkien language and culture overseas. Some 350,000 overseas Chinese currently trace their ancestry to Xiamen. Some of this diaspora later returned: an estimated 220,000 Xiamen residents are returning overseas Chinese and their kin. Others continue to help fund universities and cultural institutions in Xiamen.

At the time of the Xinhai Revolution, the native population of the city was estimated at 300,000 and the foreign settlement at 280. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the area around Xiamen was renamed Siming County. Xiamen&#x27;s trade during the period was largely conducted through Taiwan, which had been seized by Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese subsequently claimed Fujian as their sphere of influence during the colonial squabbling over China. Japan occupied Xiamen Island from May 1938 to September 1945 during World War II. During the Japanese occupation, the city provided some shipments of rice to the Portuguese Colony of Macau. In the late phases of the Chinese Civil War that followed, the Communists captured Xiamen and Gulangyu in October 1949 but failed to capture Kinmen. The same year, Xiamen became a provincially administered city ().

In 1955 and 1958, mainland China escalated Cold War political tensions by shelling nearby islands from Xiamen in what became known as the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. The Nationalists responded by reinforcing Kinmen and shelling Xiamen. The Gaoji Causeway built from 1955 to 1957 notionally transformed Xiamen Island into a peninsula, and so it was termed in the heady propaganda of the time. Due to political tensions, the eastern half of Xiamen Island and much of the Fujian Coast facing the offshore islands remained undeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s. The Water Police and Post-Office were situated directly across the water from the American embassy.

When Deng Xiaoping initiated his Opening Up Policy, Xiamen was made one of the first four special economic zones in 1980, with special investment and trade regulations attracting foreign investment, particularly from overseas Chinese. The construction of Huli Export Processing Zone in Xiamen Special Economic Zone was officially started on 15 October 1981. In 1984, Xiamen Special Economic Zone was expanded from an area of 2.5 square kilometers of Huli to 131 square kilometers of the whole island. The city grew and prospered. In June 2010, Xiamen Special Economic Zone was expanded to the whole Xiamen city, and four districts outside Xiamen Island – including Jimei, Haicang, Tongan and Xiang&#x27;an – were included into the zone. After this expansion, the area of Xiamen Special Economic Zone reached 1,573 square kilometers, 11 times larger than before.

Answering the call of the Belt and Road Initiative, Xiamen has focused on dealing with international competition with a more confident attitude and to facilitate the construction of the important hub city of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.

In 2001, the governments of mainland China and Taiwan agreed to initiate the &quot;Three Mini-Links&quot; and restored ferry, commercial, and mail links between the mainland and offshore islands. Trade and travel between Xiamen and Kinmen was restored and later expanded to include direct air travel to Taiwan Island. In 2010, travelers between Xiamen and Kinmen made 1.31 million trips.

In 2006, Xiamen was ranked as China&#x27;s 2nd-&quot;most suitable city for living&quot;, as well as China&#x27;s &quot;most romantic leisure city&quot; in 2011.

==Demographics==
A large number of the populace are migrants.

According to the 2020 Census, Xiamen has a population of 5,163,970 inhabitants. According to the 2010 Census, Xiamen has a population of 3,531,347 inhabitants, almost 1.8 times the population counted for the last census in 2000 (which was of 2,053,070 inhabitants). The annual average population growth was of 5.57% for the period 2000–2010. This masks the population explosion in Jimei District, however, which quadrupled since the prior census; Huli District&#x27;s population more than doubled. The resident population was 1,967,800 in 2013 yearend, and with a population of 3.73 million (those residing at least half a year). The total resident population is said to be 4,255,000 in December 2014, without specifying what counts as a resident.

By the end of 2024, the resident population of Xiamen has reached 5.35 million, the majority being Han people. There are also some ethnic minorities such as She and Hui.

===Languages===
As with all of China, the official language is Mandarin. Migrants of non-Hokkien ancestry usually speak Mandarin and/or their inherent tongues.

The indigenous language is Hokkien, a subgroup of Southern Min, with the Tong&#x27;an dialect being the most populous and prevalent. The Xiamen dialect is mostly defined to the southwest quarter of Xiamen Island, while the Zhangzhou dialect is spoken in a section of Haicang District.

The English words &quot;Amoy&quot;, &quot;tea&quot; (), &quot;&quot; (), &quot;pekoe&quot; (), kowtow (), and &quot;ketchup&quot; () are derived from the local Hokkien.

===Religion===

The first evidence of organised religion existed in the area was dated to Sui dynasty when Buddhism was first spread to Tong&#x27;an region and spread to Xiamen Island during Tang dynasty. In the 19th century, Xiamen proper had two Dutch Reformed and two LMS churches. Xiamen Island was home to three Dutch Reformed missions at &quot;Kang-thau&quot;, &quot;Kio-than&quot;, and &quot;Chhan-chhu-oa&quot;.

==Administration==
Xiamen is a sub-provincial city of Fujian with direct jurisdiction over 6 districts.

In May 2003, Gulangyu and Kaiyuan districts were merged into Siming District; Xinglin District () was merged into Jimei District; and Xiang&#x27;an District was created out of a section of Tong&#x27;an District.

==== Lacquer thread sculpture ====

Lacquer thread sculpture () is a traditional artware in East China which uses well-tempered lacquer threads to build decorative patterns.

The main material of lacquer thread sculpture is the mixture of lacquer, the special brick powder and boiled tung oil. After beating the mixture and twisting it into a string, the craftsmen coil, entangle, pile, carve and engrave on the sculpture which is then coated with primer.

The technique&#x27;s development depended on flourishing folk religions and the Buddhist sculpture tradition. As a legacy of the color sculpture of the Tang dynasty (618–907), it was inspired by the thread sculpture technology of the Song and Yuan dynasties (960–1368), especially the process of leaching powder and clay thread sculpture.

The lacquer thread sculpture technique was formed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties (1368–1911). It has four major steps: sculpture, foundation coating, lacquer thread decoration and gilding the surface. It focuses on the aesthetic characteristics of the lacquer thread itself, and demonstrates the evolution of the use of line in Chinese arts and crafts.

==== Bead embroidery ====
The bead embroidery () in Xiamen has small pearls, glass beads and jewels embroidered on the cloth, creating the shining glory, colorful decorations, clear layout and a strong sense of art with stereoscopic impression.

The craftsmanship has a history of nearly 100 years. In the 1970s and 1980s, the art reached its peak in popularity and many kinds of bead embroidery products were exported to over 50 countries and regions in Asia, Europe and America. In 2007, the art was included in the Fujian Provincial Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

==== Nanputuo Temple ====

Like most of the temples in PRC, Nanputuo Temple () has endured its share of violence and destruction during the disastrous cultural revolution. The temple&#x27;s original construction was built more than a millennium ago, then it was destroyed and later rebuilt during the Tang dynasty, the temple was rebuilt and expanded by general Shi Lang during early Qing dynasty. The temple was named after the Buddhist sacred site Mount Putuo of Zhejiang Province, which is considered the abode of Guanyin Bodhisattva. The first elected abbot of the temple, Master Hui Quan set up Minnan Buddhist College in 1925. During cultural revolution, the temple was severely damaged and converted into a factory. After the cultural revolution, the status of the temple was finally reinstated and renovated in the 1980s.

The temple consists of four separate halls of worship, monks quarters and some of the finest maintained grounds and landscapes you&#x27;re likely to find in any Chinese temple. Stone carvings, lotus filled ponds and secluded caves are scattered around the grounds. If you&#x27;re after a bit of good luck, try tossing a coin on the rock behind the main temple, which is said to bring good luck your way. Behind the smoky courtyards, libraries, monk&#x27;s digs, temples and statues of laughing Buddha Milefo is Wulao Feng, &quot;the peak of five old men,&quot; which overlooks the South China Sea, offering a scenic view of Xiamen University campus and the sprawling urban metropolis of Xiamen.

==== Belief in Life Protection Emperor ====
Life Protection Emperor (), commonly referred to as &quot;Baosheng Dadi&quot; () or &quot;Dadaogong&quot; (), &quot;Wuzhenren&quot; () or &quot;Huajiaogong&quot; (), is the Medicinal Deity popularly worshiped by people across Southern Fujian and the Chaozhou-Jieyang-Shantou region (Teochew speaking region in Guangdong province). There are temples dedicated to the deity across the Southern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Among them, the Qingjiao Tzu Chi Temple and Baijiao Tzu Chi Temple are recognized as the ancestral temples of Life Protection Emperor.

Wu Tao or Wu Ben () was born in the village of Bailiao near Xiamen in Fujian Province, during the Song dynasty in the year 979. He was a skilled doctor and Taoist practitioner who was credited with performing medical miracles, including applying eye drops to a dragon&#x27;s eye and removing a foreign object from a tiger&#x27;s throat. After his death in 1036, he began to be worshiped as a deity. His deified status was officially recognized by the Hongxi Emperor of the Ming dynasty who conferred on him the title of “Imperial Inspector at Heavenly Gate, Miracle Doctor of Compassion Relief, Great Taoist Immortal, and the Long-lived, Unbounded, Life Protection Emperor“.

==== Belief in Lord Chi ====

Lord Chi (), or Chi Ran, is an imperial official of Nanjing origin. He is very upright in disciplining himself and fulfilling his official responsibilities. It is said that in the era of Emperor Wanli of the Ming dynasty, Chi was appointed by the imperial court to be magistrate of Zhangzhou, Fujian province. He met two envoys when he passed Small Yingling Mountain, which is in present Xiang&#x27;an district. After having a good conversation with them, he knew that they were under the celestial imperial order from the Jade Emperor (the Supreme Lord of Heaven) and were instructed to spread plague among the population in Zhangzhou. Chi tried to get the poison from them and swallowed the poison immediately to prevent the plague. When he arrived at Maxiang, he was badly poisoned and his face turned black, then he died under a big banyan tree. Jade Emperor was touched by Chi&#x27;s bravery and selfless sacrifice, and his love for the people as his children, so Chi was deified and titled &quot;the Celestial Imperial Inspector representing the Heaven&quot; (), and was promoted as Wang Ye or Sacred Duke.

After Koxinga took over Taiwan, the belief in Lord Chi has been transmitted to Taiwan and Southeast Asia. It has a history of over 300 years and Lord Chi has become one of the divinities (Wang Ye) worshipped in Taiwan.

==== Belief in Fude Zhengshen ====
Belief in Fude Zhengshen () is the belief in the God of Earth. In Chinese folk religion, the Earth Deity is also regarded as God of Wealth and Prosperity, because people believe that &quot;land can bestowed wealth&quot; ().

Every year, the second day of the second month and the fifteenth day of eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar are regarded the birthday of the Earth Deity. Every 16th day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar is the sacrifice day of the &quot;year-end dinner&quot;. Folk activities include the ceremony to light the first incense to invite the ruler of heaven, holding the sacrifice ceremony, sending stoves, and offering incenses to Buddha. Among these activities, meeting the deities, dancing performances, and opera performed to show gratitude for gods are all cultural events.

<doc id="143884" wikidata="Q3189987" url="?curid=143884" title="Jun Tsuji">
<text>was a Japanese author: a poet, essayist, playwright, and translator. He has also been described as a Dadaist, nihilist, Epicurean, shakuhachi musician, actor and bohemian. He translated Max Stirner&#x27;s &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot; and Cesare Lombroso&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; into Japanese.

Born in Tōkyō, Tsuji sought escape in literature from a childhood he described as &quot;nothing but destitution, hardship, and a series of traumatizing difficulties&quot;. He became interested in the works of Tolstoy, Kōtoku Shūsui&#x27;s socialist anarchism, and the literature of Oscar Wilde and Voltaire, among many others. Later, in 1920 Tsuji was introduced to Dada and became a self-proclaimed first Dadaist of Japan, a title also claimed by Tsuji&#x27;s contemporary, Shinkichi Takahashi. Tsuji became a fervent proponent of Stirnerite egoist anarchism, which would become a point of contention between himself and Takahashi. He wrote one of the prologues for famed feminist poet Hayashi Fumiko&#x27;s 1929 ( and was active in the radical artistic circles of his time.

==Individualist anarchism==
Tsuji was influenced by the philosophy of Epicurus, and many characteristics of Epicureanism show through his lifestyle. For example, Tsuji avoided active engagement in politics and sought after a form of ataraxia, which he was apparently able to experience through vagabond wandering and Egoism. He also spent his time primarily trying to enjoy a simple life free of suffering (see Aponia). While his writings themselves are significant, it seems Tsuji&#x27;s own emphasis was on developing an experimental, liberated lifestyle. Most of Tsuji&#x27;s writings describe the philosophy behind this, as well as the personal process Tsuji went through towards this aim. As Hagiwara Kyōjirō (萩原 恭次郎) wrote, “Tsuji chose not to express himself with a pen so much as he chose to express himself through living, as conveyed by his personality. That is, Tsuji himself was his expression&#x27;s piece of work”.

==&quot;Death of an Epicurean&quot;==
One notable play written by Tsuji is the dadaist/absurdist , in which a figure must confront Panta Rhei, or the transient nature of all things. Tsuji saw the concept of Panta Rhei to be related to Stirner&#x27;s Creative Nothing, wherein the nihility of all things provides potential for creativity and change. Tsuji also found this relevant to the Buddhist concept of nothingness.

In &quot;Death of an Epicurean&quot;, Tsuji comments on the destruction of the Ryōunkaku (Cloud-surpassing Tower) in the area of Tokyo he often called home, Asakusa. This building was a skyscraper that had become very much a symbol of modernity in Japan, and its destruction in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake was a harrowing omen to many who saw it as reminiscent of the Tower of Babel. Authors such as Ishikawa Takuboku popularized the building&#x27;s symbolism in literature.

==Censorship and vagabondage==
Tsuji wrote during the 1920s, a dangerous period in Japanese history for controversial writers, during which he experienced the wages of censorship through police harassment. He also experienced this vicariously through the persecution of close associates such as his former wife, anarcha-feminist Itō Noe, who was murdered in the Amakasu Incident.

For being a controversial writer in the heart of Tokyo&#x27;s radical art scene, Tsuji himself believed that had he been living instead as a peasant in the Soviet Union at the time, he would surely have been shot to death.

==Institutionalization, Buddhist renunciation, and death==

In 1932 Tsuji was institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital after what would become popularly known as the &quot;Tengu Incident&quot;. According to some accounts, one night during a party at a friend&#x27;s residence, Tsuji climbed to the second floor and began flapping his arms crying &quot;I am the Tengu!&quot;, eventually jumping from the building, running around, and jumping onto the table calling &quot;kyaaaaaa, kyaaaa!!&quot;

After hospitalization, Tsuji was diagnosed as having experienced a temporary psychosis probably resulting from his chronic alcoholism. During this hospitalization Tsuji came to idealize the Buddhist monk Shinran and read the Tannishō many times over. Thereafter the once prolific Tsuji gave up his writing career, and he returned to his custom of vagabondage in the fashion of a Komusō monk, apparently as a sort of Nekkhamma.

For the next few years Tsuji fell into various incidents with police and was readmitted to mental hospitals several times. At the age of 41 Tsuji suffered a major asthma attack and after hospitalization became weighed down with substantial hospital bills. While book royalties and a sort of provided some economic support, Tsuji was caught up in a harsh late World War II economic environment and spent the last few years of his life in vagabond poverty. Tsuji often made ends meet by going door to door as a busking shakuhachi musician.

However, in 1944, Tsuji settled down in a friend&#x27;s one-bedroom apartment in Tokyo, where he was found dead from starvation.

Tsuji is now buried in Tokyo&#x27;s Saifuku Temple.

==Legacy==
Tsuji is remembered for having helped found Dadaism in Japan along with contemporaries such as Murayama Tomoyoshi, MAVO, Yoshiyuki Eisuke, and Takahashi Shinkichi. Moreover, he was one of the most prominent Japanese contributors to Nihilist philosophy prior to World War II. He is also remembered as the father of prominent Japanese painter, Makoto Tsuji (辻 まこと).

Tsuji was depicted in the 1969 film &quot;Eros + Massacre&quot; and has been the subject of several Japanese books and articles.

<text>The Ego and Its Own (), also known as The Unique and Its Property, is an 1844 work by German philosopher Max Stirner. It presents a post-Hegelian critique of Christianity and traditional morality on one hand; and on the other, humanism, utilitarianism, liberalism, and much of the then-burgeoning socialist movement, advocating instead an amoral (although importantly not inherently immoral or antisocial) egoism. It is considered a major influence on the development of anarchism, existentialism, nihilism, and postmodernism.

In 2010, John F. Welsh coined the term &quot;dialectical egoism&quot; for the thoughts of Stirner expressed in this work, in order to emphasize the distinction from the negative and pejorative connotations from the common everyday use of &quot;egoism&quot; in the sense of egotism.

The discussion that follows is based on the first known English translation, by Steven T. Byington, first published in 1907. A more recent translation by Apio Ludd &quot;aka&quot; Wolfi Landstreicher was published by Underworld Amusements in 2017 under the title &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;, the translator noting that Stirner had not used the word ego.

== Content ==
=== Part One ===
The first part of the text begins by setting out a tripartite dialectical structure based on an individual&#x27;s stages of life (Childhood, Youth and Adulthood). 

In the first &quot;realistic&quot; stage, children are restricted by external material forces. Upon reaching the stage of youth, they begin to learn how to overcome these restrictions by what Stirner calls the &quot;self-discovery of mind&quot;. However, in the &quot;idealistic&quot; stage, a youth now becomes enslaved by internal forces such as conscience, reason and other &quot;spooks&quot; or &quot;fixed ideas&quot; of the mind (including religion, nationalism and other ideologies). The final stage, &quot;egoism&quot;, is the second self-discovery, in which one becomes self-conscious of oneself as more than his mind or body.

Throughout the book, Stirner applies this dialectical structure to human history. Part one is a sustained critique of the first two periods of human history and especially of the failure of the modern world to escape from religious modes of thinking. Stirner&#x27;s analysis is opposed to the belief that modern individuals are progressively more free than their predecessors. Stirner sees moderns as being possessed by ideological forces such as Christianity and the ideologies of the modern nation state.

Stirner&#x27;s critique of modernity is centred on the Protestant Reformation. According to Stirner, Reformation theology extended religious domination over individuals by blurring the distinction between the sensual and the spiritual (thus allowing priests to marry for example). The Reformation also strengthened and intensified religious belief and made it more personal, creating an internal conflict between natural desires and religious conscience. Thus the Reformation only served to further enslave Europeans under spiritual ideology.

Stirner&#x27;s critique of a progressive view of history is part of his attack on the philosophies of the left-Hegelians, especially that of Ludwig Feuerbach. Stirner sees Feuerbach&#x27;s philosophy as merely a continuation of religious ways of thinking. Feuerbach had argued that Christianity was mistaken in taking human qualities and projecting them into a transcendent God. But according to Stirner, Feuerbach&#x27;s philosophy, while rejecting a God, left the Christian qualities intact. Feuerbach had taken a set of human qualities and deified them, making them the only prescriptive view of humanity. This became just another religion for Stirner, a &quot;change of masters&quot; over the individual. Stirner criticizes other left-Hegelians for setting a conception of essential human nature as a goal to be striven for instead of one which is already achieved. So while liberals like Arnold Ruge found the essence of the human in citizenship, and social liberals like Moses Hess found it in labor, all of them made a similar error of ossifying an &quot;essence&quot; of the human and deifying it. For Stirner, &quot;human nature&quot; cannot provide any prescriptions on how one ought to live as one doesn&#x27;t need to become his nature, but instead he already is (&quot;Your nature is, once and for all, a human one; you are human natures, human beings. But, just because you already are so, you do not still need to become so&quot;).

=== Part Two ===
Part two is centered on the possibility of freedom from current ideological ways of thinking through a robust philosophical egoism. Stirner&#x27;s egoism is centered on what he calls &quot;Eigenheit&quot; (&#x27;Ownness&#x27; or autonomy). This &#x27;Ownness&#x27; is a feature of a more advanced stage of human personal and historical development. It is the groundwork for our world-view.

Stirner&#x27;s Egoism is a descriptive psychological egoist, though he differentiates between conscious and involuntary egoism. Stirner does not advocate narrow selfishness of a &quot;sensual man&quot;: 
Selfishness [...] in the Christian sense, means something like this: I look only to see whether anything is of use to me as a sensual man. But is sensuality then the whole of my ownness? Am I in my own senses when I am given up to sensuality?

Stirner&#x27;s conception of Ownness is a type of self-description:
Ownness includes in itself everything own, and brings to honor again what Christian language dishonored. But ownness has not any alien standard either, as it is not in any sense an idea like freedom, morality, humanity, etc.: it is only a description of the — owner.

In Part II, Stirner discards the concept of freedom, as being of limited value, and replaces it with power and property. In Chapter &quot;My Power&quot;, Stirner explores the concept of human rights and their subsequent inherent separation from the self: &quot;The right of &#x27;all&#x27; is to go before my right.&quot;

In the chapter &quot;My Self-Enjoyment&quot; Stirner discusses longing and &quot;true life&quot;, discarding both of them preferring a &quot;non-seeking&quot; man: &quot;Not till I am certain of myself, and no longer seeking for myself, am I really my property; I have myself, therefore I use and enjoy myself.&quot; &quot;A man is &#x27;called&#x27; to nothing, and has no &#x27;calling&#x27;, no &#x27;destiny&#x27;, as little as a plant or a beast has a &#x27;calling&#x27;&quot;. Further he argues that &quot;[t]he true man does not lie in the future, an object of longing, but lies, existent and real, in the present&quot;.

In Part III of Part II, &quot;The Unique One&quot;, Stirner gives a summary of the book and its ideas, and ends it as it began: &quot;all things are nothing to me&quot;.

== Style and structure ==
Stirner repeatedly quotes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Bruno Bauer assuming that readers will be familiar with their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and in-jokes on formulations found in Hegel&#x27;s works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as Ludwig Feuerbach. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.

== Reception and influence ==
Initially, &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; received much attention, though most reviews were negative critiques by left Hegelians such as Ludwig Feuerbach and Moses Hess. Feuerbach&#x27;s critique, &quot;&quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; in Relation to &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;&quot;, called the work &quot;ingenious&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot; but also criticizes it as &quot;eccentric, one-sided and falsely defined&quot;. Stirner responded to these critiques in an 1845 essay titled &quot;Stirner&#x27;s Critics&quot;.

&quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; also had a profound impact on Marx and Engels. In 1844 Engels sent a letter to Marx praising &quot;the noble Stirner&quot; and suggesting that his dialectical egoism can serve as a point of departure for communism: It is certainly true that we must first make a cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it. . . . [W]e are communists out of egoism also, and it is out of egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...

However, Marx and Engels would later collaborate on a lengthy criticism of Stirner&#x27;s book in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1845, published 1932). The critique is a polemical tirade filled with &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks and insults against Stirner (Marx calls him a &quot;petty bourgeois individualist intellectual&quot;).

The argument in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; critiquing &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; is that Stirner&#x27;s central concept is the same kind of &quot;ghost&quot; that Stirner argues does not exist. For Marx and Engels, Stirner&#x27;s &quot;egoism&quot; simply presented a modern religiosity, that according to L. Dallman &quot;stands in a privileged relationship to non-conceptual reality&quot;. Therefore, Marx and Engels derisively and repetitively refer to Stirner as &quot;Saint Max&quot;.

Stirner also had a lasting influence in the tradition of individualist anarchism. American individualist Benjamin R. Tucker, editor of the journal &quot;Liberty&quot;, adopted Stirner&#x27;s egoism in 1886 while rejecting conceptions of natural rights. This led to a bitter split in American individualist anarchism between egoists such as James L. Walker and John Beverly Robinson, and the proponents of natural rights anarchism such as that of Lysander Spooner. Other individualist anarchists influenced by Stirner include Lev Chernyi, Adolf Brand, Renzo Novatore, John Henry Mackay, Enrico Arrigoni, Miguel Giménez Igualada, and Émile Armand.

Although initially influenced by American individualist anarchist, S.E.P. was influenced more by European individualists and eventually by Dora Marsden, which led to him discarding anarchism, as did Dora Marsden some 70 years before him, which would go on to influence others associated with him. Other egoists who rejected anarchism include Stephen Marletta, William J. Boyer, Ragnar Redbeard, Malfew Seklew and Svein Olav Nyberg, among others.

Recently, Stirner has been an influential source for post-left anarchist thinkers such as Jason McQuinn, Bob Black and Hakim Bey.

<doc id="143888" wikidata="Q12372854" url="?curid=143888" title="Perfect fifth">
<text>In music theory, a perfect fifth is the musical interval corresponding to a pair of pitches with a frequency ratio of 3:2, or very nearly so.

In classical music from Western culture, a fifth is the interval from the first to the last of the first five consecutive notes in a diatonic scale. The perfect fifth (often abbreviated P5) spans seven semitones, while the diminished fifth spans six and the augmented fifth spans eight semitones. For example, the interval from C to G is a perfect fifth, as the note G lies seven semitones above C.

The perfect fifth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the second and third harmonics. In a diatonic scale, the dominant note is a perfect fifth above the tonic note.

The perfect fifth is more consonant, or stable, than any other interval except the unison and the octave. It occurs above the root of all major and minor chords (triads) and their extensions. Until the late 19th century, it was often referred to by one of its Greek names, &quot;diapente&quot;. Its inversion is the perfect fourth. The octave of the fifth is the twelfth.

A perfect fifth is at the start of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;; the pitch of the first &quot;twinkle&quot; is the root note and the pitch of the second &quot;twinkle&quot; is a perfect fifth above it.

== Alternative definitions ==

The term &quot;perfect&quot; identifies the perfect fifth as belonging to the group of &quot;perfect intervals&quot; (including the unison, perfect fourth, and octave), so called because of their simple pitch relationships and their high degree of consonance. When an instrument with only twelve notes to an octave (such as the piano) is tuned using Pythagorean tuning, one of the twelve fifths (the wolf fifth) sounds severely discordant and can hardly be qualified as &quot;perfect&quot;, if this term is interpreted as &quot;highly consonant&quot;. However, when using correct enharmonic spelling, the wolf fifth in Pythagorean tuning or meantone temperament is actually not a perfect fifth but a diminished sixth (for instance G–E).

Perfect intervals are also defined as those natural intervals whose inversions are also natural, where natural, as opposed to altered, designates those intervals between a base note and another note in the major diatonic scale starting at that base note (for example, the intervals from C to C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, with no sharps or flats); this definition leads to the perfect intervals being only the unison, fourth, fifth, and octave, without appealing to degrees of consonance.

The term &quot;perfect&quot; has also been used as a synonym of &quot;just&quot;, to distinguish intervals tuned to ratios of small integers from those that are &quot;tempered&quot; or &quot;imperfect&quot; in various other tuning systems, such as equal temperament. The perfect unison has a pitch ratio 1:1, the perfect octave 2:1, the perfect fourth 4:3, and the perfect fifth 3:2.

Within this definition, other intervals may also be called perfect, for example a perfect third (5:4) or a perfect major sixth (5:3).

==Other qualities==

In addition to perfect, there are two other kinds, or qualities, of fifths: the diminished fifth, which is one chromatic semitone smaller, and the augmented fifth, which is one chromatic semitone larger. In terms of semitones, these are equivalent to the tritone (or augmented fourth), and the minor sixth, respectively.

==Pitch ratio==

The justly tuned pitch ratio of a perfect fifth is 3:2 (also known, in early music theory, as a &quot;hemiola&quot;), meaning that the upper note makes three vibrations in the same amount of time that the lower note makes two. The just perfect fifth can be heard when a violin is tuned: if adjacent strings are adjusted to the exact ratio of 3:2, the result is a smooth and consonant sound, and the violin sounds in tune.

Keyboard instruments such as the piano normally use an equal-tempered version of the perfect fifth, enabling the instrument to play in all keys. In 12-tone equal temperament, the frequencies of the tempered perfect fifth are in the ratio formula_1 or approximately 1.498307. An equally tempered perfect fifth, defined as 700 cents, is about two cents narrower than a just perfect fifth, which is approximately 701.955 cents.

Kepler explored musical tuning in terms of integer ratios, and defined a &quot;lower imperfect fifth&quot; as a 40:27 pitch ratio, and a &quot;greater imperfect fifth&quot; as a 243:160 pitch ratio. His lower perfect fifth ratio of 1.48148 (680 cents) is much more &quot;imperfect&quot; than the equal temperament tuning (700 cents) of 1.4983 (relative to the ideal 1.50). Hermann von Helmholtz uses the ratio 301:200 (708 cents) as an example of an imperfect fifth; he contrasts the ratio of a fifth in equal temperament (700 cents) with a &quot;perfect fifth&quot; (3:2), and discusses the audibility of the beats that result from such an &quot;imperfect&quot; tuning.

==Use in harmony==

W. E. Heathcote describes the octave as representing the prime unity within the triad, a higher unity produced from the successive process: &quot;first Octave, then Fifth, then Third, which is the union of the two former&quot;. Hermann von Helmholtz argues that some intervals, namely the perfect fourth, fifth, and octave, &quot;are found in all the musical scales known&quot;, though the editor of the English translation of his book notes the fourth and fifth may be interchangeable or indeterminate.

The perfect fifth is a basic element in the construction of major and minor triads, and their extensions. Because these chords occur frequently in much music, the perfect fifth occurs just as often. However, since many instruments contain a perfect fifth as an overtone, it is not unusual to omit the fifth of a chord (especially in root position).

The perfect fifth is also present in seventh chords as well as &quot;tall tertian&quot; harmonies (harmonies consisting of more than four tones stacked in thirds above the root). The presence of a perfect fifth can in fact soften the dissonant intervals of these chords, as in the major seventh chord in which the dissonance of a major seventh is softened by the presence of two perfect fifths.

Chords can also be built by stacking fifths, yielding quintal harmonies. Such harmonies are present in more modern music, such as the music of Paul Hindemith. This harmony also appears in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; in the &quot;Dance of the Adolescents&quot; where four C trumpets, a piccolo trumpet, and one horn play a five-tone B-flat quintal chord.

==Bare fifth, open fifth, or empty fifth==

A bare fifth, open fifth or empty fifth is a chord containing only a perfect fifth with no third. The closing chords of Pérotin&#x27;s &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; and &quot;Sederunt Principes&quot;, Guillaume de Machaut&#x27;s &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot;, the Kyrie in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, and the first movement of Bruckner&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot; are all examples of pieces ending on an open fifth. These chords are common in Medieval music, sacred harp singing, and throughout rock music. In hard rock, metal, and punk music, overdriven or distorted electric guitar can make thirds sound muddy while the bare fifths remain crisp. In addition, fast chord-based passages are made easier to play by combining the four most common guitar hand shapes into one. Rock musicians refer to them as &quot;power chords&quot;. Power chords often include octave doubling (i.e., their bass note is doubled one octave higher, e.g. F3–C4–F4).

An &quot;empty fifth&quot; is sometimes used in traditional music, e.g., in Asian music and in some Andean music genres of pre-Columbian origin, such as &quot;k&#x27;antu&quot; and &quot;sikuri&quot;. The same melody is being led by parallel fifths and octaves during all the piece.

Western composers may use the interval to give a passage an exotic flavor. Empty fifths are also sometimes used to give a cadence an ambiguous quality, as the bare fifth does not indicate a major or minor tonality.

==Use in tuning and tonal systems==
The just perfect fifth, together with the octave, forms the basis of Pythagorean tuning. A slightly narrowed perfect fifth is likewise the basis for meantone tuning.

The circle of fifths is a model of pitch space for the chromatic scale (chromatic circle), which considers nearness as the number of perfect fifths required to get from one note to another, rather than chromatic adjacency.

<doc id="143890" wikidata="Q1631607" url="?curid=143890" title="SpaceCamp">
<text>SpaceCamp is a 1986 American science fiction adventure film inspired by the U.S. Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama. Directed by Harry Winer, story by Patrick Bailey and Larry B. Williams, screenplay by Clifford Green (as W. W. Wicket) and Casey T. Mitchell, the film stars Kate Capshaw, Kelly Preston, Larry B. Scott, Lea Thompson, Tate Donovan, and Joaquin Phoenix (credited as &quot;Leaf Phoenix&quot;) in his feature film debut.

&quot;SpaceCamp&quot; received mixed reviews and is famous for being a &quot;marketing nightmare,&quot; as it was released less than five months after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident of January 28, 1986 (although filming was completed before the disaster occurred). At the time of release, some thought the movie was trying to capitalize on the shuttle tragedy and should never have been released. However, those associated with &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; disagreed and added they had taken extra care to avoid any appearance of exploiting a national tragedy.

The film performed poorly at the box office, grossing less than $10 million in the US. The script was later adapted into a novel, which did include references to the &quot;Challenger&quot; explosion and some of the kids&#x27; decisions to attend Space Camp in the wake of said tragedy.

== Plot ==
Four teenagers - Kathryn, Kevin, Rudy, and Tish - and 12-year-old Max go to Space Camp at Huntsville, Alabama, for three weeks during the summer to learn about the NASA space program and mimic Astronaut training. They meet their instructor Andie Bergstrom, a NASA-trained astronaut who is frustrated that she has not yet been assigned to a Space Shuttle mission. Her bitterness is compounded by the fact that her husband, camp director Zach Bergstrom, is an astronaut who has walked on the Moon.

Max befriends a robot named Jinx, which was deemed unsuitable for space work because it overheated and was overly literal. Max and the robot declare themselves to be &quot;friends forever&quot;. Kathryn declares her dream to become the first female Shuttle commander, and is frustrated when Andie assigns that role to Kevin instead to teach him responsibility. Kevin pursues Kathryn romantically, Rudy shares his wish to open the first fast food franchise on the Moon and Tish reveals that despite appearing to be a valley girl, she is a genius with a photographic memory.

Kathryn and Kevin sneak away for some romance near the launch pad, but Jinx unintentionally gives them away when Andie and Zach discover they are missing. During a confrontation, Andie explains that she believes Kathryn has what it takes to accomplish her ambition, and explains the necessity of the harsh treatment Andie is giving her. While Kathryn vows to improve her performance, Zach&#x27;s conversation with Kevin is less successful.

Kevin takes out his anger on Max. Upset, Max states &quot;...I wish I was in space&quot;. Jinx overhears and takes what Max said literally. The campers are allowed to sit in the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during a routine engine test. Jinx secretly enters NASA&#x27;s computer room and triggers a &quot;thermal curtain failure&quot;, causing one of the boosters to ignite during the test. In order to avoid a crash, Launch Control is forced to ignite the second booster and launch the Shuttle.

The Shuttle is not flight ready, has no long range radio and insufficient on-board oxygen to last to the re-entry window at Edwards Air Force Base. Andie takes the Shuttle to the partially constructed Space Station &quot;Daedalus&quot; to retrieve oxygen stored there. Realizing that while they have no voice communications with NASA they do have telemetry, Tish begins using a switch to send a morse code signal to NASA, but it is not noticed by ground control.

Andie is slightly too big to reach the oxygen cylinders, so Max suits up for an EVA. During a critical moment, Max begins to panic until Kevin, knowing that Max is a fan of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, begins calling him &quot;Luke&quot;, and tells him to &quot;use the Force&quot;, which calms him enough to complete the mission, allowing Max and Andie to retrieve the containers.

In the Shuttle, Rudy attempts to decipher the technical schematics to work out how to feed the oxygen into the Shuttle&#x27;s tanks. His lack of confidence combined with the time pressure frustrates Kathryn, who tries reading the diagram herself and gives Andie instructions that conflict with Rudy&#x27;s. Andie follows Rudy&#x27;s correct instructions. Kathryn&#x27;s self-confidence is shaken as she realizes her interference nearly caused disaster.

The second oxygen tank malfunctions, injuring Andie. Unaware of this, Ground Control begins the autopilot sequence to land the Shuttle – closing the bay doors and stranding Andie outside. Andie regains consciousness and urges them to leave her and take the re-entry window, as the Shuttle does not have enough oxygen to make the next window. Kathryn is unable to make a decision, but Kevin shows himself to be the Shuttle Commander and overrides the autopilot, enabling Max to rescue Andie. Having missed the Edwards re-entry window, the crew comes up with a plan to land at White Sands, New Mexico, after Rudy recalls the 1982 Space Shuttle mission that landed there. Armed with this news, Tish uses Morse Code to signal NASA to let them land there.

At Ground Control, Jinx brings the signal to Zach&#x27;s attention and they prepare for the White Sands landing. With Andie injured, Kathryn fulfils her role as Shuttle Pilot, but frets and doubts her abilities until Kevin cajoles and teases her into guiding &quot;Atlantis&quot; through re-entry and landing it at White Sands.

== Cast ==
* Kate Capshaw as Andie Bergstrom, a camp instructor and astronaut.
* Tom Skerritt as Zach Bergstrom, the camp director, &quot;flown&quot; astronaut, and Andie&#x27;s husband.
* Lea Thompson as Kathryn Fairly, who idolizes Andie and wants to be the first female shuttle commander. However, she is assigned the pilot role.
* Tate Donovan as Kevin Donaldson. Kevin is initially arrogant and selfish until Andie assigns him the role of Commander to teach him responsibility, much to Kathryn&#x27;s dismay.
* Larry B. Scott as Rudy Tyler. Rudy loves science, but admits he is sometimes not very good at it.
* Kelly Preston as Tish Ambrosé. In many ways a typical valley girl teenager, Tish is also highly intelligent and has an eidetic memory.
* Leaf Phoenix as Max Graham, an eager 12-year-old boy who has been to Junior Camp twice, whom Andie finally allows to stay at the main camp. He frequently makes references to &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
* Frank Welker as the voice of Jinx, a sentient robot who befriends Max. Jinx facilitates the group&#x27;s launch into space and then helps rescue them by discovering Tish&#x27;s telemetry in Morse code. Jinx takes everything literally.

== Production ==
The film was made in the summer of 1985 and was the last film made by ABC Motion Pictures which was closed down in October 1985.

The film was the feature film directorial debut of Harry Winer.

Lea Thompson mentioned in an interview that after their first day of shooting, they were ten days behind schedule and what was supposed to be a three-month shoot became six. She also mentioned that &quot;We had T-shirts printed up that said, &quot;&#x27;SpaceCamp&quot;: It&#x27;s Not Just A Movie, It&#x27;s A Career.&#x27; Oh, actually, instead of &quot;SpaceCamp&quot;, it said &quot;SpaceCramp&quot;.&quot;

=== Music ===
==Release==
&quot;SpaceCamp&quot; was released in theaters on June 6, 1986.

===Home media===
It was released on DVD on September 25, 2001 and later re-released in 2006. On September 26, 2017, Kino Classics released the film on Blu-Ray.

== Reception ==
&quot;SpaceCamp&quot; received mixed reviews with 53% of critics giving it positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. Critic Roger Ebert gave it a one and half star rating, saying that &quot;Our thoughts about the Space Shuttle will never be the same again, and our memories are so painful that &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; is doomed even before it begins.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; says that &quot;&quot;SpaceCamp&quot; never successfully integrates summer camp hijinks with outer space idealism to come up with a dramatically compelling story&quot;, while James Sanford of the &quot;Kalamazoo Gazette&quot; responds &quot;Not exactly out of this world&quot;.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Lea Thompson mentioned that &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of people come up to me and say that they became physicists or inventors, how much they loved that movie and how much it inspired them.&quot;

In 2016, in honor of the 30th anniversary of &quot;SpaceCamp&quot;&#x27;s release, U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center inducted the film’s cast into the Space Camp Hall of Fame.

== Remake ==
In January 2020, Disney announced that a remake was in the works for their streaming service, Disney+. Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell have signed on to write the script and it will be produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

<text>A jiāngshī (), also known as a Chinese hopping [[vampire]], is a type of undead creature or reanimated corpse in Chinese legends and folklore. Due to the influence of Hong Kong cinema, it is typically depicted in modern popular culture as a stiff corpse dressed in official garments from the Qing dynasty. Although the pronunciation of jiangshi varies in different East Asian countries, all of them refer to the Chinese version of vampire.

In popular culture, it is commonly represented as hopping or leaping. In folkloric accounts, however, it is more formidable, capable of giving chase by running, and if sufficiently ancient or if it has absorbed sufficient yang energy, capable also of flight. According to folkloric understandings, &quot;jiāngshī” came from the hills, soaring through the air, to devour the infants of the people&quot;.

In both popular culture and folklore, it is either represented as anthropophagous (i.e. man-eating), therefore resembling Slavic vampires, or as killing living creatures by absorbing their &quot;qi&quot;, or &quot;life force&quot;. It is usually not represented as blood-sucking, as in the West European conception. During the day, it rests in a coffin or hides in dark places such as caves and forests.

De Groot suggests that the belief in jiangshi was the result of the natural horror at the sight of dead bodies, nourished by the presence of unburied corpses in the imperial China, which &quot;studded the landscape&quot;, the idea of the vital energy flowing through the universe as capable of animating objects - including exposed corpses, and by severe cultural taboos concerning postponement of burial. These fears are described as having preoccupied &quot;credulous and superstitious minds in Amoy&quot;.

The belief in jiangshi and its representation in the popular imagination was also partly derived from the habit of &quot;corpse-driving&quot;, a practice involving the repatriation of the corpses of dead laborers across Xiang province (present-day Hunan) to their hometowns for burial in family gravesites. The corpses were trussed up against bamboo sticks and carried by professionals known as corpse-drivers and transported over thousands of miles to their ancestral villages, which gave the impression of a hopping corpse. These professionals operated during the night to avoid crowds during the day, which served to amplify the fearful effects of their trade.

Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and the rest of East Asia. Movies such as &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; and its various spin-offs &quot;Mr. Vampire II&quot;, &quot;Mr. Vampire III&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Vampire IV&quot; became cult classics in comedy-horror and inspired a vampire craze in East Asia, including Taiwan and Japan. Today, jiangshi appear in toys and video games. Jiangshi costumes are also sometimes employed during Halloween.

==Origins==
The Qing dynasty scholar Ji Xiaolan mentioned in his book &quot;Yuewei Caotang Biji&quot; () (c. 1789 – 1798) (&quot;The Shadow Book of Ji Yun&quot;, Empress Wu Books, 2021) that the causes for a corpse to be reanimated can be classified in either of two categories: a recently deceased person returning to life, or a corpse that has been buried for a long time but does not decompose.

Some causes are described below:

* The use of supernatural arts to resurrect the dead
* Spirit possession of a dead body.
* A corpse absorbs sufficient yang &quot;qi&quot; (positive energy) to return to life.
* When the lower parts of the person&#x27;s soul remain in the body to assume control after death. Traditional Chinese thought posits that a person&#x27;s body is governed by three &quot;huns&quot; and seven &quot;pos&quot;. The Qing dynasty scholar Yuan Mei wrote in his book &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot; that &quot;A person&#x27;s &quot;hun&quot; is good but the &quot;po&quot; is evil, the &quot;hun&quot; is intelligent but the &quot;po&quot; is not so good&quot;. When the &quot;hun&quot; leaves his/her body after death but their &quot;po soul&quot; remains and takes control of the body, the dead person becomes a jiangshi.
* When the dead person is not buried even after a funeral has been held. The corpse comes to life after it is struck by a bolt of lightning, or when a pregnant cat (or a black cat in some tales) leaps across the coffin.
* When a person&#x27;s soul fails to leave their deceased body, due to improper death, suicide, or that person just wanting to cause trouble.
* A person injured by a jiangshi is infected with the &quot;jiangshi poison&quot; and gradually changes into a jiangshi over time, as seen in the &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; films.

==Appearance and attributes==
In both folklore and popular culture, the appearance of a jiangshi can range from that of a recently deceased person in a state of rigor mortis to that of horribly decayed and rotting corpse. The jiangshi always lacks the suppleness that characterized a living person or even a West European vampire. The Chinese character for &quot;jiang&quot; () in &quot;jiangshi&quot; literally means &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;stiff&quot;.

=== Folklore ===
Jiangshi are described as having greenish-white skin, possibly deriving from fungus or mould growing on corpses. They have long hair and may behave like animals. They are ferocious, ravenous beings possessing extreme strength, being described as attacking men with &quot;brute force and clumsy violence&quot;. It is often represented as being capable of giving chase by running, of dodging, and sometimes by flying - &quot;a jiangshi came from the hills, soaring through the air, to devour the infants of the people&quot;.

==Methods and items used to counter jiangshi==
* Mirrors: Li Shizhen&#x27;s medical book &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; mentions, &quot;A mirror is the essence of liquid metal. It is dark on the external but bright inside.&quot; () Jiangshi are also said to be terrified of their own reflections.
* Items made of wood from a peach tree: The &quot;Jingchu Suishi Ji&quot; () mentioned, &quot;Peach is the essence of the Five Elements. It can subjugate evil auras and deter evil spirits.&quot; ()
* A rooster&#x27;s call: Yuan Mei&#x27;s book &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot; mentions, &quot;Evil spirits withdraw when they hear a rooster&#x27;s call&quot; (), because the rooster&#x27;s call usually occurs with the rise of the sun.
* Jujube seeds: &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot; mentions, &quot;Nail seven jujube seeds into the acupuncture points on the back of a corpse.&quot; ()
* Fire: &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot; mentions, &quot;When set on fire, the sound of crackling flames, blood rushes forth and bones cry.&quot; ()
* Hooves of a black donkey: Mentioned in Zhang Muye&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Ghost Blows Out the Light&quot;
* Vinegar: Mentioned by coroners in eastern Fujian.
* &quot;Fulu&quot; (Taoist talisman), stuck on the forehead to immobilise them whilst it is firmly stuck on. With a unique spell, it can be used to transport the creatures with the handbell.
* Holding one&#x27;s breath, which makes the jiangshi unable to find you as they are blind, though this contradicts the earlier statement that they are afraid of their own reflection.
* Ba gua sign
* &quot;I Ching&quot;
* &quot;Tong Shu&quot;
* Glutinous rice, rice chaff
* Adzuki beans
* Handbell
* Thread stained with a concoction of black ink, chicken blood and burnt talisman
* Blood of a black dog
* Stonemason&#x27;s awl
* Axe
* Broom
* Dropping a bag of coins can cause the jiangshi to count the coins.
On &quot;eHow.com&quot;, there was a list of five methods:
*To subdue a hopping vampire the person must take a thin yellow piece of paper and write out a distinct spell in chicken&#x27;s blood, which will then be attached to the vampire&#x27;s forehead.
*A person defending themselves against a hopping vampire/zombie can use an 8 sided mirror called Ba-qua mirror, which is often used in Feng Shui. The mirrors purpose is to reflect the light, which in turn scares the creature away. 
*A sword charged under the light of the moon made of Chinese coins can be used in an attack against the vampire.
*To stop a hopping vampire (zombie) in its place, take a small amount of blood and place it on the creature&#x27;s forehead.
* To banish the hopping vampire, a person can throw sticky rice at the creature drawing out the evil in it.
Architectural features

It is also the conventional belief of feng shui practitioners in Chinese architecture that a threshold (), a piece of wood approximately 15 cm (6 in) high, be installed along the width of the door at the bottom to prevent a jiangshi from entering the household.

==Origin stories==
=== Taboos regarding unburied dead ===
De Groot observes that unburied corpses studded the landscape of imperial China, causing great fear and nourishing &quot;an inveterate belief in these specters&quot;. Furthermore, it was supposed that corpses, if left unburied and exposed to the sun and moon so as to absorb the vital energy permeating the universe, could reanimate as ravening jiangshi. The notion that corpses are prone to becoming jiangshi when their burial is long-postponed would have motivated the populace to quickly bury the dead in their midst.

=== Corpse-driving in Western Hunan ===
A supposed source of the jiangshi stories came from the folk practice of &quot;transporting a corpse over a thousand &quot;li&quot;&quot; (). This was also known as &quot;driving corpses in Xiangxi&quot; ().

During the Qing dynasty, laborers from all over China often engaged in difficult construction work in the backwaters of western Hunan (Xiangxi), and the mortality rates were high. The Chinese preferred to be buried alongside family, partly due to the belief that their souls might feel homesick if they were buried far from home, so an industry for the transportation of these corpses to their native villages, often across thousands of miles, soon developed. The corpses would be arranged upright in single file and be tied to long bamboo rods on the sides, while two men (one at the front and one at the back) would carry the ends of the rods on their shoulders and walk. When the bamboo flexed up and down, the corpses appeared to be &quot;hopping&quot; in unison when viewed from a distance away.

Two oral accounts of transporting corpses are included in Liao Yiwu&#x27;s &quot;The Corpse Walker&quot;. One account describes how corpses would be transported by a two-man team. One would carry the corpse on his back with a large robe covering both of them and a mourning mask on top. The other man would walk ahead with a lantern and warn his companion about obstacles ahead of him. The lantern was used as a visual guide for the corpse carrier to follow since they could not see with the robe covering them. It is speculated in the accounts in the book that corpses would be carried at night to avoid contact with people and the cooler air would be more suitable to transporting bodies.

=== Myth and legend ===
Actual corpse-driving using manual labor gave rise to legends and rumors of the use of Taoist sorcery to transport dead bodies. According to these tales, the relatives of a person who died far away from home could not afford vehicles to have the deceased person&#x27;s body transported home for burial, so they would hire a Taoist priest to conduct a ritual to reanimate the dead person and teach him/her to &quot;hop&quot; their way home. The priests would transport the corpses only at night and would ring bells to notify others in the vicinity of their presence because it was considered bad luck for a living person to set eyes upon a &quot;jiang shi&quot;.

Some speculate that the stories about &quot;jiang shi&quot; were originally made up by smugglers who disguised their illegal activities as corpse transportation and wanted to scare off law enforcement officers.

==Similar folklore==
Archaeologists have found revenant and what appear to be deviant burials dating back to 4500–3800 BC in Cyprus. Those born as illegitimate children, with abnormalities, or on inauspicious days, or who were victims of murder, drowning, suicide, curses, or the Black Death were thought to have had the potential to be a vampire. A suspected vampire would be incinerated or dismembered to prevent their return. Other preventive methods included deep buried burial, prone burials, and tying, staking, or pinning corpses with stones. These types of burials have been discovered in numerous locations, including Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Slavic folklore references vampires and preventions dating back to the 11th century with Drawsko, Poland being home to some of these burial sites and early discoveries of such practices. The three primary areas of focus upon burial to prevent vampirism were the mouth, the hands, and the feet, as the mouth is used for feeding, the hands are used for grasping victims, and the feet are used for movement. Folklore and burial practices dealing with revenants can also be traced back to Norse mythology with draugr or draug(s) that closely resemble stories of jiangshis. These draugr were also re-animated corpses that rose from their graves, and many of the various accounts report the draugr to be sighted far from its initial burial site.

== Popular culture ==
In popular culture, such as in jiangshi movies, jiangshi have a standard appearance. They have a paper talisman (&quot;fulu&quot;, with a sealing spell) attached onto and hanging off the forehead in portrait orientation, and wear a uniform coat-like robe and round-top tall rimmed hat characteristic of a mandarin (Chinese official from during the Qing dynasty). The influence of western vampire stories brought the blood-sucking aspect to the Chinese myth in more modern times in combination with the concept of the hungry ghost, though traditionally they feed solely on the &quot;qi&quot; of a living individual for sustenance and in order to grow more powerful. Some claim that their modern visual depiction as horrific Qing officials may have been derived by the anti-Manchu or anti-Qing sentiments of the Han Chinese population during the Qing dynasty, as the officials were viewed as bloodthirsty creatures with little regard for humanity, although the plausibility of this claim is affected by the lapse of time between the modern depiction and the end of the Qing empire.

=== Literature ===
=== Cinema and popular culture ===
Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and the rest of East Asia. Movies such as &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; and its various spin-offs &quot;Mr. Vampire II&quot;, &quot;Mr. Vampire III&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Vampire IV&quot; became cult classics in comedy-horror and inspired a short-lived vampire craze in East Asia, including Taiwan and Japan. The craze subsided quickly by the mid-1990s but enjoyed a brief resurgence in the early 2000s. Attempts to experiment with the genre by producing pure horror movies, such as Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;The Era of Vampires&quot; without the comic elements, have met with criticism and lacked the same popularity.

Today, jiangshi appear in toys and video games, such as Hsien-Ko from Darkstalkers, Qiqi in &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, Chiaotzu in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, and Yoshika Miyako from &quot;Touhou Project&quot;. Jiangshi costumes are also sometimes employed during Halloween.

<text>The Humber is a large tidal estuary on the east coast of Northern England. It is formed at Trent Falls, Faxfleet, by the confluence of the tidal rivers Ouse and Trent. From there to the North Sea, it forms part of the boundary between the East Riding of Yorkshire on the north bank and North Lincolnshire on the south bank. Also known as the River Humber, it is tidal its entire length. 

Below Trent Falls, the Humber passes the junction with the Market Weighton Canal on the north shore, the confluence of the River Ancholme on the south shore; between North Ferriby and South Ferriby and under the Humber Bridge; between Barton-upon-Humber on the south bank and Kingston upon Hull on the north bank (where the River Hull joins), then meets the North Sea between Cleethorpes on the Lincolnshire side and the long and thin headland of Spurn Head to the north.

Ports on the Humber include the Port of Hull, the Port of Grimsby and the Port of Immingham; there are lesser ports at New Holland and North Killingholme Haven. The estuary is navigable for the largest of deep-sea vessels. Inland connections for smaller craft are extensive but handle only a quarter of the goods traffic handled in the Thames.

==Names==
There are numerous theories for how the hydronym of &quot;Humber&quot; is derived from Celtic or Pre-Celtic languages. For example, it may be a Brittonic formation containing &quot;-[a]mb-ṛ&quot;, a variant of the element &quot;*amb&quot; meaning &quot;moisture&quot;, with the prefix &quot;*hu-&quot; meaning &quot;good, well&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;hy-&quot;, in &quot;Hywel&quot;, etc).

The first element may also be &quot;*hū-&quot;, with connotations of &quot;seethe, boil, soak&quot;, of which a variant forms the name of the adjoining River Hull.

The estuary appears in some Latin sources as (A name used by Edmund Spenser in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;). This is possibly a Latinisation of the Celtic form (Welsh for river mouth or estuary) but is erroneously given as a name for both the Humber and The Ouse as one continuous watercourse. Both and may record an older Indo-European word for water or river, (as in the &#x27;Five Rivers&#x27; of the Punjab). An alternative derivation may be from the Latin verb meaning &quot;to hide, to conceal&quot;. The successive name &quot;Humbre&quot;/&quot;Humbri&quot;/&quot;Umbri&quot; may continue the meaning via the Latin verb also meaning &quot;to cover with shadows&quot;.

==Geography==

Although it is now an estuary its entire length, the Humber had a much longer freshwater course during the Ice Age, extending across Doggerland, which is now submerged beneath the North Sea.

==History==
The Humber features regularly in medieval British literature. In the Welsh Triads, the Humber is (together with the Thames and the River Severn) one of the three principal rivers of Britain, and is continually mentioned throughout the Brut y Brenhinedd as a boundary between the southern kingdom (Lloegyr) and various northern kingdoms. In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th-century historically unreliable chronicle (), the Humber is named for &quot;Humber the Hun&quot;, an invader who drowned there during battle in the earliest days of the chronicle.

The Humber remained an important boundary throughout the Anglo-Saxon period, separating Northumbria from the southern kingdoms. The name &quot;Northumbria&quot; derives from the Anglo-Saxon (plural) = &quot;the people north of the Humber&quot;.

The Humber is recorded with the abbreviation &quot;Fl. Abi&quot; (The Abus river, ) in Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia, discharging into the German Ocean (the North Sea) south of Ocelum Promontorium (Spurn Head). Ptolemy also gives the Iron Age tribes of the area as the Coritani south of the Humber and the Parisi to the north.

In the 1719 novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Crusoe leaves England on a ship departing from The Humber.

On 23 August 1921, the British airship R38 crashed into the estuary near Hull, killing 44 of the 49 crew on board.

From 1974 to 1996, the areas now known as the East Riding of Yorkshire, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire constituted the county of Humberside. The Humber, from 1996, forms a boundary between the East Riding of Yorkshire (to the north) and North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire, to the south.

==Fortifications==
The Humber Forts were built in the mouth of the estuary for the First World War. Planned in 1914, their construction started in 1915 and they were not completed until 1919. A coastal battery at Easington, &quot;Fort Goodwin&quot; or &quot;Kilnsea Battery&quot;, faced the Bull Sands Fort. They were also garrisoned during the Second World War, and were finally abandoned for military use in 1956.

Fort Paull is further upstream, a Napoleonic-era emplacement replaced in the early 20th century by &quot;Stallingborough Battery&quot; opposite Sunk Island.

==Crossings==
The Humber Bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world from its construction in 1981 until 1998. It is now the twelfth longest.

Before the bridge was built, a series of paddle steamers operated from the Corporation Pier railway station at the Victoria Pier in Hull to the railway pier in New Holland. Steam ferries started in 1841, and in 1848 were purchased by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. They, and their successors, ran the ferry until the bridge opened in 1981. Railway passenger and car traffic continued to use the pier until the end of ferry operations.

The line of the bridge is similar to an ancient ferry route from Hessle to Barton upon Humber, which is noted in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and in a charter of 1281. The ferry was recorded as still operating in 1856, into the railway era. The Humber was then across.

===Foot===
Graham Boanas, a Hull man, is believed to be the first man to succeed in wading across the Humber since ancient Roman times. The feat in August 2005 was attempted to raise cash and awareness for the medical research charity, DebRA. He started his trek on the north bank at Brough; four hours later, he emerged on the south bank at Whitton. He is tall and took advantage of a very low tide. He replicated this achievement on the television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; (Series 10 Episode 6) when he beat James May who drove an Alfa Romeo 159 around the inland part of the estuary in a race without using the Humber Bridge.

=== Swimming===
On Saturday 26 August 1911, Alice Maud Boyall became the first recorded woman to swim the Humber. Boyall, then aged 19 and living in Hull, was the Yorkshire swimming champion. She crossed the Humber from Hull to New Holland Pier swimming the distance in 50 minutes, 6 minutes slower than the existing men&#x27;s record.

Since 2011, Warners Health have organised the &#x27;Warners Health Humber Charity Business Swim&#x27;. Twelve swimmers from companies across the Yorkshire region train and swim in an ellipse from the south bank to the north bank of the estuary under the Humber Bridge over a total distance of approximately . Since then, an organised group crossing at the Humber Bridge has become an annual event, with a small number of pre-selected swimmers crossing in a &#x27;pod&#x27; which remains close together, in aid of Humber Rescue.

In 2019, Hull-based competitive open water swimmer Richard Royal became the first person to attempt and complete a two-way swim across the estuary, beginning and finishing at Hessle foreshore, with Barton on the south bank as the mid-way point, fulfilling the land-to-land criteria, covering a total of . Royal holds the record for the fastest one-way swim across the Humber (35 minutes 11 seconds) and the fastest two-way swim (1 hour, 13 minutes, 46 seconds), certified by Guinness World Records and the World Open Water Swimming Association. He raised over £900 for Humber Rescue, who provided safety support during the swim.

==Ecology==
The Humber is home both to resident fish and those returning from the sea to their spawning grounds in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. Salmon, sole, cod, eel, flounder, plaice, sprat, lamprey and sand goby have all been caught within the estuary. It is also used by over-wintering birds, is a good breeding ground for bitterns, marsh harriers, little terns and avocets, and forms part of the Severn-Trent flyway, a route used by migratory birds to cross Great Britain.

In 2019 the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and the University of Hull re-introduced the river oyster into the Humber after a sixty-year absence.
