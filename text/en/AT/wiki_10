<text>Kelso is a city in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Washington and is the county seat of Cowlitz County. At the 2020 census, the population was 12,720. Kelso is part of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan statistical area, which has a population of 110,730. Kelso shares its long western border with Longview. It is near Mount St. Helens.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of Kelso were Native Americans from the Cowlitz tribe. The Cowlitz people were separated into the Upper (or Taidnapam) and Lower (or Mountain) Cowlitz tribes, who were members of the Sahaptin and Salish language families, respectively. In 1855, European explorers noted that there numbered over 6,000 individuals of the Cowlitz Tribe.

Kelso was founded by Peter W. Crawford, a Scottish surveyor, who, in 1847, took up the first donation land claim on the lower Cowlitz River. Crawford platted a townsite which he named after his home town of Kelso, Scotland. The original plat was dated and filed in October 1884. It became incorporated in 1889.

In its early days, Kelso obtained the nickname &quot;Little Chicago&quot; as it became famous for its large number of taverns and brothels that catered to local loggers. On weekends, trainloads of loggers would come into town from the surrounding region looking for women, liquor, gambling and fights. The FBI finally forced the mayor to shut them down in the 1950s, with the last tavern/brothel closing in the mid-1960s. The economy continues to be based largely on wood products.

In the late 19th century and into the first part of the 20th century, Kelso was the center for commercial smelt fishing on the Cowlitz River. In 1910, according to the Oregonian Newspaper, 5,000 tons of fish were caught. The Kelso Chamber of Commerce created the slogan in 1956 and became known as the Smelt Capital of the World. The Cowlitz River has historically had heavy runs of smelt and were shipped to markets around the country. Smelt numbers have declined significantly in the past several decades possibly due to overharvesting, global climate change and habitat loss.

The Allen Street Bridge disaster occurred on January 3, 1923 in Kelso. , the event is recognized as the deadliest bridge disaster in the state. The wooden drawbridge collapsed under a combination of high, rushing waters of the Cowlitz River, a log jam, and the poor condition of the overpass. The disaster happened during the end of work day, and 17 people were formally listed as having died due to the event.

Pieces of the mysterious 1947 Maury Island incident took place in Kelso. A military aircraft carrying suspicious slag-like material, supposedly from a UFO, crashed in southeast Kelso.

On May 18, 1980, being only away, Kelso residents experienced the shock wave caused by the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Called the largest volcanic eruption in historic times in the contiguous United States, Kelso received large amounts of volcanic ash through the air and from the massive mudflow caused by the eruption transported by the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers. Many areas of the city, including the Three Rivers Golf Course are built on volcanic ash dredged from the Cowlitz River by inmates in state custody and volunteers.

In March 1998, the Aldercrest-Banyon landslide began shifting the foundations of 64 homes and local infrastructure in the east Kelso neighborhood of Aldercrest. Eventually, 129 houses were destroyed by this slow-moving landslide. Investigation showed that these houses had been built on top of an ancient active landslide area, and three straight years of higher-than-average rains set the earth into motion.
In October 1998, President Bill Clinton declared this slide a federal disaster. It was the second worst landslide disaster (in cost) in the United States, following the 1956 Portuguese Bend Landslide on Palos Verdes Hills in Southern California. This disaster at Aldercrest led to stricter city zoning ordinances and oversight over geological surveys.

<text>Longview is a city in Cowlitz County, Washington, United States. It is the principal city of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Cowlitz County. Longview&#x27;s population was 37,818 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the most populous city in Cowlitz County. The city is located in southwestern Washington, at the junction of the Cowlitz and Columbia rivers. Longview shares a border with Kelso to the east, which is the county seat.

The Cowlitz Indian Tribe, a federally recognized tribe of Cowlitz people, is headquartered in Longview.

The Long-Bell Lumber Company, led by Robert A. Long, decided to buy a great expanse of timberland in Cowlitz County in 1918. A total of 14,000 workers were needed to run the two large mills as well as lumber camps that were planned. The number of workers needed was more than a lumber town, or the nearest town, could provide. Long planned and built a complete city in 1921 that could support a population of up to 50,000 and provide labor for the mills as well as attracting other industries. Several buildings in the city were built from Long&#x27;s private funds.

==History==

Longview was the location of Mount Coffin, an ancestral burial ground for the local indigenous people.

The first Euro-American settlers were led by Harry and Rebecca Jane Huntington, in 1849. The area was named Monticello in honor of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home in Virginia. In 1852 a group assembled in what would be called the &quot;Monticello Convention&quot; to petition Congress for statehood to be called &quot;Columbia&quot;. Congress agreed to statehood but as Washington, after President Washington, to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia. A monument to the convention is located near the Longview Civic Center. From 1854 to 1865 the town of Monticello was the seat of Cowlitz County, before being destroyed by the flooding of the Cowlitz River in December 1867. In 1865 Nathaniel Stone founded the town of Freeport (a mile upriver from Monticello) which became the seat of Cowlitz County until 1872. The area of the towns of Monticello and Freeport is now part of the city of Longview.

The area remained sparsely populated for nearly 60 years, consisting mostly of farmland and wilderness. In 1918, Missouri timber baron Robert A. Long (1850–1934) decided to move his operation out to the west coast, owing to the Long-Bell Lumber Company&#x27;s dwindling supplies in the south. By 1921, Wesley Vandercook had decided to build a mill near the small town of Kelso, Washington. It was apparent that Kelso, with a population of barely 2,000, would not be able to support the approximately 14,000 men that would be required to run the mill.

The Long-Bell company contracted with George Kessler, a city planner based in St. Louis, to build the city that would support the two mills that were now planned. Kessler designed the town based on the nation&#x27;s capital, with elements of Roman City planning. Its theme is rooted in the City Beautiful movement, which influenced urban design in the early 20th century. Longview was officially incorporated on February 14, 1924. At the time of its conception, Longview was the only planned city of its magnitude to have ever been conceived of and built entirely with private funds. A number of prominent buildings in Longview were purchased with R. A. Long&#x27;s personal funds, including R. A. Long High School, the Longview Public Library, the YMCA building and the Monticello Hotel.
The initial growth period, lasting from 1923 to 1934, was very rapid. The city grew from a few thousand people to being the fourth largest city in the state by the 1930s. However, the effects of the Great Depression hampered further development of the planned city until the booming World War II economy, when the Port of Longview became a strategic location for loading cargo going into the Pacific Theater.

The Allen Street Bridge disaster, which involved a wooden drawbridge connecting Longview and Kelso, occurred on January 3, 1923. , the event is recognized as the deadliest bridge disaster in the state. The span collapsed under a combination of high, rushing waters of the Cowlitz River, a log jam, and the poor condition of the overpass. The disaster happened during the end of work day, and 17 people were formally listed as having died due to the event.

Suburban developments created neighborhoods in the western valley in the 1960s. The local economy has been in decline since lumber companies mechanized production in the 1970s and 1980s, reducing the availability of jobs. No major development occurred until a brief boom in the early 2000s, ended by the recession of the late 2000s.

Recently, an initiative from local activists has pushed to implement a new strategic plan to increase development in the city, in an effort to expand affordable housing.

==Government==
The city has seven council members with one serving as the mayor as well as a city manager.
The city council elects a mayor out of themselves every two years. The mayor runs the council meetings, and serves as the ceremonial figure head of the city. Day-to-day operations are conducted by the City Manager, who is hired by the city council.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Lewis and Clark Bridge spans the Columbia River, linking Longview to Rainier, Oregon. It is the only bridge spanning the river between Portland and Astoria, Oregon.

===Climate===
Longview is located in a small gorge, so its climate varies from that of its close neighbor, Portland. Longview is generally about cooler than Portland. Located about inland across a stretch of relatively flat ground, the Longview skies can be overcast due to moisture from the Pacific Coast marine layer. The Columbia River gorge permits an exchange of air between eastern and western Washington. The direction and speed of air movement through the gorge is determined primarily by the pressure gradient between the eastern and western slopes of the mountains. Due to the gorge-like effect, marine pushes on summer evenings can frequently reach gusts up to There have been gusts of up to , and over at higher elevations.

Fall is usually cooler but foggy; on some days the fog never clears. By early-to-mid November, rainfall begins in typical Northwest fashion. Winter tends to be chilly and rainy, with occasional violent windstorms or spates of unusually warm——temperatures. This is due to extremely warm air coming from the Pineapple Express which can drop of rain in a matter of days. Each year there are one or two snowfalls, typically less than but up to in the surrounding foothills. Spring is warmer, but still a little wet; this is the most common time for the occasional thunderstorms.

<doc id="137893" wikidata="Q988279" url="?curid=137893" title="East Wenatchee, Washington">
<text>East Wenatchee is a city in Douglas County, Washington, United States. The population at the 2010 census was 13,190, a 129.1% increase on the 2000 census, having annexed much of the East Wenatchee Bench CDP. As of the 2020 census, the population increased to 14,158.

East Wenatchee lies on the east shore of the Columbia River, opposite Wenatchee on the west shore. On November 10, 2002, East Wenatchee was designated a principal city of the Wenatchee – East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area by the Office of Management and Budget.

==History==
===Founding and early years===

At the turn of the 20th century irrigation projects, including the Columbia Basin Project east of the region, fostered the development of intensive agriculture in the shrub-steppe native to the region. Fruit orchards become one of the area&#x27;s leading industries.

In 1908, the first highway bridge to span the Columbia River opened. The privately owned bridge carried people, horses, wagons, and automobiles; it also supported two large water pipelines along its sides. It connected Chelan County on the west (Wenatchee) shore with Douglas County on the East Wenatchee shore. The bridge opened East Wenatchee and the rest of Douglas County to apple orchard development. Still standing today, the bridge is a pin-connected steel cantilever bridge and cost $177,000 to build. It once carried the Sunset Highway (State Highway 2) across the river.

The bridge was the brainchild of W. T. Clark, one of the builders of the Highline Canal, a major irrigation project to water the apple orchards in the valley. It was financed in part by James J. Hill (1838–1916), of the Great Northern Railway (which arrived in Wenatchee in 1892). In its second year of operation the canal firm that owned it decided to start charging tolls.

This prompted local leaders to hasten to the state legislature to persuade the state to purchase the bridge as part of the state highway system. The state purchased the bridge despite the state-employed consultant&#x27;s opinion &quot;that the ugliness of the structure is very apparent&quot; (Dorpat), despite defects in the timber floor and concrete piers, and despite leaks in the waterpipes.

The structure remained in full use until 1950 when the Senator George Sellar Bridge was built. Today, it remains as a footbridge on the Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail and still has the old pipeline running across it.

===Incorporation and growth===

On February 28, 1935, citizens voted, 48 in favor and 46 against, to incorporate the town of East Wenatchee. When the town was incorporated on March 11, 1935, the original town site was . Through subsequent annexations, the town has grown into a city. Today, East Wenatchee&#x27;s boundaries encompass . From its foundation in agriculture, the region&#x27;s economy has diversified to include year-round tourism and a variety of other industries.

===Landing of first trans-pacific airplane flight===

On October 5, 1931, East Wenatchee became part of aviation history. Having taken off from Misawa, Japan, pilots Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon Jr. safely belly-landed their Bellanca airplane, &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;, on a nearby airstrip known then as Fancher Field. After take off, the pilots intentionally jettisoned the landing gear to conserve fuel. This flight was the first nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean. In honor of this pioneering flight, East Wenatchee&#x27;s airport is called Pangborn Memorial Airport, the Pangborn-Herndon Memorial Site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is nearby, and &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;″s propeller is displayed in the Wenatchee Valley Museum &amp; Cultural Center.

===Clovis points discovery===

On May 27, 1987, East Wenatchee became part of archaeological history. On that date, while digging in an orchard just east of the city, farmworkers accidentally discovered a cache of 11,000-year-old Clovis points and other artifacts, left there by Pleistocene hunters. The East Wenatchee Clovis Site, near Pangborn Airport, was explored in two subsequent archaeological digs in 1988 and 1990, was closed to science by the landowner after protests by local Native American tribes. The legal moratorium on new archaeological work at the site ended on June 1, 2007.

<text>The decade of the 1980s in Western cinema saw the return of studio-driven pictures, coming from the filmmaker-driven New Hollywood era of the 1970s. The period was when the &quot;high concept&quot; picture was established by producer Don Simpson, where films were expected to be easily marketable and understandable. Therefore, they had short cinematic plots that could be summarized in one or two sentences. Since its implementation, this method has become the most popular formula for modern Hollywood blockbusters. At the same time in Eastern cinema, the Hong Kong film industry entered a boom period that significantly elevated its prominence in the international market.

== Trends ==
The cinema of the 1980s covered many subgenres, with hybrids crossing between multiple genres. The course strengthened towards creating ever-larger megahit films, which earned more in their opening weeks than most previous movies due in part to scheduling releases when there were less competition for audience interest.
* Action: In the 1970s, action films usually focused on maverick police officers. However, the genre did not become dominant in Hollywood until the 1980s, when it was popularized by action stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, and Bruce Willis. Schwarzenegger built an iconic career out of action classics such as &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), and &quot;Predator&quot; (1987). Stallone starred in 1982&#x27;s &quot;First Blood&quot; about a returning Vietnam War veteran fighting a small town sheriff, as well as its sequels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Rambo III&quot;. Previously seen as a taboo in the 1970s, Vietnam War flicks like Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; made the conflict a popular subject in the 1980s. Norris starred in the &quot;Missing in Action&quot; trilogy (1984, 1985, 1988) about a Vietnam veteran going back to rescue POWs. The release of &quot;Die Hard&quot; in 1988 was particularly influential on the development of the genre in the subsequent decade. In the film, Willis plays a New York City police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a Los Angeles office building. Riding the buddy cop wave that was boosted by the likes of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise, Stallone and Kurt Russell&#x27;s &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; became one of the two last Hollywood films to be released in the 1980s. Meanwhile, Hong Kong action cinema was being revolutionized by filmmakers Jackie Chan, Tsui Hark, and John Woo; garnering increased attention all over the world with the likes of &quot;Project A&quot; (1983), &quot;Police Story&quot; (1985), &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989). Which featured increasingly complex martial arts and gunfight choreography with generally unsafe and most often uninsured stunt work. Blazing the trail for newer types of action movies like the heroic bloodshed subgenre.
* Animation: In the 1970s, full-length animated films usually focused on adult fare due to the influence of Ralph Bakshi films. However, even though they didn&#x27;t become popular until the late-1990s and 2000s due to public preference of TV animation, some well-known films were made during the 1980s, especially with Don Bluth. After he left Disney in 1979, Bluth formed his first animation studio and produced the moderately-successful &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982). Bluth later teamed up with Steven Spielberg to produce &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988) which both became box-office successes, and proved there was still confidence in animation for theaters. After breaking up with Spielberg, Bluth independently produced &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven&quot; (1989). Meanwhile, the Disney studio was having horrible times and the box-office failure of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985) almost put the studio in jeopardy. However, in later years, the modest success of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), and their collaboration with Spielberg on the live-action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) directed by Robert Zemeckis, which was a critical and box office hit, gave Disney enough confidence in its feature animation division. A year later in the penultimate month of the 1980s, the studio released &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, which eventually started an era known as the Disney Renaissance. Inspired by the success of 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie&quot;, Looney Tunes compilation films continued with &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; (1982), &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; (1983) and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (1988). That decade also saw a brief resurgence of popular-toys-based films. Nelvana&#x27;s &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; (1985) was successful enough to warrant two sequels: &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot; (1987). Additional well-known popular-work based films include &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don&#x27;t Come Back!!)&quot; (1980), &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1985), &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; (1985), &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986), &quot;The Chipmunk Adventure&quot; (1987) and &quot;The BFG&quot; (1989); While other well-known original films include &quot;The King and the Mockingbird&quot; (1980), &quot;American Pop&quot; (1981), &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (1982), &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; (1982), &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot; (1983), &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (1983), &quot;&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; (1987). The &#x27;80s also saw a resurgence of Japanese anime films: Inspired by the rarely successful release of his first film 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;, Hayao Miyazaki went to produce &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984) for Topcraft. The film&#x27;s huge success convinced Hayao Miyazaki to form Studio Ghibli which would then produce several critically acclaimed films of the decade including &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986), &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988), &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988) and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989). Other well-known anime films of that decade include &quot;Golgo 13: The Professional&quot; (1983), &quot;&quot; (1984), &quot;Lensman&quot; (1984), &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; (1985), &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise&quot; (1987), &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) and &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; (1989). Additionally, the first-ever theatrical animated franchise: the Doraemon film series (based on the anime and manga series of the same name) began in 1980 with the release of &quot;&quot; (1980).
* Blockbusters: The decade started by continuing the blockbuster boom of the mid-1970s. The sequel to 1977&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, opened in May 1980 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year. It is considered among the greatest films of all time (being the highest rated 1980s film on IMDb). It was followed by &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) finishing the &quot;Star Wars original trilogy&quot;. &quot;Superman II&quot; was released in Europe and Australia in late 1980, but not distributed in the United States until June 1981. Though now seen as campier over the original 1978 &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Superman II&quot; was received with a positive reaction. From the success of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, creator George Lucas teamed up with director Steven Spielberg to create one of the most iconic characters in the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; starring Harrison Ford, who had also co-starred in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. The story about an archaeologist and adventurer, Indiana Jones (Ford), hired by the U.S. government to go on a quest for the mystical lost Ark of the Covenant, created waves of interest in old 1930s style cliffhanger serials as well as treasure hunting adventures like 1984&#x27;s &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. It became the highest-grossing film of 1981, leading to sequels all in the top-10 films of the decade. In 1982, Spielberg directed his fairy-tale, sci-fi family blockbuster &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, which shattered all records, earning 40% more than any Star-Wars film, and double or triple the revenue of 46 of the top 50 films.
* Comedy: The disaster films of the past decade were spoofed in the gag comedy &quot;Airplane!&quot;, paving the way for more of the same style of humor in such releases as &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982), &quot;Top Secret!&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988). Popular comedy stars in the &#x27;80s included Leslie Nielsen, John Candy, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Rick Moranis, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. Many had come to prominence on the NBC TV series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, including Bill Murray, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. Eddie Murphy made a success of comedy-action films including &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982) and the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; series (1984–1993). Also in the top-50 films were the romantic comedies &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot; (1986), &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot; (1988) and &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981). Influenced largely by 1978&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, the decade also saw the continued rise of teen comedies like &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; (the later two of these had sequels). Also popular were the films of John Hughes such as &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986). &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988) provided a tongue-in-cheek approach to the teenage comedy genre, showcasing the murders (disguised as suicides) of several popular students at a U.S. high school. Other notable comedies of the decade include the gender-swap film &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), and a brief spate of age-reversal films including &quot;Big&quot;, &quot;18 Again!&quot;, &quot;Vice Versa&quot; and &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;. Also notable were the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series of broad comedies, produced between 1984 and 1993.
* Dance: Many movies during the 80s were centered around dancing and heavily influenced by MTV music videos. 1983&#x27;s &quot;Flashdance&quot;, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Footloose&quot;, and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; were all extremely successful as well as their soundtracks.
* Drama: Among the historical, romantic, and dramatic films, several were well received at the box office, including &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988), &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985) and &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985). Also notable in critical success were &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (also 1982) and &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984). Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Always&quot; was one of the two last Hollywood films to be released in the 1980s.
* Fantasy: Fantasies saw a resurgence particularly in sword and sorcery films. In 1981, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; and &quot;Excalibur&quot; started it off, but it was 1982&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; which caused the fantasy explosion. The epic starred Arnold Schwarzenegger in his acting breakthrough as he began his ascent to stardom. Loosely based on the original tales by Robert E. Howard, the film was written by the unlikely pairing of Oliver Stone and John Milius. Its sequel followed in 1984 with the light-weight &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;. Schwarzenegger returned again to a similar sword-wielding role in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Red Sonja&quot;. The same year as &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, similar films followed such as &quot;The Sword and the Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; and the &quot;Ator&quot; films. Fairy-tale fantasy was also popular with films such as &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (1984), &quot;Legend&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987). Disney&#x27;s &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, a big-budget sequel to 1939&#x27;s classic &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, was a major flop, yet became a major success on home video. Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986) was not an initial success but has since become a major cult classic. Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987) blended fantasy with several other genres such as horror, action, comedy, and romance to great effect, becoming an international favorite all over Asia.
* Horror: Creativity from 1970s horror films extended throughout the 1980s, except having more gore, with many successful 1980s horror films having numerous sequels as their murderers were themselves unstoppable. Stanley Kubrick directed his horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). The creative and violent &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981) with its secluded atmosphere is seen by many as one of the best in its genre, leading to its inevitable sequel &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; in 1987. &quot;Halloween&quot; director John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982) shocked audiences in its effects, as did David Cronenberg&#x27;s graphic and gory &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981). Sequels to &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980), and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) were the popular face of horror films in the 1980s, unkillable as their antagonists were, a trend reviled by most critics. Dan O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; and Stuart Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Re-Animator&quot; soon followed. In 1986, the James Cameron film &quot;Aliens&quot; was released a few weeks before David Cronenberg&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Fly&quot;. Films such as &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Joe Dante&#x27;s &quot;Gremlins&quot; (both 1984) and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) started a trend for horror comedies. &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1988) started the popular killer doll franchise starring Brad Dourif as the infamous killer doll Chucky.
* James Bond: The James Bond film series entered its third decade in 1981 with Roger Moore starring in the more realistic &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; after the outlandish excess of &quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1979. The decade saw the beginning of a new era for Bond since the previous decade&#x27;s directors originally directed a 1960s Bond; the new director brought to the series, John Glen, criticized for a less stylistic and more &quot;workman&quot; style of direction, directed all the EON Bond films from 1981 to 1989. &quot;Moonraker&quot; was the last for regular Bernard Lee who portrayed Bond&#x27;s boss M. For the 1980s Bonds, a collection of numerous MI6 superiors would brief Bond on his missions. 1983 was a significant year for the series as a non-EON Bond was released, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, directed by &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; director Irvin Kershner, with Sean Connery returning to the role for the first time since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;; it was competing with the next EON film, &quot;Octopussy&quot; at the box office with media dubbing the situation &quot;The Battle of the Bonds&quot;. Even lesser known in the same year was one-time Bond George Lazenby appearing in the TV reunion film &quot;The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; as Bond-like character &quot;JB&quot;. &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) was the last for Roger Moore before Timothy Dalton was chosen as the new Bond in 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and lastly in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;.
* Martial Arts: In Hong Kong, most action stars were either already skilled or at least partially trained in kung fu. Many also worked as fight choreographers with backgrounds in stage combat such as the comedic trio of Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao (aka the Three Dragons) who were all part of The Seven Little Fortunes troupe as children. Though the likes of Jet Li and Yuen Woo-ping were more known for being in front of or behind the camera respectively. Not to be left out, female action stars such as Michelle Yeoh, Cynthia Rothrock, Yukari Oshima, Moon Lee, and Cynthia Khan established the girls with guns trend during the latter half of the decade, which also heavily showcased hand-to-hand combat sequences. Meanwhile, Hollywood found its footing in the martial arts subgenre with the likes of Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Steven Seagal. All across-the-board, notable films include &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot;, &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot;, &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;, &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, and &quot;Miracles&quot;.
* Rite-of-Passage: Beyond just the teenager coming-of-age stories, more complex rite-of-passage films had older actors changing or transforming through the rituals. So although teenagers were the focus of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Risky Business&quot;, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and its sequels (1986, 1989), and 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; featuring the Brat Pack, older people with troubled lives were the subjects of &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986) or &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; in trying to become a fighter pilot, a female welder in &quot;Flashdance&quot; transforming into a ballet dancer, and &quot;Cocoon&quot;&#x27;s (1985) elderly set overcoming old age. Even &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983) reunion was a rite-of-passage that challenged old classmates to redirect their lives after the suicide of a friend. The Goonies in 1985 and Stand by Me in 1986 were both successful at the box office and went on to be considered classics of the decade. They also both featured a number young actors that would see future success both on the big screen and the small screen.
* Science Fiction: Continuing the 1970s&#x27; sci-fi boom was Australian post-apocalyptic &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, with a leather-clad outlaw fighting road barbarians in the futuristic desert wasteland. Another futuristic adventure released the same year, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, also saw an anti-hero set in a dystopian future. In 1982, yet another film set in a dystopian future, the Tech-noirish &quot;Blade Runner&quot; starred Harrison Ford as a detective searching for renegade androids. Sci-fi films aimed at younger audiences included the two &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, as well as the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T.&quot;. The Star Trek series became a big screen success with four movies being released during the 1980s.
* Sequels: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a trend emerged toward the release of sequels based on recently successful productions. Among the sequels were &quot;&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Final Conflict&quot; (aka &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot;), &quot;Grease 2&quot;, &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, &quot;Porky&#x27;s II: The Next Day&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.
* Sports: Baseball was especially popular on the big screen as evidenced by the releases of &quot;The Natural&quot;, &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, &quot;Major League&quot;, and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;. As well as boxing with &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;Rocky III&quot;, and &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. Though other competitions were represented by the likes of &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (golf), &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (track), &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (pool), &quot;Hoosiers&quot; (basketball), and &quot;Over the Top&quot; (arm wrestling).
* Thriller: The 1980s saw an immense amount of thriller films, many being of an erotic nature, including &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) and &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987). Perhaps two of the most influential examples of 1980s thriller films were David Lynch&#x27;s bizarre cult classic &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), which dealt with the underworld of a seemingly idyllic U.S. suburbia, a subject which has spawned many imitations well into the first decade of the 21st century and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s horror/thriller &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980).
* Western: A stylish form of western was evolving, with films such as &quot;Pale Rider&quot;, &quot;Silverado&quot; (both 1985) and &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988).

The decade saw an increased amount of nudity in film, as well as the increasing emphasis in the American industry on film franchises; especially in the science fiction, horror, and action genres. Much of the reliance on these effects-driven movies was due in part to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films at the advent of this decade and the new cinematic visuals they helped to pioneer.

With the release of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, the PG-13 rating was introduced in the U.S. to accommodate films that straddled the line between PG and R. Which was mainly due to the controversies surrounding the violence of the PG films &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot; from earlier that same year.

Some have considered the 1980s in retrospect as one of the weaker decades for American cinema in terms of the qualities of the films released. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has voiced his own view that the 1980s was one of the worst eras for American films. Film critic Kent Jones also shares this opinion. However, film theorist David Bordwell countered this notion, saying that the &quot;megapicture mentality&quot; was already existent in the 1970s, which is evident in the ten highest-grossing films of that decade, as well as with how many of the filmmakers part of New Hollywood were still able to direct many great pictures in the 1980s (Martin Scorsese, Brian de Palma, John Carpenter, etc.).

In the list, where revenues are equal numbers, the newer films are listed lower, due to inflation making the dollar-amount lower compared to earlier years.

<text>Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood (sometimes shortened to Mister Rogers) is an American half-hour educational children&#x27;s television series that ran from 1968 to 2001. It was created and hosted by Fred Rogers. Its original incarnation, the series &quot;Misterogers&quot; debuted in Canada on October 15, 1962, on CBC Television. In 1966, Rogers moved back to the United States creating &quot;Misterogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; (sometimes shown as &quot;MisteRogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;), later called &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, on the regional Eastern Educational Television Network (EETN, a forerunner of today&#x27;s American Public Television). The U.S. national debut of the show occurred on February 19, 1968. It aired on NET and its successor, PBS, until August 31, 2001.

The series is aimed primarily at preschool children ages 2 to 5, but it was labeled by PBS as &quot;appropriate for all ages&quot;. &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; was produced by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public broadcaster WQED and Rogers&#x27; non-profit production company Family Communications, Inc., previously known as Small World Enterprises prior to 1971; the company was renamed The Fred Rogers Company after Rogers&#x27; death (it has since been renamed again to Fred Rogers Productions as of 2019). In May 1997, the series surpassed &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; as the longest-running children&#x27;s television series, a record the series held until June 2003, when &quot;Sesame Street&quot; beat &quot;Mister Rogers&quot;&#x27; record. The series could be seen in reruns on most PBS stations until August 31, 2007, when it began to be removed by various PBS stations, and was then permanently removed from the daily syndicated schedule by PBS after August 29, 2008.

Eleven years after &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; concluded, PBS debuted an animated spin-off, &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;. A 50th-anniversary tribute and a PBS pledge-drive show, hosted by actor Michael Keaton (who got his start on the show), titled &quot;Mister Rogers: It&#x27;s You I Like&quot;, premiered on PBS stations nationwide on March 6, 2018.

In December 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; #89 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

==History==

The series had its genesis in 1953, when Rogers and Josie Carey joined the newly formed public television station WQED. On April 5, 1954, WQED debuted &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, a program featuring Rogers as puppeteer and composer, with Carey as host and lyricist, in an unscripted weekday-afternoon live television program. It was on this program where many of the puppets, characters and music used in the later series were developed, such as King Friday XIII, Daniel Tiger, and X the Owl. It was also the time when Rogers began wearing his famous sneakers, as he found them to be quieter than his work shoes while he was moving about behind the set. The show was briefly broadcast nationally on the NBC Television Network.

===CBC television===
Rogers moved to Toronto, Ontario, in 1961 to work on a new series based on &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, called &quot;Misterogers&quot;, a 15-minute program on CBC Television. &quot;Misterogers&quot; aired on CBC for about four years, and a number of the set pieces that he would take with him back to the United States, such as the trolley and castle, were created for the Canadian program by CBC designers and in collaboration with producer Bruce Attridge. Most importantly, Rogers appeared on camera in the new show rather than only appearing through puppets or characters. Fred Rainsberry, head of Children&#x27;s Programming at CBC, persuaded Rogers to appear on camera in the new show (which he named after Rogers) after seeing him interact with children. Ernie Coombs, one of the Americans whom Rogers brought with him to help develop the CBC show, would remain with CBC, on Rogers&#x27; recommendation, after Rogers returned to the United States. Coombs first appeared as Mr. Dressup in the CBC program &quot;Butternut Square&quot;, conceived and produced by Attridge. Coombs then helped to develop what became &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, which ran for nearly 30 years as an iconic presence on Canadian television, ending in 1996.

===Move to WQED===
In 1966, Rogers acquired the rights to his program from CBC and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;. He renamed the show &quot;Misterogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which initially aired regionally in the northeastern United States through EEN, including educational stations in Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City. The 100 episodes of the half-hour show incorporated the &quot;Neighborhood of Make-Believe&quot; segments from the CBC episodes with additional reality-based opening and closing material produced in Pittsburgh. The series was cancelled in 1967 due to lack of funding, but an outpouring of public response prompted a search for new funding.

In 1967, The Sears Roebuck Foundation provided funding for the program, which enabled it to be seen nationwide on National Educational Television; taping began on September 21, 1967 for the first national season. The first national broadcast of &quot;Misterogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; appeared on most NET stations on February 19, 1968. In 1970, when PBS replaced NET, it also inherited this program. Around the same time, the show had a slight title change, to the more-familiar &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;.

The show was broadcast from February 19, 1968 to February 20, 1976, and again from August 27, 1979 to August 31, 2001. The final episode was recorded on December 1, 2000. The studio at WQED in Pittsburgh in which the series was recorded was later renamed &quot;The Fred Rogers Studio&quot;.

==Format==


During each half-hour segment, Rogers spoke directly to the viewer about various topics, taking the viewer on tours of factories, demonstrating experiments, crafts, and music, and interacting with his friends. Rogers also made a point simply to behave naturally on camera rather than acting out a character, stating that &quot;One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away&quot;. The half-hour episodes were punctuated by a puppet segment chronicling occurrences in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Another segment of the show consisted of Rogers going to different places around the neighborhood, where he interviewed people to talk about their work and other contributions that focused on the episode&#x27;s theme, such as Brockett&#x27;s Bakery, Bob Trow&#x27;s Workshop, and Negri&#x27;s Music Shop. In one episode, Rogers took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, which aired on CBS from 1978 to 1982.

At the start of each episode, the show&#x27;s logo appears as the camera pans slowly over a model of the neighborhood, as the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers&#x27; television house. From 1979 to 1981, an alternate version of the opening sequence was used. Beginning in the early 1980s, the neighborhood model incorporated a small version of the &quot;Neighborhood Trolley&quot;, as it crosses several streets from left to right on a model train track. This is the same model electric trolley that later in the program would transport viewers into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Usually, the camera goes from the neighborhood to out on the porch of the Rogers&#x27; television house, where the viewers see Fred Rogers coming for a visit before he enters the house. After the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers&#x27; television house, Fred Rogers is seen coming home with his jacket on, singing &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot;. He goes into the closet, takes off his jacket, hangs it up, and grabs a cardigan zipper sweater to put on. After that, he takes his dress shoes off and grabs a pair of blue sneakers to put on. One of Rogers&#x27; sweaters now hangs in the Smithsonian Institution, a testament to the cultural influence of his simple daily ritual.

At the end of each episode, Rogers sang &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Good Feeling&quot; (a different song, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was used from 1968 to 1972) when he took off his sneakers as he says &quot;You&#x27;re alive&quot; in a higher-toned voice, and grabs his dress shoes to put back on, and then snaps his fingers two times. After that, Rogers goes into the closet, takes off his cardigan, hangs it up, and grabs his jacket to put back on. Before the closing credits, Rogers got ready to go out the door by reminding the viewers: &quot;You always make each day a special day. You know how: By just your being you/yourself. There&#x27;s only one person in the whole world that&#x27;s like you, and that&#x27;s you. And people can like you just/exactly the way you are. I&#x27;ll be back next time. Bye-bye!&quot;. During the closing credits, which is complete with the show&#x27;s logo and the episode number, the camera would perform a reversed version of the opening sequence&#x27;s pan shot, while the &quot;Neighborhood Trolley&quot; crosses streets from right to left.

Starting in 1979, episodes were grouped into week-long series, with each series focused on a particular topic; each opening includes that week&#x27;s subject, in the form of &quot;Mister Rogers Talks About [subject]&quot;. Rogers&#x27; monologues throughout the week explore various facets of the topic, and the ongoing story from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe serves as illustration. 

Rogers covered a broad range of topics over the years, and the series did not shy away from issues that other children&#x27;s programming avoided. In fact, Rogers endeared himself to many when, on March 23, 1970, he dealt with the death of one of his pet goldfish. The series also dealt with competition, divorce, and war. Rogers returned to the topic of anger regularly and focused on peaceful ways of dealing with angry feelings.

Beginning in the third season, Mister Rogers always made a clear distinction between the realistic world of his television neighborhood and the fantasy world of Make-Believe (prior to that, the line was blurred somewhat as he would often talk about it as if it were real and he had a direct line of contact with the characters in it). He often discussed what was going to happen in Make-Believe before the next fantasy segment was shown (&quot;Let&#x27;s pretend that Prince Tuesday has been having scary dreams...&quot;), and sometimes acted out bits of Make-Believe with models on a table before the camera transitioned to the live-action puppet rendition. The miniature motorized trolley, which was known in character form as &quot;Trolley&quot;, with its accompanying fast-paced piano theme music, and which was operated by Rogers with his left hand, working buttons and controls hidden on the side of the bench on which Rogers usually would sit, was the only element that appeared regularly in both the realistic world and Make-Believe: it was used to transport viewers from one realm to the other. Rogers, however, was mentioned from time to time in Make-Believe, particularly by Mr. McFeely, who appeared occasionally in the Make-Believe segments and seemed to form a link between the two worlds. The idea of the trolley came from Rogers. When he was young, many trolleys operated in Pittsburgh, and he liked riding on them. This reality/fantasy distinction put Rogers&#x27; series in sharp contrast with other children&#x27;s series, such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, which freely mixed realistic and fantastic elements.

Trolley was a character in its own right. Often, when it crossed into the Neighborhood of Make Believe, it would stop and have a &quot;conversation&quot; with King Friday XIII (by moving back and forth slightly and making bell noises to respond to Friday), then continue on. Trolley also truly showed the difference between the worlds during the week when the three youngest puppet characters (Daniel Striped Tiger, Prince Tuesday, and Ana Platypus) prepared for and went to school for the first time, as it played the school bus. When in Mister Rogers&#x27; house, it simply had two pieces of yellow construction paper shaped and drawn like the profile of a school bus stuck to its sides, but in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, it had a chassis on it that made it look like a school bus.

The series featured &quot;Picture Picture&quot;, a rear-projection motion picture and slide projector, whose screen was encased with a picture frame. In early episodes, Picture Picture would show various films or slides at Mister Rogers&#x27; command; after the material was presented, Mister Rogers would thank Picture Picture, to which it would return a &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; on its screen. After 1970, Picture Picture no longer operated magically, becoming merely a projector; Mister Rogers would insert a film, slides or videotape through a slot on the side, then show the material using a wired remote control (slides were viewed on Picture Picture; films and video were faded in to the clip). When Picture Picture was not used, a different painting would be displayed on its screen. Often it would display the words &quot;Hello&quot; or &quot;Hi&quot; at the opening.

The series was also notable for its use of jazz-inspired music, mostly arranged and performed by Johnny Costa, until Costa&#x27;s death in 1996, when he was succeeded by Michael Moricz for the remainder of the series. The music was unique in its simplicity and flow that blended with the series&#x27; sketches and features. The music was usually played live during taping. Lyrics and melodies were written and sung by Rogers, who created more than 200 original songs.

Only Mr. McFeely, Mrs. McFeely, Officer Clemmons, Scientist Adler, and Chef Brockett appeared substantially the same way in both Mr. Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.

===Neighborhood of Make-Believe===

The &quot;Neighborhood of Make-Believe&quot; is the fictional kingdom visited by Mr. Rogers during the show. Characters in the &quot;Neighborhood of Make-Believe&quot; were portrayed by both hand puppets and actors. Fred Rogers was the puppeteer for a great number of the characters:

* Collette
* Cornflake S. Pecially
* Daniel Striped Tiger
* Donkey Hodie
* Edgar Cooke
* Grandpere Tiger
* Henrietta Pussycat
* Ino A. Horse
* King Friday XIII
* Lady Elaine Fairchilde
* Mrs. Frogg
* Princess Margeret H. Lizard
* Queen Sara Saturday
* Tadpole Frogg
* X the Owl

Other characters and their performers or puppeteers:

* Anna Platypus
* Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones
* Bob Dog
* Cousin Mary Owl
* Cousin Steven Owl
* Dr. Duckbill Platypus
* Elsie Jean Platypus
* Harriett Elizabeth Cow
* H.J. Elephant III
* Hula Mouse
* James Michael Jones
* Prince Tuesday
* Purple Panda
* Robert Troll

In addition to Bob Trow, other regular puppeteers included Michael Horton, Lenny Meledandri (1980–2001), and Carole Switala.

Michael Keaton made his first television appearance as a volunteer in 1975. He played an acrobat in a troupe called The Flying Zookeenies that performed for King Friday&#x27;s birthday and was also in charge of running the Trolley.

===Operas===
Thirteen in-series &quot;operas&quot; took place during the course of the series within the Make-Believe segments. Many of them featured American baritone John Reardon as a main character. The operas would encompass the entire episode and would be seen after a brief introduction by Mr. Rogers.

# Babysitter Opera (1968)
# Campsite Opera (1968)
# Teddy Bear/Whaling Ship Opera (1969)
# &quot;Pineapples and Tomatoes&quot; (1970)
# &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (1971)
# &quot;Snow People and Warm Pussycat&quot; (1972)
# &quot;Potato Bugs and Cows&quot; (1973)
# &quot;All in the Laundry&quot; (1974)
# &quot;Key to Otherland&quot; (1975)
# &quot;Windstorm in Bubbleland&quot; (1980)
# &quot;Spoon Mountain&quot; (1982)
# &quot;A Granddad for Daniel&quot; (1984)
# &quot;A Star for Kitty&quot; (1986)

Additionally, a play, &quot;Josephine The Short-Necked Giraffe&quot;, first aired in 1989 as a tribute to the late John Reardon.

===Guests===
Guests on the series ranged from cellist Yo-Yo Ma to actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (in a 2001 piece where celebrities were asked about their heroes, Rogers cited Ma as one of his heroes). A 1968 visit by electronic music pioneer Bruce Haack resurfaced in the 2004 documentary &quot;Haack: King of Techno&quot;.

Guests on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; were often surprised to find that, although Rogers was just as gentle and patient in life as on television, he was nevertheless a perfectionist who did not allow &quot;shoddy&quot; ad-libbing; he believed that children were thoughtful people who deserved programming as good as anything produced for adults on television.

Rogers appeared as a guest on some other series. On the children&#x27;s animated cartoon series &quot;Arthur&quot;, for example, Rogers plays himself as an aardvark like Arthur. Later on, Arthur appears as a guest in hand-puppet form in a 1999 episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Bill Nye, host of a science-themed program, and Rogers also exchanged appearances on each other&#x27;s series, as did Rogers and Captain Kangaroo. Rogers additionally appeared in an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, where he explains to Big Bird that, even if one loses a running race such as the one Big Bird had run against his friend &quot;Snuffy&quot;, no hard feelings threaten to break the two of them apart. Big Bird himself also appeared in one episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, when he came to deliver his entry to the &quot;Draw the Neighborhood&quot; art contest.

==Funding==
* N.E.T. affiliated stations children&#x27;s program fund (1968–1970)
* The Sears-Roebuck Foundation (1968–1976, 1979–1992)
* Corporation for Public Broadcasting (1971–1976, 1991–2001)
* Office of Education (1974–1975)
* Bureau of Education for the Handicapped (1975)
* Ford Foundation (1975–1976)
* Johnson &amp; Johnson (1975–1976)
* Public Television Stations / &quot;contributions to your PBS station from Viewers Like You&quot; (1975–1976, 1979–2001)

The Ford Foundation, Public Television Stations and Johnson &amp; Johnson also provided funding for repeats of the 1969-1975 color episodes, beginning in 1976.

==After the series==
When Fred Rogers died in 2003, PBS&#x27;s website provided suggestions to parents on how to respond to children who ask about Rogers&#x27; death.

Beginning on September 3, 2007, some PBS affiliates began replacing the show with new programs such as &quot;Super Why!&quot;, &quot;WordGirl&quot; and &quot;WordWorld&quot;. In June 2008, PBS announced that, beginning in late 2008, the network would stop broadcasting &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; as part of its daily syndication lineup to member stations, instead airing the program only once a week over the weekend. Milwaukee PBS, for example, still carries the show once a week, on Sunday, over its primary HD/SD channel. Beginning on September 1, 2008, &quot;Mister Rogers&quot; was replaced by new programming such as &quot;Martha Speaks&quot;, &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot;, and an update of &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. However, individual member stations have the option of airing &quot;Mister Rogers&quot; independently of the PBS syndicated feed, with series home WQED in particular continuing to air the series daily until 2010. There was a campaign in 2008 and 2009 to urge PBS and all member stations to bring the show back seven days a week. The premiere of the &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; spin-off in 2012 effectively ended most reruns of the show for several years, but, by 2017, some stations began to bring back a select number of episodes. As of 2023, reruns air on many PBS stations early in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series&#x27; national premiere, PBS aired select episodes of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; for a week in February 2018.

===Spin-offs===

In July 2011, during the annual Television Critics Association summer press tour, it was announced that a new animated spin-off series, &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;, was in production. The show debuted on most PBS stations on September 3, 2012. The series features Daniel Tiger, the four-year-old son of Daniel Striped Tiger, as a host of the series, which also features characters of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe all grown older, with the children now having families of their own.

A second spin-off titled &quot;Donkey Hodie&quot;, focusing on the titular character, aired on PBS May 3, 2021. The puppet series features a radically different design for the character along with his friends Purple Panda, Duck Duck and Bob Dog, as they learn and sing through the land of &quot;Someplace Else&quot;.

==Music and regular songs==
===Regular songs===

The song &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot; was written by Fred Rogers in 1967 and was used as the opening theme for each episode of the show.

In the first three seasons of the show, during which new episodes were constantly being produced, each show ended with the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, which was written by Rogers&#x27; former colleague, Josie Carey. Starting with Season 4 in 1971, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was used only on Monday through Thursday episodes, and a new closing song, which is titled as &quot;The Weekend Song&quot;, was used only on Friday episodes as the program would not return until Monday.

Eventually, the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; song was removed entirely due to copyright issues, and by 1973, Rogers sang &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Good Feeling&quot; at the end of each episode. Prior to 1973, the original version of &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Good Feeling&quot; was used as part of Mister Rogers&#x27; general repertoire of songs. When &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Good Feeling&quot; became the closing theme for &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 1973, it used a rewrite of &quot;The Weekend Song&quot; at the end, using only the first four lines: &quot;And I&#x27;ll be back when the day is new, and I&#x27;ll have more ideas for you. And you&#x27;ll have things you&#x27;ll want to talk about; I will too&quot;. This was only used on Monday through Thursday episodes. On Friday episodes, the lyric was changed to &quot;week&quot; instead of &quot;day&quot;. On early episodes of this season, the line was originally written as &quot;When tomorrow is new&quot;.

===Music===
Musical directors for the series include:
*Johnny Costa (1968–96)
*Michael Moricz, who took over as music director after Costa&#x27;s death and served until the end of the series in 2001.

In addition to arranging and directing the music heard on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, Costa, along with other musicians, performed almost all the background music heard on the series, including the show&#x27;s recognizable main theme, the trolley whistle, Mr. McFeeley&#x27;s frenetic speedy delivery piano plonks, the vibraphone flute-toots (played on a synthesizer) as Fred fed his fish, dreamy celesta lines, incidental music, and Rogers&#x27; entrance and exit tunes. Each day an episode was recorded, Costa and his ensemble played live in the studio for the filming. Musicians who played in this ensemble were:
*Johnny Costa – Piano, Celesta, Synthesizer, &amp; Trolley Whistle
*Joe Negri – Guitar
*Carl McVicker Jr. – Bass Guitar, Double Bass
*Bobby Rawsthorne – Drums &amp; Percussion

Even after Costa&#x27;s death in 1996, much of the music heard on the program continued to be Costa&#x27;s, and his name continued to be listed in the show&#x27;s closing credits as one of its Musical Directors.

==Broadcast history==
The first broadcast of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; was on the National Educational Television network on February 19, 1968; the color NET logo appeared on a model building at the beginning and end of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; from 1969 to 1970. When NET ceased operations, the series moved its successor network PBS, even though episodes up until the end of the fourth season in May 1971 were still copyrighted by and produced for NET.

The series&#x27; first season (1968) consisted of 130 episodes, produced in black-and-white. For seasons 2–8 (1969–75), the show produced 65 new color episodes each year. By the end of season 8, this meant there was a library of 455 color episodes that could be repeated indefinitely. Rogers and the rest of the show&#x27;s cast and crew began suffering burnout from taping 65 episodes a year and, in 1975, Rogers made the decision to take a break from the series for a few years. As a consequence, season 9 (1976) consisted of only five episodes. These five new episodes (which aired the final week of original episodes of the so-called &quot;first series&quot;) featured Mister Rogers in his workshop, watching scenes of past episodes of his series, which he recorded on videocassettes and kept on the shelf in his workshop. On the Friday episode of that week (February 20, 1976), he reminded viewers that they, too, could watch many of those old episodes beginning the following week. During the hiatus period, two primetime episodes were produced and aired as specials: a Christmas show in December 1977 and a &quot;springtime&quot;-themed show.

In 1978, production of the series resumed, with an eye towards &quot;freshening up&quot; the show by producing 15 new episodes per year. These &quot;second series&quot; episodes, which began airing in August 1979, would be mixed in with the already-airing cycle of repeats from the so-called &quot;first series&quot; (i.e., the color episodes of seasons 2–9, aired from 1969 to 1976).

The series aired 15 new episodes annually between 1979 and 1993. As well, there were occasional &quot;Mister Rogers Talks with Parents About...&quot; specials, which featured panelists discussing ways in which parents could talk to their children about the issues discussed on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. These specials usually were aired on weekends, just prior to the airing of a new batch of Monday-to-Friday episodes.

Beginning in 1994, the production schedule was changed so that 10 new episodes a year were produced instead of 15. Shortly thereafter, as of August 11, 1995, the episodes from the &quot;first series&quot; (1968–76) were withdrawn from the repeat schedule, since there were over 200 &quot;second series&quot; episodes available for broadcast, and many of the first series episodes had become outdated.
The show&#x27;s final years varied the number of episodes produced per season: season 26 (1995–96) consisted of 20 episodes, season 27 (1997) produced 10 episodes, seasons 28 and 29 (1998–99) both contained 15 episodes, and season 30 (2000) reverted to 10 episodes. The final season, season 31 (2001), consisted of only 5 episodes, centering on the theme &quot;Celebrate The Arts&quot;.

A few episodes from the &quot;first series&quot; are available for viewing in the Paley Center for Media, including the first episode of the series and the first color episode. A complete collection of episodes, including more than 900 videotapes and scripts from the show along with other promotional materials produced by Rogers or his Family Communications Inc. production company, exists in the Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood Archives, located in the Elizabeth Nesbitt Room at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information Building.

===Reruns===
When PBS began re-airing the first 460 color episodes of the series in 1976, some of the earliest color episodes from 1969 and 1970 were re-edited with new voice-overs or footage. For example, in one 1970 episode where Mister Rogers demonstrates the noise-proof ear protectors that airport workers use on the tarmac, the film footage used featured a worker directing a United Airlines jet with its stylized &quot;U&quot; logo—which was not introduced until 1974. All of the episodes revised from the first series also included an extra segment following the closing credits, mentioning the episode number and additional companies that provided funding since these episodes originally aired, even though they had not provided funding at the time of their original production. The episode numbers correlated to activity guides for parents, which included activities and discussion topics for parents and child care providers to utilize with their children. The black and white episodes of the first season were last re-run on August 21, 1970, just before NET was replaced by PBS.

, almost all of the 1979–2001 &quot;second series&quot; episodes are still in active rotation on a number of PBS stations. The only exception is the week-long &quot;Conflict&quot; series (episodes #1521–#1525), first aired during the week of November 7–11, 1983. The series/story arc covered the topics of war, bombs, and an arms race, and was created in response to the Invasion of Grenada, and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. The &quot;Conflict&quot; series was last aired on PBS during the week of April 1–5, 1996.

Only a few episodes of the series have been released to DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, although some earlier compilation-based releases were issued on VHS by Playhouse Video during the mid-1980s. 100 episodes have subsequently been released as part of Amazon Video. A DVD set titled the &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day Collection&quot;, containing 30 episodes from the second series, was released on March 27, 2018 by PBS.

====Twitch marathons====
On May 11, 2017, streaming video platform Twitch announced with The Fred Rogers Company that 886 episodes of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; would be streamed live on the Internet over an 18-day period (although several episodes were skipped over during the marathon, most notably the 1983 &quot;Conflict&quot; episodes). The marathon began on May 15, 2017, at noon PT and ended on June 3, 2017. The marathon included many &quot;Mister Rogers&quot; episodes that had only aired once before. During the live stream, viewers were encouraged to support their local PBS station.

&quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; joined other popular PBS shows, including &quot;The Joy of Painting&quot; and &quot;The French Chef&quot;, that have been streamed on the Twitch service.

On March 20, 2018, Twitch began streaming a 90-episode marathon to commemorate Rogers&#x27; 90th birthday, followed by a repeat marathon of the series.

===International Broadcast===
In the Canadian province of Ontario, the show was broadcast on TVOntario from 1970 to 1989. These broadcasts could also be seen in U.S. cities close to Canadian border.

===Digital Platforms===
In late May 2024, it was announced that online streaming platform Pluto TV would be creating a dedicated 24/7 channel for Mister Rogers Neighborhood as the program was available already on-demand. On June 10th, the channel was launched. The show is also among the shows broadcast by the free streaming channel PBS Retro launched in April 2024.

==Episodes==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Specials==
A prime time Christmas special, &quot;Christmastime with Mister Rogers&quot;, first aired in 1977. This special had François Clemmons introducing a storyteller and flutist friend to Rogers. They filmed several narrated segments of the stories François&#x27; friend told. The special also had the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segment which shows how they celebrated Christmas. The trolley had a banner on the roof that said &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on one side, and &quot;Happy Hannukah&quot; on the other. This special was aired every Christmas season until 1982. This special&#x27;s opening has Rogers walking through a real neighborhood while the titles roll rather than the model neighborhood used in the series.

In 1994, Rogers created another one-time special for PBS called &quot;Fred Rogers&#x27; Heroes&quot; which consisted of documentary portraits of four real-life people whose work helped make their communities better. Rogers, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit and tie, hosted in wraparound segments that did not use the &quot;Neighborhood&quot; set.

For a time, Rogers produced specials for the parents as a precursor to the subject of the week on the Neighborhood called &quot;Mister Rogers Talks To Parents About &quot;[topic]&quot;&quot;. Rogers did not host those specials, though; other people like Joan Lunden, who hosted the &quot;Conflict&quot; special, and other news announcers played MC duties in front of a gallery of parents while Rogers answered questions from them. These specials were made to prepare the parents for any questions the children might ask after watching the episodes on that topic of the week.

===&quot;Mister Rogers: It&#x27;s You I Like&quot;===
On March 6, 2018, a primetime special commemorating the 50th anniversary of the series aired on PBS, hosted by actor Michael Keaton. The hour-long special also features interviews by musician Yo-Yo Ma, musician Itzhak Perlman, actress Sarah Silverman, actress Whoopi Goldberg, actor John Lithgow, screenwriter Judd Apatow, actor David Newell, producer Ellen Doherty, and spouse Joanne Byrd Rogers, as well as clips of memorable moments from the show, such as Rogers visiting Koko the gorilla, Margaret Hamilton dressing up as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;&#x27;s Wicked Witch of the West, and Jeff Erlanger in his wheelchair singing &quot;It&#x27;s You I Like&quot; with Rogers.

Earlier PBS specials include &quot;Our Neighbor, Fred Rogers&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Fred Rogers: America&#x27;s Favorite Neighbor&quot; in 2003. A short special, &quot;Mister Rogers in Our Neighborhood&quot; by PBS station WUCF, described Fred Rogers&#x27;s college years and family connections in Florida.

==Tributes==
Over the years, many television shows, exhibits and attractions have been named in tribute to &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. After three years as a traveling exhibit, the Children&#x27;s Museum of Pittsburgh had &quot;Welcome to Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; installed as a permanent exhibit in 2004. The planetarium show &quot;The Sky Above Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; is an animated adaptation of the television show for preschool-aged children. Idlewild and Soak Zone, an amusement park near Rogers&#x27; hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania has an attraction called &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood of Make-Believe&quot; featuring a life-size trolley ride, designed by Rogers. This was shut down in 2014 to reopen as Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood in 2015. A children&#x27;s play area at Monroeville Mall in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monroeville was named for the television show.

Many of the artifacts from the set of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, including the tree of X the owl, the make-believe neighborhood and the inside entrance to Mister Rogers&#x27; home is on display at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. Also included is a life-size figure of Mister Rogers and a sweater he wore on the show.

A kiosk containing artifacts used during the series is located on Concourse C of Pittsburgh International Airport, near the children&#x27;s play area. The &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; Archives at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information is an academic resource and collection that contains correspondence, scripts, props, puppets, fan mail, 911 tapes including all but four episodes of the series on 3/4-inch production videotape; plus one on VHS (three other episodes are not in the collection) along with various videos of specials, interviews and scholarly articles that show the cultural impact of Fred Rogers&#x27; work. A statue of Fred Rogers exists on the North Shore of the Allegheny River near Heinz Field at the surviving footing of the Manchester Bridge. The original trolley from the shows is on display at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto, Ontario.

A documentary feature film about the series, titled &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot;, was released by Focus Features on June 8, 2018. Another documentary, &quot;Mister Rogers &amp; Me,&quot; was shown at film festivals in 2010 and on PBS stations in 2012. An American drama film, titled &quot;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&quot; starring Tom Hanks as Rogers, was released on November 22, 2019 by TriStar Pictures.

On September 21, 2018, a Google Doodle was created in honor of Mr. Rogers.

In summer of 2023, a fan&#x27;s Lego Ideas contest toy block creation of Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood received some 10,000 supporters for an official project set. It advanced to the Sep. 2023 review phase but was turned down by the Lego Review Board in May 2024. 

===Music===
The music of the show was interpreted by an eclectic mix of modern artists for the 2005 album &quot;Songs From the Neighborhood: The Music of Mister Rogers&quot;. The YouTube show &quot;Pittsburgh Dad&quot; uses a piano theme song inspired by the jazz music constantly heard on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. The musical project Symphony of Science, in association with PBS Digital Studios, created a music video called &quot;Garden of Your Mind&quot; from clips of the show, using Rogers&#x27; own pitch-corrected spoken words to create a song.

<doc id="137898" wikidata="Q1514440" url="?curid=137898" title="Mansfield, Washington">
<text>Mansfield is a town in Douglas County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee–East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 326 at the 2020 census.

==History==
R.E. Darling named Mansfield in 1905 after his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. Mansfield&#x27;s land was purchased and first developed in 1909 by the Great Northern Railway. Mansfield was officially incorporated on February 23, 1911.

===Fires===
By 1914, the town had grown substantially, and had acquired two hotels, a bank, a doctor&#x27;s office, and many more amenities. What had started as a town based on agriculture and the railroad had grown into a popular resort destination.

In June 1914, a fire broke out in Mansfield&#x27;s Knox Store, known as &quot;Mansfield&#x27;s greatest store&quot;. The fire was pushed by the wind and spread over both sides of the first block of Mansfield&#x27;s Main Street. The fire caused roughly $200,000 US in damage. In November of the same year, fire destroyed the second block of Main Street. After the fires, a town ordinance was passed requiring all new buildings within certain areas of the town to be built of fire-proof materials.

In 1922, the Cross Hotel, owned by contractor Robert Cross, burned to the ground. The hotel was one of Mansfield&#x27;s greatest attractions, and was considered to be one of the best hotels in all of North Central Washington. Though his hotel was lost, many of the houses built by Cross are still in use today.

===The Great Depression===
Mansfield&#x27;s economy continued to grow throughout the years leading up to the Great Depression. The town&#x27;s enormous amount of wheat production proved very lucrative, and the town continued to grow.

In the mid-1920s, a terrible drought hit Mansfield and the surrounding area. That, along with the beginnings of the Great Depression, caused many people to leave Mansfield in search of work.

===After the Depression and Mansfield today===
The town&#x27;s crops and economy eventually recovered, but the damage had been done. Mansfield would never fully return to what it once was. The railroad eventually closed its service depot in Mansfield. In the 1950s, the train station was sold off and moved. Finally, in the 1980s, the railroad departed from Mansfield for the last time. The railroad was no longer able to serve the communities it passed through in Central Washington. The rails were dismantled, leaving Mansfield as &quot;the town at the end of the rails&quot;.

Today, Mansfield is still a town based on agriculture. The town&#x27;s grain elevators process around 1.7 million bushels of wheat annually.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Mansfield has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Rock Island is a city in Douglas County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee–East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,279 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Rock Island was officially incorporated on November 3, 1930. The area of Rock Island was used by Native American tribes for fishing and crossing of the Columbia River due to the nearby Rock Island Rapids prior to settlement of the Washington Territory.

The site had been previously settled in the late 19th century and was known as Hammond; early maps sometimes show the city as Hammond P.O. (Post Office) or Power City. In the teacup valley in which Rock Island is currently located, two men, Ingraham and McBride, opened a trading post in the early 1860s. Their patrons were local Native Americans, who often fished that stretch of the Columbia when the fish were running. The two pioneering men would later move their post to the mouth of the Wenatchee River, leaving little trace of their stay.

The most notable figure in Rock Island&#x27;s founding is James E. Keane. As the first permanent settler to the Rock Island area, James Keane arrived with a crew of men in 1887. Keane planned to build a home and improve the land that he had acquired through the Homestead, Pre-emption, and Desert Acts. Four years later, the Great Northern Railroad made its first survey of the area and began construction toward the valley from the east. One half mile upriver from the well-known Rock Island Rapids, Mr. Keane platted a townsite he named Hammond.

Hammond was located nearly 2.5 miles south of the present site of the City of Rock Island due to changes in planning by the Great Northern Railway. Keane moved his townsite to this new area and named it Rock Island, named aptly for the rock islands in the Columbia River near the site. Between 1891 and 1893, Rock Island became a town of considerable importance for the railroad. The mammoth steel bridge that was built across the Columbia drew many laborers to the area, and the small town boomed. Several stores popped up to meet the needs of the workers, and the Rock Island Sun newspaper began publication.

The site was thought to be the area where the large city of the area would develop as it was located near the Rock Island Rapids and near the bridge which spanned the Columbia River for the Great Northern Railway. Despite these strategic advantages, the large city in the area would become Wenatchee, just seven miles upriver from the site of present-day Rock Island. In 1893, however, the completion of that first bridge across the Columbia marked the downfall of Rock Island. With few jobs in town to entice them, the employees of the railroad moved away.

In 1930, Rock Island boomed again when the Puget Sound Power and Light Company began construction of a dam just below the Rock Island Rapids. The project was estimated at 10 million dollars and the Rock Island Dam was to be the first dam on the Columbia River. On November 3, 1930, with the construction of the dam in full swing, Rock Island was officially incorporated as a Washington town, with a population of 421 residents. The town boomed for a second time in its history as workers for the dam project created temporary villages near the town, but it could not last. When two of the dam&#x27;s generators began producing power in 1931, and the final spillway was closed in 1932, Rock Island again faced a bust and a loss of residents.

Many Native American pictographs were destroyed with the construction of the Rock Island Dam. A small sampling of pictographs saved prior to the construction of Rock Island Dam can be seen at the Wenatchee Valley Museum &amp; Cultural Center in nearby Wenatchee. During World War II a silicon smelter would be built in the town of Rock Island, closing in 1999. Rock Island was also home to a nearby state park, appearing on maps until the late 1940s.

<text>Republic is a city in Ferry County, Washington, United States. The population was 992 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Ferry County. It was the largest mining camp in the Republic Mining District, and home to the &quot;Hot Air Line&quot; railway.

==History==
===Republic Mining District===
Republic was founded by gold prospectors in the late 19th century. Mining claims were first made along Eureka Creek on March 1, 1896, after the northern half of the Colville Indian Reservation was vacated on February 21. On March 5, 1896, the Republic claim was staked by Thomas Ryan and Philip Creasor along Granite Creek, another branch of the Sanpoil River. The resulting Republic Mine eventually became the highest producer of gold in the county. On April 18, 1896, the Republic Mining District, originally called the Eureka Mining District, was established.

The first ore mill for processing low grade ore in the district was constructed in May, 1898, while highest grade ores were hauled east to Marcus, Washington partway by cart and then via the Spokane Falls &amp; Northern branch line for the remaining distance. Between 1899 and 1900, stamp mills were constructed at the Mountain Lion mine in the northwest part of camp and the Republic Mine in the south resulting in a brief period where all of the district&#x27;s ore was milled in the camp. The Mountain Lion Gold Mining company 100-ton mill used a combination of mercury plate amalgamation followed by MacArthur-Forrest cyanide leaching. However, because of much lower gold and silver recovery rates, combined with the soon to arrive rail lines, the mill was soon shut down. The 200-ton Republic mill processed the ore by first roasting the finely crushed ore, followed by cyanide leaching, with the first loads of ore being processed in October 1900.

In July 1901, the Republic mine and mill both shut down because of the milling cost, and a lack of enough profitable ore being recovered. Ores in the Republic District were noted to have increasing percentages of silver concentration in the lower portions of the ore bodies, and the Republic mill did not provide more than a 50% return on assayed ore value, dooming the mill. The Republic mine remained inactive until 1902 when the arrival of railroads in the town made mining profitable again. From 1902 to 1909, ore was freighted north to British Columbia and then west to smelters on the coast for processing, with periods where shipments up to of ore a week were regular.

The Republic mining District encompassing Republic and the surrounding areas, had no defined borders as of 1909 when the geologist Joseph B. Umpleby visited, but included six townships with a center &quot;a little west of the south end of Curlew Lake&quot;. At the time of the visit Republic was the most important mining camp in the county and the largest with a population of around 1,500.

===Eureka to Republic===
In July 1897, Philip Creasor built a two-story hotel at the townsite, originally called Eureka. This town site was platted on April 29, 1898, and the post office name changed to Republic, since there was already a post office named Eureka in the state of Washington. On May 8, 1900, a special election was held which approved incorporation of Republic, and J.J. Sullivan was elected mayor. The town was then officially incorporated on May 22, 1900, and had a population of about 1800. Two separate rail lines granted access to the area, Great Northern Railways Spokane Falls &amp; Northern branch line and the locally owned Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, commonly called the &quot;Hot air line&quot; from Grand Forks, British Columbia. During the summer of 1900, Swedish immigrant Charles E. Anderson first opened Anderson&#x27;s Grocery.

===Hot Air Line===

The Spokane and British Columbia Railway, originally the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, was a short lived standard-gauge private rail company based out of Republic operating between Republic, Grand Forks and Lynch Creek British Columbia. The line was locally known as the &quot;Hot Air line&quot;. The line began operation in 1902 as the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, before being bought out in 1916. The company was initially incorporated in 1901 with J. Stratton as president, with construction of the line between Republic and Danville, Washington at the United States-Canadian border being contracted to the Republic and Grand Forks Construction Company, itself owned by Stratton. The rail line paralleled the Great Northern spur line from Republic through Malo and Curlew, Washington to Danville. The northern line was initially surveyed by the Republic and Kettle River company, but they were forced to build on higher ground beyond the Great Northern land boundaries. On January 2, 1902, the railroad was also approved by the Secretary of the Interior to conduct surveying for a southern line though the Colville Indian Reservation along the Sanpoil River.

===Early entertainment===
During the early 1900&#x27;s, Republic was home to a regional Baseball team which traveled the northeast region playing other city teams such as those from Colville and Orient, Washington, plus Grand Forks, British Columbia. The city also had a brass band which would play at events such as Fourth of July celebrations which it would host with the baseball club. The Kettle River Journal of Orient reported August 1913 that the Republic Theater had been purchased by a new owner who renovated and remodeled it.

===1983 Republic hotel fire===
On December 4, 1983, around 6pm, fire broke out on north Clarke Ave and raged for over 2 hours before being extinguished. The starting point was thought to have been an upper back room in the Republic Hotel and cafe. It spread for half a block consuming the hotel, the state liquor store, &quot;The Republic News-Miner&quot; newspaper offices, and an unoccupied building. A radio shop at the south end of the block and a hardware store at the north end were smoke-damaged but spared. Fire crews from Curlew, Malo, Keller, and Tonasket all responded to the blaze.

===Modern era===
Republic&#x27;s prominence, initially brought on by the gold rush, started to fade as prospectors and those who supported the mining industry moved away. During the years between 1900 and 1910, the town lost over half its population. Despite this, mining has continued to be an important part of life in Republic, as gold is still mined for in the mountains surrounding the town. As of 2022, an estimated of gold had been recovered from northern Ferry County, with active gold exploration being conducted by Adamera Minerals Corporation who acquired property on Buckhorn Mountain near the Canadian border from Kinross Gold Corporation. As of the 2020s, the town of 1,100 is sustained mainly by those people in surrounding farms and ranches, miners who work at the local mine, and tourists looking for a quieter, slower pace of life.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Republic is located on a low shoulder of Klondike Mountain northwest of the Sanpoil River in a long graben valley. The valley is bordered by the Okanagan Highlands to the west and the Kettle River Range to the east.

===Climate===

Republic experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold winters, warm summers and fairly even precipitation year-round, with a drying trend in summer, though there is a secondary uptick in rainfall from April through June, unlike in much of the rest of the state.

The hot dry summers and valley airflow can result in wildfire smoke and haze shrouding the town and greater Sanpoil valley when large fires are burning in the region. A number of wildfires in the past 50 years have burned close to Republic in both the Okanogan Highlands and the Kettle River Range, including the 1988 White Mountain Fire, 2001 Mount Leona Fire, and the 2015 North Star fire.

<text>Basin City () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Franklin County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,092 at the 2010 census, up from 968 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The town of Basin City was laid out in the 1950s on land owned by dry-land farmer Loen Bailie. The town was established to support the local agricultural community which was being opened to irrigation through the Columbia Basin Project. The new settlers to the area consisted primarily of young farmers from Idaho and southwestern Oregon and World War II veterans, who received preferential status on the purchase of federal lands that were sold as part of the project. Early crops included sugar beets, alfalfa, corn, asparagus, wheat and barley. Later, potatoes, beans, carrots, and onions also became important, while sugar beet production stopped due to closure of a local sugar beet plant. A large number of orchards were planted, and the area is now a major supplier of the famous Washington apples. Cherries and other fruits are also produced locally.

==Geography==
Basin City is located in northwestern Franklin County at (46.591416, -119.149325). As the name implies, it lies in a basin. The land west of the town slopes gradually downward for about then rises abruptly by about at Basin Hill. Basin Hill extends about southwest of town to the Columbia River, where it forms the southern extent of the &quot;White Bluffs&quot; for which the town of White Bluffs was named. Basin Hill also extends to the north, where it is called Sage Hill and then rises a bit higher at Radar Hill, named for an old World War II radar base installed at the peak. A little further to the northwest lie the Saddle Mountains. The tallest peak visible from Basin City is Rattlesnake Mountain, about to the southwest on the opposite side of the Columbia River. However, from the top of nearby Basin Hill it is possible to see Mount Rainier, which lies approximately to the west in the Cascade Range. Bailie&#x27;s Lake, a small lake formed by irrigation runoff, lies to the northwest of town and provides opportunities for fishing and hunting.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Basin City CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Although the CDP itself is quite small, it serves as the heart of a much larger agricultural community extending for miles in all directions.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 968 people, 219 households, and 204 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 302.0 people per square mile (116.4/km2). There were 221 housing units at an average density of 69.0/sq mi (26.6/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 55.68% White, 0.62% Native American, 0.31% Asian, 20.76% from other races, and 22.62% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 76.14% of the population.

There were 219 households, out of which 68.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.7% were married couples living together, 13.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 6.4% were non-families. 4.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 1.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.42 and the average family size was 4.41.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 43.6% under the age of 18, 13.9% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 10.4% from 45 to 64, and 2.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 20 years. For every 100 females, there were 110.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.1 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $29,444, and the median income for a family was $31,071. Males had a median income of $23,438 versus $21,071 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $8,461. About 22.9% of families and 18.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.1% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Freedom Rodeo==
The Basin City Freedom Rodeo was first staged on July 4, 2020, as a peaceful protest against Washington State&#x27;s coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The Basin City Memorial Park rodeo grounds were restored specifically for the event after 40 years of not being used. The Bailie Memorial Youth Foundation donated the money for the restoration. Organizers spent a month leveling the rodeo grounds, installing bleachers, and putting in grass. The first event had two days of rodeo slack competitions, a parade, fireworks, and a dance with open mouth kissing. The Freedom Rodeo is now an annual event.

<text>Connell () is a city in Franklin County, Washington, United States. The population was 5,441 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early settlement===
Prior to 1883, the area known as Connell was used by ranchers as open range for cattle and horses. The community was established in 1883 as a junction between the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. The new town was called Palouse Junction by Jacob Cornelius Connell, a railroad official and resident. Palouse Junction was unique on the Ainsworth—Spokane line, in that it was not on a river. It was also the gateway to the Palouse via the OR&amp;N&#x27;s line to Washtucna. Water for trains and for the town was from public wells dug by the railroad. At some time between 1886 and 1900, the town was renamed to Connell.

The Northern Pacific Railroad ceased service to the station in 1890, but the Union Pacific Railroad took over the station in 1901, and the town began to grow again. A school district was formed sometime between 1900 and 1904. In 1902 the Franklin County Bank was Incorporated in Connell, and the Connell Land and Improvement Company was established. Also in that year, the county allowed a franchisee to begin piping in water for the town. The attempts to bring water into the town were found lacking and the following year a well was dug that hit water at . In 1903, lots on the west side of the tracks were sold, and a new commercial district began to grow; a number of existing buildings were moved to the new lots.

By this time, the town rivaled Pasco in importance in Franklin County. Unfortunately, much of the business district was destroyed by fire in July 1905. The destroyed sections were quickly rebuilt using brick. Connell was officially incorporated on November 28, 1910. Dryland wheat farming was the lifeblood of Connell through most of the twentieth century.

===Present day===
The primary industrial base is food processing, agricultural chemicals, and the Coyote Ridge Corrections Center, a minimum and medium-security correctional facility that is capable of holding 2600 offenders. The community is also home to the North Franklin School District where there is a high school, junior high, grade school and administration offices.

In 1998 the city approved a &quot;water system plan&quot; that would include the purchase of additional water rights to secure water for future growth in residential, commercial and industrial activities. By 2007, the water system plan was completed. New waterlines had been installed to replace aging pipes, reservoirs were upgraded and additional wells were brought into the system.

Continuing the community&#x27;s infrastructure overhaul, the city also rebuilt Columbia Avenue, the main thoroughfare, and reconstructed its industrial streets, and received a grant award to reconstruct a portion of Clark Street. This roadway connects the downtown to Highway 260 on the west side of town, and serves the junior and senior high schools and administration buildings for the school district. Several businesses have left the city and very few new businesses have been established.

==Government==
Connell has a strong-mayor form of city government. In 1989, Connell established the position of city administrator. As of January 2022, the mayor was Lee Barrow, and the city administrator was Cathleen Koch.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, Connell has a total area of , all of it land.

The site of the town is located in a depression formed by the convergence of Providence Coulee, coming from the north, Washtucna Coulee from the east, and Esquatzel Coulee to the southeast. Terrain rises a few hundred feet from the floor of the coulees to the higher land surrounding Connell. Ephemeral streams flow through these coulees. U.S. Route 395 passes through Connell, connecting the town with Interstate 90 at Ritzville to the northeast and Interstate 82 at the Tri-Cities to the southwest. State Route 260 begins a few miles west of Connell and passes through the town as it heads east along Washtucna Coulee to Washtucna.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Connell has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.
It is the least snowy city in Eastern Washington, on average.

<text>Kahlotus () is a city in Franklin County, Washington, United States. The population was 147 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
Originally named Hardersburg after Hans Harder who platted the town in 1902, the community was later renamed Kahlotus. The meaning of the word &quot;Kahlotus&quot; is uncertain. According to toponymist William Bright, the name derives from the Sahaptin placename /kalúːt&#x27;as/. The name is also thought to translate from another Native American word meaning &quot;Hole in the ground&quot;. A third possibility is that the town was named for a Palouse tribal chief and signer of the Yakima Treaty of 1855. His name appeared with various spellings, including Kohlotus, Quillatose (by future governor Isaac Stevens), Qalatos, and Kahlatoose.

==History==
The first organized settlement of Kahlotus was by German immigrants, imported by the railroads, in around 1880. Harder&#x27;s platting of the town coincided with the reinstatement of service on the Oregon &amp; Washington Railroad &amp; Navigation line between LaCrosse and Palouse Junction (now Connell), crossing the north end of town parallel to present-day Highway 260. Soon after, the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway began construction on a second railroad on the south shore of nearby Kahlotus Lake, including tunnels through the basalt cliffs near the southeast corner of town.

Kahlotus was officially incorporated on May 31, 1907. The town boomed during construction of the railroad, local legend claims that nearly 20 saloons, a bank, newspaper, brothels, and other businesses appeared to serve the rail crews.

Dryland farming has historically constituted the majority of the local economy. Relatively little irrigated agriculture occurs in the area, supported by local wells. The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project does not deliver water to Kahlotus.

In 1969, the initial phase of the Lower Monumental Dam was completed nearby, bringing more electricity and water for irrigation, but inundating the nearby Marmes Rockshelter. The dam also made the Snake River navigable, allowing grain to be barged downriver rather than being carried by train. Within a few years, the railroad through the north end of the valley was abandoned and removed. The Burlington Northern Railroad tracks along the south end of the lake bed and Devils Canyon were abandoned and removed in the late 1980s, and the right of way became part of the Columbia Plateau Trail State Park.

==Geography==
Kahlotus lies on the floor of Washtucna Coulee at the junction of three state highways. State Route 21 has its southern terminus in Kahlotus, from which it runs north all the way to the Canadian border. State Route 260 passes through Kahlotus as it follows the path of the coulee from Connell in the west to Washtucna in the east. State Route 263 has its northern terminus in Kahlotus, from which it extends through the Devils Canyon to the Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River six miles south of the city. The Columbia Plateau Trail passes through Kahlotus, entering the city from the east along Washtucna Coulee before turning south into the Devils Canyon.

Being located on the floor of a coulee puts Kahlotus at relatively lower elevation than the surrounding terrain. The steep walls of the coulee rise hundreds of feet dramatically to the north and south of the city center. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

===Kahlotus Lake===
Kahlotus Lake, near the east edge of town, was a highly alkaline, spring fed lake and was once a popular fishing spot full of bass and crappie. Several times in the early 20th century, the lake swelled with runoff and flooded the lower-lying portions of town. However, the lake shrank rapidly through the 1990s, and by 2000 only a small marshy area remained at the east end of the lake bed, far from town. Most likely, the lake disappeared due to a combination of several consecutive years of below average rainfall and increases in irrigation withdrawals within the valley.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Kahlotus has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Pasco ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Franklin County, Washington, United States. The population was 77,108 at the 2020 census, and estimated at 80,038 in 2023.
Pasco is one of three cities (the others being Kennewick and Richland) that make up Washington state&#x27;s Tri-Cities region, a mid-sized metropolitan area of approximately 303,622 people.

==History==

On October 16, 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in the Pasco area, at a site now commemorated by Sacajawea State Park. The area was frequented by fur trappers and gold traders. In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway was built near the Columbia River, bringing many settlers to the area. Pasco was officially incorporated on September 3, 1891. It was named by Virgil Bogue, a construction engineer for the Northern Pacific Railway after Cerro de Pasco, a city in the Peruvian Andes, where he had helped build a railroad. In its early years Pasco was a small railroad town, but the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam in 1941 brought irrigation and agriculture to the area.

Due largely to the presence of the Hanford Site (which made the plutonium for the &quot;Fat Man&quot; nuclear bomb used on Nagasaki in 1945), the entire Tri-Cities area grew rapidly from the 1940s through 1950s. However, most of the population influx resided in Richland and Kennewick, as Pasco remained primarily driven by the agricultural industry, and to a lesser degree the NP Pasco rail yards. After the end of World War II, the entire region went through several &quot;boom&quot; and &quot;bust&quot; periods, cycling approximately every 10 years and heavily based on available government funding for Hanford-related work. Farming continues to be the economic driver for most of the city&#x27;s industrial tax base.

Pasco was not a sundown town in the same way as Richland and Kennewick, however Jim Crow laws restricted African Americans to living only on the east side of the railroad tracks, which was largely underdeveloped without public water or garbage service. In the 1940s, Edward R. Dudley visited as an investigator from the NAACP and observed widespread discrimination from businesses and law enforcement. In a 1947 survey, black residents listed water supply and service as the most significant problem for the area, and racial discrimination as second. White residents listed over-crowded schools as the most significant problem, and the presence of blacks as second. In 1948, Hazel Scott was refused service at a Pasco restaurant and successfully sued the owners for discrimination, bringing national attention to racial segregation practices in the Tri-Cities.

Pasco completed one of its largest annexations, comprising to the northwest, in August 1982 amid a legal dispute with neighboring Richland that was decided by the Washington Supreme Court. In the late 1990s, foreseeing another Hanford-related boom period, several developers purchased large farm circles in Pasco for residential and commercial development. Since that time, Pasco has undergone a transformation that has not only seen its population overtake the neighboring city of Richland, but also has resulted in growth in the city&#x27;s retail and tourism industries. Recently incorporated land on the West side of the city has exploded into new housing tracts, apartments, and shopping centers. This area of the city has become referred to locally as &quot;West Pasco&quot;, distinguishing it from the older area of town to the East. In addition to an influx of new residents to the region, many residents of the Tri-Cities have moved from Richland and Kennewick to West Pasco due to its central location and virtually all-new housing and business. In early 2018, plans were announced for 5,000 to 8,000 new residences in West Pasco, west of Road 100.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

As Pasco is located in Southeastern Washington, the city lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. As a result, the area is a windswept desert, receiving little precipitation throughout the year. Hot summers, warm springs, and cold winters provide a stark contrast to other areas of the state. Climate data is sparse, as there is no functioning weather station in the city; more reliable data is provided by the weather station in nearby Walla Walla.

The Columbia River borders the south side of the city, separating it from the neighboring cities of Richland and Kennewick.

== History ==
The area now known as West Pasco was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Yakama, Walla Walla, and Umatilla peoples. These tribes relied on the Columbia River for fishing, trade, and transportation, developing complex societies with cultural and traditions centered around the river. European exploration in the region began in the early 19th century, with the Lewis and Clark Expedition passing through in 1805. This marked the beginning of increased interaction between Native American tribes and European settlers. By the mid-19th century, the establishment of Fort Walla Walla and subsequent agricultural development led to more permanent settlements in the area.

The modern development of West Pasco accelerated during the mid-20th century, primarily due to the establishment of the Hanford Site as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. The Hanford Site&#x27;s role in producing plutonium for nuclear weapons brought a substantial population increase to the Tri-Cities area, including Pasco. To accommodate the growing workforce, residential subdivisions were constructed, and West Pasco began to expand significantly.

In the post-war era, infrastructure development such as roads, schools, and public facilities supported the expanding population. The region&#x27;s agricultural roots remained strong, with local farms producing a variety of crops, including wheat, potatoes, and later, wine grapes. The Columbia Basin&#x27;s favorable climate and fertile soil proved ideal for viticulture, and the area has since become one of the premier wine-producing regions in the United States.

<text>Pomeroy is the county seat of Garfield County, Washington, United States and is the only incorporated city in the county. The population was 1,389 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Pomeroy has a total area of , all of it land.

U.S. Route 12 in Washington serves as the primary highway through town, connecting Pomeroy with the Lewiston–Clarkston metropolitan area (to the east) and the Tri-Cities metro area/Walla Walla area (to the west). The city is 1,857 ft above sea level in the very hilly region between the Blue Mountains (to the south) and the Palouse region (to the north). The primary highway through town passes over Alpowa Summit (2,785 ft) only a few miles east of town.

==History==
The Nez Perce trail existed in the area before history was recorded, and the first written record of caucasians passing through the area were Lewis and Clark in 1805. Captain Benjamin Bonneville also passed through the future site of the town while he was surveying for the US government in 1834. In 1860, an Irish settler named Parson Quinn settled just east of present-day Pomeroy, and lived there for the next 40 years. Rancher Joseph M. Pomeroy purchased the land in 1864, and platted the town&#x27;s site in May 1878.
Pomeroy was officially incorporated on February 3, 1886. The town has been the seat of Garfield County since 1882, despite fierce competition in the 1880s with neighboring towns Pataha and Asotin. The county was split in October 1883, and the city of Asotin was named the county seat of the new Asotin County, Washington, leaving the debate about Pomeroy&#x27;s status as county seat for Garfield County to continue. The debate continued through both houses of the Washington Territorial Legislature in for the remainder of 1883 to Governor William A. Newell of the Washington Territory, and eventually reached the United States Congress in 1884.

Despite a city ordinance which mandated fire-proof materials for downtown buildings after fires in 1890 and 1898, on July 18, 1900 a blaze destroyed half of the small town&#x27;s business district. The recovery took two years as the destroyed buildings were rebuilt using brick which led to a building boom for the small community. In 1912, the city voted to outlaw the manufacture or sale of alcohol. The prohibition quickly led to rampant bootlegging and corruption which lasted until the 21st Amendment passed in 1933.

On August 21, 2003, following efforts by the Pomeroy Historic Committee, a 10-block section of the Downtown Pomeroy Historic District was placed on the National Historic Register.

<text>Electric City is a city in Grant County, Washington. The population was 956 at the time of the 2020 census. The community was named for its proximity to the power source at Grand Coulee Dam.

==History==

Electric City was established in 1934 as one of several settlements around the future site of the Grand Coulee Dam that aimed to house construction workers. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped at Electric City during his tour of the dam site later that year; by August, 500 lots had been platted for the town. Some of the earliest buildings in Electric City had been relocated from nearby Osborne, which was inundated by Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake following the dam&#x27;s completion. A post office was created for the settlement in June 1935 and was followed by a school a year later.

Electric City was incorporated as a fourth-class city on August 4, 1950, following a vote on July 8. The 1950 U.S. census counted a population of 1,472 people in the Electric City area a few months before the election. A group of residents contested the validity of the incorporation and appealed to the Grant County&#x27;s superior court, which did not overturn the incorporation.

==Geography==
Electric City is located near the northern end of the Grand Coulee (now filled by Banks Lake) in northern Grant County, Washington. It is southwest of the Grand Coulee Dam and the city of Grand Coulee, and connected to both by State Route 155.

<doc id="137915" wikidata="Q1507694" url="?curid=137915" title="Ephrata, Washington">
<text>Ephrata ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Grant County, Washington, United States. Its population was 8,477 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Ephrata was officially incorporated on June 21, 1909 and was given the county seat for the newly created Grant County.

The settlement of Ephrata is quite recent. There was no known settlement until 1886, just three years before Washington gained statehood. The horse rancher Frank Beezley was the first to settle near the natural springs, thus the area was known as Beezley Springs. As the climate and topography were not promising to settlement, the entire region remained sparsely populated until several federal congressional actions, including the Northern Pacific Land Grant Act, the Homestead Act, and Desert Claims Act, encouraged the settlement of this semi-arid desert-like area. Originally, Douglas County spread over the entire territory of the Big Bend of the Columbia River. In 1909, the Washington State legislature divided it, creating Grant County. When the time came to present arguments to the state legislature regarding which town should be the county seat, someone apparently intentionally intoxicated the representative of a rival community, and Ephrata was chosen.

It is generally believed that the city was named Ephrata by a man who worked for the Great Northern Railway. The name Ephrata is derived from a biblical description of an orchard in the middle of the desert. It is also the ancient name for the town of Bethlehem.

The region was known at the turn of the century for the great herds of wild horses that roamed the land. Horse trading was an important element of the local economy, and Ephrata served as the staging area for the horse round-ups. The last &quot;Grand Horse Round-up&quot; was held in Ephrata in 1906. Ephrata then developed as a trade and service center for cattle and sheep ranches in the area until the construction of the Columbia Basin Reclamation Project.

In 1939, one of the state&#x27;s longest runways was built at Ephrata Municipal Airport and served the U.S. Army Air Corps until 1945, when the field was turned into a commercial airport. The airport and hangars were used in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Always,&quot; the final movie to feature Audrey Hepburn.

Ephrata was in the national spotlight in a segment on &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; after the 2003 murder of Craig Sorger by Evan Savoie and Jake Eakin. The two accused were the youngest defendants in state history to be tried as adults.

Grant County Public Utility District has its headquarters located in Ephrata.

===Columbia Basin Irrigation Project===
Beginning in July 1918, several prominent Ephrata residents started the promotion of a plan to redirect waters of the Columbia River in order to irrigate the dry but fertile soils of the Big Bend country. Labeled &quot;The Dam University&quot;, Ephrata residents persistently lobbied at the local, state, and federal levels to gather support for the project. Initial funding for the Grand Coulee Dam was through the Public Works Administration created under Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s promise of a &quot;New Deal&quot; in 1933. However, the irrigation waters would not be released as the nation focused on ending World War II during the 1940s. During this era, Grand Coulee Dam&#x27;s main mission was to produce electricity for the Hanford Reservation and for aluminum manufacturing, vital to military aircraft production. When the war ended, the Project returned to its original mission, to irrigate the desert.

===Population growth===
The construction of the Irrigation Project and the military activity increased the population of Ephrata by a factor of eight between 1940 and 1960. As the federal projects phased out, the town experienced a population decrease of 22% between 1960 and 1975. The population stabilized between 1975 and 1982, with a slight decrease between 1980 and 1990. The city has seen steady population growth since 1990. The present population is 7,110.

==Geography and climate==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Ephrata has a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;).

==History==
George began as a large irrigation district between Quincy and Moses Lake. In the early 1950s, the need for a town to support the local agriculture business was evident, and the Bureau of Land Management agreed to for this purpose. The sole bid was that of a local pharmacist, Charlie Brown, who invested his own money into the venture and solicited planning help from a University of Washington instructor. The plan included streets, utilities, etc.

When filing the papers for the town with the BLM, Brown decided that the town should be named after the first President of the United States, George Washington.

The citizens of the town have named their streets after varieties of cherries grown in the area, such as Bing and Royal Anne.

The town was officially incorporated on November 4, 1957, at a ceremony including Governor Albert Rosellini and a cherry pie.

<text>Marlin—officially the Town of Krupp—is a town in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 49 at the 2020 census, the lowest of any incorporated municipality in Washington. Although legally incorporated as Krupp, the town is more commonly known as Marlin, which is the name of its post office. Elections are held there under the name of Marlin, Washington, and they are the same locale.

==History==
First settled in 1871 by Henry Marlin, the townsite was originally a cattle ranch that was later surrounded by wheat farms. The Great Northern Railway was built through the area in 1892 and placed a station, which was named Krupp—allegedly for a local German family. Its plat was filed in 1902 by George Urquhart, a Scottish immigrant who bought land rights and cattle from Marlin. The area was then settled by families who emigrated from Iowa and incorporated as the town of Krupp on January 7, 1911, despite not meeting the population threshold of 300 residents needed for incorporation.

A post office was established in 1918 under the name of &quot;Marlin&quot;, following a request from local residents to avoid using Krupp amid anti-German sentiment during World War I. The name was associated with Krupp, a well-known munitions plant in Germany. From then on, the town was primarily known by the name of its post office, but officially remains Krupp; both names are also used on some signs.

In the summer of 1971 a three-day rock festival, &quot;Sunrise &#x27;71,&quot; was scheduled to take place immediately south of town, but was shut down by county authorities. It was to be on the scale of Woodstock, with an estimated attendance of 50,000 people.

Krupp/Marlin lost its lone school in 1970 and would eventually lack a filling station, grocery store, or restaurant. By 1983, it had 27 total homes and no formal municipal services. It is the smallest incorporated place in Washington, with only 60 residents in 2000. The community was noted for its Hutterites, who resided in colonies in the surrounding farmland.

==Geography==
Krupp is located along Crab Creek in eastern Grant County, approximately northeast of Moses Lake. It is on the north side of State Route 28. The city has 10 streets, centered around its main street, Urquhart Avenue, and is surrounded by gravel roads.

<text>The National Day of the Republic of China, also referred to as Double Ten Day or Double Tenth Day, is a public holiday on 10 October, now held annually as national day in the Republic of China (ROC, commonly known as Taiwan). It commemorates the start of the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 which ultimately led to the establishment of the Republic of China on 1 January 1912, and the collapse of the imperial Qing dynasty, ending 2,133 years of imperial rule of China since the Qin dynasty. The day was once held as public holiday in mainland China during the Mainland Period of the ROC before 1949. The subsequent People&#x27;s Republic of China continues to observe the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution at the same date but not as a public holiday, which emphasize more on its revolutionary characteristics as commemoration of a historical event rather than celebration to the founding of the Republic of China.

Following the consequence of the Chinese Civil War, the ROC government lost control of mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island of Taiwan in December 1949. The National Day is now mainly celebrated in Taiwan Area, thus the name “Taiwan National Day” is also used by some groups, but it is also celebrated by many overseas Chinese communities.

==Names==
Double Ten Day can be referred to variety of names such as the National Day of China or Chinese National Day when the ROC was in power in mainland China and as the internationally recognized government of &quot;China&quot; until the 1970s. Another name Taiwan National Day, is also used but in dispute as the ROC was founded in 1912, contemporarily Taiwan was ruled by Japan. The name &quot;Taiwan National Day&quot; has been criticized by former ROC president Ma Ying-jeou.

==Celebration in Taiwan==
During the establishment of the Republic of China, Taiwan and Penghu were under Japanese rule, which began in 1895. In 1945, after surrender of the Empire of Japan in World War II, Taiwan and Penghu were placed under the control of the ROC.

In Taiwan, the official celebration begins with the raising of the flag of the Republic of China in front of the Presidential Office Building, along with a public singing of the National Anthem of the Republic of China. It is then followed by celebrations in front of the Presidential Office Building; from time to time, a military parade may occur. Festivities also include many aspects of traditional Chinese and/or Taiwanese culture, such as the lion dance and drum teams, and cultural features coming from Taiwanese aborigines are integrated into the display in recent years. Later in the day, the president of the Republic of China would address the country and fireworks displays are held throughout the major cities of the island. In 2009, all government sponsored festivities for the Double Ten Day were cancelled, and the money intended for the festivals (NT$70 million) were reallocated for reconstruction of the damage done by Typhoon Morakot.

In 2022 former President Ma Ying-jeou, who opposes the styling of the holiday as Taiwan National Day, publicly called for current President Tsai Ing-wen to stop using the name Taiwan National Day in material associated with the holiday. His view was criticized by Robert Tsao as obsolete. 

Because of the lack of direct relations between the origin of the holiday and Taiwan in modern Taiwan the holiday is widely believed to be slightly absurd but is still widely celebrated.

===National Day Military Parade===

Traditionally, the Republic of China Armed Forces (ROCAF) have staged a military parade. During prior parades, troops and equipment march past a reviewing platform in front of the Presidential Office Building. Typically, foreign ambassadors, military officers, and other representatives and dignitaries are invited to view the parade. Following the National Anthem and the firing of a 21-gun salute, the parade commander, a general-ranked officer of any of the service branches of the ROCAF, would then be driven to the front of the grandstand to request permission from the President to commence the parade proper. Until 1975, the President also inspected the parade formations while riding a vehicle, as each battalion of the parade formations presented arms in the presence of the President and all the unit colours and guidons also dipped in their presence. After all the units in the ground column marched past the grandstand, they would reassemble at the center of the road for a holiday address delivered by the President to the ROCAF and the country, marking the close of the parade.

The parade has been held intermittently during the period of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The military parade on 10 October 1949, was the first public military parade held in Taiwan with Chen Cheng serving as the Grand Review Officer. The 1964 National Day parade was struck by tragedy when a low flying air force F-104 Starfighter fighter aircraft struck a Broadcasting Corporation of China tower, causing the plane&#x27;s fuel tank to fall and kill three people including a woman and her baby in front of the Central Weather Bureau building in downtown Taipei. The other two remaining F-104 aircraft were ordered to look for the crashed aircraft and accidentally collided and crashed in Tucheng City, Taipei County (now New Taipei City), killing both pilots. The parade was not held again until 1971 (the 60th anniversary), while the mobile column and flypast segments returned in 1975. When Chen Shui-bian became president, the parade was not held until 2007 and then it was entitled a &quot;Celebration Drill&quot; and not a traditional military parade. Since Ma Ying-jeou became president, one parade has been held on the centenary celebrations of the Double Tenth Day, and another on the 105th, the only one under Tsai Ing-wen&#x27;s presidency.

The tradition of shouting &quot;Long live the Republic of China!&quot; () at the end of the addresses by the president of the Republic of China was not held for the first time in 2016. It was also the very year that fire and police services joined the parade for the first time in history, breaking the tradition of an exclusively-military parade to include personnel from civil uniformed services.

=== Full order of march past for National Day Parades until 1991 ===

Until 1991, following the opening report by the Parade commander, usually a lieutenant general or vice admiral of the ROCAF, the massed military bands of the ROC Armed Forces, led by the Senior Drum Major, would take their positions in the parade, playing the ROC Armed Forces March, a medley of the official songs of the service branches of the armed forces. Then the parade would march past, in the following sequence, with minor variations over the years:

==== Ground column ====

* ROC Armed Forces Joint Honor Guard
* Parade commander and staff
* Joint Division of Armed Forces Academies
** Republic of China Military Academy 
** Republic of China Naval Academy
** Republic of China Air Force Academy
** National Defense University College of Political Warfare Instruction
** ROC Air Force Institute of Technology
** Chung-cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School
** Army Academy R.O.C.
* Contingent of personnel from the service branches
** ROCA combined divisional formation
** Composite brigade of ROCN personnel (including Republic of China Marine Corps)
** Composite group of ROCAF ground and air defense personnel
** Republic of China Military Police
** Republic of China Joint Logistics Command
** Reserve and militia formations of the Republic of China Armed Forces Reserve
* Female battalion of the College of Political Warfare Instruction
* Drum and Bugle Corps of military educational institutions
* Taiwan Police College (formed part in past parades of the 1970s and 1980s)

==== Flypast ====

The parade&#x27;s flypast segment was for many years organized in like manner as in the Bastille Day military parade. First, while the honor guard departs from the presidential grandstand the training, fighter and transport aircraft of the ROC Air Force, the transport and anti-submarine aircraft of ROCN Naval Aviation and transport planes of ROCA Army Aviation fly past first, followed by the helicopters of all three service branches, together with those of the National Police Agency, National Fire Agency and Coast Guard Administration after the ground column segment is concluded.

==== Mobile column ====

The mobile column, for many years, served as a crowd favorite of National Day civil-military parades, since in this segment the ROC shows off to its people the advanced and modern military equipment and vehicles in service and those being introduced, many of them nationally produced, for use by the servicemen and women of the ROCAF, and since 2016, the state civil security institutions. As in every parade, the ROCMP&#x27;s motorcycle column leads off the mobile column segment, followed by (as of 2016):

* ROCN mobile column
** Republic of China Marine Corps
*** Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit
*** Amphibious Armor Group
** Coastal and air defense formations of the Republic of China Navy
* Republic of China Air Force mobile column
** Air defense guns and missiles
** Equipment and materiel, including air to air missiles
* Mobile column of ROCA formations and equipment (order as of 1991, 2007, 2011 and 2016 parades)
** Anti-tank weapons
** Signals
** Armored cavalry
** CBRN defense
** ROCA Corps of Engineers
** Motorized and mechanized infantry
** Armored formations
** Logistical and combat support
** Air defense and missiles (mobile missile and gun systems and truck-towed systems)
** Towed guns of the field artillery
** Self propelled artillery (MRLs and self-propelled guns)
** Disaster risk and response vehicles and equipment for calamity response operations
* National Police Agency
** Criminal Investigation Bureau vehicles and equipment
** NPA National Highway Police
** Mobile vehicles of the NPA&#x27;s Special Police Corps
* National Fire Agency vehicles and equipment
* Coast Guard Administration small marine equipment and vehicles

Alongside the military and civil security mobile column, in the parades of the 70s and 80s and in more recent parades, a civil mobile column is present, composed of vehicles from the automobile and truck companies, state-owned firms, and the private sector.

==Celebrations outside the Republic of China==
=== Mainland China and special administrative regions===

As the Chinese Communist Party became the official government of mainland China in 1949, 10 October is now celebrated in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution and the Wuchang Uprising.

The former British colony of Hong Kong celebrated the ROC National Day as a public holiday until the government of the United Kingdom cut its diplomatic relations with the ROC Government as London recognized Beijing in 1950, shortly after the PRC&#x27;s founding and it was postponed. The former Portuguese colony of Macau had celebrated the ROC national day as a public holiday until the government of Portugal cut its relations as Lisbon recognizes Beijing in 1979. After the civil war in mainland China, the National Day was celebrated in regions inhabited by Chinese patriots who remained loyal to the Republic. Before the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC in 1997 and Macau also transferred in 1999, many ROC supporters there would display patriotic and colourful flags (mainly the national flag of ROC) to celebrate the National Day. Taiwan agencies in Hong Kong and Macau have annually held a public ceremony to celebrate the National Day of ROC with members of pro-ROC private groups. The day continues to be celebrated in Hong Kong and Macau after the transfer of sovereignty to the mainland, but the national flags publicly shown have been removed by Police of Hong Kong since July 1997 and by Police of Macau since December 1999. Flag-raising ceremony at Hung Lau, Tuen Mun, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionary base, is the most noticeable yearly event, organized by Johnny Mak. Since 2020, the event was celebrated as the PRC&#x27;s Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution rather than the ROC&#x27;s Double Ten Day in line with the holidays in mainland China. Chris Tang claimed in September 2021 that celebrations in Hong Kong for Double Ten Day could risk breaching the national security law. The event in Macau is commemorated under the name of the Xinhai Revolution Memorial Day.

===Other countries===

Overseas Chinese played a key role in the birth of the ROC since the nation&#x27;s founding father Sun Yat-sen, a medical doctor by training, received financial support mainly from the overseas Chinese communities abroad to overthrow the imperial Qing dynasty and establish the second republic in Asia in 1912. Outside Taiwan, the National Day is also celebrated by many Overseas Chinese communities. Sizable National Day parades occur yearly in the Chinatowns of San Francisco and Chicago.

<text>Moses Lake is a city in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 25,146 as of the 2020 census. Moses Lake is the most populous city in Grant County. The city anchors the Moses Lake Micropolitan area, which includes all of Grant County and is part of the Moses Lake–Othello combined statistical area.

Moses Lake, on which the city lies, is made up of three main arms over long and up to one mile (1.6 km) wide. It is the largest natural body of fresh water in Grant County and has over of shoreline covering . Before it was dammed in the early 1900s and then incorporated into the Columbia Basin Project, Moses Lake was a smaller shallow lake. To the south of the town is the Potholes Reservoir and the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge that has a number of seep lakes and vast amounts of migratory birds and other fauna natural to the area.

==History==

Before the construction of Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in 1941 and Moses Lake Army Air Base in 1942 the area was largely barren. Native Americans knew the area as Houaph, which meant willow. Chief Moses was leader of the Sinkiuse tribe from 1859 to 1899, and was forced to negotiate with white settlers who began to settle in the area in the 1880s. Under pressure from the government, Chief Moses traded the Columbia Basin land for a reservation that stretched from Lake Chelan north to the Canada–US border. The government later traded again for what is now the Colville Indian Reservation.

The new settlers named the lake in honor of Chief Moses. The city was originally named Neppel, after a town in Germany where one of the original settlers had lived. The first settlers established fisheries and farms — some of the first exported items were carp, jackrabbits and fruit — but irrigation attempts failed and settlers left at about the same rate as they came. When the town was incorporated and renamed Moses Lake in 1938, the population was estimated at 302 people.

The arrival of the air base in 1942 and irrigation water pumped from Grand Coulee Dam in 1955 offered newcomers a reason and a way to settle in an area that previously had little to offer other than good fishing and a place to water sheep and cattle. Moses Lake was quickly transformed into a hub for a vast region where transportation, agriculture and recreation came together.

The air base was built to train World War II pilots to fly the P-38 Lightning and B-17 Flying Fortress, two planes that were essential to the war effort. The base was closed after the war ended, but reopened in 1948 as a U.S. Air Force base and test area for Boeing&#x27;s B-47 Stratojet and B-50 Superfortress.

The B-47 tests led to development of modern commercial jetliners still used today. Fighter jets were stationed there to protect Grand Coulee Dam to the north and the Hanford site to the south. Boeing still uses the airport as a test and evaluation facility for its aircraft. Japan Airlines used the airport as a training area from November 1968 until March 2009. The old air base is now owned by the Port of Moses Lake and is home to Grant County International Airport, Big Bend Community College and several businesses.

Farmers, meanwhile, had developed new methods to irrigate water from the lake and from the Columbia River and began planting expansive irrigated acreage. When the Columbia Basin Project began to deliver water to the area in the mid-1950s, farms expanded by thousands of acres, growing potatoes, corn, onions, carrots and sugar beets.

In little more than a decade, Moses Lake&#x27;s population grew from 300 to 2,679 in 1950. Today, the population is 25,146 (2020 census).

==Economy==
Moses Lake&#x27;s historic economic base has been agriculture, but now includes considerable manufacturing and technology. Several companies have moved to the area, including REC Silicon (one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of polysilicon, used in solar panels). Moses Lake has also attracted some alternative fuel companies, such as Washington Ethanol &amp; Washington Biodiesel.

BMW, in partnership with the SGL Group, began construction in July 2010 on a $100 million carbon-fiber manufacturing plant. The plant was designed to produce 300 tons of carbon fiber per year from a single production building, and began operations in 2011. In 2013, ground was broken for a second 300-ton building, bringing projected production to 600 tons per year. In 2014, a third 300-ton building was started. When the third building is completed, SGL Moses Lake will be the largest producer of carbon fiber in the world. Mitsubishi in 2016 announced that the company would use the port of Moses Lake for its new regional jet (MRJ) FAA flight testing. The testing will be completed by the end of 2018.

Several manufacturers of electric vehicle batteries have factories or research facilities in Moses Lake due to its proximity to hydroelectricity and silane processors for silicon. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded grants to fund the construction of plants for Group14 and Sila Nanotechnologies that are expected to open in 2024. Sila plans to expand from an initial workforce of 100 employees to 500 within a few years of operation at the factory, which will generate 20 gigawatts of battery capacity by 2026.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Moses Lake is bisected by two major highways that bypass the city center: Interstate 90 and State Route 17. State Route 171 and Interstate 90 Business serve the city&#x27;s downtown, connecting to the two highways.

===Rail===
The Columbia Basin Railroad is headquartered in Moses Lake and operates the city&#x27;s railroad. It is the busiest shortline railroad in Eastern Washington.

During the 1990s, a high-speed rail line between Seattle and Moses Lake was proposed, primarily to use Grant County International Airport as a satellite airport for the Seattle metropolitan area.

===Public transportation===
Moses Lake and Grant County are served by the Grant Transit Authority, which runs several bus routes within the city and intercity bus service to nearby Ephrata and other towns.

===Airport===
Larson Air Force Base, five miles from the city of Moses Lake, originally was named Moses Lake Army Air Base. It was activated on 24 November 1942 as a World War II training center. Major Donald A. Larson, for whom the base was later renamed, was from Yakima, Washington.

The Secretary of Defense announced on November 19, 1965, that Larson was to be closed by June of the following year. Larson Air Force Base, since renamed Grant County International Airport, is now a world-class heavy jet training and testing facility used by the Boeing Company, the U.S. military and NASA. The airport had hosted Japan&#x27;s national carrier, Japan Airlines, from 1968 to 2008 for the training of its pilots, co-pilots, and flight engineers due to lack of runway space at airports in Japan to do touch and goes with jumbo jets. Columbia Pacific Aviation now handles charter passenger service to and from Moses Lake. With and a main runway long, it is one of the largest airports in the United States.

Moses Lake is also served by the much smaller municipal airport, which has one runway.

==Sister cities==
Moses Lake has one sister city: Yonezawa, Japan. On August 7, 1978, the mayor of Moses Lake, Bob Hill, wrote a letter to Mayor Toshihide Cho of Yonezawa City, inviting Yonezawa to become a &quot;Sister City&quot; to Moses Lake. The 1981 group to visit Yonezawa City in May became the &quot;Official Delegation&quot; since it was during this visit that the &quot;Sister City Agreement&quot; between Yonezawa City and Moses Lake was signed by Mayor Bob Hill and Mayor Toshihide Cho on May 1, 1981. As part of the program, a small group of high school students from both cities are invited to take part in a cultural exchange. Since its inception, over 200 students and their family members from these two communities have taken part in this exchange. The two cities continue to exchange students every summer since 1981 and marked the 40th anniversary of this program on May 1, 2021.

There is a street named after Yonezawa in Moses Lake and a street named after Moses Lake in Yonezawa. The large hawk statue located on the west end of Yonezawa Boulevard is called an Otaka Poppo. These wood carvings, known as sasano bori, are special wood carvings unique to Yonezawa. These wooden dolls have been given as gifts to Moses Lake residents can be found on display around the city and on the campus of Big Bend Community College. Japanese lanterns, some which are gifts from citizens of Yonezawa, can be found around Moses Lake on Yonezawa Boulevard and inside the Japanese Garden.

==Economy==

===Farming===
Quincy has long had an agricultural economy, which was enhanced by irrigation made possible with the Grand Coulee Dam. Major crops include potatoes, wheat, and timothy grass. Orchards and vineyards are also displacing lower-value crops in the Quincy Valley.

An investigation into the dumping of toxic waste onto farmland and its relabeling as fertilizer in Quincy was the subject of the 2001 book &quot;Fateful Harvest&quot;.

===Technology===
Technology companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo!, Dell and Intuit have located large data centers within the Quincy area since 2007. Microsoft&#x27;s Columbia Data Center, built starting in 2006 and expanded several times, is said to be the world&#x27;s largest data center. The centers, attracted to the area because of its abundant and cheap hydroelectricity, have been criticized for dodging fines from the Grant County Public Utility District for overusing electricity and for creating air pollution through their diesel backup generators.

The data centers are incentivized by tax credits offered by the state of Washington to stimulate economic development in the city. Two additional electrical substations are being built to handle expected demand from current and future companies.

===Tourism===
Although George is the closest town to the Gorge Amphitheatre, Quincy is the closest town that offers services such as motels and a full grocery store. Quincy sees an uptick in population during concerts.

The semi-arid climate allows Quincy to go for weeks or months without rain during the summer. This makes nearby water recreation such as Crescent Bar a major draw.

<text>Soap Lake is a city in Grant County, Washington, on the shores of Soap Lake. The population was 1,691 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Soap Lake was officially incorporated on June 9, 1919.
This came to a halt during the Depression when drought hit Soap Lake. Because of the lack of water and money, the tourist trade dwindled. But, when Grand Coulee Dam was built, the irrigation canals brought new life into the area. Soap Lake has been internationally known during the past century for its uniquely mineral-rich (23) waters and mud. Many people believe the water and mud to be successful in treatment of a variety of ailments. From the early 1900s to the mid-1940s, there were a number of sanitariums located on Soap Lake.

These early versions of spas were used by visitors from all over the country and the world. When the sanitariums, hotels, and bath houses were full, people slept in tents, and even under their cars, in order to use the water of the lake. In 1933, the Veteran&#x27;s Administration sent nine veterans, under a special project, to Soap Lake for treatment of Buerger&#x27;s disease. In November 1938, McKay Hospital was completed. For a number of years, McKay was used as a research center for the study of the therapeutic effect of the water of the lake and the climate.

Soap Lake is located in the center of the state of Washington, 20 miles north of Interstate 90 between Seattle and Spokane, sitting in a desert environment with nine inches or less of rainfall per year and 320 days of sun. The current population is approximately 1,740 people. Soap Lake is formed at the end of a chain of lakes running down the center of the Lower Grand Coulee. The Lower Grand Coulee is over a mile and a half wide in places with sheer basalt rock walls rising 900 feet over the coulee floor. State Highway 17, Coulee Corridor-National Scenic Byway, runs through Soap Lake and up the floor of the canyon heading towards Grand Coulee Dam and Canada.

Of the five lakes existing along the Coulee Corridor, Soap Lake has the highest mineral content. The first layer of Soap Lake is made up of about 81 feet of mineral water; the second level is mud-like and consists of a stronger mineral composition with concentrations of unusual substances and microscopic life forms. The lake&#x27;s two layers have not mixed in thousands of years. The scientific community refers to lakes with this rare condition as meromictic. With only 11 meromictic lakes in the United States, Soap Lake is likely the most radical of all. The scientific community is currently exploring the lake to document some of the unusual qualities. The mineral content of Soap Lake water has been analyzed many times since the mid-1900s. The concentration of different minerals has changed throughout this time. The most recent analysis was conducted in 2000.

In 1950, Soap Lake became a city of Third Class. The population in 1952 was 2051, which grew to 2580 in 1955. At this time the lake was becoming increasingly diluted, due to the seepage of these same life-giving irrigation canals. The City Council petitioned the Department of the Interior to remedy this situation. The Bureau of Reclamation built several wells and pumps to intercept the seepage water, and the end of the 1950s diminished the dilution.

==Tourism==
The city is currently trying to attract tourism by attempting to revive the health aspect of the lake to attract the spa crowd. The minerals in the lake are said to have healing properties for Buerger&#x27;s disease. Two older brick buildings along the main street northbound have been renovated to house an art museum and a coffee shop.

Another tourism effort is to install a novel roadside attraction: a 52,000 pound (60 feet in height) lava lamp, formerly a Target advertisement in Times Square.
That effort was profiled in the 2010 documentary film, World&#x27;s Largest.

<text>Warden is a city in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,449 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Central Basin plateau was settled in the late 1800s by immigrants of Russian-German (Bessarabian) ancestry who homesteaded in the area and farmed dryland wheat. Prior to this the area had been inhabited by local Native American Salish tribes that had contact with the early Spanish and British traders. The Milwaukee Railroad arrived in the early 1900s and attracted additional settlers, including Doc Harris who established a drug and sundries store with physician services in Warden about 1905. The town&#x27;s name of &quot;Warden&quot; comes from its Bessarabian German heritage and means &quot;worthy&quot; or &quot;treasured&quot; as may be noted in the &quot;Das Deutsche Woerterbuch von Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm&quot;. A local tradition attributes the name of the town to Doc Harris&#x27;s son Ward. However, the area of the town was being referred to as &quot;Warden&quot; by its German settlers long before Doc Harris arrived, as may be noted in the &quot;Protokol&quot;, official church records in German of the original church which is today the Warden Community Church. Other nearby towns also carry Bessarabian German names such as Lind, Ruff, and Odessa. The Bessarabian German tradition of the town has long since vanished and has been mostly replaced with a mixed Anglo/Hispanic culture with a current population that is of roughly 72% Hispanic heritage.

In regards to the history of the present-day Hispanic populace, some of the families can trace their heritage back to the days of the earliest Spanish contact in the area. This first group predates the influx of Bessarabian German settlers by decades. A large number of Hispanics came to work in the fields that opened to more diverse agriculture after the federal Columbia Basin Project brought irrigation to the area. This second group of Hispanics came up from Texas, but they had roots in the villages around the city of Monterey, Mexico. They claim a distinct &quot;Tejano&quot; culture and have been in the US for generations already. The third group are the most recent arrivals that seem to come mostly from the West Mexican States of Jalisco, Sinaloa, and Sonora. They have a culture that is distinct from the &quot;Tejanos&quot; in many regards, including language, music, and food. Many in this third group still may speak only Spanish; whereas the other groups may be bilingual or speak only English already.

The Town of Warden was officially incorporated June 28, 1910. By 1917 the population of Warden reached 300. Electricity arrived in 1939, but the town&#x27;s population declined through World War II.

In 1945 the beginning of the Columbia Basin Project would bring irrigation water from Grand Coulee Dam to irrigate over of arid but fertile soil. In 1948 the federal government started selling government-owned farm units on the Columbia Basin Project to qualified applicants with preference to veterans. By 1954 the East Low Canal was finished. As a result of the project, the population of Warden grew from 322 in 1950 to 949 in 1960 to 1,639 in 1990 and has continued to grow to the current population of about 2,600.

<text>Wilson Creek is a town in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 204 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area around Crab and Wilson creeks were inhabited by Native American peoples until the arrival of settlers in the late 19th century. The town was originally known as &quot;Nanum Creek&quot; and was renamed after one of the first pioneers to the area, who settled there in 1886. John Marlin and the Urquhart Brothers established their homes in the area in 1870s and were followed by a military road connecting Fort Walla Walla to Camp Chelan that passed near the area. A railroad was built through the area in 1892. Wilson Creek was platted in 1903 and officially incorporated on May 8, 1903.

When Grant County was created in 1909, Wilson Creek was its largest town with around 600 people. The town grew little, however, and by the mid-20th century had been surpassed by Ephrata and Quincy. Despite the slowing of growth, Wilson Creek established a port district in March 1960. The Port of Wilson Creek is home to an airport, which was renovated in 1984 and again in the 2000s when updates were made to the runway.

==Geography==
Wilson Creek is located alongside a creek of the same name. Crab Creek, into which the aforementioned creek flows, runs along the southern side of the town. Just west of town along Crab Creek are Billy Clapp Lake and the Pinto Dam, both of which are part of the extensive Columbia Basin Project. State Route 28 passes immediately south of the town site as it follows the valley of Crab Creek, connecting Wilson Creek to Soap Lake to the west and Odessa to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Aberdeen ( ) is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 17,013 at the 2020 census. The city is the most populous in Grays Harbor County and the region&#x27;s economic center, bordering the cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis. Aberdeen is occasionally referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula&quot;.

==History==
Samuel Benn, a New York City native, established a homestead on the Chehalis River in 1859 and later platted a town at the site named Aberdeen. According to accounts collected by historian Edmond S. Meany, the name has two possible origins: from the Ilwaco-based Aberdeen Packing Company, which opened a cannery on the homestead in 1873; or from the Scottish city of Aberdeen, named by an early settler who had lived in Scotland. Like the Scottish city, Aberdeen is a port settlement situated at the mouth of two rivers—the Chehalis and the Wishkah. An earlier name for the settlement was Heraville, which was recorded by Benn.

The city was founded by Samuel Benn in 1884 and incorporated on May 12, 1890. Although it became the largest and best-known city in Grays Harbor, Aberdeen lagged behind nearby Hoquiam and Cosmopolis in its early years. When A.J. West built the town&#x27;s first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been in business for several years. Aberdeen and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending at one of the established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through Cosmopolis and headed west for Ocosta. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens together built a spur; in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to Aberdeen.
By 1900, Aberdeen had become home to many saloons, brothels, and gambling establishments. It was nicknamed &quot;The Hellhole of the Pacific&quot;, as well as  &quot;The Port of Missing Men&quot; due to its high murder rate. One notable resident was Billy Gohl, known locally as Billy &quot;Ghoul&quot;, who was rumored to have killed at least 140 men, disposing of the bodies in the Wishkah River. Gohl was ultimately convicted of two murders.

Aberdeen was hit hard during the Great Depression, with the number of major local sawmills reduced from 37 to 9. By the late 1970s, most of the area had been logged and the remaining mills closed during the next decade. By the early 1990s, the industry was decimated due to resource reduction. Local political and business leaders ignored this fact and did not pursue economic diversification. 

Aberdeen is also the home port of the tall ship &quot;Lady Washington&quot;, a reproduction of a smaller vessel used by the explorer Captain Robert Gray, featured in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;.

==Geography==
Aberdeen is at the eastern end of Grays Harbor, near the mouth of the Chehalis River and southwest of the Olympic Mountains. Grays Harbor is notable as the northernmost ria on North America&#x27;s Pacific Coast because it has remained free of glaciers throughout the Quaternary due to unfavorable topography and warm temperatures. It is thought that, during glacial periods of the Quaternary, the Chehalis River was a major refugium for aquatic species, as was the west coast from the Olympic Peninsula southward for plants that later formed the northern part of the Pacific temperate rainforest in formerly glaciated areas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Aberdeen experiences a climate on the boundary between Mediterranean (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) and oceanic (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). Although rainfall is extremely high between October and March, July and August still have a distinct excess of evaporation over rainfall. Temperatures are generally very mild due to the proximity of the warm Pacific Ocean and the Kuroshio Current. Snow is very common but usually light, with one exception being December 1964 during which fell. Occasionally, southeasterly winds can cause very high temperatures. For example, in August 1981, the temperature in Aberdeen reached .

==Industry==
Aberdeen and the rest of Grays Harbor remain dependent on timber, fishing, and tourism industries and as a regional service center for much of the Olympic Peninsula. Grays Harbor Community Hospital employees total more than 600 workers.  Historically the area is dependent on harvesting and exporting natural resources. The Port of Grays Harbor is the largest coastal shipping port north of California. It is still a center for the export of logs on the west coast of the U.S. and has become one of the largest centers for the shipment of autos and grains to China and Korea.

On December 19, 2005, Weyerhaeuser made plans to close the Aberdeen large-log sawmill and the Cosmopolis pulp mill, and the closures took effect in early 2006.  This resulted in the loss of at least 342 jobs.  In January 2009, Weyerhaeuser closed two additional plants in Aberdeen, resulting in another 221 lost jobs.  In both cases many employees were not told by Weyerhaeuser management, but learned about the closures from local radio stations who received a press release prior to a scheduled press conference.

Major employers in Grays Harbor include Westport Shipyard, Sierra Pacific Industries, the Quinault Indian Nation, The Simpson Door Company, Hoquiam Plywood, Pasha Automotive, Willis Enterprises, Ocean Gold Companies, Vaughn Company, and the Stafford Creek Corrections Center, a state prison which opened in 2000.

Other significant employers include the cranberry-growing cooperative Ocean Spray, worldwide retailer Walmart, Sidhu &amp; Sons Nursery USA, Inc. (AKA Briggs Nursery), Overstock.com, and Washington Crab Producers.

In 2007, Imperium Renewables of Seattle invested $40 million in the construction of the biodiesel plant at the Port of Grays Harbor.  It is estimated the plant will produce as much as of biodiesel fuel made from plants and vegetable material annually.

In September 2010, the Weyerhaeuser Cosmopolis Pulp Mill was purchased by the Beverly Hills-based Gores Group and restarted as Cosmo Specialty Fibers, Inc. They started production of pulp on May 1, 2011.

===Retail===
The city had two indoor shopping malls that were developed in the 1970s and early 1980s. The Wishkah Mall east of downtown Aberdeen opened in August 1976 on the riverfront and was followed in August 1981 by the South Shore Mall, which was south of the Chehalis River. The newer South Shore Mall had and space for 80 retailers, including anchor tenants Sears and J.C. Penney following their relocation from downtown. It was renamed to the Shoppes at Riverside in 2016 and closed on February 13, 2021, following an engineering report that found the soil under the foundation had settled and would pose structural risks. A movie theater and fun center remain open in two of the four anchor spaces at the mall, which is owned by Coming Attractions Theaters.

==Education==

The city&#x27;s school district has two high schools: J. M. Weatherwax High School, or Aberdeen High School as it is now called; and Harbor High School, an alternative high school with an enrollment exceeding 200 students.  Aberdeen High has a long-time school sports rivalry with nearby Hoquiam High School.

In 2002, the Weatherwax building of Aberdeen High School, built in 1909, burned to the ground in an act of arson. The new building was completed in 2007 and held its grand opening on August 25, 2007.

Aberdeen School District also consists of one junior high: Miller Junior High; five elementary schools: Central Park Elementary, McDermoth Elementary, Stevens Elementary, AJ West Elementary and Robert Gray Elementary; and one Roman Catholic parochial school: St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School.

Aberdeen is home to Grays Harbor College, located in south Aberdeen, and is represented by the Charlie Choker mascot.  The college emphasizes student opportunities and has resources to help students transfer to a four-year college to complete a degree.

Aberdeen has the largest public library in Grays Harbor County, which is operated as part of the Timberland Regional Library system. The city originally had a Carnegie library that was opened in 1908 and replaced in 1966 by the current building, which underwent extensive renovations in 2000.

The city&#x27;s museum was located in a historic armory building that was built in 1922. The building and the museum&#x27;s collections were destroyed in a major fire in June 2018, including an exhibit on Nirvana. It was the latest of several major fires to have affected Aberdeen.

<text>Brady is a census-designated place (CDP) in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 692 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Brady was named in honor of John Brady, an early settler in the Chehalis Valley. Brady had a farm roughly a mile north of the present location of the Brady Food Mart.

The Chehalis River valley south of Brady was the first part of this area to be settled, by the Smith, Twidwell and Foster families in the late 19th century. Andrew Jackson Smith settled his homestead beginning in 1851. The Smith, Foster and Twidwill families are all related. At that time the Chehalis River was the only means of transportation in and out of the area, so these homesteads were staked out on the riverfront. Subsequent road construction led in the 1930s to paving through Brady of a two-lane highway, at the time called Highway 410, connecting the Pacific coast with U.S. Highway 101 at Olympia. This road is now referred to as the Monte-Elma Road. A four-lane, divided freeway connecting Interstate 5 at Olympia to Aberdeen was built through the Brady area in the mid-1960s. The section passing through the Brady area is part of U.S. Route 12.

The greater Brady area relates to the boundaries of the now-defunct Brady school district, bounded on the east by the Satsop River, on the north by the Grays Harbor County line, on the south by the Chehalis River, and on the west by the boundary with the Montesano School District at Camp Creek. Today, these boundaries roughly correspond to Grays Harbor Fire District No. 2, which is served by the Brady Volunteer Fire Department.

The school at Brady, known as Olympic View School, was consolidated with the Montesano School District in 1968. Prior to this consolidation the school was the social hub of the community. The school house was sold to a private drug abuse rehabilitation charity called the Harvester Foundation. The school playshed, which had been converted to residential housing, burned in a case of suspected arson in the mid-1970s. Two children did not escape, and their bodies were later recovered from the ashes from beneath the remains of a completely incinerated bed. The schoolhouse was later demolished.

==Geography==
Brady is located in southeastern Grays Harbor County between Montesano to the west and Satsop to the east. U.S. Route 12, running through the southern part of Brady, leads west to Aberdeen and southeast to Grand Mound, while Olympia is to the east via US 12 and State Route 8.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Brady CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.37%, are water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 645 people, 239 households, and 185 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 90.6 people per square mile (35.0/km2). There were 257 housing units at an average density of 36.1/sq mi (13.9/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 95.97% White, 0.16% African American, 2.33% Native American, 0.16% Pacific Islander, and 1.40% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.24% of the population.

There were 239 households, out of which 35.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.2% were married couples living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.2% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.70 and the average family size was 3.03.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.9% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 28.1% from 25 to 44, 26.4% from 45 to 64, and 12.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.4 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $67,386, and the median income for a family was $72,750. Males had a median income of $45,764 versus $30,625 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $20,857. About 4.9% of families and 5.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 35.7% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Copalis Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 447 at the 2020 census.

The name &quot;Copalis&quot; comes from the Quinault language term /k&#x27;ʷpíls/. The Copalis are a Native American group. Both the Chehalis people and Quinault Indian Nation claim the Copalis are a subdivision of their tribe.

==History==

The Copalis Native Americans belong to the coastal division of the Salishan language family and historically occupied the area of Copalis River and the Pacific Coast between the mouth of Joe Creek and Grays Harbor. In 1805, Lewis and Clark estimated a population of 200 Copalis in 10 houses. The 5 individuals assigned to a &quot;Chepalis&quot; tribe in an enumeration given by Olson of the year 1888 probably refers to them.

The first non-Native American people settled in Copalis Beach in the 1890s. Copalis, along with the beach of the same name, has become famed as the &quot;Home of the razor clam.&quot; The community sits near the northern end of probably the greatest razor clam bed in the world for the flavor renowned variety abounds, apparently only in the Pacific Northwest, and particularly on Copalis Beach. During the commercial season, Copalis&#x27; normal population of about 350 persons, leaped fourfold.

During 1947 and 1948, commercial diggers took more than a million pounds of bivalves from Copalis Beach, earned themselves approximately $200,000.00 and brought huge additional sums to cannery men and workers. Tourists dug thousands of pounds more.

==Parks and recreation==
Cosmopolis is home to Mill Creek Park, a green space that contains a pond. Also listed as is Marenko Park, located on the city&#x27;s west side. A forested area, it contains a hiking trail.

==Economy==
In 2006, the Weyerhaeuser pulp mill in Cosmopolis shut down, costing the local community 245 jobs. Previously, in late 2005, the Weyerhaeuser large-log saw mill in Aberdeen closed, losing 95 jobs. In the late 2000s a biodiesel facility was being planned but the project did not materialize.

In late 2010, the mill was purchased by the Gores Group and renamed Cosmo Specialty Fibers, which manufactures specialty pulps and exports much of the product to Asia via the deep-water port in Aberdeen.

==Infrastructure==
As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy, a concrete, steel, and earthen dam was constructed on Mill Creek. Completed in 2018, the $3.1 million project replaced a 1913 dam that collapsed in 2008, forcing the closure of Mill Creek Park. While the old dam had hampered migrating fish, the new structure included fish ladders and local species of salmon and trout were recorded soon thereafter migrating past the dam.

<text>Hoquiam ( ) is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. It borders the city of Aberdeen at Myrtle Street, with Hoquiam to the west. The two cities share a common economic history in lumbering and exporting, but Hoquiam has maintained its independent identity. It shares a long rivalry with its more populated neighbor, especially in high school sports.

Hoquiam was incorporated on May 21, 1890. Its name comes from a Native-American word meaning &quot;hungry for wood&quot;, from the great amount of driftwood at the mouth of the Hoquiam River. The population was 8,776 at the 2020 census.

==History==
One of the first logging operations in Hoquiam was established by Ed Campbell in 1872.

About 10 years later, Captain Asa M. Simpson, a Pacific Coast mariner and businessman in the lumber industry from San Francisco, provided the financing for the Northwestern Mill. In 1881, Simpson sent his manager, George Emerson, to Hoquiam to establish a mill there, and Emerson purchased 300 acres for the new mill and lumber operation. By September 1882, the Simpson mill was producing its first lumber products.
In 1886, Captain Simpson merged his mill with the Miller Brothers mill, also located in Hoquiam, and named it the Northwest Lumber Company. The mill was later renamed the Simpson Lumber Company, and retained that name until 1906. In 1913, Frank J. Shields became the new manager at the mill at Hoquiam.

The extension of the railroad from Aberdeen to Hoquiam, beginning in 1898, contributed to the continued importance of logging and lumber in Hoquiam. The importance of logging and related products continued to be relevant to Hoquiam&#x27;s economy, and in 1927, a pulp mill was established under the name of Grays Harbor Pulp Company. A year later, a Pennsylvania company- the Hammermill Paper Company- became interested in Grays Harbor Pulp Company. When the Pennsylvania company bought stock in the Grays Harbor Pulp Company, the Grays Harbor pulp Company built a paper mill and became the Grays Harbor Pulp &amp; Paper Company. In 1936, the Grays Harbor Pulp and Paper Company merged with Rayonier Incorporated, a company which manufactured a certain kind of wood pulp used by its customers to produce rayon.

In 1907, Hoquiam was home to Industrial Workers of the World Industrial Union No. 276.

Victories included non-league wins over Lincoln High of Tacoma, Bellevue High, two over archrival Aberdeen High, and a win over a touring team from Australia. It was the only game the Australians lost during their tour.

In 2006, the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) changed the enrollment limit for the 2A classification allowing Aberdeen to drop to 2A along with other schools in the area creating a new league. The old league football rivalry which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006 was renewed with the 101st meeting between Hoquiam and Aberdeen on October 14. Hoquiam Grizzlies won 20–6.

==Infrastructure==

===Flood control===
As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy, Hoquiam received a new pump house to replace an ineffective, aging pump. Completed in 2018 at a cost of $1.3 million, the modernized station protects the community&#x27;s northern residential area, including the Lincoln Elementary School, and is considered a vital infrastructure project for future levee builds, known as the North Shore Levee and the North Shore Levee West Segments. Pipelines that direct the flow of floodwaters were also replaced. The combination of the pump station and levee projects is calculated to eventually remove flood insurance requirements for homeowners and businesses in the neighborhood. During a January 2022 flood, the rebuilt station pumped a combined of water without fail over 30 consecutive hours. Due to the improvements, it has been estimated that the city would gain an 11:1 ratio on the return on investment, including a 2:1 ratio for damages avoided during a future flood event.

===Transportation===
The local airport, Bowerman Airport , is coastal Washington&#x27;s only jet-capable airport. It has a 5,000-foot (1,524 m) runway and a parallel taxiway located on a narrow peninsula extending westward into Grays Harbor. Hoquiam is also home to dozens of species of migratory birds that nest along the water&#x27;s edge during the milder months.

As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy&#x27;s Aquatic Species Restoration Plan, the Middle Fork Wildcat Creek, a Cloquallum Creek tributary in McCleary, received attention to restore natural fish passages for spawning salmon and trout. The project included the removal of 3 culverts, replacing them with bridges over the creek. The culverts also caused local flooding due to debris buildup. The 2022 project cost a combined $1.7 million, including over $400,000 from the county, and expanded forest and aquatic habitat on the Middle Fork by over .

<text>Moclips is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 211 at the 2020 census. It is located near the mouth of the Moclips River.

According to Edmond S. Meany, the word &quot;moclips&quot; comes from a Quinault word meaning a place where girls were sent as they were approaching puberty. However, according to William Bright, the name comes from the Quinault word meaning simply &quot;large stream&quot;.

==History==

Although settled earlier by homesteaders such as Steve Grover in 1862, Moclips was not incorporated until 1905 with the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway and the first Moclips Beach Hotel built by Dr. Edward Lycan. The hotel was a two-story, 150-room beachside resort. It burned down in 1905, just months after it was completed. Dr. Lycan then had a new, larger hotel built on the same site. It was three stories high, a block long, and loomed from the dunes. This Moclips Beach Hotel was completed in 1907 and advertised as having 270 &quot;outside&quot; rooms, with of covered veranda, and a perfect view of the Pacific Ocean, reported to be just from the hotel grounds. 
Moclips grew into a sizable town with restaurants, hotels, a candy store, theater, canneries, and the M.R. Smith Lumber and Shingle Mill. Many hotels, schools, canneries and shingle mills were quickly built. Four schools once taught children from Taholah to Ocean Shores. Class schedules for the local schools were based on the clamming tides. Two of these buildings exist today.
In 1911 Moclips was struck by a series of fatal storms, eventually washing much of the town away. The Moclips Beach Hotel stood in pieces. By the end of 1913, there was nothing left of the hotel. Fires destroyed much of Moclips along the beach. In 1948 a hilltop welding accident destroyed many homes and businesses.

The U.S. Navy and Air Force made the neighboring town of Pacific Beach their home during World War II. The Navy still occupies property along the bluff in Pacific Beach - now a recreational use center for the military.

<doc id="137953" wikidata="Q987133" url="?curid=137953" title="Montesano, Washington">
<text>Montesano is the county seat of, Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 4,138 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
===Medcalf Prairie===
According to Edwin Van Syckle, a portion of the present-day town of Montesano was first platted in 1870 by Samuel Henry Williams, who purchased land in what was known as Wedcalf Prairie, named after the early settler William Medcalf. At about the same time, surveyor Charles Newton Byles bought a farm from Walter King on the present-day site of Montesano on April 9, 1870, and later platted three blocks on the west side of Main Street. The town of Montesano was born, but it was not incorporated until November 26, 1883, by the Washington Territorial Legislature.

===South Montesano===
Prior to that time, the name &quot;Montesano&quot; was used to refer to the homestead of Isaiah Lancaster Scammon and his wife Lorinda. They filed a 640-acre Donation Land Claim on January 15, 1853, on the Chehalis River, opposite the mouth of the Wynoochee River, in the area now referred to as South Montesano. The Scammon home was often referred to as &quot;Scammon&#x27;s Landing&quot; or &quot;Scammon&#x27;s Hotel&quot;, because it was an important stopping point along the Chehalis River for early pioneers, and the furthest up-river mooring point and railroad junction for seagoing ships.

According to Edmond S. Meany, in 1860 the seat of what was then called Chehalis County was moved to &quot;the place of J.L. Scammons&quot;. Mrs. Lorinda Scammon was very religious and wished to have the place named &quot;Mount Zion&quot;. Another early settler, Samuel James, suggested &quot;Montesano&quot;, which was derived from Spanish meaning &quot;mountain of health&quot;; it was said that this had a more pleasant sound and meant about the same. The suggestion was approved, and soon after, a post office was secured with the name &quot;Montesano&quot;. The people of Chehalis County voted to move the county seat to the platted town of Montesano in 1886, and the Scammon home was then known as South Montesano.

===21st century===
In 2012, a man calling himself Michael Thomas entered the county courthouse where he struggled with a deputy sheriff, shooting her in the shoulder with her own gun. He also stabbed in the neck a judge trying to assist the deputy. Later identified as Steven Daniel Kravetz, the assailant was convicted on assault charges and acquitted of attempted murder.

==Geography==
Montesano is on the north slope of the Chehalis River valley, near the confluence of the Wynoochee River and Chehalis River. The town is bordered on the north by Lake Sylvia and on the west by Sylvia Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and relatively dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above and very wet autumns and springs due to the maritime winds. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Montesano is in a region of oceanic climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfb&quot; on climate maps due to frequent summer rainfall, even though there is a significant drying trend during that season. The summer highs are hotter than in Aberdeen courtesy of its inland position. This also renders frequent but most often minor frosts in winter, with the climate retaining a significant maritime influence.

===Historic buildings and sites===

A prominent feature of the town is the 1911 Grays Harbor County Courthouse, a three-story structure with a domed tower. The interior features murals of local history. There is a dent in the front door made by the sheriff as he fired at a fleeing felon. The motto &quot;come on vacation and leave on probation&quot; was coined for this Grays Harbor County city.

==Parks and recreation==
In the northern part of the town is Lake Sylvia State Park. Wynooche Valley Road is a route that travels north from Montesano and follows the course of the Wynoochee River; it forms an access way to the southern Olympic Mountains and the southern quarter of Olympic National Park.

==Infrastructure==
The city was a recipient of the installation of flood control measures near Montesano&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant. As part of the Chehalis Basin Strategy, log jacks were placed during 2018-2019 that helped increase the riverbank of the migrating Wynoochee River, which was threatening the plant that during flooding would have inundated the community with sewage runoff. The $2 million cost of the project was estimated to have saved over $40 million in future cleanup and containment efforts. The fortification increased the habitat of aquatic species and extended the operating life of the plant by several decades.

<text>Oakville is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. It was incorporated in 1905, with booming lumber, railway, and farming industries creating the early foundation of the community. The population was 715 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1818, the United States and Great Britain agreed to a treaty of joint occupancy in the Oregon Country, which included the land that would eventually become Oakville, Washington. Over the next several decades, citizens of the United States began to settle in the area. As traveling by boat was easier than moving through the dense forests, many used the river system, entering from the port of Grays Harbor and canoeing inland via the Chehalis River. The British government gave full ownership of the area to the United States in 1846.

In 1850, the land in the area was mainly open prairie, maintained by yearly fires started deliberately by local tribes, which kept the forest from encroaching and which encouraged the bloom of camas, a staple food, and other plants. The prairie lands were attractive to settlers arriving in the area, helped by the indigenous people, and towns began to be platted up and down the Chehalis River.

In the 1870s, a party of several families relocated to the area from Crawford County, Illinois. The leader of the party, James Reed Harris, had purchased the donation claim for the area from John Hole for $1200. He applied for a post office, and after some discussion, it was decided to use the name &quot;Oakville,&quot; inspired by the Garry oak trees in the area. The post office opened on December 31, 1873.

Logging and railroad construction soon brought other settlers to the area; the plat of the city site was filed on September 27, 1887. Around 1890, Northern Pacific Railway was laying tracks through the city. By the turn of the century, a Northern Pacific train station had been established in the city, and the area had several general stores, a new school, and a couple of hotels. Oakville was officially incorporated on December 18, 1905.

In 1909, a report by the Railroad Commission of Washington described Oakville:
&quot;Oakville is a town of about 400 inhabitants, located on the line of the Northern Pacific trailer in the center of an important lumbering and taking district. The timber resources of this section are of immense value and the bottom lands are well adapted to general farming. Oakville is a growing town and will develop more rapidly as the resources of the surrounding district are more thoroughly exploited.&quot;

Lumber was a major industry in the early days of the city; in 1916, Oakville Lumber Company, Big Fir Lumber Company, Vance Lumber Company, and others were in operation, along with the Callow Mill. The city was &quot;noted for large shipments of cascara bark.&quot; Factories were also part of the city&#x27;s economy, with the E.H. Hilton &amp; Co. Oiled Clothes Factory in operation by 1915, and the Oakville Co-Operative Cheese Company incorporating a few years later.

The historic Oakville State Bank was incorporated on August 14, 1909 by C.R. Harper and C.C. Scates. The bank changed names and ownership several times over the next century. It is said to be the last bank in Washington to be robbed by a rider on horseback. Other businesses in the early days of the city included a jewelry store, a shoe company, and a hardware store. 

The city&#x27;s librarian Clara Trudgeon had been appointed by the State Traveling Library by 1908, making Oakville eligible to be a recipient of one of the 150 cases of books the state had in rotation. The weekly newspaper was &quot;The Oakville Cruiser.&quot; By 1919, the city had an active community center, and the high school had received accreditation as a four-year school.

===Oakville blobs===

On August 7, 1994, a resident reported that a translucent, gelatinous substance had rained down in the night; she expressed concern that it may have caused her and her mother to become ill, and speculated it may have been the reason her kitten died. When the substance, colloquially known as &quot;Oakville blobs,&quot; appeared again, samples were collected and tested by a local doctor, who initially stated that the substance contained human blood cells. Further testing by the Department of Ecology refuted these results, as tests showed that there were no nuclei present. Several theories were given by residents, including wondering whether the substance might have been waste from a commercial plane toilet or whether it may have been particles of deceased jellyfish that had evaporated and been incorporated into a rain cloud. The blobs were also found to contain two species of bacteria. There are no remaining testing samples of the blobs.

The incident received coverage in several media outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and a segment was produced about the event for an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Monsters and Mysteries in America&quot;,

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Oakville is on the northern shore of the Chehalis River, just downstream from the convergence of the Chehalis and Black Rivers. This is an area subject to annual flooding, with major floods occurring most recently in 2007 and 1996. Both of these floods were federally declared disasters due to the extensive damage to human life, livestock, and property in the region. In 2016, the Chehalis River Basin Flood Authority authorized $55,000 to be used to collect data, geography, and history on the flooding in the city, which reports indicated to be affecting approximately 35 homes and causing on average three road closures per event, with this flooding occurring typically twice a year.

To its north, Oakville is bordered by the hills of the Capitol State Forest. The area is filled with hills, valleys, rivers, and dense forests.

The original Oakville elementary school, built in 1953, began to be demolished in November 2021 after a bond program to rebuild and renovate the school system campus was passed in 2020. The $5.6 million measure covered the cost of a new elementary building and help to refurbish several areas at the high school. A separate, small schools modernization grant of $4.6 million covered additional upgrades on the campus. Additional programs, funded separately from the construction bond by business, charity, and government grants, were implemented during the time, such as the beginnings of a preschool curriculum, additional building upgrades and renovations, and the creation of a library at the elementary building. The new school was completed and opened in late 2022.

<text>Ocean Shores is a city in Grays Harbor County, Washington, United States. The population was 6,715 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 7,549.

==History==

The City of Ocean Shores occupies the Point Brown Peninsula on the Washington coast. Long before the arrival of European explorers and settlers, the peninsula was used by the various local tribes for trading and other purposes. The Chinook, Chehalis, and Quinault tribes used the area, as well as others that now make up the Quinault Indian Nation.

On May 7, 1792, Captain Robert Gray sailed into the bay and named the area Bullfinch Harbor. Later, Captain George Vancouver renamed the area Grays Harbor after Captain Gray. The first established white settler on the Point was Matthew McGee, who settled in the early 1860s. He sold the southern portion of the peninsula to A.O. Damon in 1878 for a trading supply center whose dock extended into the Oyehut channel. A.O. Damon took over the entire peninsula from McGee, and the land was passed along to his grandson, Ralph Minard, who used the area as a cattle ranch from 1929 until he sold to the Ocean Shores Development Corporation in 1960 for $1,000,000.

At the time the Washington State legislature was considering legalizing some forms of gambling. In expectation of a huge casino development, the Ocean Shores Development Corporation opened their sale of lots in a travel trailer parked in the dunes. Soon the word spread about the California-style development of the place called Ocean Shores. Lots began at $595 and were sold sight unseen from the first plat maps. As the numbers of lots sold rose, the prices rose. Property lots were staked and numbered only as the road construction crews began to lay out the massive road system. Even though the first roads were only in length, the downtown area had mercury vapor lights to show that this was a booming city. In the first year 25 homes were constructed and their owners had charter membership certificates in the Ocean Shores Community Club.

As the development grew, the Ginny Simms Restaurant and Nightclub brought in the Hollywood set. In fact, on its opening night, chartered planes flew up a whole contingent of Hollywood stars, and 11,000 people turned out at Bowerman Basin to see the celebrities.

By December 1960, of canals were planned, a six-hole golf course was drawing players, and the mall shopping area was ready for the 1961 Ocean Shores Estates construction boom. The mall, 100 motel units, three restaurants and an airstrip sprang up from the sandy ground, with the marina opening in 1963. The SS &quot;Catala&quot; was brought up from California to become a &quot;boatel&quot; and charter fleet office. Two years later a southwest winter storm drove her into the sand and for many years she was the most famous shipwreck on the Washington Coast. In 1966 the gates to the city were installed.

Pat Boone became a local resident in 1967 as a stockholder in Ocean Shores Estates Incorporated, and promotion of the development was sped along by the Celebrity Golf tournaments hosted by Boone.

By 1969, Ocean Shores was declared the &quot;richest little city&quot; per capita in the country, with an assessed valuation of $35 million and 900 permanent residents. The following year the city was incorporated and a planning commission was formed to zone the city and codify streets. The city&#x27;s first school opened in 1971 and road paving began in earnest.

During the 1970s, the town struggled through many setbacks brought on mainly by the state&#x27;s economic recession. By the 1980s, the slump was over and construction of homes and businesses accelerated again.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Ocean Shores experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), with tendencies towards a Mediterranean (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), notably the pattern of a wetter winter and moderately drier summer.

The climate is similar to nearby Aberdeen, situated slightly farther inland, but Ocean Shores experiences a narrower range of temperatures and is significantly less susceptible to extremes of heat in the summer, caused by hotter, inland air masses being pushed into the region.

A group of young Asian-American men who were visiting Ocean Shores spent that July 4 weekend there when they were attacked by a group of white men. One of the Asians, Minh Duc Hong, fatally stabbed Chris Kinison, who was from the Ocean Shores area. Hong was arrested and tried for manslaughter. His trial ended in a hung jury, 11–1 in favor of acquittal; prosecutors decided not to retry the case.

The latter name is for a U.S. Army fort established in 1860 before the town was founded, &quot;ts-a-lis&quot; is the Lower Chehalis word for Westport, meaning &quot;place of sand&quot;. Early explorers pronounced the word &quot;Chehalis&quot; and gave this name to the river and the people living up river who later became the Chehalis people or &quot;People of the Sands&quot;. The area was used regularly during the summer by local Native American tribes (most likely the Shoalwater Bay Tribe, comprising Willapa Chinook and Lower Chehalis people) before Thomas Barker Speake and his family arrived early in the summer of 1857. Westport is also the home to a station for the US Coast Guard. 

===Tsunami shelters===
In 2016, the Ocosta School District became the first in North America to build a publicly funded vertical tsunami shelter, located at Ocosta Elementary School. Measuring , the structure is joined with the school, can hold 1,000 people, and is built to withstand a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. The $13.8 million project was funded by a local bond.

A $15.2 million grant, with a 10% match by Westport, was awarded from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the city in 2023 for the construction of a community tsunami evacuation tower that is scheduled to be ready in 2026. Capable of also holding 1,000 people, the tower is planned to be part of a larger park complex near the town&#x27;s marina and will stand around tall. With plans to add an additional three towers in the future, Westport also received a $2.0 million grant to complete a communications network that would continue to operate during a catastrophic event.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

A weather station in Grayland, a community just south of Westport, has recorded conditions in the area going back to 1948. The area is generally mild and wet, with November through January having especially high levels of rainfall (averaging over for each of those months) and little or no snow. (See Grayland, Washington for climate data.)

<doc id="137964" wikidata="Q1515068" url="?curid=137964" title="Clinton, Washington">
<text>Clinton is a community and census-designated place (CDP) located on southern Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 956. The local post office, however, serves approximately 2,500 people in surrounding areas.

Clinton is the western terminus of the Mukilteo–Clinton ferry operated by Washington State Ferries, which serves Whidbey Island. The ferry carries State Route 525, which continues through Clinton to the rest of Whidbey Island. Much of Clinton is situated on a high bluff overlooking Saratoga Passage on Puget Sound. The community of Columbia Beach, however, rests at sea level. To the north of the ferry dock is old Clinton, where the community started.

== History ==
Whidbey Island was originally inhabited by Coast Salish tribes, including the Suquamish, Swinomish, Lower Skagit, and Snohomish. Clinton, was primarily inhabited by the Snohomish tribe. There were three main Snohomish villages in southern Whidbey: D’GWAD’wk (Digwadsh), TSEHT-skluhks, and SHET’LH-shet-lhuts. The Digwadsh, meaning &quot;in the basket,&quot; was the largest of these villages. It had about seven longhouses and frequently welcomed visits from neighboring tribes like the Duwamish and Suquamish. Today, many descendants of the Digwadsh live on the Tulalip Reservation.

The local tribes built cedar-plank longhouses and lived off the island&#x27;s natural resources, including berries, fish, and other local bounty. European contact began in the late 18th century with the arrival of explorer George Vancouver. By the late 1800s, more settlers began to move to Whidbey Island, bringing diseases that tragically decimated many Native populations. In northern Whidbey, Colonel Isaac N. Ebey became the island&#x27;s first permanent white resident.

Clinton was initially known as Brighton Beach but was later renamed Clinton, possibly after the Clinton family, some of the area&#x27;s earliest settlers. By the late 1800s, Clinton developed a reputation for its milling and logging industries. The early town centers included the old Clinton Union Store, the Post Office, and the Salisbury Shingle Mill.

Mukilteo–Clinton ferry service began in 1911 as a passenger ferry and transitioned to a car ferry by 1919, significantly improving access to South Whidbey Island. Before that, traveling to Whidbey Island by road, via the Deception Pass Bridge, could take over an hour. Boats were also essential for delivering mail and supplies to the island. The ferry service initially operated under the Black Ball Line of the Puget Sound Navigation Company and was later acquired by the Washington State Department of Transportation, creating Washington State Ferries (WSF), now the largest ferry system in the U.S. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (73.84%) is water. The community&#x27;s coastline and bluff terrain offer panoramic views.

== Economy ==
The economy of Clinton, along with the surrounding Island County, is driven by a combination of tourism, service industries, agriculture, and small-scale manufacturing. Outdoor activities, such as boating, hiking, and beach activities, draw visitors to the area.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, Clinton had a population of 956 people and 507 total households. The average age in the community was 49.5 years old, with 32.4 percent of residents over the age of 65. The racial makeup of Clinton was 86.0% non-Hispanic white, 0.05% Black, 0.09% Native American and Alaska native, 2.7% Asian, 0.01% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, and 1.2% other. Multi-racial people made up 8.5% of the population. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 3% of the population.

According to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey, approximately 57% of Clinton residents are U.S. citizens and 5.8% are foreign-born. The median household income stood at $69,570 in 2022. Approximately 13% of Clinton residents have an income below the poverty line. Clinton residents largely commuted by car, with an average commute time of 37.1 minutes.

==Landmarks==

The Sno-Isle Regional Library System has a library in Clinton, supported by the &quot;Friends of the Clinton Library&quot;. There are two grocery stores in Clinton, one in the downtown area and another a few miles west.

<text>Coupeville is a town on Whidbey Island, in Island County, Washington, United States.

It is the county seat of Island County. The population was 1,942 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Coupeville and the bay in which it is located, Penn Cove, was inhabited by the Lower Skagit, a Lushootseed-speaking Coast Salish people. There were three villages around the bay, with the largest being at &quot;bəc̓adᶻali&quot;, meaning &quot;snake place&quot;, the site of present day Coupeville. There was an abundance of salmon, clams, and other resources, as well as offering easy access to the water, making it an excellent village site.

When Europeans arrived to explore the Puget Sound, it was Joseph Whidbey who first visited the bay, naming it Penn Cove in honor of his good friend. Captain George Vancouver later wrote after meeting the Skagit at the village that their population had quickly fallen due to disease.

Coupeville was laid out in the 1850s by Captain Thomas Coupe, and named for him.

Coupeville was officially incorporated on April 20, 1910.

Coupeville is a historic district within the federal Ebey&#x27;s Landing National Historical Reserve.

<text>Freeland is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States. At the time of the 2020 census the population was 2,252. The town received its name based on its origins as a socialist commune in the early 1900s: in the eyes of its founders, the land of the town was literally to be free for all people. Some of the first settlers were veterans of a prior experiment in socialism, the nearby Equality Colony.

==History==

Some Equality Colony dissidents, led by George Washington Daniels, incorporated the Free Land Association in 1900 and established the colony on land they purchased through James P. Gleason of the Fidelity Trust company. Members purchased dividend-paying shares in the association store fund and the machinery fund. The association store operated according to Rochdale Principles, and shares in the store were sold to non-residents as well as association members. Because members could pay for their land with dividends from their shares, the founders considered the land to be &quot;free&quot;. By 1902, however, the colony announced that new settlers would have to purchase land outright, as the idealistic land-financing plan based on share dividends had not worked.

Daniels platted five-acre tracts with wide streets to form the original townsite. Additional plats were added over the next several years.

Freeland considered itself a cooperative profit-sharing association and rejected the rigid communal structure of other colonies on the island. They described themselves to the &quot;Whidby Islander&quot; as &quot;simply a settlement of socialists co-operating on semi-capitalistic principles.&quot;

During its early years, Freeland had no local school, sending its children three miles across the island to Useless Bay. The lack of roads contributed to the isolation of the colony, although Daniels&#x27; son-in-law, John H. Prather, purchased several boats to provide freight and passenger service between Freeland and Everett, the nearest town on the mainland.

==Geography==
Freeland is located on the southern part of Whidbey Island. The community sits on a mile-wide isthmus between the south end of Holmes Harbor, a inlet of Saratoga Passage, and Mutiny Bay on Admiralty Inlet. It is located on the 48th parallel north.

Washington State Route 525 passes through Freeland, leading east to Clinton and northwest to SR 20 at Keystone. Oak Harbor is north of Freeland via SR 525 and SR 20.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Freeland CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 4,329 people, 785 households, and 652 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 390.4 people per square mile (150.9/km2). There were 664 housing units at an average density of 197.4/sq mi (76.3/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 94.4% White, 0.5% African American, 1.0% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.4% from other races, and 2.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.7% of the population.

There were 561 households, out of which 27.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.3% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.4% were non-families. 26.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34 and the average family size was 2.79.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 21.9% under the age of 18, 4.8% from 18 to 24, 28.2% from 25 to 44, 30.2% from 45 to 64, and 14.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.4 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $78,409, and the median income for a family was $67,212. Males had a median income of $99,205 versus $75,708 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $84,968. About 1.1% of families and 2.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.9% of those under age 18 and 6.1% of those age 65 or over.

==Outdoor recreation==
Double Bluff Beach and State Park is a popular site on the south side of Whidbey Island, south of Freeland. The beach offers of shellfish harvesting and at times total solitude along the shores of Useless Bay and Admiralty Inlet to the north of the Puget Sound.

South Whidbey State Park, northwest of Freeland, provides beach access and forested trails through a mixture of second growth and old growth timber.

Freeland Park on Holmes Harbor on the north side of town has beach access, boat ramp, boat moorage, picnic tables, children&#x27;s playground, and an annual Third of July fireworks celebration.

Holmes Harbor Golf Club is an 18-hole, par 64, public golf course with views of Holmes Harbor.

<text>Langley () is a city in Island County, Washington, United States. It sits at the south end of Whidbey Island, overlooking the Saratoga Passage. The city&#x27;s population was 1,035 at the 2010 census, while the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for Langley&#x27;s post office had a population of 4,878. By the 2020 census, the population increased to 1,147 people. Langley proper only covers , but its ZCTA extends for .

Langley has been home to the Snohomish people since time immemorial. For centuries, people came to the site of Langley to camp during the summer months, and there was a village nearby at Sandy Point (), which, as of 1792, was inhabited by about 200 people; however, the Snohomish were removed to the Tulalip Reservation in the late 1800s, and the village was abandoned. The modern settlement of Langley was founded in the 1890s by Jacob Anthes, and the town was incorporated in 1913.

Langley is served by South Whidbey Fire/Emergency Medical Services, the Langley Police Department, and South Whidbey School District #206; the school district offices are located there.

==History==

=== Pre-contact ===
Indigenous peoples, namely the Snohomish people, have inhabited south Whidbey Island since time immemorial. Langley is known in the Lushootseed language as , meaning &quot;gooseberry bush.&quot;

The site of Langley was a camping spot used during clam harvesting in the summer months. Nearby, there was a village of the , a Snohomish band, approximately one mile east of Langley on Sandy Point (). This village had a large potlatch house, which brought visitors, even as distant as the Samish, during festivities.

For centuries, warfare was uncommon in Puget Sound, and mainly retaliatory in nature. The main dangers to the Snohomish at the time were the Haida and other Northwest Coast peoples, who traveled in large war canoes from the far north to raid and pillage along the southern coasts.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, smallpox epidemics rocked the Northwest Coast, killing 90 percent of the population. In 1792, the village at was seen by Joseph Whidbey, who noted that the population seemed to be about 200 people. Later, the village would be abandoned in the late 1800s after the removal of the Snohomish people to the Tulalip Reservation.

=== American settlement ===
Langley was founded in the 1890s by Jacob Anthes, and was named for J.W. Langley of Seattle. In 1902, Anthes built a logger bunkhouse that still stands in the downtown core (now functioning as the South Whidbey Historical Society Museum). Langley was officially incorporated on February 26, 1913.

In the late 1900s, a number of 4H rabbits escaped their enclosures at the Island County Fair and went on to thrive as a large feral population initially residing around the county fairgrounds and later spreading throughout Langley and south Whidbey Island. In the 2010s the rabbits became a controversial issue in local politics, with citizens and groups advocating for public policy positions from removal and relocation to eradication. Some favored controlling the rabbit population using raptors, while others advocated for a more lenient position of community acceptance.

=== The Olympic Club ===
The Dog House was opened in 1908 as an elite gentlemen&#x27;s club called &quot;The Olympic Club&quot;. However, on opening night the founder realized that he didn&#x27;t have enough money to pay the entertainers, so he left town with all the money. Over the years, the building has acted as host to many businesses.

During the Prohibition era, the building was host to underground boxing and wrestling matches which were illegal on the mainland.

When Prohibition ended, the club became a public bar, and operated as a restaurant and bar until its closure in 2008. The Clyde Theatre began in the top floor of this building.

==Government and politics==
The City of Langley operates under a mayor–council government. The mayor and city council members are elected for four-year terms. The city council enacts ordinances and resolutions, holds public hearings, receives citizen comments, authorizes payment of city funds, approves contracts, and creates committees and boards to assist in the operation of city government. The city council meets on the first and third Monday of each month in City Hall at 5:30pm. The mayor presides over council meetings and is responsible for the administration of city government.

The current mayor is Kennedy Horstman, who was elected in November 2023. 

Langley is also served by a sewage treatment facility on Coles Road, operated by the city&#x27;s Public Works Department.

Paull Schell, the former mayor of Seattle, was an influence on city politics in the 90s and 2000s, constructing the Inn at Langley.

== Langley Marina ==
In January 2009, the City of Langley transferred ownership of the Langley Marina to the Port of South Whidbey. The small boat harbor consists of 41 slips and 330 feet of linear moorage that can accommodate vessels up to 190 feet (57.6 meters).

Facilities include restrooms and showers, water and 110v 20, 30, 50, and 100 amp power at the docks, a floating pump out station, and a boat launch. No fuel is available.

=== Services &amp; Facilities ===

* Vessel moorage
* Restrooms &amp; showers
* Beach
* Fishing

== Schools ==
Langley is in the South Whidbey School District, which has been in declining in attendance over the last two decades.

=== Home of the Cougars ===

The first school constructed in Langley, the original Langley High School and later the Langley Middle School after the new High School was constructed – home of the Cougars – closed permanently in 2017 and is now managed by local nonprofits and companies. There are two time capsules buried next to the Middle School flagpole, the next one scheduled to be opened in the year 2055, buried in 2005.

The main building has been converted into an artistic community classroom, known as the South Whidbey Community Center.

The gym has been converted into a CrossFit studio. The football field and track and field area are still maintained by the Community Center, and the science building is now home to the Veteran&#x27;s Resource Center of South Whidbey.

Whidbey Children&#x27;s Theatre is housed in the former school auditorium.

The library is now home to the Whidbey Dance Theatre and the Island Dance Studio.

=== High School ===
The high school, home of the Falcons, absorbed grades 7–8 with the closure of the middle school in 2017. In 2023, grade 6 joined the high school building, as well. Grades 6-12 are now housed at the high school.

=== Elementary School ===
The home of the Dolphins and the home of the Orcas, constructed next door to one another, downsized and have now been merged into a singular entity, still occupying some classrooms in both campuses. Grades K – 6 are housed at the elementary school campus.

== Library ==

The Langley Library is located in a historic building constructed in 1923. This 100-year old public library became a branch of the Sno-Isle Libraries system in 2010. The building was temporarily closed on 17 February 2024 for remodeling. The project estimated to cost $4 million envisages improvements to the accessibility and energy efficiency while retaining the period appearance. About will be added to the lower level. During the project execution of 9–12 months, the library is temporarily located in the South Whidbey Community Center.

==Events==

Mystery Weekend is a yearly mystery game event occurring during the last weekend in February. A fake newspaper story is run in the South Whidbey Record or in a fake newspaper that can be purchased from the Visitor &amp; Information Center, detailing the persons involved and instructing players to seek out characters played by local residents.

The Welcome the Whales Festival and parade is held at the beginning of April each year.

The Djangofest NW Music Festival is held in September each year. This five-day festival celebrates the Romani jazz style of Django Reinhardt, and features workshops, concerts, and impromptu jam sessions around town.

The Whidbey Island Area Fair is held in July at the Island County Fairgrounds in Langley. The original Island County Fair Association was formed in 1912, predating the incorporation of Langley.

<text>Oak Harbor is a city located on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States. The population was 24,622 at the 2020 census. Oak Harbor was incorporated on May 14, 1915.

==History==
The Lower Skagit people have inhabited Oak Harbor () and the nearby Crescent Harbor () since time immemorial. There were several villages in the vicinity, and the modern settlement of Oak Harbor was built over one such village.

In the early 1850s, two settlers staked claims where the city now stands—Zakarias Martin Toftezen, a shoemaker from Norway; C.W. Sumner from New England. Irish and Dutch immigrants also arrived and settled in the area. Oak Harbor was named for the area&#x27;s Garry Oak trees and was incorporated in 1915 with a population of 401. Houses and businesses sprouted up along the shores of Oak Harbor as the pioneers relied entirely on water transportation until the 1900s. For the next 30 years, steamers and freighters carried passengers and freight from the Island to the mainland and back as well as Fidalgo Island to the north. The city grew following the completion of Deception Pass Bridge on July 31, 1935, and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island on September 21, 1942. The bridge, which linked Whidbey Island to Fidalgo Island and the mainland, was a Public Works Administration project built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. A nearby state park with of forest, campsites, and trails was also developed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Access to the island by land is only available by driving through Deception Pass. Other ways to travel to Whidbey Island include flying or utilizing a ferry service. The Mukilteo–Clinton ferry provides service connecting the southern end of Whidbey Island to the area immediately north of Seattle, while the Coupeville-Port Townsend ferry connects to the Olympic peninsula.

Surveys of shorelines throughout the Puget Sound region have indicated that 58% are &quot;unstable&quot;. Average retreat rates range from one to eight centimeters per year and shores in the Puget Sound area, composed of unconsolidated sediment, erode 10 to 100 times faster than rocky shoreline.

===Climate===
Oak Harbor has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, though not severe, and damp winters. Due to the Olympic rain shadow, the region is much drier than most of the Pacific Northwest west of the Cascades.

<text>Marrowstone is a census-designated place (CDP) on Marrowstone Island in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. The population was 995 at the 2020 census. All Marrowstone addresses are in Nordland, Washington, and the ZIP code is 98358.

Marrowstone takes its name from Marrowstone Point, the northernmost point on Marrowstone Island. It was given the name &quot;Marrow-Stone Point&quot; in 1792 by the British explorer, George Vancouver, in describing the area&#x27;s hard, clay-like soil.

== History ==
A post office called Nordland has been in operation since 1898. The community derives its name from Peter Nordby, the original owner of the town site.

==Geography==


According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 6.3 square miles (16.4 km2), all of it land.

Prominent land features include several points, such as Marrowstone Point, at the northern end of Marrowstone Island, Kinney Point, at the southern end of the island, Nodule Point, on the east side, mid island, and Griffiths Point, on the western side of Mystery Bay, which is an inlet on the western side of Marrowstone Island. Other notable features include East Beach, a sandy beach at the northern end of East Marrowstone Road and Scow Bay/Kilisut Harbor, which separates Marrowstone Island from its western neighbor, Indian Island, a Navy ammunition depot.

A narrow causeway connects the southwestern end of Marrowstone Island with the southern end of Indian Island. A short bridge joins the western side of Indian Island to the mainland of Jefferson County.

Flagler Road (SR 116) runs along the western edge of Marrowstone Island, which is primarily low-lying. East Marrowstone Road runs along the eastern edge of the island, which consists largely of sandy bluffs, with the exception of the area near East Beach.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 844 people, 432 households, and 260 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 133.5 people per square mile (51.5/km2).

==Arts and culture==

The Nordland General Store is Marrowstone&#x27;s only source of groceries. It is arguably the focal point of Marrowstone; on maps the town of Nordland (the address of all Marrowstone residents) is usually located at the site of the Nordland General Store. It is located across Flagler Road from Mystery Bay, near the center of Marrowstone Island. It was severely damaged by fire in November 2020, but reopened in May 2024.

===Festivals and events===

For approximately 100 years, Marrowstone has held its annual Strawberry Festival in June. Residents and visitors enjoy strawberry shortcake at the Nordland Garden Club Building. The Marrowstone Island Community Association hosts the Strawberry Festival each year. It meets about 7 times throughout the year at the Nordland Garden Club Building. Strawberries were once grown all over Marrowstone and can be found growing wild on the island.

On Memorial Day weekend, island residents bring their tractors to parade them in front of the Nordland General Store.

The Seattle Youth Symphony&#x27;s Marrowstone Music Festival - now called Marrowstone Summer Music and held on the campus of Western Washington University, in Bellingham, Washington – was held at Fort Flagler on the northern end of Marrowstone Island from 1958 until 1989. Until 1975, it was called the Pacific Northwest Music Camp.

The neo-pagan Aquarian Tabernacle Church performs a modern Eleusinian Mysteries play at Fort Flagler over Easter weekend each year.

==Parks and recreation==
Fort Flagler, a Washington state park, is situated on 784 acres (314 hectares) at the northern end of Marrowstone Island. It overlooks Port Townsend Bay and Admiralty Inlet, the entrance to Puget Sound. Fort Flagler was one of three forts, along with Fort Worden (near Port Townsend) and Fort Casey (on Whidbey Island), that guarded the entrance to Puget Sound. Mystery Bay State Park is another state park on Marrowstone Island, located on 10 acres (4 hectares) of Mystery Bay shorefront about a half-mile north of the Nordland General Store. It is primarily for boaters. Kinney Point State Park comprises at the south end of the island. Accessible only by boat, it is part of the Cascadia Marine Trail.

<text>Port Hadlock-Irondale is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. The population was 3,983 at the 2020 census.

==History of Irondale==

The first iron-producing blast furnace in Washington Territory was completed in Irondale in 1881. About 1,200 tons of pig iron was produced during its first year of operation, with ore obtained from Chimacum Valley. The plant was closed in 1889.

The initial hope was for Irondale to become a major iron and steel producer for the western United States. At first, it looked as though this dream was going to come true. After only two years of production, Irondale had several bars, boarding facilities for both men and horses, and homes and accommodations for over 200 workers. Before the local economy and the plant failed in 1889, there were over 400 men employed at the foundry. The town expanded and grew on the sandy bluffs that overlooked the waterside plant.

There were several efforts made to rebuild the iron and steel plant in the following years, but all failed. Irondale today is a bedroom community for the surrounding towns of Port Hadlock, Port Townsend and further south to Silverdale.

==History of Port Hadlock==
Samuel Hadlock, the founder of Port Hadlock, moved west in 1846, finally landing in the Port Hadlock area in 1870. He contracted with the Washington Mill Company to build a sawmill on a spit of land at the south end of Port Townsend Bay, on a low bank, but deep enough waters for tall ships to moor. Hadlock established a large lumber mill. Lumber from the mill was shipped to San Francisco, and as far away as Australia and Hawaii. Two of the remaining buildings of the Washington Mill Company are what is known today as the Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building, and the residence of Samuel Hadlock, presently known as the Ajax Cafe.

On the waterfront near the mill were a general store, post office, barber shop, livery stable, laundry, two hotels and two saloons. The saloons were frequented by sailors from all over the world as well as local mill workers, longshoremen, and loggers. There was little law enforcement and it was life in the Wild West.

In 1909 construction started on the alcohol plant. It was completed in 1910, when it began manufacturing wood alcohol from sawdust. The operational costs of this venture proved too costly, and the plant suspended operation about 1913. The alcohol plant was renovated into a resort, which included an inn, restaurant, marina and art gallery. The resort and restaurant are open to the public.

The residential section was in upper Hadlock. After the lumber mill burned, businesses began to move uptown. William Sehrs of Sehrs Shipyard built the Masonic Temple in 1911. Sehrs completed other projects such as the Nordland ferry and bridges across Chimacum Creek. The Tri-Area was a growing, viable community.

Subsequent industries have included a boat building yard and a clam cannery. In 1946 Melvin Kivley established the first businesses at the Hadlock intersection - a secondhand store and a Signal Service Station.

==Geography==
Port Hadlock-Irondale is located in northeastern Jefferson County on the Quimper Peninsula, an arm of the northeast corner of the Olympic Peninsula. The CDP includes the communities of Port Hadlock and Irondale, plus part of Chimacum, all of which form what is locally known as the &quot;tri-area&quot;. Irondale is in the northeast corner of the CDP, and Port Hadlock is adjacent to it in the east part of the CDP; both communities abut Port Townsend Bay. Chimacum is on the southern edge of the CDP, in the Chimacum Valley at the intersection of Washington State Route 19 and Chimacum Road. The CDP extends to the west to within of Discovery Bay.

The community is south of Port Townsend and north of Port Gamble. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 13.77%, are water.

<text>Port Ludlow is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. It is also the name of the marine inlet on which the community is located. The CDP&#x27;s population was 2,603 at the 2010 census, up from 1,968 at the 2000 census.

Originally a logging and sawmill community, its economy declined during the first half of the 20th century. Following the completion of the nearby Hood Canal Bridge in 1960, Port Ludlow became the site of resorts and planned communities, attracting more affluent residents who were retired, buying vacation homes, or needing a more convenient commute to the business centers on the west side of Puget Sound. Based on per capita income, Port Ludlow ranks 16th of 522 ranked areas in the state of Washington, and achieves the highest rank in Jefferson County. Port Ludlow&#x27;s location and marina facilities make it a convenient and popular port for leisure craft sailing between Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands.

==History==

The United States Exploring Expedition, under Charles Wilkes, entered Puget Sound in 1841. Wilkes bestowed many patriotically American place names; at the time the sovereignty of the Oregon Country was yet to be resolved between Britain and the United States. Many of Wilkes&#x27;s names commemorated American heroes and victories during the War of 1812. Port Ludlow was one of these, honoring Augustus Ludlow, a War of 1812 American naval hero.

Early explorers of the Pacific Northwest often named sheltered inlets with names beginning with &quot;Port&quot;. Communities that subsequently developed often adopted their inlet&#x27;s name. Today Port Ludlow is both the name of the inlet and the community on its shore. To avoid confusion the inlet is sometimes called Port Ludlow Bay.

The first shipments of timber from the Puget Sound to San Francisco in 1851 stimulated interest in the business potential of building sawmills on Puget Sound. John R. Thorndike and W. P. Sayward sailed to Puget Sound in 1852 and found the environs of Port Ludlow promising. Thorndike filed a timber claim of , and they started building a mill there. The initial mill housed two sash saws capable of producing of lumber daily. The trees along the banks of the bay were logged first, and then oxen and horses were used to bring more distant logs to the mill. The mill was leased in 1858 to the Amos &amp; Phinney Company, of which A. Phinney became the resident manager.

The U.S. Federal Census of 1860 designated Port Ludlow as one of the three enumeration districts in Jefferson County, Washington Territory. The census tally portrays the make-up of a young logging and sawmill community: Of the 124 people counted, 117 (94%) were adults between the ages of 20 and 50, and the remaining 7 were children. Of the adult population 112 (96%) were men and only 5 women, of which 3 were residing with husbands. 53 (47%) of the men were listed as lumbermen and 14 (13%) as sawyers. Of the total population, 94 (76%) were born in the United States, and of those all were born in the eastern half of the nation but two — a two-year-old born in California and a one-year-old born in Washington Territory. Of the 30 (24%) who were foreign-born, 8 were born in England, 8 in Ireland, 6 in Canada, 4 in Germany, 2 in Norway, and one each in Australia and Denmark. The indigenous peoples were not counted in the 1860 census.

<text>Port Townsend is a city on the Quimper Peninsula in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. The population was 10,148 at the 2020 United States Census. It is the county seat and only incorporated city of Jefferson County.

In addition to its natural scenery at the northeast tip of the Olympic Peninsula, the city is known for the many Victorian buildings remaining from its late 19th-century heyday, numerous annual cultural events, and as a maritime center for independent boatbuilders and related industries and crafts. The Port Townsend Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. It is also significantly drier than the surrounding region due to being in the rainshadow of the Olympic Mountains, receiving only of rain per year.

==History==
The bay was originally named &quot;Port Townshend&quot; by Captain George Vancouver in 1792, for his friend the Marquis of Townshend. It was immediately recognized as a good safe harbor, although strong south winds and poor holding ground often make small-craft anchorage problematic off the town&#x27;s waterfront.

The official founding of the American city of the same name took place on April 24, 1851. Indian tribes located in what is now Jefferson County in the mid-19th century included the Chimakum (or Chemakum), Hoh (a group of the Quileute), Klallam (or Clallam), Quinault, and Twana (the Kilcid band — Anglicized as &quot;Quilcene&quot;).

Port Townsend is called the &quot;City of Dreams&quot; because of the early speculation that the city would be the largest harbor on the west coast of the United States. Guarding the gate of Puget Sound, it would become known by its other nickname, the &quot;Key City,&quot; a title that remains to this day.

By the late 19th century, Port Townsend was a well-known seaport, very active and banking on the future. Many homes and buildings were built during that time, with most of the architecture ornate Victorian. During this period, in 1888, the Port Townsend Police Department was established.
Railroads were built to reach more areas in the 1870s–1890s, and Port Townsend was to be the northwest extension of the rail lines. Its port was large and frequented by overseas vessels, so shipping of goods and timber from the area was a major part of the economy. Many of the buildings were built on the speculation that Port Townsend would become a booming shipping port and major city. When the depression hit, those plans lost the capital to continue and rail lines ended on the east side of Puget Sound, mainly in Tumwater, Tacoma, and Seattle. With the other Puget Sound ports growing in size, Port Townsend saw a rapid decline in population when the Northern Pacific Railroad failed to connect the city to the eastern Puget Sound city of Tacoma. By the late 1890s, the boom was over. Without the railroad to spur economic growth, the town shrank and investors looked elsewhere to make a good return. (The Milwaukee Road built a short spur to the pulpmill and barged cars over from Anacortes.)

Over the decades that followed, Port Townsend maintained its economic stability in a variety of ways, including the development of artillery fortifications at Fort Worden. Many people left the area, and many buildings were abandoned. Port Townsend&#x27;s economy was very weak until the 1920s, when a paper mill was built on the edge of the town. The bay is now home to Naval Magazine Indian Island, the US Navy&#x27;s primary munitions-handling dock on the Pacific coast.

Since the 1970s new residents, including many retirees, have moved to town. The waterfront retail district has restaurants, services, and tourist destinations. Since 1999, the city has had an annual international film festival in September. Other cultural programming, some at Fort Worden, now a state park, includes a Wooden Boat Festival, writers&#x27; conference, playwrighting festival, and blues and jazz festivals, in addition to music, dance, and live theater performances. The town has two independent movie theaters, both upgraded by 2014 to handle digital film.

===Recognition of historic status===

Because of the speed at which the economy declined in the 1890s and the lack of any industry to replace it, very few of the Victorian buildings were torn down or built over in the intervening period. They were essentially preserved for nearly 100 years, when the value of protecting them was appreciated and fostered. Unlike most cities in the Pacific Northwest that were ravaged by natural and man-made disasters such as fire and earthquakes, prominent examples of public, private, and business buildings from nearly every period of Port Townsend&#x27;s history have survived to the present day.

The Port Townsend Historic District, an area including many Victorian-era buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977.

==Geography==

Port Townsend is located on the Quimper Peninsula which extends out of the extreme northeastern end of the Olympic Peninsula, on the north end of a large, semi-protected bay. Port Townsend is adjacent to the Admiralty Inlet and a trio of state parks built on retired artillery installations (Fort Worden, Fort Casey, and Fort Flagler). The city and its surroundings are well-treed, with large Douglas fir dominant over many other tree species in the remaining wooded areas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 26.22%, are water.

===Climate===
Port Townsend has a moderate Mediterranean climate with damp, chilly (though not severe) winters and warm, dry summers. It lies in the Olympic rain shadow and receives an average of only annual precipitation. However, the environment is not as dry as the mean yearly total would suggest; cool breezes and fog from the Juan de Fuca Strait provide a comfortable level of humidity.

<text>Quilcene is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. The population was 598 at the 2020 census.

The community is located on the Olympic Peninsula at the head of Quilcene Bay, an arm of the seawater-filled glacial valley of Hood Canal. Each year many visitors enjoy the panoramic views of Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and Seattle from the summit of nearby Mount Walker, the only peak facing Puget Sound that has a road to its summit. The Olympic National Forest lands in Quilcene hold Douglas fir, spring-blooming Pacific rhododendrons, Oregon grape, and salal. Leland Lake is located north of Quilcene.

Quilcene oysters are named after the community. Quilcene has one of the largest oyster hatcheries in the world.

==History==
Early inhabitants of the area were the Twana people, inhabiting the length of Hood Canal, and rarely invading other tribes. The name &quot;Quilcene&quot; comes from the Twana word /qʷəʔlsíd/, referring to a tribal group and the name of an aboriginal Twana village and community on Quilcene Bay. The Quilcene (&quot;salt-water people&quot;) were a distinct band of these people.

The Wilkes Expedition charted the place as &quot;Kwil-sid&quot; in 1841. Hampden Cottle, a logger from Maine, and several other families settled there in 1860 and eventually established a town. The town was originally situated on the banks of the Quilcene River, before being moved to higher ground. The economy in Quilcene was based primarily on farming and logging, and by 1880 the town had a population of 53.

The Tubal Cain Mining Company in 1902 claimed that Quilcene would become the center for the smelting of iron, copper, gold, and manganese that was expected to be found in the Olympic Mountains; however, little ore was ever discovered.

Circa 1910, Green&#x27;s Shingle Mill was a large part of Quilcene&#x27;s history.

==Geography==
 Quilcene is located in eastern Jefferson County at the north end of Quilcene Bay, an arm of Dabob Bay, which extends north from Hood Canal. The Big Quilcene River forms the southern edge of the community, and the Little Quilcene River forms the northeastern edge; both arise in the Olympic Mountains to the west and flow past the town into Quilcene Bay.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.25%, are water.

The Olympic National Forest is west and south of the community. The summit of Mount Walker, southwest of the CDP, offers views of Mount Jupiter, Buckhorn Mountain, Mount Constance, Mount Baker and the town of Quilcene.

At the southwest edge of the Quilcene CDP, at the union of the Big Quilcene River and Penny Creek, the Quilcene National Fish Hatchery has been operating since 1911. There, the US Fish and Wildlife Service raises coho salmon for on-station release and provides coho salmon eggs and fingerlings for tribal programs.

<doc id="137977" wikidata="Q1502800" url="?curid=137977" title="Baring, Washington">
<text>Baring is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 255 at the 2020 census, up from 220 at the 2010 census. It is located on U.S. Highway 2 about west of Stevens Pass, along a very flat and straight three-mile section of highway that has been dubbed the &quot;Baring Straight&quot; (a play on the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia), since US-2 is otherwise hilly and curvy through the mountains.
The settlement was first known as &quot;Salmon&quot;, but by 1909 it was known as Baring.

== History ==

The towns in the Skykomish River valley were established based on the railway and the roads built to cross the Cascade Mountains at Stevens Pass. In the late 19th century during the expansion of the Great Northern Railway, the railway&#x27;s chief locating engineer, John F. Stevens, surveyed the area and identified Stevens Pass as the ideal route for crossing the North Cascades. The first train passed through in June 1893. Early road development in the area included the Skykomish Tote Road, connecting towns along the rail line, which can be seen in photographs and maps from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1912, local citizens established a Good Roads Club to promote the construction of a cross-Cascades highway. By 1913, King, Chelan, and Snohomish counties collaborated on the Cascade Scenic Highway project (King County Road No. 999), which was surveyed the same year. However, completion of the highway was delayed due to World War I, funding, and construction obstacles. King County finished its 28-mile section by 1917, but the first automobiles did not cross until 1924, with the official opening taking place in July 1925.

The Cascade Scenic Highway and Stevens Pass Highway (now US 2) played a key role in the region&#x27;s development by improving access and connectivity. The Stevens Pass Highway became State Road 15 in the 1930s, and was later realigned, paved, and renamed multiple times before ultimately becoming US 2 in the late 1940s.

<text>Bellevue ( ) is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States, located across Lake Washington from Seattle. It is the third-largest city in the Seattle metropolitan area, and the fifth-largest city in Washington. It has variously been characterized as a satellite city, a suburb, a boomburb, or an edge city. The population was 151,854 at the 2020 census. The city&#x27;s name is derived from the French term (&quot;beautiful view&quot;).

Bellevue is home to some of the world&#x27;s largest technology companies. Before and after the 2008 recession, its downtown area has been undergoing rapid change with many high-rise projects being constructed. Downtown Bellevue is currently the second-largest city center in Washington state, with 1,300 businesses, 45,000 employees, and 10,200 residents. In a 2018 estimate, the city&#x27;s median household income was among the top five cities in the state of Washington.
In 2008, Bellevue was number one in CNNMoney&#x27;s list of the best places to live and launch a business, and in 2010 was again ranked as the fourth-best place to live in America. In 2014, Bellevue was ranked as the second-best place to live by &quot;USA Today&quot;.

More than 145 companies have been located in Bellevue; companies currently headquartered there include PACCAR Inc, T-Mobile US, and Valve. The technology company Amazon was founded in Bellevue by Jeff Bezos.

==History==
The Duwamish, whose main settlements were located in present-day Renton and Seattle, maintained a small outpost settlement called Satskal (&quot;SAH-tsah-kahl&quot;) along the Mercer Slough, south of present-day downtown Bellevue. It was from this village that an attack on the settlers of Elliott Bay was staged. The Duwamish also had a village near Factoria called &#x27;pah-pah-DEEL&#x27;.

Bellevue was first settled by European Americans in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and Aaron Mercer, who claimed homestead tracts several miles apart. Both moved away within a few years, and permanent residents did not arrive until 1879. By 1882, a community, consisting mostly of logging homesteaders, had established itself. Once the land had been logged, it was gradually cleared, largely by Japanese immigrant labor in the early 20th century, to support small-scale farming on leased land plots.

By the early part of the 20th century, Bellevue had acquired a reputation as a weekend getaway destination for Seattle residents, who would arrive by ferry at Meydenbauer Bay and spend the day at nearby Wildwood Park. After the ferry landing was moved to Medina, however, tourism to Bellevue waned. To counter this decline, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was conceived of in 1925, and by the 1930s it had grown to attract as many as 15,000 visitors. At the time, Bellevue was still a small town with around 2,000 residents.

Prior to the opening of the Lake Washington Floating Bridge in 1940, Bellevue was mostly rural farmland area with little development. Although it was small, developers were pushing to change that; in the 1920s, James S. Ditty predicted that it would become a city with a population of 200,000. He envisioned plans that included the bridging of Lake Washington and an area filled with golf courses and airports. His map with these visions was published in 1928. Once the Murrow Memorial Bridge opened, access from Seattle improved, and the area began to evolve into a bedroom community.

In 1942, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was cancelled. The primary reason was that some 90 percent of the agricultural workforce in the area was of Japanese ancestry, and all of these farmers and their families had been forcibly interned in camps following the start of World War II. The fair would not be revived for another 45 years. Following the expulsion of the ethnic Japanese farming community, a large quantity of farmland became available for development. This made way for the initial development of the Bellevue downtown area.
Bellevue incorporated as a third-class city on the March 31, 1953. Following the 1963 opening of a second bridge across the lake, the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, the city began to grow more rapidly. The Crossroads community was annexed in 1964. Lake Hills was annexed in 1969. By the 1970 census, Bellevue had become the fourth most populous city in the state of Washington, behind only Seattle, Spokane, and Tacoma.

Bellevue remains one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. The city experienced a building boom during the mid-2000s, with the building of developments such as Lincoln Square and the Bravern.

Bellevue Square is located in downtown Bellevue and is now one of the largest shopping centers in the region. Opened in 1946, the mall has undergone several significant phases of expansion since the 1980s.

The city&#x27;s plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of in the large Bel-Red section of the city bordering the adjacent city of Redmond. The plan is similar to the redevelopment of the downtown core with superblocks of mixed-use projects from private developers. These include the Spring District, a mixed-use residential and commercial neighborhood which was developed on of industrial land around a future light rail station. The 2 Line of Link light rail was opened from South Bellevue station to Redmond Technology station in April 2024 and is scheduled to be extended to Seattle in 2025.

==Geography==
Bellevue lies between Lake Washington to the west and the smaller Lake Sammamish to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the Kelsey Creek watershed, whose source is located in the Larsen Lake and Phantom Lake green belt and whose outlet is near where Interstate 90 meets Lake Washington&#x27;s eastern shore. The city is bisected by Interstate 405 running north–south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The State Route 520 freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from a French term for &quot;beautiful view&quot;. Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Mountains can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city.

South of I-90, the city continues up Cougar Mountain, at the top of which is an unincorporated King County location called Hilltop. To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes the Coal Creek, Somerset, and Factoria neighborhoods.

Bellevue is bordered by the cities of Kirkland to the north and Redmond to the northeast along the Overlake and Crossroads neighborhoods. Across the short East Channel Bridge, I-90 connects Bellevue to Mercer Island to the southwest. Issaquah is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is bordered to the west by many affluent suburbs such as Medina, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point and Yarrow Point. The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the relatively recently incorporated city of Newcastle, and the city of Renton.

Bellevue is an economic hub of the Seattle region&#x27;s Eastside and home to the headquarters of various sizes, including the U.S. operations for many international firms. Since 2005, the city has become a hub for software engineering and other technology development centers. These include PACCAR Inc, T-Mobile US, Eddie Bauer, SAP Concur, and Symetra. Bellevue hosts a number of satellite offices for large technology companies such as eBay, Meta, ByteDance, Oracle, Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft; Microsoft was at one point headquartered in Bellevue but has since moved to the neighboring community of Redmond, Washington. Celebrated video game companies Valve, Bungie, Sucker Punch Productions, and The Pokémon Company International are also based here.

In 2019, Amazon and Facebook announced plans to open large engineering centers in Bellevue with plans to add several thousand employees. In 2018, Google also opened a major engineering facility in downtown Bellevue. , there are several high-rise office buildings in Downtown Bellevue that are under construction or in active planning and design phases, including Bellevue 600, part of a major Amazon campus. Several high-rise residential buildings are also planned in downtown, spurred in part by future light rail service, on former retail and low-rise commercial lots. , Amazon has 12,000 employees in Bellevue and has reduced its workforce in Seattle.

By the late 2010s, Microsoft had become the largest employer in Bellevue, where it had several offices to supplement its headquarters campus in Redmond. The company&#x27;s workforce in the city peaked at 9,300 in 2021 and later declined as it consolidated offices at its headquarters and vacated its leased offices pace in Downtown Bellevue and Eastgate.

The freeways are connected to Seattle via floating bridges over Lake Washington. Downtown Bellevue has wide streets with few mid-block connections and an incomplete sidewalk network; it has been labeled as &quot;pedestrian unfriendly&quot; and hostile to cycling. The city government adopted plans to improve pedestrian and bicycle connections in 2009 and built the first downtown bicycle lane (including some protected sections) in 2018. The city had 42,000 on-street parking spaces in a 2013 inventory; plans to introduce fees for on-street parking spaces in some neighborhoods were announced in 2025.

Bellevue is the main Eastside hub for both the local transit authority, King County Metro, and Sound Transit, the regional transit system. The Bellevue Transit Center, which serves both Metro and Sound buses, is located in the heart of the downtown business district and is connected to Interstate 405 by NE 6th St. and a direct-access Texas T HOV ramp. Local buses run into Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, and the University District; regional buses go to Bothell, Lynnwood, Everett, Seattle, Renton, Kent and Auburn, among other cities. An electric microtransit shuttle service operated by Circuit, Inc. began operating in August 2023; the app-based service is funded by the city&#x27;s hotel room tax and fare-free for passengers.

The 2 Line of Sound Transit&#x27;s Link light rail system is planned to run from Seattle through Mercer Island and Bellevue before ending in Redmond. The $3.7 billion project was approved by voters in 2008 as part of the Sound Transit 2 ballot measure. It began construction in 2016 and was scheduled to begin service in 2023, but was later delayed to 2024 due to construction issues. The first section, from South Bellevue station to Redmond Technology station in Overlake, opened on April 27, 2024.

The Bellevue City Council lobbied Sound Transit, the regional transit authority, to construct its light rail line underground through Bellevue&#x27;s rapidly growing downtown. The city government promised to devote between $104 million and $150 million toward a potential tunnel in the form of cash, services, free access to rights-of-way and one-time tax revenues that result from the East Link project. In November 2011, the city council signed an agreement with Sound Transit. Tunnel construction started in early 2016 while the remainder of downtown Bellevue construction began in mid-2017.

Bellevue was also served by a railroad, a Burlington Northern branch line known as the Woodinville Subdivision, which included the historic Wilburton Trestle. The line is now disused, though part of the track bed at Wilburton Station will be reused by Sound Transit&#x27;s light-rail construction. Construction of Eastrail, a rail trail on the abandoned Woodinville Subdivision right of way through Bellevue, is planned to be completed in 2023. Some sections of the railroad in Bellevue were demolished in 2008 to make way for the expansion of I-405 and will require the construction of additional structures to supplement the existing right of way.

The city once had an operating airfield named Bellevue Airfield, which shut down in 1983.
