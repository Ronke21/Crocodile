<text>A city-state is an independent sovereign city which serves as the center of political, economic, and cultural life over its contiguous territory. They have existed in many parts of the world throughout history, including cities such as Rome, Carthage, Athens and Sparta and the Italian city-states during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, such as Florence, Venice, Genoa and Milan.

With the rise of nation states worldwide, there remains some disagreement on the number of modern city-states that still exist; Singapore, Monaco and Vatican City are the candidates most commonly discussed. Out of these, Singapore is the largest and most populous, and is generally considered to be the last real city-state left in the world, with full sovereignty, international borders, its own currency, a robust military, and substantial international influence in its own right. &quot;The Economist&quot; refers to it as the &quot;world&#x27;s only fully functioning city-state&quot;.

Several non-sovereign cities enjoy a high degree of autonomy and are often considered as city-states. Hong Kong, Macau, However, cities of the United Arab Emirates—most notably Dubai and Abu Dhabi—are often cited as such as well.
== Historical background ==
=== Ancient and medieval world ===


Historical city-states included Sumerian cities such as Uruk and Ur; Ancient Egyptian city-states, such as Thebes and Memphis; the Phoenician cities (such as Tyre and Sidon); the five Philistine city-states; the Berber city-states of the Garamantes; the city-states of ancient Greece (the poleis such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Corinth); the Roman Republic (which grew from a city-state into a vast empire); the Italian city-states from the Middle Ages to the early modern period, such as Florence, Siena, Ferrara, Milan (which as they grew in power began to dominate neighboring cities) and Genoa and Venice, which became powerful thalassocracies; the Mayan and other cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica (including cities such as Chichen Itza, Tikal, Copán and Monte Albán); the central Asian cities along the Silk Road; the city-states of the Swahili coast; Ragusa; Tbilisi; states of the medieval Russian lands such as Novgorod and Pskov; free imperial cities of German-speaking Europe; mueang of Indochina; barangay states of the Philippines; and many others. Danish historian Poul Holm has classed the Viking colonial cities in medieval Ireland, most importantly the Kingdom of Dublin, as city-states.

In Cyprus, the Phoenician settlement of Kition (in present-day Larnaca) was a city-state that existed from around 800 BC until the end of the 4th century BC.

Some of the most well-known examples of city-state culture in human history are the ancient Greek city-states and the merchant city-states of Renaissance Italy, which organised themselves as independent centers. The success of regional units coexisting as autonomous actors in loose geographical and cultural unity, as in Italy and Greece, often prevented their amalgamation into larger national units. However, such small political entities often survived only for short periods because they lacked the resources to defend themselves against incursions by larger states (such as Roman conquest of Greece). Thus they inevitably gave way to larger organisations of society, including the empire and the nation-state.

===Central Europe===
In the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) over 80 Free Imperial Cities came to enjoy considerable autonomy in the Middle Ages and in early modern times, buttressed legally by international law following the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Some, like three of the earlier Hanseatic cities – Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck – pooled their economic relations with foreign powers and were able to wield considerable diplomatic clout. Individual cities often made protective alliances with other cities or with neighbouring regions, including the Hanseatic League (1358 – 17th century), the Swabian League of Cities (1331–1389), the Décapole (1354–1679) in the Alsace, or the Old Swiss Confederacy ( 1300 – 1798). The Swiss cantons of Zürich, Bern, Lucerne, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Geneva originated as city-states.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, some cities – then members of different confederacies – officially became sovereign city-states, such as the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (1806–11 and again 1813–71), the Free City of Frankfurt upon Main (1815–66), the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (1806–11 and again 1814–71), the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck (1806–11 and again 1813–71), and the Free City of Kraków (1815–1846). Under Habsburg rule the city of Fiume had the status of a &quot;corpus separatum&quot; (1779–1919), which – while falling short of an independent sovereignty – had many attributes of a city-state.

===Italy===

In Northern and Central Italy during the medieval and Renaissance periods, city-states — with various amounts of associated land — became the standard form of polity. Some of them, despite being de facto independent states, were formally part of the Holy Roman Empire. The era of the Italian states, in particular from the 11th to the 15th centuries, featured remarkable economic development, trade, manufacture, and mercantile capitalism, together with increasing urbanization, with remarkable influence throughout much of the Mediterranean world and Europe as a whole. During this time, most of the Italian city-states were ruled by one person, such as the Signoria or by a dynasty, such as the House of Gonzaga and the House of Sforza.

====Examples of Italian city-states during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance====

*Republic of Florence, Duchy of Milan, Duchy of Ferrara, San Marino, Duchy of Modena and Reggio, Duchy of Urbino, Duchy of Mantua and the Republic of Lucca.

*The powerful maritime republics: Republic of Venice, Republic of Genoa, Republic of Amalfi, Republic of Pisa, Republic of Ancona and Duchy of Gaeta.

===Southeast Asia===
In the history of Mainland Southeast Asia, aristocratic groups, Buddhist leaders, and others organized settlements into autonomous or semi-autonomous city-states. These were referred to as &quot;mueang&quot;, and were usually related in a tributary relationship now described as mandala or as &quot;over-lapping sovereignty&quot;, in which smaller city-states paid tribute to larger ones that paid tribute to still larger ones—until reaching the apex in cities like Ayutthaya, Bagan, Bangkok and others that served as centers of Southeast Asian royalty. The system existed until the 19th century, when colonization by European powers occurred. Siam, a regional power at the time, needed to define their territories for negotiation with the European powers so the Siamese government established a nation-state system, incorporated their tributary cities (Lan Xang, Cambodia and some Malay cities) into their territory and abolished the mueang and the tributary system.

In early Philippine history, the barangay was a complex sociopolitical unit which scholars have historically considered the dominant organizational pattern among the various peoples of the Philippine archipelago. These sociopolitical units were sometimes also referred to as barangay states, but are more properly referred to using the technical term &quot;polity&quot;. Evidence suggests a considerable degree of independence as city states ruled by Datus, Rajahs and Sultans. Early chroniclers record that the name evolved from the term &quot;balangay&quot;, which refers to a plank boat widely used by various cultures of the Philippine archipelago prior to the arrival of European colonizers.

===20th-century cities under international supervision===

====Danzig====
The Free City of Danzig was a semi-autonomous city-state that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the Baltic Sea port of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) and nearly 200 towns in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920 under the terms of Article 100 (Section XI of Part III) of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I.

====Fiume====
After a prolonged period where the city of Fiume enjoyed considerable autonomy under Habsburg rule (see Corpus separatum (Fiume)), The Free State of Fiume was proclaimed as a fully independent free state which existed between 1920 and 1924. Its territory of comprised the city of Fiume (now in Croatia and, since the end of World War II, known as Rijeka, both names meaning &quot;river&quot; in the respective languages) and rural areas to its north, with a corridor to its west connecting it to Italy.

====Jerusalem====
Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 1947, Mandatory Palestine was to be partitioned into three states: a Jewish state of Israel, an Arab state of Palestine, and a &quot;corpus separatum&quot; (Latin for &quot;separated body&quot;) consisting of a Jerusalem city-state under the control of United Nations Trusteeship Council. Although the plan had some international support and the UN accepted this proposal (and still officially holds the stance that Jerusalem should be held under this regime), implementation of the plan failed as the 1948 Palestine war broke out with the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, ultimately resulting in Jerusalem being split into West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem. Israel would eventually gain control of East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War in 1967.

====Memel====
The Klaipėda Region or Memel Territory was defined by the Treaty of Versailles in 1920 when it was put under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors. The Memel Territory was to remain under the control of the League of Nations until a future day when the people of the region would be allowed to vote on whether the land would return to Germany or not. The then predominantly ethnic German Memel Territory (Prussian Lithuanians and Memellanders constituted the other ethnic groups), situated between the river and the town of that name, was occupied by Lithuania in the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923.

====Ottoman====
Some proposals for the partition of the Ottoman Empire envisaged international zones at Istanbul/Constantinople or the wider Turkish straits, and possibly also at İzmir/Smyrna. Although the allies of World War I occupied both after the 1918 Armistice of Mudros, the British-led occupation of Istanbul recognised Turkey as de jure sovereign, while the Greek occupation of Smyrna was an attempted annexation. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne re-established Turkish control of both areas.

====Shanghai====
The Shanghai International Settlement (1845–1943) was an international zone with its own legal system, postal service, and currency.

====Tangier====


The international zone within the city of Tangier, in North Africa was approximately . It was at first under the joint administration of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom, plus later Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. The international zone was initially attached to Morocco. It then became a French-Spanish protectorate from 1923 until 29 October 1956, when it was reintegrated into the state of Morocco.

====Trieste====
The Free Territory of Trieste was an independent territory situated in Central Europe between northern Italy and Yugoslavia, facing the north part of the Adriatic Sea, under direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in the aftermath of World War II, from 1947 to 1954. The UN attempted to make the Free Territory of Trieste into a city state, but it never gained real independence and in 1954 its territory was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia.

==== West Berlin ====
In the 20th century West Berlin, though lacking sovereignty, functioned from 1948 until 1990 as a state legally not belonging to any other state, but ruled by the Western Allies. They allowed – notwithstanding their overlordship as occupant powers – its internal organisation as one state simultaneously being a city, officially called Berlin (West). Though West Berlin maintained close ties to the West German Federal Republic, it never legally formed a part of it.

==Modern city-states==
===Vatican City===
Until September 1870, the city of Rome had been controlled by the pope as part of his Papal States. When King Victor Emmanuel II seized the city in 1870, Pope Pius IX refused to recognize the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

Because he could not travel without effectively acknowledging the authority of the king, Pius IX and his successors each claimed to be a &quot;Prisoner in the Vatican&quot;, unable to leave the papal enclave once they had ascended the papal throne.

The impasse was resolved in 1929 by the Lateran Treaties negotiated by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini between King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XI. Under this treaty, Vatican City was recognized as an independent state, with the Pope as its head. The Vatican City State has its own citizenship, diplomatic corps, flag, and postage stamps. With a population of less than 1,000 (mostly clergymen), it is by far the smallest sovereign country in the world.

===Monaco===
The Principality of Monaco is a very small independent city-state bordering France. Monaco-Ville (the ancient fortified city) and Monaco&#x27;s well-known area Monte Carlo are districts of a continuous urban zone, not distinct cities, though they were three separate municipalities (&quot;communes&quot;) until 1917. The Principality of Monaco and the city of Monaco (each having specific powers) govern the same territory. Though they maintain a small military, largely for ceremonial purposes, they would still have to rely on France for defence in the face of an aggressive power.

===Singapore===

Singapore is an island city-state in Southeast Asia bordering Malaysia to the north and Indonesia to the south. 6 million people live and work within , making Singapore the 2nd-most-densely populated country in the world after Monaco. Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia for two years before it was expelled from the federation in 1965, becoming an independent republic, a city and a sovereign country. &quot;The Economist&quot; refers to the nation as the &quot;world&#x27;s only fully functioning city-state&quot;. In particular, it has its own currency, a large commercial airport, one of the busiest trans-shipment maritime ports in the world, and fully fledged armed forces to safeguard the nation&#x27;s sovereignty against potential regional aggressors. Singapore is also referred to as the only island city-state in the world by WorldAtlas.

==States with similar characteristics==
A number of other small states share many of these characteristics, and are sometimes cited as modern city-states. Luxembourg, Djibouti, Qatar, Brunei, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Malta are each politically and economically centered on a single city; in the cases of Luxembourg, Djibouti and Kuwait, this primate city is so dominant as to give its name to the country. These countries are distinct from true city-states such as Singapore in that they comprise both their primate city (such as Luxembourg City) and a number of peripheral cities and towns (such as Esch-sur-Alzette and ten other towns in Luxembourg) with autonomous municipal authorities, and may also include substantial rural areas (such as the sparsely-populated Éislek forest of northern Luxembourg).

Occasionally, microstates with high population densities such as San Marino are cited as city-states, despite lacking a large urban centre.

== Non-sovereign city-states ==

Some cities or urban areas, while not sovereign states, may nevertheless be constituent states of a federation, or enjoy a high degree of autonomy. As such, they function as &quot;city-states&quot; within the context of the sovereign state to which they belong. Historian Mogens Herman Hansen describes this aspect of self-government as: &quot;The city-state is a self-governing, but not necessarily independent, political unit.&quot; A city with more limited self-government may be referred to as an independent city.

Some non-sovereign cities which have a high degree of autonomy, and have been described as city-states, include:

*Spain: Ceuta and Melilla (as autonomous cities)
* China: Hong Kong and Macau (as special administrative regions)
* France: Paris (as a department)
* Romania: Bucharest (as a municipality with a special status equal to the counties)
* United Kingdom: Gibraltar (as a British Overseas Territory)
Some cities that are constituent states in a federation, and as such can be accurately described as non-sovereign city-states with a high degree of autonomy, include:
* Argentina: Buenos Aires
* Austria: Vienna
* Belgium: Brussels
* Germany: Bremen, Berlin and Hamburg
* Mexico: Mexico City
* Russia: Moscow and Saint Petersburg
* Switzerland: Basel-Stadt

== Proposed city-states ==
===Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order===

The Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order is a proposed city-state in Albanian capital of Tirana which will be established if approved by the Albanian Parliament and a national referendum. The state, which would be led by the Bektashi Order, is planned to be similar in structure to the Vatican City. The idea has been proposed by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and leader of the Bektashi Order Baba Mondi in the hope that sovereignty would help promote moderate Muslim values instead of radical ideologies. The Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order would be surrounded by the suburbs of eastern Tirana and would be the smallest nation in the world.

===London===

The London independence movement seeks a city-state separate from the United Kingdom.

<text>Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol () was a Russian novelist, short story writer, and playwright of Ukrainian origin.

Gogol used the grotesque in his writings, for example, in his works &quot;The Nose&quot;, &quot;Viy&quot;, &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, and &quot;Nevsky Prospekt&quot;. These stories, and others such as &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, have also been noted for their proto-surrealist qualities. According to Viktor Shklovsky, Gogol used the technique of defamiliarization when a writer presents common things in an unfamiliar or strange way so that the reader can gain new perspectives and see the world differently. His early works, such as &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot;, were influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, Ukrainian culture and folklore. His later writing satirised political corruption in contemporary Russia (&quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, &quot;Dead Souls&quot;), although Gogol also enjoyed the patronage of Tsar Nicholas I who liked his work. The novel &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; (1835), the play &quot;Marriage&quot; (1842), and the short stories &quot;The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich&quot;, &quot;The Portrait&quot;, and &quot;The Carriage&quot; are also among his best-known works.

Many writers and critics have recognized Gogol&#x27;s deep influence on Russian, Ukrainian and world literature. Gogol&#x27;s influence was acknowledged by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Franz Kafka, Mikhail Bulgakov, Vladimir Nabokov, Flannery O&#x27;Connor and others. Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé said: &quot;We all came out from under Gogol&#x27;s Overcoat.&quot;

==Early life==
Gogol was born in the Ukrainian Cossack town of Sorochyntsi, in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire. His mother was descended from Leonty Kosyarovsky, an officer of the Lubny Regiment in 1710. His father Vasily Gogol-Yanovsky, who died when Gogol was 15 years old, was supposedly a descendant of Ukrainian Cossacks (see Lyzohub family) and belonged to the &#x27;petty gentry&#x27;. Gogol knew that his paternal ancestor , a Cossack hetman in Polish service, received nobility from the Polish king. The family used the Polish surname &quot;Janowski&quot; (Ianovskii) and the family estate in Vasilevka was known as Ianovshchyna.

His father wrote poetry in Ukrainian as well as Russian, and was an amateur playwright in his own theatre. As was typical of the left-bank Ukrainian gentry of the early nineteenth century, the family was trilingual, speaking Ukrainian as well as Russian, and using Polish mostly for reading. Gogol&#x27;s mother called her son Nikola, which is a mixture of the Russian Nikolai and the Ukrainian Mykola. As a child, Gogol helped stage plays in his uncle&#x27;s home theater.

In 1820, Nikolai Gogol went to a school of higher art in Nezhin (Nizhyn) (now Nizhyn Gogol State University) and remained there until 1828. It was there that he began writing. He was not popular among his schoolmates, who called him their &quot;mysterious dwarf&quot;, but he formed lasting friendships with two or three of them. Very early he developed a dark and secretive disposition, marked by a painful self-consciousness and boundless ambition. Equally early he developed a talent for mimicry, which later made him a matchless reader of his own works and induced him to toy with the idea of becoming an actor.

On leaving school in 1828, Gogol went to Saint Petersburg, full of vague but ambitious hopes. He desired literary fame, and brought with him a Romantic poem of German idyllic life – &quot;Hans Küchelgarten&quot;, and had it published at his own expense, under the pseudonym &quot;V. Alov.&quot; The magazines he sent it to almost universally derided it. He bought all the copies and destroyed them, swearing never to write poetry again.

==Literary development==
His stay in St. Petersburg forced Gogol to make a certain decision regarding his self-identification. It was a period of turmoil; the November Uprising in the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led to a rise of Russian nationalism. Initially, Gogol used the surname Gogol-Ianovskii, but it soon became inconvenient. At first he tried to shorten it to the Russian-sounding &quot;Ianov&quot;, but in the second half of 1830 he abandoned the Polish part of his surname altogether. He even admonished his mother in a letter to address him only as &quot;Gogol&quot;, as Poles had become &quot;suspect&quot; in St. Petersburg. Tsarist authorities encouraged the Ukrainian intellectuals to sever ties with the Poles, promoting a limited, folkloric Ukrainian particularism as part of the heritage of the Russian empire.

In 1831, the first volume of Gogol&#x27;s Ukrainian stories (&quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot;) was published under a pen name &quot;Rudy Panko&quot;, was in line with this trend, and met with immediate success. A second volume was published in 1832, followed by two volumes of stories entitled &quot;Mirgorod&quot; in 1835, and two volumes of miscellaneous prose entitled &quot;Arabesques&quot;. Although Gogol wrote in Russian, Russian editors and critics of that time such as Nikolai Polevoy and Nikolai Nadezhdin saw Gogol as a regional Ukrainian writer, and used his works to illustrate the specific of Ukrainian national characters. In 1981, literary scholar George Grabowicz argues that Ukrainian literature of Gogol&#x27;s times was bilingual, with Ukrainian writers using Polish and Russian alongside Ukrainian. Therefore Gogol should be understood as both Russian and Ukrainian writer, especially in his early writings.

The themes and style of these early prose works by Gogol, as well as his later drama, were similar to the work of Ukrainian-language writers and dramatists who were his contemporaries and friends, including Hryhory Kvitka-Osnovyanenko. However, Gogol&#x27;s satire was much more sophisticated and unconventional. Although these works were written in Russian, they were nevertheless full of Ukrainianisms, which is why a glossary of Ukrainian words was included at the end of the volumes. 

At this time, Gogol developed a passion for Ukrainian Cossack history and tried to obtain an appointment to the history department at Saint Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev. Despite the support of Alexander Pushkin and Sergey Uvarov, the Russian minister of education, the appointment was blocked by a bureaucrat on the grounds that Gogol was unqualified. His fictional story &quot;Taras Bulba&quot;, based on the history of Zaporozhian Сossacks, was the result of this phase in his interests. During this time, he also developed a close and lifelong friendship with the historian and naturalist Mykhaylo Maksymovych.

In 1834, Gogol was made Professor of Medieval History at the University of St. Petersburg, a job for which he had no qualifications. The academic venture proved a disaster:He turned in a performance ludicrous enough to warrant satiric treatment in one of his own stories. After an introductory lecture made up of brilliant generalizations which the &#x27;historian&#x27; had prudently prepared and memorized, he gave up all pretence at erudition and teaching, missed two lectures out of three, and when he did appear, muttered unintelligibly through his teeth. At the final examination, he sat in utter silence with a black handkerchief wrapped around his head, simulating a toothache, while another professor interrogated the students. Gogol resigned his chair in 1835.

Between 1832 and 1836, Gogol worked with great energy, and had extensive contact with Pushkin, but he still had not yet decided that his ambitions were to be fulfilled by success in literature. During this time, the Russian critics Stepan Shevyrev and Vissarion Belinsky, contradicting the earlier critics, reclassified Gogol from a Ukrainian to a Russian writer. It was only after the premiere of his comedy &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (&quot;Revizor&quot;) at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, on 19 April 1836, that he finally came to believe in his literary vocation. The comedy, a satire of Russian provincial bureaucracy, was staged thanks only to the intervention of the emperor, Nicholas I. The Tsar was personally present at the play&#x27;s premiere, concluding that &quot;there is nothing sinister in the comedy, as it is only a cheerful mockery of bad provincial officials.&quot;

From 1836 to 1848, Gogol lived abroad, travelling through Germany and Switzerland. Gogol spent the winter of 1836–37 in Paris, among Russian expatriates and Polish exiles, frequently meeting the Polish poets Adam Mickiewicz and Bohdan Zaleski. He eventually settled in Rome. For much of the twelve years from 1836, Gogol was in Italy, where he developed an adoration for Rome. He studied art, read Italian literature and developed a passion for opera.

Pushkin&#x27;s death produced a strong impression on Gogol. His principal work during the years following Pushkin&#x27;s death was the satirical epic &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. Concurrently, he worked at other tasks – recast &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; (1842) and &quot;The Portrait&quot;, completed his second comedy, &quot;Marriage&quot; (&quot;Zhenitba&quot;), wrote the fragment &quot;Rome&quot; and his most famous short story, &quot;The Overcoat&quot;.

In 1841, the first part of &quot;Dead Souls&quot; was ready, and Gogol took it to Russia to supervise its printing. It appeared in Moscow in 1842, under a new title imposed by the censorship, &quot;The Adventures of Chichikov&quot;. The book established his reputation as one of the greatest prose writers in the language.

==Later life==

After the triumph of &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, Gogol&#x27;s contemporaries came to regard him as a great satirist who lampooned the unseemly sides of Imperial Russia. They did not know that &quot;Dead Souls&quot; was but the first part of a planned modern-day counterpart to the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante. The first part represented the &quot;Inferno&quot;; the second part would depict the gradual purification and transformation of the rogue Chichikov under the influence of virtuous publicans and governors – &quot;Purgatory&quot;.

In April 1848, Gogol returned to Russia from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and passed his last years in restless movement throughout the country. While visiting the capitals, he stayed with friends such as Mikhail Pogodin and Sergey Aksakov. During this period, he also spent much time with his old Ukrainian friends, Maksymovych and Osyp Bodiansky. He intensified his relationship with a starets or spiritual elder, Matvey Konstantinovsky, whom he had known for several years. Konstantinovsky seems to have strengthened in Gogol the fear of perdition (damnation) by insisting on the sinfulness of all his imaginative work.

==Death==

Exaggerated ascetic practices undermined his health and he became deeply depressed. On the night of 24 February 1852, he burned some of his manuscripts, which contained most of the second part of &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. He explained this as a mistake, a practical joke played on him by the Devil. Soon thereafter, he took to bed, refused all food, and died in great pain nine days later.

Gogol was mourned in the Saint Tatiana church at the Moscow University before his burial and then buried at the Danilov Monastery, close to his fellow Slavophile Aleksey Khomyakov. His grave was marked by a large stone (Golgotha), topped by a Russian Orthodox cross.

In 1931, with Russia now ruled by communists, Moscow authorities decided to demolish the monastery and had Gogol&#x27;s remains transferred to the Novodevichy Cemetery. His body was discovered lying face down, which gave rise to the conspiracy theory that Gogol had been buried alive. The authorities moved the Golgotha stone to the new gravesite, but removed the cross; in 1952, the Soviets replaced the stone with a bust of Gogol. The stone was later reused for the tomb of Gogol&#x27;s admirer Mikhail Bulgakov. In 2009, in connection with the bicentennial of Gogol&#x27;s birth, the bust was moved to the museum at the Novodevichy Cemetery, and the original Golgotha stone was returned, along with a copy of the original Orthodox cross.

The first Gogol monument in Moscow, a Symbolist statue on Arbat Square, represented the sculptor Nikolay Andreyev&#x27;s idea of Gogol rather than the real man. Unveiled in 1909, the statue received praise from Ilya Repin and from Leo Tolstoy as an outstanding projection of Gogol&#x27;s tortured personality. Everything changed after the October Revolution. Joseph Stalin did not like the statue, and it was replaced by a more orthodox Socialist Realist monument in 1952. It took enormous efforts to save Andreyev&#x27;s original work from destruction; it stands in front of the house where Gogol died.

==Style==

D. S. Mirsky characterizes Gogol&#x27;s universe as &quot;one of the most marvellous, unexpected – in the strictest sense, original – worlds ever created by an artist of words&quot;.

Gogol saw the outer world strangely metamorphosed, a singular gift particularly evident from the fantastic spatial transformations in his Gothic stories, &quot;A Terrible Vengeance&quot; and &quot;A Bewitched Place&quot;. His pictures of nature are strange mounds of detail heaped on detail, resulting in an unconnected chaos of things: &quot;His people are caricatures, drawn with the method of the caricaturist – which is to exaggerate salient features and to reduce them to geometrical pattern. But these cartoons have a convincingness, a truthfulness, and inevitability – attained as a rule by slight but definitive strokes of unexpected reality – that seems to beggar the visible world itself.&quot; According to Andrey Bely, Gogol&#x27;s work influenced the emergence of Gothic romance, and served as a forerunner for absurdism and impressionism.

The aspect under which the mature Gogol sees reality is expressed by the Russian word &quot;poshlost&#x27;&quot;, which means something similar to &quot;triviality, banality, inferiority&quot;, moral and spiritual, widespread in a group of people or the entire society. Like Sterne before him, Gogol was a great destroyer of prohibitions and of romantic illusions. He undermined Russian Romanticism by making vulgarity reign where only the sublime and the beautiful had before. &quot;Characteristic of Gogol is a sense of boundless superfluity that is soon revealed as utter emptiness and a rich comedy that suddenly turns into metaphysical horror.&quot;
His stories often interweave pathos and mockery, while &quot;The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich&quot; begins as a merry farce and ends with the famous dictum &quot;It is dull in this world, gentlemen!&quot;

==Politics==

It stunned Gogol when some critics interpreted &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; as an indictment of Tsarism despite Nicholas I&#x27;s patronage of the play. Gogol himself, an adherent of the Slavophile movement, believed in a divinely inspired mission for both the House of Romanov and the Russian Orthodox Church. Like Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Gogol sharply disagreed with those Russians who preached constitutional monarchy and the disestablishment of the Orthodox Church. Gogol saw his work as a critique that would change Russia for the better.

After defending autocracy, serfdom, and the Orthodox Church in his book &quot;Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends&quot; (1847), Gogol came under attack from his former patron Vissarion Belinsky. The first Russian intellectual to publicly preach the economic theories of Karl Marx, Belinsky accused Gogol of betraying his readership by defending the &quot;status quo&quot;.

== National identity ==

Gogol was born in the Ukrainian Cossack town of Sorochyntsi. According to Edyta Bojanowska, Gogol&#x27;s images of Ukraine are in-depth, distinguished by description of folklore and history. In his Evenings on a Farm, Gogol pictures Ukraine as a &quot;nation ... united by organic culture, historical memory, and language&quot;. His image of Russia lacks this depth and is always based in the present, particularly focused on Russia&#x27;s bureaucracy and corruption. &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, according to Bojanowska, &quot;presents Russian uniqueness as a catalog of faults and vices.&quot; The duality of Gogol’s national identity is frequently expressed as a view that &quot;in the aesthetic, psychological, and existential senses Gogol is inscribed ... into Ukrainian culture&quot;, while &quot;in historical and cultural terms he is part of Russian literature and culture&quot;. Slavicist Edyta Bojanowska writes that Gogol, after arriving in St. Petersburg, was surprised to find that he was perceived as a Ukrainian, and even as a &quot;khokhol&quot; (hick). Bojanowska argues that it was this experience that &quot;made him into a &quot;self-conscious Ukrainian&quot;&quot;. According to Ilchuk, dual national identities were typical at that time as a &quot;compromise with the empire&#x27;s demand for national homogenization&quot;.

Professor of Russian literature Kathleen Scollins notes the tendency to politicize Gogol&#x27;s identity, and comments on the erasure of Gogol&#x27;s Ukrainianness by the Russian literary establishment, which she argues &quot;reveals the insecurity of many Russians about their own imperial identity&quot;. According to Scollins, Gogol&#x27;s narrative double-voicedness in both &quot;Evenings&quot; and &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; and &quot;pidginized Russian&quot; of the Zaporizhian Cossacks in &quot;The Night before Christmas represents a &quot;strateg[y] of resistance, self-assertion, and divergence&quot;&quot;. Linguist Daniel Green notes &quot;the complexities of an imperial culture in which Russian and Ukrainian literatures and identities informed and shaped each other, with Gogol´ playing a key role in these processes&quot;.

Gogol&#x27;s appreciation of Ukraine grew during his discovery of Ukrainian history, and he concluded that &quot;Ukraine possessed exactly the kind of cultural wholeness, proud tradition, and self-awareness that Russia lacked.&quot; He rejected or was critical of many of the postulates of official Russian history about Ukrainian nationhood. His unpublished &quot;Mazepa’s Meditations&quot; presents Ukrainian history in a manner that justifies Ukraine’s &quot;historic right to independence&quot;. Before 1836, Gogol had planned to move to Kyiv to study Ukrainian ethnography and history, and it was after these plans failed that he decided to become a Russian writer.

Professor of literature and Gogol researcher Oleh Ilnytzkyj also argues against the traditional classification of Nikolai Gogol as a Russian writer, saying that he should be viewed as a Ukrainian writer operating within an imperial culture. The &quot;Russian&quot; view of Gogol, he contends, arises from &quot;all-Russianness,&quot; an ideology aimed at assimilating the East Slavs into a singular &quot;Russian&quot; nation. Gogol was appropriated by an underdeveloped Russian literature, which downplayed his Ukrainian heritage and nationalism to bolster its own prestige. Ilnytzkyj emphasizes that Russian functioned as an imperial lingua franca rather than a marker of nationality, serving as a literary language adopted by Ukrainian society to advance a Ukrainian national agenda before Ukrainian became the preferred option. He refutes the notion that Gogol’s Ukrainian and Russian works reflect a &quot;divided soul,&quot; portraying them instead as unified expressions of Ukrainian nationalism—rooted in a deep love for Ukraine and disdain for Russia, from which he self-exiled for twelve years. Gogol’s struggle, Ilnytzkyj argues, was not with his identity but with the demands placed on him by Russian imperial expectations.

In his interpretation of Taras Bulba (1842), Ilnytzkyj argues that the second edition of the novel is a profound assertion of Ukrainian nationalism, supported by a meticulous examination of Gogol’s use of terms such as russkii, Rossiia, and tsar&#x27;. According to Ilnytzkyj, Gogol deliberately linked his Ukrainian Cossack characters to the legacy of Kyivan Rus’, crafting a distinct Ukrainian-Rus’ian identity with the term russkii—a direct challenge to the &quot;all-Russian&quot; narrative advanced by Russian imperial ideology. While Gogol’s legacy occupies a place in both Ukrainian and Russian literary traditions, Ilnytzkyj cautions against confusing his dual influence with a hyphenated identity, emphasizing instead Gogol’s fundamental Ukrainian identity within a transnational imperial framework. Finally, Ilnytzkyj asserts that nothing Gogol wrote after 1842 undermines his identity as a Ukrainian writer. After publishing Dead Souls and the revised Taras Bulba, Gogol ceased to function as an artist, despite attempts to sustain his earlier creative efforts. His later non-fiction, shaped by a religious crisis and pressure to revise his views on Russia, cannot negate the Ukrainian nationalist and anti-Russian achievements of his earlier fiction.

==Influence and interpretations==
Even before the publication of &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, Belinsky recognized Gogol as the first Russian-language realist writer and as the head of the natural school, to which he also assigned younger or lesser authors such as Goncharov, Turgenev, Dmitry Grigorovich, Vladimir Dahl and Vladimir Sollogub. Gogol himself appeared skeptical about the existence of such a literary movement. Although he recognized &quot;several young writers&quot; who &quot;have shown a particular desire to observe real life&quot;, he upbraided the deficient composition and style of their works. Nevertheless, subsequent generations of radical critics celebrated Gogol (the author in whose world a nose roams the streets of the Russian capital) as a great realist, a reputation decried by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as &quot;the triumph of Gogolesque irony&quot;.

The period of literary modernism saw a revival of interest in and a change of attitude towards Gogol&#x27;s work. One of the pioneering works of Russian formalism was Eichenbaum&#x27;s reappraisal of &quot;The Overcoat&quot;. In the 1920s, a group of Russian short-story writers, known as the Serapion Brothers, placed Gogol among their precursors and consciously sought to imitate his techniques. The leading novelists of the period – notably Yevgeny Zamyatin and Mikhail Bulgakov – also admired Gogol and followed in his footsteps. In 1926, Vsevolod Meyerhold staged &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; as a &quot;comedy of the absurd situation&quot;, revealing to his fascinated spectators a corrupt world of endless self-deception. In 1934, Andrei Bely published the most meticulous study of Gogol&#x27;s literary techniques up to that date, in which he analyzed the colours prevalent in Gogol&#x27;s work depending on the period, his impressionistic use of verbs, the expressive discontinuity of his syntax, the complicated rhythmical patterns of his sentences, and many other secrets of his craft. Based on this work, Vladimir Nabokov published a summary account of Gogol&#x27;s masterpieces.
Gogol&#x27;s impact on Russian literature has endured, yet various critics have appreciated his works differently. Belinsky, for instance, berated his horror stories as &quot;moribund, monstrous works&quot;, while Andrei Bely counted them among his most stylistically daring creations. Nabokov especially admired &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, and &quot;The Overcoat&quot; as works of genius, proclaiming that &quot;when, as in his immortal &#x27;The Overcoat&#x27;, Gogol really let himself go and pottered happily on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced.&quot; Critics traditionally interpreted &quot;The Overcoat&quot; as a masterpiece of &quot;humanitarian realism&quot;, but Nabokov and some other attentive readers argued that &quot;holes in the language&quot; make the story susceptible to interpretation as a supernatural tale about a ghostly double of a &quot;small man&quot;. Of all Gogol&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Nose&quot; has stubbornly defied all abstruse interpretations: D.S. Mirsky declared it &quot;a piece of sheer play, almost sheer nonsense&quot;. In recent years, however, &quot;The Nose&quot; has become the subject of several postmodernist and postcolonial interpretations.

The portrayals of Jewish characters in his work have led to Gogol developing a reputation for antisemitism. Due to these portrayals, the Russian Zionist writer Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky condemned Russian Jews who participated in celebrations of Gogol&#x27;s centenary. Later critics have also pointed to the apparent antisemitism in his writings, as well as in those of his contemporary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Felix Dreizin and David Guaspari, for example, in their &quot;The Russian Soul and the Jew: Essays in Literary Ethnocentrism&quot;, discuss &quot;the significance of the Jewish characters and the negative image of the Ukrainian Jewish community in Gogol&#x27;s novel &quot;Taras Bulba&quot;, pointing out Gogol&#x27;s attachment to anti-Jewish prejudices prevalent in Russian and Ukrainian culture.&quot; In Léon Poliakov&#x27;s &quot;The History of Antisemitism&quot;, the author mentions that &quot;The &#x27;Yankel&#x27; from &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; indeed became the archetypal Jew in Russian literature. Gogol painted him as supremely exploitative, cowardly, and repulsive, albeit capable of gratitude. But it seems perfectly natural in the story that he and his cohorts be drowned in the Dniper by the Cossack lords. Above all, Yankel is ridiculous, and the image of the plucked chicken that Gogol used has made the rounds of great Russian authors.&quot;

Despite his portrayal of Jewish characters, Gogol left a powerful impression even on Jewish writers who inherited his literary legacy. Amelia Glaser has noted the influence of Gogol&#x27;s literary innovations on Sholem Aleichem, who 
&quot;chose to model much of his writing, and even his appearance, on Gogol... What Sholem Aleichem was borrowing from Gogol was a rural East European landscape that may have been dangerous, but could unite readers through the power of collective memory. He also learned from Gogol to soften this danger through laughter, and he often rewrites Gogol&#x27;s Jewish characters, correcting anti-Semitic stereotypes and narrating history from a Jewish perspective.&quot;
===In music and film===
Gogol&#x27;s oeuvre has also had an impact on Russia&#x27;s non-literary culture, and his stories have been adapted numerous times into opera and film. The Russian composer Alfred Schnittke wrote the eight-part &quot;Gogol Suite&quot; as incidental music to &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; performed as a play, and Dmitri Shostakovich set &quot;The Nose&quot; as his first opera in 1928 – a peculiar choice of subject for what was meant to initiate the great tradition of Soviet opera. More recently, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Gogol&#x27;s birth in 1809, Vienna&#x27;s renowned Theater an der Wien commissioned music and libretto for a full-length opera on the life of Gogol from Russian composer and writer Lera Auerbach.

More than 135 films have been based on Gogol&#x27;s work, the most recent being &quot;The Girl in the White Coat&quot; (2011).

==Legacy==
Gogol has been featured many times on Russian and Soviet postage stamps; he is also well represented on stamps worldwide. Several commemorative coins have been issued in the USSR and Russia. In 2009, the National Bank of Ukraine issued a commemorative coin dedicated to Gogol. Streets have been named after Gogol in various cities, including Moscow, Sofia, Lipetsk, Odesa, Myrhorod, Krasnodar, Vladimir, Vladivostok, Penza, Petrozavodsk, Riga, Bratislava, Belgrade, Harbin and many other towns and cities.

Gogol is mentioned several times in Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Poor Folk&quot; and &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;.

Ryūnosuke Akutagawa considered Gogol along with Edgar Allan Poe his favorite writers.

==Adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 made a series of six Gogol short stories, entitled &quot;Three Ivans, Two Aunts and an Overcoat&quot; (2002, adaptations by Jim Poyser) starring Griff Rhys-Jones and Stephen Moore. The stories adapted were &quot;The Two Ivans&quot;, &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, &quot;Ivan Fyodorovich Shponka and His Aunt&quot;, &quot;The Nose&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Portrait&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;.

Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (literally the Russian title «Ночь перед Рождеством» translates as &quot;The Night before Christmas&quot;) was adapted into operatic form by at least three East Slavic composers. Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko wrote his &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; («Різдвяна ніч», with libretto in Ukrainian by Mykhailo Starytsky) in 1872. Just two years later, in 1874, Tchaikovsky composed his version under the title &quot;Vakula the Smith&quot; (with Russian libretto by Yakov Polonsky) and revised it in 1885 as &quot;Cherevichki (The Tsarina&#x27;s Slippers)&quot;. In 1894 (i.e., just after Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death), Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the libretto and music for his own opera based on the same story. &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; was also adapted into a film in 1961 entitled The Night Before Christmas. It was adapted also for radio by Adam Beeson and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 24 December 2008 and subsequently rebroadcast on both Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra on Christmas Eve 2010, 2011 and 2015.

Gogol&#x27;s story &quot;Viy&quot; was adapted into film by Russian filmmakers four times: the original &quot;Viy&quot; in 1967; the horror film &quot;Vedma&quot; (aka &quot;The Power of Fear&quot;) in 2006; the action-horror film &quot;Viy&quot; in 2014; and the horror film &quot;Gogol Viy&quot;, released in 2018. It was also adapted into the Russian full-motion video game &quot;Viy: The Story Retold&quot; (2004). Outside of Russia, the film loosely served as the inspiration for Mario Bava&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Black Sunday&quot; and the 2008 South Korean horror film &quot;Evil Spirit ; VIY&quot;.

In 2016, Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;The Portrait&quot; was announced to be adapted into a feature film of the same name, by Anastasia Elena Baranoff and Elena Vladimir Baranoff.

The Russian TV-3 television series &quot;Gogol&quot; features Nikolai Gogol as a lead character and presents a fictionalized version of his life that mixes his history with elements from his various stories. The episodes were also released theatrically starting with &quot;Gogol. The Beginning&quot; in August 2017. A sequel entitled &quot;Gogol. Viy&quot; was released in April 2018, and the third film, &quot;Gogol. Terrible Revenge&quot;, debuted in August 2018.

In 1963, an animated version of Gogol&#x27;s classic surrealist story &quot;The Nose&quot; was made by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker, using the pinscreen animation technique, for the National Film Board of Canada. A definitive animated movie adaptation of the story was released in January 2020. Meanwhile, &quot;The Nose or Conspiracy of Mavericks&quot; has been in production for about fifty years.

==History==
The first non-Native American settlers in the region consisted entirely of settlers from New England as well as settlers from Upstate New York whose parents had moved to that region shortly after the American Revolution. These were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era.

They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Jefferson County. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ, United Church of Christ and Church of God.

When the New England settlers arrived in what is now Concord there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. New Englanders and New England transplants from Upstate New York were the vast majority of Jefferson County&#x27;s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. As a result of this heritage Concord, Wisconsin was named after Concord, New Hampshire.

On February 1, 1860, Charles Ingalls married Caroline Quiner in Concord. Their daughter was Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; books.

==Notable people==
*John A. Hazelwood, educator, lawyer and Wisconsin politician

*John M. Sell, house painter and Wisconsin legislator
*George Weeks, farmer, sheriff, prison warden and Wisconsin legislator

<text>Fort Atkinson is a city in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States. It is on the Rock River, a few miles upstream from Lake Koshkonong. The population was 12,579 at the 2020 census. Fort Atkinson is the largest city located entirely in Jefferson County, as Watertown is split between Jefferson and Dodge counties. Fort Atkinson is a principal city of the Fort Atkinson-Watertown micropolitan statistical area which is in turn a sub-market of the larger Milwaukee-Waukesha-Racine CSA.

== History ==
Fort Atkinson was named after General Henry Atkinson, the commander of U.S. forces in the area during the Black Hawk War (1832) against a mixed band of Sauk, Meskwaki and Kickapoo peoples. The city developed at the site of Fort Koshkonong, which was used during that war. A replica of the original 1832 stockade has been built just outside town, although not at the original site. The fort was located to control the confluence of the Rock and Bark rivers.

The settlement grew rapidly in the mid-19th century, after the migration of pioneers from the east, especially New York State and the northern tier. They were among the many migrants carrying New England Yankee culture west across the northern tier of states.

The history and natural history of Fort Atkinson and the surrounding area are presented at the Hoard Historical Museum and National Dairy Shrine Museum. William Dempster Hoard founded the nationally distributed dairy farm magazine &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot; in Fort Atkinson in 1885. The museums include the Frank and Luella Hoard House, the Dwight and Almira Foster House, and the Knox Research Library and Archive. The Dairy Shrine portion of the complex portrays the past, present, and future of the dairy industry.

The oldest manmade features near Fort Atkinson are a cluster of prehistoric earthworks indigenous mounds just south of town. Early European settlers named them the General Atkinson Mound Group. The mounds are a remnant of the Woodland Period in present-day Wisconsin. They are effigy and geometric mounds, different from the platform mounds at nearby Aztalan State Park, built by peoples of the Mississippian culture, which reached its peak around 1300. They had settlements throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries, extending from central Illinois northward to the Great Lakes and also to the Southeastern United States. Materials were traded within the culture from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. A long panther intaglio, the Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound, appears on a mound west of town, the last remaining intaglio in the state.

Fort Atkinson&#x27;s 19th- and early 20th-century building history is preserved in the Main Street and Merchants Avenue historic districts. Other Registered Historic Places include the Fort Atkinson Water Tower, David W. and Jane Curtis House, Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman Farm, and Jones Dairy Farm.

<text>Watertown is a city in Jefferson and Dodge counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 22,926 at the 2020 census. Of this, 14,674 were in Jefferson County and 8,252 were in Dodge County; Division Street, several blocks north of downtown, marks the county line. Watertown is the most populous city in the Watertown-Fort Atkinson micropolitan area, which also includes Johnson Creek and Jefferson.

==History==

===Origin===
Watertown was first settled by Timothy Johnson, who built a cabin on the west side of the Rock River in 1836. He was born in Middleton, Middlesex County, Connecticut, on the 28th of June, 1792. A park on the west side of the city is named in his honor. The area was settled to utilize the power of the Rock River, which falls in two miles (two dams). In contrast, the Rock River falls only in upstream from Watertown. The water power was first used for sawmills, and later prompted the construction of two hydroelectric dams, one downtown (where the river flows south) and one on the eastern edge of the city (where the river flows north).

Watertown was a New England settlement. The original founders of Watertown consisted entirely of settlers from New England, particularly Connecticut, rural Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well some from upstate New York who were born to parents who had migrated to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were &quot;Yankees&quot;, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal as well as the end of the Black Hawk War. When they arrived in what is now Watertown there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before moving to what is now Watertown. Watertown, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history. It was incorporated as a village in 1849, and chartered as a city in 1853.

In the 1850s, immigrants arrived in Watertown from Germany. Most of the German immigrants who arrived in Watertown brought with them the trappings of the German middle class, including a proclivity for classical music, the Latin language and ornate furniture. Unlike instances in other parts of the country in which they faced discrimination and xenophobia, they were welcomed with open arms by the English-Puritan descended &quot;Yankee&quot; population of Watertown and Jefferson County as a whole. This warm reception led to chain migration, which in turn greatly increased the German population of the region. Culturally they had much in common with the New England derived population. For instance both groups unanimously opposed slavery and both had a pronounced love for commerce and industry. Economically both communities would thrive in Watertown for the entirety of the 19th century, not facing any measurable economic hardships until the Great Depression in the following century.

===Milwaukee and Rock River Canal===
A canal from Milwaukee to the Watertown area was once planned, but was replaced by railroad before any work had been completed, other than a dam in Milwaukee. The territorial legislature incorporated the Milwaukee and Rock River Canal company in 1836, but the plan was abandoned in 1848. The canal would have provided a waterway between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, but even if completed, it may not have seen much success because railroads had already become the preferred mode of transportation.

===19th century growth===
In 1853, a plank road was completed from Milwaukee to Watertown. After plank roads were no longer used, the route was replaced by highway (Wisconsin Highway 16) and a railroad. A street named &quot;Watertown Plank Road&quot; survives in Milwaukee. It is referred to in the &quot;Plank Road Brewery&quot; family of beers, produced by Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee.
There was an influx of German immigrants in the late 19th century. The city is the home of the first kindergarten in the United States, started in 1856 by Margarethe Schurz, wife of statesman Carl Schurz; the building that housed this kindergarten is now located on the grounds of the Octagon House Museum in Watertown.

===City railroad bond default===
Growth of the city was substantially hampered when Watertown issued almost half a million dollars in bonds to support the building of two railroads to town to encourage further growth: the Chicago &amp; Fond du Lac Company and the Milwaukee, Watertown &amp; Madison Road. The success of the plank road convinced residents that a railroad would be even more beneficial, and bonds were issued from 1853 to 1855. The Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad, as it was called before it extended to Madison, was completed in 1855, only the second line in the state.

Soon after, in the Panic of 1857, the two railroads went bankrupt. The bonds were sold by the original investors to out-of-town speculators at a small fraction of their face value. Since the railroads were never built and did not produce revenue, the city was unable to pay off the bonds. Moreover, the city did not feel compelled to do so because the creditors (those who held the bonds) were not only from out of town, but weren&#x27;t even the original holders. Yet the creditors exerted so much pressure on the city to pay off the bonds that Watertown effectively dissolved its government so that there was no legal entity (the government as a whole or officers) that could be served a court order to pay or appear in court. The case was not resolved until 1889, when it had risen all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which essentially dismissed the case of the creditors. A small amount remained to be paid, and this was not paid off until 1905, half a century later.

==Geography and climate==
Watertown is located in southeastern Wisconsin, approximately midway between Madison and Milwaukee, at 43°12&#x27;N 88°43&#x27;W (43.193, −88.724). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Small communities in the immediate area (e.g., within the school district) include Richwood, Lebanon, Old Lebanon, Sugar Island, Pipersville, Concord, Ebenezer, and Grellton.

The Rock River flows through Watertown in a horseshoe bend before heading south and west on its way to the Mississippi River. The city originally developed inside the horseshoe, though it has long since grown beyond. Silver Creek adjoins the river in the city, as does a short creek on the west side.

The most notable geographical feature is a high density of drumlins, long hills formed by the glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation as they retreated northwards. Hills in the area are elongated in the north-south direction.

<text>Elroy is a city in Juneau County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Baraboo River and at the east end of the Elroy-Sparta State Trail. The population was 1,356 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Elroy was named in 1858, supposedly after a place in Scotland.

By another account, the original residents chose &quot;LeRoy&quot; as the name for the community and its post office, but were informed that another community in the state had that name already. Switching the first two letters was suggested and adopted.

A post office called Elroy has been in operation since 1862.
Elroy was for many years an important railroad hub in the area. The Baraboo Air Line Railroad reached Elroy in the 1870s. The Air Line was later acquired by the Chicago and North Western Railway and the line was pushed on to Sparta, Wisconsin. It eventually became the main line of the CNW between Chicago, Illinois and Winona, Minnesota. The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway also became a presence in Elroy when its line was built from St. Paul, Minnesota, south through Camp Douglas, Wisconsin. Both railroad companies kept roundhouses and other operations in Elroy. Rail traffic on the Elroy portion of the CNW eventually declined, due to the construction of better mainline trackage further to the north (via Adams, Necedah, and Wyeville). The rails on this portion were taken up in the mid-1960s and the right-of-way was converted into the Elroy-Sparta Bike Trail, as it remains today. The CNW tracks from Elroy southeast to Reedsburg, Wisconsin, along with those of the north-south Omaha line, were taken up in the 1990s, and these rights-of-way are now known as the &quot;400&quot; State Trail, and the Omaha Trail, respectively.

==Geography==
Elroy is located at (43.742016, -90.269597).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The city is primarily surrounded by the Town of Plymouth and partially touches the Town of Wonewoc on the southern end.

A small Lutheran congregation, St. Luke&#x27;s, has existed since about 1890. The church was built in 1897 and remains in use today.

On June 29, 2010, in a special election, most of the remainder of the town of Bristol was annexed to the village of Bristol (effective July 4, 2010), while a small section of the town was annexed to the village of Pleasant Prairie. The town of Bristol ceased to exist.

<text>Camp Lake is a neighborhood and former census-designated place in the village of Salem Lakes, Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population of Camp Lake was 3,665 at the 2010 census. Upon incorporation of the village of Salem Lakes in 2017, the census statistical boundaries for the neighborhood ceased to exist.

==History==

Camp Lake was named after a lake noted on the first township surveys. When the Wisconsin Central/Soo railroad came through the area, there was a depot stop created as Camp Lake. Prior to that, James McVey had a hotel called the Camp Lake Hotel and Gardens. The earliest visitors to Camp Lake were children and their mothers from Chicago. The Camp still operates and continues to offer community services. Camp Lake has had a post office since the 1910 era.

Center Lake and Camp Lake were noted on the earliest maps as two separate lakes with an isthmus. Navigators cannot traverse the isthmus. The high level of this isthmus made this the choice area for the Wisconsin Central/Soo Railroad to cross between the lakes and escape the low-lying areas to the south of Camp Lake.

In the 1920s, Camp Lake Oaks subdivision was the location of one of the nation&#x27;s early radio stations, WCLO, for &quot;Camp Lake Oaks&quot;. Camp Lake Oaks was a subdivision built on property owned at one time by the Knickerbocker Ice Company on the northeast corner of Camp Lake south of the Soo rail line. Charles Whitmore used the radio station to advertise his &quot;new&quot; subdivision and offer the community music and news on the air waves. The building where the station was located is now a private residence. The station is still on the air in Janesville, Wisconsin.

Many of the early (1840–50) buildings in this hamlet still exist, although they are not being used for their original purposes. Hotels are now apartments, grocery stores are now restaurants, and residences are now businesses.

==Geography==

<text>Kenosha () is a city in and the seat of Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 99,986, which made it the fourth-most populous city in Wisconsin. Situated on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, Kenosha is a satellite city located roughly south of Milwaukee and north of Chicago and has significant cultural and economic connections to both cities. Interstate 94 runs along Kenosha&#x27;s western border.

Kenosha was once a center of industrial activity; it was home to large automotive factories which fueled its economy during the 20th century. Like some other Rust Belt cities, Kenosha lost these factories in the 1980s, causing it to gradually transition into a services-based economy. In the 2010s, the city and surrounding county have benefited from an expanding economy and increased job growth. It is home to the headquarters of the Fortune 1000 tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc., as well as the clothing company Jockey International. Kenosha is home to multiple educational institutions, including the University of Wisconsin–Parkside, Herzing University, Carthage College, and Gateway Technical College. Residents of the city are called Kenoshans.

==History==
The Potawatomi originally named the area (also transcribed , ) &quot;place of the pike&quot;, while the Menominee referred to the place as , meaning &quot;Northern Pike&quot;. The early Ojibwa name is reported as &quot;trout (pike) come all at once&quot;. These refer to the annual spawning of trout, in which thousands of fish entered the rivers from Lake Michigan, providing food for the coming months.

Sites of early human habitation have been discovered in the Kenosha vicinity. It remains unclear if any sites pre-date the Clovis culture but, if so, those sites would be contemporaneous with the Wisconsin glaciation. Paleo-Indians settled in the area at least 13,500 years ago.

===European settlement===
The first European settlers, part of the Western Emigration Company, arrived in the early 1830s, from Hannibal and Troy, New York, led by John Bullen Jr., who sought to purchase enough land for a town. Thwarted in Milwaukee and Racine, the group arrived at Pike Creek on 6 June 1835, building log houses and later homes of frame, native stone, and brick. The first school and churches followed, with platting completed in 1836. As more settlers arrived and the first post office was established, the village was known as Pike Creek, then renamed Southport in 1837, a name which lives on as a southeast-side neighborhood, park, and elementary school, and has been adopted by several businesses.

The area became an important Great Lakes shipping port. In 1850, the village changed its name from Southport to Kenosha, which is its current name. The name Kenosha was adapted from the Chippewa word &quot;kinoje&quot; (pike or pickerel).

Between 1902 and 1988, Kenosha produced millions of automobiles and trucks including makes and models such as Jeffery, Rambler, Nash, Hudson, LaFayette, and American Motors Corporation (AMC). In May 1954, Nash acquired Detroit-based Hudson and the new firm was named American Motors Corporation. A westside park and an elementary school are named for Charles W. Nash. A prototype steam car was built in Kenosha by the Sullivan-Becker engineering firm in 1900. Two years later, the Thomas B. Jeffery Company, builders of the Sterling bicycle, began production of the Rambler runabout. In 1902, Rambler and Oldsmobile were the first cars to employ mass-production techniques. The 1903 Rambler was also the first US-built production automobile to use a steering wheel, rather than the then-common tiller-controlled steering. Auto executive Charles W. Nash purchased Jeffery in 1916 and the new company became Nash Motors.

In 1973, residents in the Town of Pleasant Prairie sought to have territory annexed and rezoned to allow for the industrial development of agricultural property. In the ensuing legal battle between Kenosha and Pleasant Prairie, the town accused the city of improperly coercing or bribing agricultural property owners to file for rezoning and annexation in order to obtain city water and electric services that could not be provided by the town. The town argued that industrial development would jeopardize the town&#x27;s residential nature. The court found the annexation proper, with no illicit bribes or improper conduct by the city.

In partnership with French automaker Renault, AMC manufactured several models in Kenosha in the early 1980s, including the Alliance, which won the 1983 &quot;Car of The Year&quot; award from &quot;Motor Trend&quot;. Two decades earlier, AMC&#x27;s 1963 Rambler Classic had also received the award. In 1987, Renault sold its controlling interest in AMC to Chrysler Corporation, which had already contracted with AMC for the production of its M-body midsized cars at the Kenosha plant. The AMC Lakefront plant (1960–1988), a smaller facility, was demolished in 1990 (a chimney-demolition ceremony that June drew 10,000 spectators) and was redeveloped into HarborPark. The area now hosts lakeside condominiums, a large recreational marina, numerous parks and promenades, sculptures, fountains, the Kenosha Public Museum, and the Civil War Museum, all of which are connected by the Kenosha Electric Railway streetcar system.

From the beginning of the 20th century through the 1930s, Italian, Irish, Polish, and German immigrants, many of them skilled craftsmen, made their way to the city and contributed to the city&#x27;s construction, culture, architecture, music, and literature.

In June 1993, the city installed reproductions of the historic Sheridan LeGrande street lights that were specially designed for Kenosha by Westinghouse Electric in 1928; these can be seen on Sixth Avenue between 54th Street and 59th Place. A classic downtown electric streetcar system was opened on June 17, 2000, and on September 22, 2014, the Kenosha city council approved a crosstown extension of the system incorporating the existing route between 48th and 61st Streets on both 6th and 8th Avenues.

On December 7, 2021, &quot;Carl the Kenosha Turkey&quot;, a turkey who had become a social media sensation and local icon, was hit by a vehicle and killed. The turkey was named the city&#x27;s unofficial mascot in 2020 and was seen by some as a source of positivity as Kenosha faced hardships in 2020–2021.

===August 2020 protests and unrest===
In the aftermath of the August 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake, protests, riots, and civil unrest occurred in Kenosha. Demonstrations were marked by daily peaceful protesting followed by confrontations with law enforcement and rioting, looting, vandalism, and arson at night. A state of emergency was declared on August 23, and the National Guard was activated the following day. On August 25, a controversial shooting occurred during the unrest, leading to a polarized response. Both then-President Donald Trump and then-Presidential candidate Joe Biden visited Kenosha.

Protests continued daily through August 29 with approximately 2,000 members of the National Guard assisting the city in restoring order. Damages exceeding $50 million occurred, with over 100 businesses affected.

In November 2021, Kenosha once again became the subject of worldwide attention as the jury trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the defendant in the 2020 unrest shooting, commenced. As part of the city&#x27;s emergency preparedness, over 500 members of the National Guard were activated ahead of the verdict. Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed Rittenhouse&#x27;s unlawful possession charge and the curfew violation charge for being legally unsupported, and a unanimous jury found Rittenhouse not guilty of the remaining charges. Following the verdict on November 19, some protests occurred in Kenosha but remained peaceful.

===Historic districts===
Kenosha has 21 locations and four districts (Library Park Historic District, Third Avenue Historic District, Civic Center Historic District, and Pearl Street Historic District) listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city has a Kenosha Landmarks Commission, and among the many local city-designated landmarks are the 1929 YMCA, the Manor House, the John McCaffary House, the St. Matthew Episcopal Church, the Washington Park Clubhouse, the Ritacca Triplex, the Ritacca Service Station, and the Justin Weed House.

==Geography==

===2023 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey one-year estimates===
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 99,218 people, 37,376 households, and 24,090 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 40,643 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 77.1% White, 10.0% African American, 0.6% Native American, 1.7% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 6.8% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races.

The 2010 census reported that 51 percent of Kenosha residents moved in from other cities and states. The Chamber of Commerce attributed this to the city&#x27;s museums, lakeshore attractions, cultural and work opportunities, its public-school system, transportation amenities, and relatively lower costs-of-living.

The importance of manufacturing jobs in Kenosha continues to diminish with only 11.7 percent or 7,769 of the total workforce of 66,362 area residents involved, a decline of 22 percent since 1990 and much lower than the statewide percentage of 16.4 percent.

The biggest surge in Kenosha employment by percentage has been in the white-collar workforce. From 1990 to 2017, the percentage of Kenosha&#x27;s workforce in business and professional services grew nearly fivefold from 3.2% of the workforce to 11%, while statewide the trend was slightly more than double. The growth has been both to due new office developments in the city, but also due to new suburban developments as Illinois workers seek more affordable housing.

==Economy==
Kenosha&#x27;s economy is fueled by its position within the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor. Nearly half of Kenosha&#x27;s workforce commutes outside of Kenosha County to their employers. The Chicago-area commuter rail network Metra has a route between Downtown Chicago and Kenosha. A 2016 study found that Kenosha&#x27;s &quot;out-commuters most likely work for positions in healthcare, manufacturing, professional/scientific and technical services. The majority of occupations included management, business/financial, and office/administrative support position&quot;, and 73 percent of out-commuters have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a higher level of education. Due to lower housing costs compared to other parts of the Chicago metropolitan area, Kenosha is a popular relocation area those wanting to benefit from high paying jobs and a lower cost of living.

Snap-on Tools world headquarters and Jockey International corporate headquarters are in Kenosha. Kenosha has a number of light industrial and distribution companies in outlying business parks. Amazon, Rustoleum, Uline, Associated Wholesale Grocers, and others have warehouses and distribution centers located in Kenosha. In 2022, Square Roots farm opened a fully indoor hydroponic facility within refurbished shipping containers in Kenosha. It is expected to be able to grow 2.4 million packages of fresh produce annually for distribution to the surrounding Chicago metro area and into the Milwaukee metro area.

Tourists spent an estimated $196.6 million in Kenosha County in 2015, with the county ranking fourth in the state in tourist money generated.

Downtown Kenosha sits along the Lake Michigan lakefront. In recent years, organizations such as Downtown Kenosha Inc. (DKI) manage the day-to-day economic development efforts, business support and promotional activities for the district. In 2023, a $450 million development to the downtown area was approved by the city council. The development plan will include thousands of apartments, condominiums, office buildings, retail spaces, hotels, and government buildings all within a nine-block radius. 

Downtown Kenosha is home to the Kenosha HarborMarket, a European-style farmer&#x27;s market held mid-May through mid-October on 2nd Ave bisected by the 56th Street boulevard streetcar line. It hosts stalls with local food products and artisan creations. In addition, the downtown area has a collection of over 50 restaurants, bars, breweries, and shops of various kinds. Frank&#x27;s Diner, which has been an attraction in downtown Kenosha since 1926, is the oldest diner in the United States and has been featured twice on Guy Fieri&#x27;s &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives&quot;, once in 2007 and again in 2021. Residential developments have also provided added condominiums and apartments.

Near downtown, the Kenosha Public Museum System includes the main Kenosha Public Museum, the Dinosaur Discovery Museum in association with Carthage College and the Smithsonian, and the Kenosha Civil War Museum. On Simmons Island, the Kenosha History Center and adjacent Maritime Museum offer memorabilia from the city&#x27;s nautical past.

In February 2020, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers announced $10 million in state funding toward the proposed Kenosha STEM Innovation Center within the Kenosha Innovation Neighborhood (KIN), which is a currently planned 60,000 sq. ft. building to be constructed on the empty 107 acre site of the former Chrysler factory. It will serve as a multi-purpose building dedicated to education, workforce development, and entrepreneurial opportunities. In December 2020, the city announced a plan for the KIN. In July 2021, the federal government awarded Kenosha $4.9 million in federal CARES Act funds toward the neighborhood, and in November, Mayor John Antaramian announced that Lakeview Technology Academy would relocate to the KIN. In March 2022, Evers officially announced $15 million in funding toward the KIN, which is expected to take 8–10 years to be fully completed and will include the collaboration of UW-Parkside, Carthage College, Gateway Technical College, and Herzing University.

==Arts and culture==

Kenosha&#x27;s four downtown museums, the Kenosha Public Museum, the Civil War Museum and the Dinosaur Discovery Museum, and the Kenosha Historical Center are Smithsonian Institution affiliates.

Completed in 2001, the Kenosha Public Museum is on the Lake Michigan shoreline. Its main exhibit is a prehistoric woolly mammoth skeleton uncovered in western Kenosha in 1992. Cut-marks on its bones indicate that the animals were butchered by humans using stone tools. Carbon dating indicates their age to be 12,500 radiocarbon years old or 14,500 calendar years old, one thousand radiocarbon years earlier than the previously-accepted presence of humans in the Americas. The museum also displays other ice age and fine art exhibits. A second permanent exhibit on local ecosystems and the history of museums and science opened in 2019.

The Kenosha History Center is adjacent to the 1917 city water treatment plant on Simmons Island adjoining the 1866 Kenosha Light Station. It showcases the history of Kenosha from the time of Native American settlements and the first European settlements to the present day. The 1906 Kenosha North Pier Light sits just east.

Kenosha&#x27;s Civil War Museum opened on June 13, 2008. The main exhibit, &quot;The Fiery Trial&quot;, opened September 15, 2008. It is a exhibit offering an interactive experience of the role of six Midwestern states before, during, and after the American Civil War.

<doc id="139225" wikidata="Q2291270" url="?curid=139225" title="Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin">
<text>Pleasant Prairie is a village in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. Located along the southwestern shoreline of Lake Michigan, Pleasant Prairie was home to 21,250 people at the 2020 census. The village is positioned directly south of the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin and directly north of the Illinois border.

Although located just south of Milwaukee, it is part of the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s Chicago metropolitan area despite being north of Chicago. Among its notable features are the RecPlex and Chiwaukee Prairie.

==History==

The Pleasant Prairie area was the center of Native American activity in pre-pioneer Wisconsin. Some of the earliest traces of Native American life in Wisconsin have been found along State Highway 32 and State Highway 165, Barnes Creek, and in the Carol Beach area.

The early Native American campsites were located along what was once the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Pleasant Prairie also saw pioneers arrive in Wisconsin on the Jambeau Trail, now known as Green Bay Road. In addition, several natural historic sites such as the Chiwaukee Prairie and the Kenosha Sand Dunes lie undisturbed in Pleasant Prairie.

===Settlement===
The area&#x27;s first white settler was Horace Woodbridge, who arrived on June 4, 1833; Henry Miller arrived later that same month. Pleasant Prairie had its beginnings as a political entity in April 1842 when the first town meeting was held and the first election of town officials took place. The early town officials met in the Williams Congregational Church located at 93rd Street and Green Bay Road. Later the old church became the town hall. Pleasant Prairie originally was a town nearly in size.

Over the next 150 years, the city of Kenosha began to annex lands south of 60th Street and west from Lake Michigan. The town of Pleasant Prairie was slowly reduced in size as Kenosha grew. There were nine separate settlement areas in the town that in some cases became the starting point for significant growth. Some no longer exist.

The original unincorporated community of Pleasant Prairie was located at 104th Avenue and Bain Station Road.

===Dynamite plant catastrophe===
In the early 20th century, Pleasant Prairie was the site of a 190-acre DuPont blasting powder plant. The plant, including 40 buildings, had an ongoing record of accidents. In 1909, residents of Kenosha County brought suit against the company on the grounds that the plant was a public menace. The suit was won by the company.

On March 9, 1911, most of the town was destroyed by the explosion of five magazines holding 300 tons of dynamite, 105,000 kegs of black blasting powder, and five nearby railcars holding more dynamite housed at the plant. The explosions rendered most houses within five miles of the blast center uninhabitable. Several hundred people were injured, and three plant employees, E. S. &quot;Old Man&quot; Thompson, Clarence Brady and Joseph Flynt, along with Alice Finch, who dropped dead of fright, were killed. The low death toll was attributed to the plant being closed at the time of the explosion. A crater 100 feet deep was blasted under the former dynamite house. Damage estimates were put at $1,500,000, equivalent to $37,000,000 in 2015. Almost equal damage was done in Bristol, four miles west of Pleasant Prairie.

The force of the explosion was felt more than 130 miles in every direction and was heard as far away as Ohio and Iowa. Many in the Midwest at first believed it was an earthquake. Residents in nearby Lake County, Illinois, saw the fireball and remembering the Peshtigo fire fled their houses, jumping into Lake Michigan. Police in Chicago scoured the streets, looking for the site of a bombing. Windows were shattered as far away as Madison, Wisconsin, a distance of some 85 miles. Concerns about looting and vandalism by curiosity seekers prompted Kenosha County Sheriff Andrew Stahl to impress a hundred deputies and clear the village.

It was believed the first explosion took place in the glaze house where more than 1,100 kegs of powder were dried in steel cylinders. One steel cylinder crashed through the roof of the general store of H. A. and E. A. King, tearing a hole five feet in diameter through the roof, the first and second floor and into the earth. H. A. King, in an adjoining room, was thrown to the floor unconscious by the shock. Phil Hess, a farmer near Truesdell, Wisconsin over two miles from the factory, lost his right ear, severed by a piece of flying glass as he was entering his home. J. H. Beland of Truesdell lost his eye from flying glass, and E. A. Fox, a farmer, bled heavily when a vein in his wrist was cut.

A DuPont spokesman was reported as being perplexed by the coverage of the blast, quoted as saying &quot;explosions occur every day in steel mills, flouring mills and grain elevators with hardly a line in the paper.&quot;

The site is the location of residential homes and the Pleasant Prairie Ball Park, which is used for softball and soccer.

===Establishing independence===
Throughout much of its history, the town of Pleasant Prairie struggled to maintain its independence and identity apart from Kenosha, its larger neighbor to the north.

In 1961, the village hall moved from the former Williams Congregational Church site to rented office space in a small commercial center located on 22nd Avenue and 91st Street.

In 1967, the village government moved into a newly constructed municipal building on Springbrook Road and 39th Avenue that provided office, an auditorium, Fire Department apparatus room, and sleeping quarters.

In 1984, the town and the city of Kenosha agreed upon a plan for the orderly development and fixed boundaries for the town in exchange for an acknowledged right of property owners in various locations along the village/city border to be annexed into the city of Kenosha. A significant provision of this agreement gave Kenosha the ability to annex lands north of State Highway 50 from Green Bay Road to I-94, where the Southport Plaza shopping center, WhiteCaps subdivision, River Crossing subdivision, and Aurora Hospital are located. In exchange, Pleasant Prairie was granted the ability to protect the rest of its area from annexations and to purchase sewer and water from Kenosha.

===Becoming a village===
In 1989, the town of Pleasant Prairie was incorporated as a village by a referendum of more than 3,000 citizens in favor and 300 against. The new boundaries were fixed and the new village, along with the WisPark Corporation, began the development of LakeView Corporate Park, a center of employment for more than 8,000 people.

In 1997, eight years after the incorporation of the town into a village, the Municipal Building was updated and increased in size to accommodate village operations.

==Geography==

Pleasant Prairie is located at (42.538820, –87.870229).

Carol Beach is a residential neighborhood located in Pleasant Prairie. It is generally bordered by Lake Michigan to the east, the Wisconsin-Illinois border to the south, Sheridan Road (Wisconsin State Highway 32) to the west, and the Kenosha Sand Dunes to the north.

Carol Beach traces its roots to 1921, the year that J. H. Penny &amp; Sons purchased land south of 116th Street. Their development was called &quot;Chiwaukee On the Lake,&quot; named for being halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee. It included the mansion owned by Fred P. Fischer, which was leased by Joe Louis in 1937 while he trained at the Lakefront Stadium in Kenosha.

In 1924, Edith Rockefeller McCormick of Chicago, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller and daughter-in-law of reaper inventor Cyrus McCormick, purchased a land parcel to found a new community which soon adopted the name &quot;Chiwaukee&quot; (the area is nearly equidistant between Chicago and Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Chiwaukee was to have its own business district, golf course and playground, and its homes were to be constructed in the Tudor style. Some locals recall a promotional arch constructed over Sheridan Road to inform passersby of the new, planned community. A street network was installed, with Lake Shore Drive as the main thoroughfare.

A national contest was announced to select a permanent name for the new community. Elmer Huge of La Porte, Indiana won a $1,500 prize for his winning submission: &quot;Edithton Beach&quot;.

When the Great Depression struck, McCormick&#x27;s debts mounted and the project collapsed. The curbs and streets leading nowhere were the only visible reminders of the failed project until 1946, when local real-estate investor and developer Joseph Shaffron bought it, renamed it &quot;Carol Beach&quot; for his young daughter, and promoted the community as a &quot;second Evanston, Illinois.&quot; Some modest homes began to be built at that time.

The area is one of the most significant wetland areas in the United States and was largely protected through a compromise land use agreement between the Town of Pleasant Prairie, Kenosha County, the State of Wisconsin, and the Army Corps of Engineers. The areas that can be developed have been, and the state of Wisconsin and the Nature conservancy continue to buy remaining properties for prairie land preservation. These undeveloped tracts of land, including the Kenosha Sand Dunes, constitute the Chiwaukee Prairie.

In 1992, the Town of Pleasant Prairie, in which Carol Beach is located, became a village. The neighborhood continues to be known as Carol Beach.

====Dexter&#x27;s Corner====
Dexter&#x27;s Corner is a residential and agricultural community within the village of Pleasant Prairie. It is located at the intersection of Wisconsin Highway 31 and Springbrook Road. The area is named for the pioneer John Dexter family, the patriarch of which was a veteran of the War of 1812. The red-brick Dexter residence is located to the north of the intersection. The site is near the location of a tower for FM radio station WWDV, formerly WKZN, and WAXO.

====Ranney====
Ranney also known as Rogers Siding is a ghost town in Pleasant Prairie. It is located at the intersection of Bain Station Road and the Canadian Pacific Railroad, originally the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad). The last passenger train stopped at the Ranney Station prior to 1862, but the Ranney post office opened in 1885 and lasted into 1906.

The Bain Station of the KD Line was located just east of Ranney, and remained into the 1940s. Rogers Siding itself was a KD Line team track just west of Green Bay Road for area farmers who would load their produce for rail shipments; the siding itself was removed in the 1980s. The last house in Ranney, the former KD Line yardmaster&#x27;s house, was demolished in 2003, and the area is now devoid of all traces of community except for continuing railroad activity on the KD Line and the Canadian Pacific. Much of the property there is now owned by We Energies.

====Tobin====
Tobin is an area along 116th Street in Pleasant Prairie. The community is named for early settler Patrick Tobin. Tobin&#x27;s most famous visitors included boxer Joe Louis, who would arrive and depart at the Tobin station on the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad interurban in the mid-1930s, to train at the Ham Fisher mansion in nearby Carol Beach, and to supervise the Joe Louis Boxing Camps held at Lakefront Stadium.

==Economy==
LakeView Corporate Park is a 2,400-acre mixed-use development that houses manufacturing, distribution, office, and service operations in a park-like setting east of I-94. Among the tenants is Jelly Belly, which offered tours of its distribution facility until August 2020.

The village has opened a newer 440-acre development called Prairie Highlands Corporate Park just west of I-94. Among the tenants are Haribo, makers of gummy bears, and Nexus Pharmaceuticals.

Pleasant Prairie Premium Outlets was opened in 1988. The mall is a large, outdoor shopping center just east of I-94 at the Highway 165 exit, and often lures shoppers from the Chicago area. It has over 90 stores, many of which are factory outlets for major national brands.

The Village of Pleasant Prairie has no downtown. Early in 2019, the village enlisted a large group of residents to generate ideas for a downtown on 180 acres near the Village municipal building. Residents highlighted the need for relatively dense residential housing, a public market, restaurants and other civic amenities, all while maintaining green spaces and respecting the village&#x27;s prairie identity.

In October 2019, the village signed a contract with Rinka, a Milwaukee-based architectural design firm, to develop a master plan for the downtown based on those principles. A draft of the plan was presented to the public in June 2020.

==Parks and recreation==
One of the best-known features of Pleasant Prairie is the RecPlex. Covering over 300,000 square feet, it is the largest municipal recreational facility in the United States. The complex of buildings includes a 50-meter pool, water park, fitness center, field house, suspended track, and two NHL-sized ice rinks. The RecPlex is located in Prairie Springs Park and is adjacent to Lake Andrea. The 121-acre lake provides visitors with access to a beach, as well as opportunities to swim, boat, and fish.

The Chiwaukee Prairie State Natural Area is one of the largest prairie complexes in Wisconsin. It is an assemblage of 485 acres of coastal wetlands and sand dunes that stretch along Lake Michigan from the Illinois state line to the Kenosha Sand Dunes on its northern boundary. Embedded within these natural areas is the residential neighborhood of Carol Beach. Chiwaukee Prairie is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which are endangered. In 2015, Chiwaukee was designated as a Ramsar wetland of international significance.

Included in the LakeView development is a 425-acre nature conservancy along the Des Plaines River floodplain.

<text>Salem Lakes, formerly the town of Salem and the village of Silver Lake, is a village in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. The village was created by a municipal merger on February 14, 2017. The population was 14,601 at the 2020 census. The communities of Benet Lake, Camp Lake, Cross Lake, Fox River, Lake Shangrila, Liberty Corners, Salem, Salem Oaks, Silver Lake, Trevor, Voltz Lake, and Wilmot are wholly or partially located in the village.

==History==
In June 1837, John Dodge became the first settler in Salem proper. Shortly thereafter, General Bullen and David Bullen settled on the east bank of the Fox River and surveyed and platted a village, hoping to make Salem a main head of Fox River navigation. A bridge spanning the river was called &quot;Bullen&#x27;s Bridge&quot;.

On February 14, 2017, Salem Lakes became a village, which included the village of Silver Lake, as well as the communities of Trevor, Wilmot, and Camp Lake.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town in 2010 had a total area of 32.4 square miles (83.9 km2), of which 29.7 square miles (76.9 km2) were land and 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2, or 8.34%) were water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 9,871 people, 3,529 households, and 2,653 families residing in the town. This census occurred before the merger of the village of Silver Lake, and does not include the data from that area. The population density was . There were 3,939 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 97.33% White, 0.53% African American, 0.32% Native American, 0.30% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.80% from other races, and 0.70% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.51% of the population.

There were 3,529 households, out of which 40.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.9% were married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 18.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.79 and the average family size was 3.21.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 29.6% under the age of 18, 6.8% from 18 to 24, 34.6% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $54,392, and the median income for a family was $60,032. Males had a median income of $41,458 versus $28,438 for females. The per capita income for the town was $22,814. About 5.2% of families and 6.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.7% of those under age 18 and 4.0% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Paddock Lake and Salem are served by Westosha Central High School (located in Paddock Lake) and Wilmot High School (located in Wilmot), and Salem Consolidated Grade School and Trevor-Wilmot Elementary in Trevor.

Salem Lakes, Randall, Twin Lakes, and Paddock Lake are served by the Community Library.

<doc id="139229" wikidata="Q742833" url="?curid=139229" title="Gauss–Bonnet theorem">
<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem (or Gauss–Bonnet formula) is a fundamental formula which links the curvature of a surface to its underlying topology.

In the simplest application, the case of a triangle on a plane, the sum of its angles is 180 degrees. The Gauss–Bonnet theorem extends this to more complicated shapes and curved surfaces, connecting the local and global geometries.

The theorem is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who developed a version but never published it, and Pierre Ossian Bonnet, who published a special case in 1848.

== Statement ==
Suppose is a compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary . Let be the Gaussian curvature of , and let be the geodesic curvature of . Then

:formula_1
where is the element of area of the surface, and is the line element along the boundary of . Here, is the Euler characteristic of .

If the boundary is piecewise smooth, then we interpret the integral as the sum of the corresponding integrals along the smooth portions of the boundary, plus the sum of the angles by which the smooth portions turn at the corners of the boundary.

Many standard proofs use the theorem of turning tangents, which states roughly that the winding number of a Jordan curve is exactly ±1.

== A simple example ==

Suppose is the northern hemisphere cut out from a sphere of radius . Its Euler characteristic is 1. On the left hand side of the theorem, we have formula_2 and formula_3, because the boundary is the equator and the equator is a geodesic of the sphere. Then formula_4.

On the other hand, suppose we flatten the hemisphere to make it into a disk. This transformation is a homeomorphism, so the Euler characteristic is still 1. However, on the left hand side of the theorem we now have formula_5 and formula_6, because a circumference is not a geodesic of the plane. Then formula_7.

Finally, take a sphere octant, also homeomorphic to the previous cases. Then formula_8. Now formula_3 almost everywhere along the border, which is a geodesic triangle. But we have three right-angle corners, so formula_10.

==Interpretation and significance==
The theorem applies in particular to compact surfaces without boundary, in which case the integral 
:formula_11

can be omitted. It states that the total Gaussian curvature of such a closed surface is equal to 2 times the Euler characteristic of the surface. Note that for orientable compact surfaces without boundary, the Euler characteristic equals , where is the genus of the surface: Any orientable compact surface without boundary is topologically equivalent to a sphere with some handles attached, and counts the number of handles.

If one bends and deforms the surface , its Euler characteristic, being a topological invariant, will not change, while the curvatures at some points will. The theorem states, somewhat surprisingly, that the total integral of all curvatures will remain the same, no matter how the deforming is done. So for instance if you have a sphere with a &quot;dent&quot;, then its total curvature is 4 (the Euler characteristic of a sphere being 2), no matter how big or deep the dent.

Compactness of the surface is of crucial importance. Consider for instance the open unit disc, a non-compact Riemann surface without boundary, with curvature 0 and with Euler characteristic 1: the Gauss–Bonnet formula does not work. It holds true however for the compact closed unit disc, which also has Euler characteristic 1, because of the added boundary integral with value 2.

As an application, a torus has Euler characteristic 0, so its total curvature must also be zero. If the torus carries the ordinary Riemannian metric from its embedding in , then the inside has negative Gaussian curvature, the outside has positive Gaussian curvature, and the total curvature is indeed 0. It is also possible to construct a torus by identifying opposite sides of a square, in which case the Riemannian metric on the torus is flat and has constant curvature 0, again resulting in total curvature 0. It is not possible to specify a Riemannian metric on the torus with everywhere positive or everywhere negative Gaussian curvature.

== For triangles ==
Sometimes the Gauss–Bonnet formula is stated as

: formula_12

where is a geodesic triangle. Here we define a &quot;triangle&quot; on to be a simply connected region whose boundary consists of three geodesics. We can then apply GB to the surface formed by the inside of that triangle and the piecewise boundary of the triangle.

The geodesic curvature the bordering geodesics is 0, and the Euler characteristic of being 1.

Hence the sum of the turning angles of the geodesic triangle is equal to 2 minus the total curvature within the triangle. Since the turning angle at a corner is equal to minus the interior angle, we can rephrase this as follows:

: The sum of interior angles of a geodesic triangle is equal to plus the total curvature enclosed by the triangle: formula_13

In the case of the plane (where the Gaussian curvature is 0 and geodesics are straight lines), we recover the familiar formula for the sum of angles in an ordinary triangle. On the standard sphere, where the curvature is everywhere 1, we see that the angle sum of geodesic triangles is always bigger than .

== Special cases ==
A number of earlier results in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, discovered over the preceding centuries, were subsumed as special cases of Gauss–Bonnet.

=== Triangles ===
In spherical trigonometry and hyperbolic trigonometry, the area of a triangle is proportional to the amount by which its interior angles fail to add up to 180°, or equivalently by the (inverse) amount by which its exterior angles fail to add up to 360°.

The area of a spherical triangle is proportional to its excess, by Girard&#x27;s theorem – the amount by which its interior angles add up to more than 180°, which is equal to the amount by which its exterior angles add up to less than 360°.

The area of a hyperbolic triangle, conversely is proportional to its &quot;defect&quot;, as established by Johann Heinrich Lambert.

=== Polyhedra ===

Descartes&#x27; theorem on total angular defect of a polyhedron is the piecewise-linear analog:
it states that the sum of the defect at all the vertices of a polyhedron which is homeomorphic to the sphere is 4. More generally, if the polyhedron has Euler characteristic (where is the genus, the &quot;number of holes&quot;), then the sum of the defect is . 

This is the special case of Gauss–Bonnet in which the curvature is concentrated at discrete points (the vertices). Thinking of curvature as a measure rather than a function, Descartes&#x27; theorem is Gauss–Bonnet where the curvature is a discrete measure, and Gauss–Bonnet for measures generalizes both Gauss–Bonnet for smooth manifolds and Descartes&#x27; theorem.

==Combinatorial analog==
There are several combinatorial analogs of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. We state the following one. Let be a finite 2-dimensional pseudo-manifold. Let denote the number of triangles containing the vertex . Then

:formula_14

where the first sum ranges over the vertices in the interior of , the second sum is over the boundary vertices, and is the Euler characteristic of .

Similar formulas can be obtained for 2-dimensional pseudo-manifold when we replace triangles with higher polygons. For polygons of vertices, we must replace 3 and 6 in the formula above with and , respectively.
For example, for quadrilaterals we must replace 3 and 6 in the formula above with 2 and 4, respectively. More specifically, if is a closed 2-dimensional digital manifold, the genus turns out 

:formula_15

where indicates the number of surface-points each of which has adjacent points on the surface. This is the simplest formula of Gauss–Bonnet theorem in three-dimensional digital space.

==Generalizations==
The Chern theorem (after Shiing-Shen Chern 1945) is the -dimensional generalization of GB (also see Chern–Weil homomorphism).

The Riemann–Roch theorem can also be seen as a generalization of GB to complex manifolds.

A far-reaching generalization that includes all the abovementioned theorems is the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

A generalization to 2-manifolds that need not be compact is Cohn-Vossen&#x27;s inequality.

==In popular culture==
In Greg Egan&#x27;s novel &quot;Diaspora&quot;, two characters discuss the derivation of this theorem.

The theorem can be used directly as a system to control sculpture - for example, in work by Edmund Harriss in the collection of the University of Arkansas Honors College.

<doc id="139230" wikidata="Q2224962" url="?curid=139230" title="Somers, Wisconsin">
<text>Somers is a village in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,402 at the 2020 census. Somers has a post office with ZIP code 53171. The former unincorporated communities of Berryville, Central Park, and Kellogg&#x27;s Corners are located in the village.

The village of Somers was incorporated on April 24, 2015, following a local election that favored incorporation. While the village originally only included the eastern half of the town&#x27;s former boundaries, it now includes almost all of the original town; the remainder is still a town and is slated to become part of Kenosha by 2035.

==History==
The community was originally named Pike on April 15, 1843, by an act of the Wisconsin territorial legislature, and became Somers in 1851.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which are land and are water.

==Demographics==
Somers first appeared in the 2020 U.S. Census after incorporation in 2015.

==Neighborhoods==
=== Berryville ===

Berryville is a residential and business community located in the eastern part of the village, at the intersection of Kenosha County Highway A (7th Street) and Highway 32 (Sheridan Road). The community was named for the proliferation of strawberry farms in the area. The Berryville School was a community fixture into the 1980s, when it was demolished for new housing. Adjacent to the school to the south was the Mid-City Outdoor Theatre (1948-1984), one of Wisconsin&#x27;s first drive-in theatres.

=== Central Park ===

Central Park is a residential and business community within the southeastern corner of the village. It is centered on the intersection of Sheridan Road (Highway 32) and Twelfth Street (Kenosha County Highway E). The area once was the location of the namesake Central Park, a sprawling private recreational park, baseball field, and picnic grounds that was served by a stop of the Milwaukee Electric Railway &amp; Light Company (TMER&amp;L) interurban line which had installed layover sidings for its rail cars waiting to reload and return picnickers to their homes. Central Park often hosted many annual company picnics including those of the Nash Motors Company of Kenosha. The Central Park picnic grounds were later sold and renamed &quot;Minkowski&#x27;s Grove&quot;, which since has been subdivided and no longer exists for public usage.

=== Kellogg&#x27;s Corners ===

Kellogg&#x27;s Corners (often called Kellogg) is a residential and agricultural community in the northwestern corner of the village. It lies at the junction of Interstate 94/U.S. Route 41 and Highway 195 at the border with Racine County. Kellogg&#x27;s Corners was first settled in 1837 by three Kellogg brothers - Seth, Chauncey, and Thaddeus.

By far, the most notable Kellogg&#x27;s Corners landmark was the Greek Revival mid-19th century Kellogg&#x27;s Corners School, an early historic one-room school of frame construction that eventually became privately owned and was demolished by its owner in 1990. The school&#x27;s rustic foundation remains to mark its location.

==Education==
* Shoreland Lutheran High School is a private Christian high school of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS).

==Notable people==
*William H. Flett, Wisconsin legislator
*Margaret Landon, author of &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;
*Drue Leyton, actress, writer, member of the French Resistance 
*Conrad Shearer, Wisconsin legislator

<text>Algoma ( ) is a city in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,243 at the 2020 census. Algoma is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area.

==History==

The Ahnapee settlement, which eventually became known as Algoma, was founded in 1834 by Joseph McCormick of Manitowoc. In 1851, Irish and English pioneers moved to the area and called the place &quot;Wolf River&quot;. The wolf was a legendary animal in stories told by the local Potawatomi Indians. (This animal eventually became the mascot of the Algoma High School.) In the Menominee language, the town is known as , meaning &quot;snowshoe&quot;.

In the mid-19th century, immigrants from Germany, Bohemia, Scandinavia, and Belgium settled in the community. The earliest businesses consisted of a sawmill, a general store, and churches. In 1859, the name of the town was changed from Wolf to &quot;Ahnapee&quot; a corruption of the Chippewa meaning &quot;when&quot;. The town which surrounds Algoma still bears this name.

In 1871, the town survived the Peshtigo Fire that swept from Green Bay and destroyed thousands of acres of land. Local residents were prepared to escape from the fire, but torrential rains extinguished it just before it reached Ahnapee.

Growth and development in Ahnapee was greatly advanced in 1892 with the arrival of the Ahnapee and Western Railway, which connected the coastal town with the Kewaunee Green Bay and Western Railroad at Casco Junction. The railroad would connect Algoma with the rest of the nation&#x27;s rail system for the 94 years. Several factories were built in Ahnapee as a result of the railroad&#x27;s arrival, including the Ahnapee Seating &amp; Veneer Company. This industry would change owners and names through the years, and operated until 2017 when it closed its doors.

Ahnapee incorporated as a city on February 23, 1879. In 1897, the city was renamed &quot;Algoma&quot;, a name which may have come from an Indian term for &quot;park of flowers&quot;. (See also Algoma (word)). The name was changed by action of the Wisconsin state legislature. As a result, the local newspaper also changed its name from the &quot;Ahnapee Record&quot; to the &quot;Algoma Record&quot;. At that time the commercial fishing fleet located in Algoma was the largest on Lake Michigan. Sport fishing is still a major tourist attraction today.

In 2020, Algoma was awarded the All-America City Award for its plan to counter long-running brain drain, which included a student mentoring program, student vocational opportunities, and a community wellness and fitness center.

==Geography==

<text>Kewaunee is a city in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,837 at the 2020 census. Located on the northwestern shore of Lake Michigan, the city is the county seat of Kewaunee County. Its Menominee name is &quot;Kewāneh&quot;, an archaic name for a species of duck. Kewaunee is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area.

==History==
Kewaunee was the site of a Potawatomi village at the time of European contact in the seventeenth century. French Jesuit missionary Jacques Marquette celebrated All Saints Day at the Potawatomi village in 1674. Later, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle visited the village in 1679, and Canadian Jesuit Jean-François Buisson de Saint-Cosme stopped in September 1698. The Potawatomis moved south and east along Lake Michigan in the eighteenth century, and the area was reclaimed by Menominee people. Trader Jacques Vieau established a short lived trading post for the North West Company in the area of Kewaunee in 1795. The United States acquired the land from the Menominee nation in the 1831 Treaty of Washington.
The current settlement at Kewaunee began in 1836, when false rumors of gold deposits in the Kewaunee River triggered a minor gold rush of Yankee settlers. Land speculator Joshua Hathaway surveyed and platted the settlement. When no gold was found, the settlers who remained established a sawmill and developed the local harbor for the lumber industry. Kewaunee became the county seat of Kewaunee County at the time of the county&#x27;s formation in 1852. In the late nineteenth century, the community attracted many Czech and German immigrants.

==Geography==

<doc id="139242" wikidata="Q621236" url="?curid=139242" title="Apple Desktop Bus">
<text>Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) is a proprietary bit-serial peripheral bus connecting low-speed devices to computers. It was introduced on the Apple II in 1986 as a way to support low-cost devices like keyboards and mice, enabling them to be connected together in a daisy chain without the need for hubs or other devices. Apple Desktop Bus was quickly introduced on later Macintosh models, on later models of NeXT computers, and saw some other third-party use as well. Like the similar PS/2 connector used in many PC-compatibles at the time, Apple Desktop Bus was rapidly replaced by USB as that system became popular in the late 1990s; the last external Apple Desktop Bus port on an Apple product was in 1999, though it remained as an internal-only bus on some Mac models into the 2000s.

== History ==

===AppleBus===
Early during the creation of the Macintosh computer, the engineering team had selected the fairly sophisticated Zilog 8530 to supply serial communications. This was initially done to allow multiple devices to be plugged into a single port, using simple communication protocols implemented inside the 8530 to allow them to send and receive data with the host computer. The idea was to allow multiple devices to be connected to a port, eliminating the need for many different types of ports or the use of expansion slots.

During development of this AppleBus system, computer networking became a vitally important feature of any computer system. With no card slots, the Macintosh was unable to easily add support for Ethernet or similar local area networking standards. Work on AppleBus was re-directed to networking purposes, and was released in 1985 as the AppleTalk system. This left the Mac with the original single-purpose mouse and keyboard ports, and no general-purpose system for low-speed devices to use.

===Apple Desktop Bus===
The first system to use Apple Desktop Bus was the Apple II of 1986. It was used on all Apple Macintosh machines starting with the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE. Apple Desktop Bus was also used on later models of NeXT computers. The vast majority of Apple Desktop Bus devices are for input, including trackballs, joysticks, graphics tablets and similar devices. Special-purpose uses included software protection dongles and even the TelePort modem.

===Move to USB===
The first Macintosh to move on from Apple Desktop Bus was the iMac in 1998, which uses USB in its place. The last Apple computer to have an Apple Desktop Bus port is the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White) in 1999. PowerPC-based PowerBooks and iBooks still used the Apple Desktop Bus protocol in the internal interface with the built-in keyboard and touchpad. Subsequent models use a USB-based trackpad.

== Design ==

=== Physical ===
In keeping with Apple&#x27;s general philosophy of industrial design, Apple Desktop Bus was intended to be as simple to use as possible, while still being inexpensive to implement. A suitable connector was found in the 4-pin mini-DIN, which is also used for S-Video. In fact, many S-Video cables can be successfully used in place of their ADB counterparts. However, pins one and two on some (mainly lower-end) cables are bridged together, which can result in catastrophic damage to the system or ADB device. The connectors are small, widely available, and can only be inserted the &quot;correct way&quot;. They do not lock into position, but even with a friction fit, they are firm enough for light duties like ADB.

ADB protocol requires only a single pin for data, labeled Apple Desktop Bus. The data signal is self-clocking by sending a 0 as low for 65 microseconds and high for 35 μs, while sending a 1 uses the opposite timing. It is a multi-drop open collector design with pull-ups to 5 V and uses collision detection to avoid device ID conflicts as well as clock stretching on the stop bit to indicate that a device requires a service request. Two of the other pins are used for +5 V power and ground. The +5 V pin guarantees at least 500 mA, and requires devices to use only 100 mA each. ADB also includes the PSW (Power Switch) pin which is attached directly to the power supply of the host computer. This is included to allow a keypress on the keyboard to start the machine without needing the ADB software to interpret the signal. In more modern designs, an auxiliary microcontroller is always kept running, so it is economical to use a power-up command over the standard USB channel.

The decoding transceiver ASIC as well as associated patents were controlled by Apple; this required vendors to work with Apple. In the Macintosh SE, the Apple Desktop Bus is implemented in an Apple-branded Microchip PIC16CR54 microcontroller.

=== Communication ===
The Apple Desktop Bus system is based around the devices having the ability to decode a single number (the &quot;address&quot;) and being able to hold several small items of data (their &quot;registers&quot;). All traffic on the bus is driven by the host computer, which sends out commands to read or write data: devices are not allowed to use the bus unless the computer first requests it.

These requests take the form of single-byte strings. The upper four bits contain the address, the ID of one of the devices on the chain. The four bits allow for up to 16 devices on a single bus. The next two bits specify one of four commands, and the final two bits indicate one of four registers. The commands are:

* codice_1 - tells the selected device to send the contents of a register to the computer
* codice_2 - tells the device to set the register to the following value
* codice_3 - clear the contents of a selected register
* codice_4 - tell all devices on the bus to reset

For instance, if the mouse is known to be at address $D, the computer will periodically send out a 1-byte message on the bus that looks something like:

codice_5

This says that device $D (1101) should talk (11) and return the contents of register zero (00). To a mouse this means &quot;tell me the latest position changes&quot;. Registers can contain between two and eight bytes. Register zero is generally the primary communications channel. Registers one and two are undefined, and are generally intended to allow 3rd party developers to store configuration information. Register three always contains device identification information.

===Enumeration and identification===
The addresses and enumeration of the devices are set to default values when reset. For instance, all keyboards are set to $2, and all mice to $3. When the machine is first powered on, the ADB device driver will send out codice_1 commands asking each of these known default addresses, in turn, for the contents of register three. If no response comes from a particular address, the computer marks it dead and doesn&#x27;t bother polling it later.

If a device does respond, it does so by saying it is moving to a new randomly selected higher address. The computer then responds by sending another command to that new address, asking the device to move to yet another new address. Once this completes, that device is marked live, and the system continues polling it in the future. Once all of the devices are enumerated in this fashion, the bus is ready to be used.

Although it was not common, it is possible for the Apple Desktop Bus to have more than one device of the same sort plugged in — two graphics tablets or software copy protection dongles, for instance. In this case when it asks for devices on that default address, both will respond and a collision could occur. The devices include a small timing variation that allows them to avoid this problem. After receiving a message from the host, the devices wait a short random time before responding, and then only do so after &quot;snooping&quot; the bus to make sure it was not busy.

With two dongles plugged in, for instance, when the bus is first setting up and queries that address, one of them will be the first to respond due to the random wait timer. The other will notice the bus was busy and not respond. The host will then send out another message to that original address, but since one device has moved to a new address, only the other will then respond. This process continues until nothing responds to the request on the original address, meaning there are no more devices of that type to enumerate.

Data rates on the bus are theoretically as high as 125 kbit/s. However, the throughput is at best half that, due to there being only one pin being shared between the computer and devices, and in practice, throughput is even less, as the entire system was driven by how fast the computer polls the bus. The classic Mac OS is not particularly well suited to this task, and the bus often slows to about 10 kbit/s. Early Teleport modems running at 2400 bit/s have no problems using Apple Desktop Bus, but later models were forced to move to the more expensive RS-422 ports as speeds moved to 14.4 kbit/s and higher.

== Problems ==
While Mini-DIN connectors cannot be plugged in the &quot;wrong way&quot;, it is possible to have trouble finding the right way without looking inside the circular connector&#x27;s shroud. Apple attempted to help by using U-shaped soft plastic grips around the connectors to key both plugs and sockets so the flat side has a specific relation to the shell keyway, but this feature was ignored by some third-party manufacturers. Additionally, there are four ways to orient the receiving socket on a device such as a keyboard; various Apple keyboards use at least three of these possible orientations.

The mini-DIN connector is only rated for 400 insertions and it is easy to bend a pin if not inserted with caution; in addition, the socket can become loose, resulting in intermittent function.

Some Apple Desktop Bus devices lack a pass-through connector, making it impossible to daisy-chain more than one such device at a time without obscure splitter units. Few mice or trackballs have them.

In spite of being electrically unsafe for hot-swapping on all but a few machines, ADB has all the basic capabilities needed for hot-swapping (like modern buses) implemented in its software and hardware. On practically all original Apple Desktop Bus systems, it is not safe to plug a device once the system is powered on. This can cause the opening of a soldered-in fuse on the motherboard. If brought to an authorised dealer, this can result in a motherboard swap at a significant expense. The simpler alternative is to obtain a fuse at a nominal cost and wire it in parallel across the open motherboard fuse (not necessarily requiring soldering).

==History==


===18th century===
The first Europeans to see the region were French fur traders who traveled the Mississippi River in the late 17th century. There is no written record of any visit to the site until 1805, when Lt. Zebulon Pike mounted an expedition up the Mississippi River for the United States. Pike recorded the location&#x27;s name as &quot;Prairie La Crosse&quot;. The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop&#x27;s crozier or &quot;la crosse&quot; in French, which was played by Native Americans there.

===19th century===
In 1841, the first white settlement at La Crosse was established when Nathan Myrick, a New York native, moved to the village at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin to work in the fur trade. Myrick was disappointed to find that because many fur traders were already well-entrenched there, there were no openings for him in the trade. As a result, he decided to establish a trading post upriver at the then still unsettled site of Prairie La Crosse. In 1841, he built a temporary trading post on Barron Island (now called Pettibone Park), which lies just west of La Crosse&#x27;s present downtown. The following year, Myrick relocated the post to the mainland prairie, partnering with H. J. B. Miller to run the outfit.

The spot Myrick chose to build his trading post proved ideal for settlement. It was near the junction of the Black, La Crosse, and Mississippi Rivers. In addition, the post was built at one of the few points along the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi River where a broad plain, ideal for development, existed between the river&#x27;s bank and the tall bluffs that line the river valley. Because of these advantages, a small village grew around Myrick&#x27;s trading post in the 1840s.

In 1844, a small Mormon community settled at La Crosse, building several dozen cabins a few miles (kilometers) south of Myrick&#x27;s post. Although these settlers relocated away from the Midwest after just a year, the land they occupied near La Crosse continues to bear the name Mormon Coulee. On June 23, 1850, Father James Lloyd Breck of the Episcopal Church said the first Christian liturgy on top of Grandad Bluff. Today, a monument to that event stands atop the bluff, near the parking lot at a scenic overlook.

More permanent development took place closer to Myrick&#x27;s trading post, where stores, a hotel, and a post office were constructed during the 1840s. Under the direction of Timothy Burns, lieutenant governor of Wisconsin, surveyor William Hood platted the village in 1851. This opened it up for further settlement, which was achieved rapidly as a result of promotion of the city in eastern newspapers. By 1855, La Crosse had grown in population to nearly 2,000 residents, leading to its incorporation in 1856. The city grew even more rapidly after 1858 with the completion of the La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Railroad, the second railroad connecting Milwaukee to the Mississippi River.

During the second half of the 19th century, La Crosse grew to become one of the largest cities in Wisconsin. It was a center of the lumber industry, for logs cut in the interior of the state could be rafted down the Black River toward sawmills built in the city. La Crosse also became a center for the brewing industry and other manufacturers that saw advantages in the city&#x27;s location adjacent to major transportation arteries, such as the Mississippi River and the railroad between Milwaukee and St. Paul, Minnesota.

===20th century===
Around the turn of the 20th century, the city became a center for education, with three colleges and universities established in the city between 1890 and 1912. Similar to cities across the country, La Crosse saw population stagnation in the latter half of the 20th century as a result of suburbanization. Since 1966, La Crosse has seen its population grow by 10.73%, while its area, miles of sewer, and miles of water mains each grew by more than 50%. La Crosse remains the largest city on Wisconsin&#x27;s western border, and the educational institutions in the city have recently led it toward becoming a regional technology and medical hub.

===21st century===
In 2016, Mayor Tim Kabat and former Mayor John Medinger issued a proclamation apologizing for La Crosse&#x27;s history as a sundown town that discriminated against African Americans.

==Geography==
La Crosse is located on the western border of the midsection of Wisconsin, on a broad alluvial plain along the east side of the Mississippi River. The Black River empties into the Mississippi north of the city, and the La Crosse River flows into the Mississippi just north of the downtown area. Just upriver from its mouth, this river broadens into a marshland that splits the city into two distinct sections, north and south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Surrounding the relatively flat prairie valley where La Crosse lies are towering bluffs, one of the most prominent of which is Grandad Bluff (mentioned in &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; by Mark Twain), which has an overlook of the three states region. This feature typifies the topography of the Driftless Area in which La Crosse sits. This rugged region is composed of high ridges dissected by narrow valleys called coulees, a French term. As a result, the area around La Crosse is frequently referred to as the &quot;Coulee Region&quot;.

===Climate===
La Crosse&#x27;s location in the United States&#x27; Upper Midwest gives the area a temperate, continental climate. The warmest month of the year is July, when the average high temperature is , with overnight low temperatures averaging .

===Parks===
Riverside Park is situated on the riverfront of downtown La Crosse near the Blue Bridges. It hosts events such as Riverfest, Fourth of July fireworks, Oktoberfest, and the Rotary Lights. Several steamboats make stops along the river in the park, including the American Queen, La Crosse Queen, and Julia Belle Swain. The park has walking/running trails. The park was previously home to a controversial Statue of Hiawatha. Long standing public debate about whether the statue was offensive or presented a caricature based on stereotypes of Native Americans eventually led to its removal in 2020, nearly 60 years after it was erected.

Pettibone Park is located on Baron Island, across the river from Riverside Park and the downtown area. The island was originally part of the state of Minnesota. The land was transferred to Wisconsin and eventually the City of La Crosse following a border dispute that was resolved in 1919. Today the park has a variety of recreational facilities, including a beach and disc golf course.

An extensive marsh, a natural floodplain created by the La Crosse River, divides the city between north and south. The area is protected as an important wildlife habitat and watershed to the Mississippi River. Several biking and walking paths cross through the marshland which is also used for canoeing, fishing and trapping. On the southern end of the marsh lies Myrick Park. The park was named after the city&#x27;s first European settler: Nathan Myrick. It has many recreational amenities as well as a nature center and environmental education department.

===Transportation===

====Airport====
The La Crosse Regional Airport (KLSE), located on French Island, provides direct scheduled passenger service to Chicago through American Airlines regional carrier Air Wisconsin. Sun Country and Xtra Airways provide charter service to Laughlin, Elko, Nevada, and other destinations. The airport also serves general aviation for the La Crosse region.

====Roads====
The city is served by several major highways and Interstate, including Interstate 90, U.S. Highway 14, U.S. Highway 53, U.S. Highway 61, Wisconsin State Highway 35, Wisconsin State Highway 16, and Wisconsin State Highway 33.

The Mississippi River Bridge, also known as the Cass St. bridge and the newer Cameron Street bridge (photo with blue arch) both connect downtown La Crosse with La Crescent, Minnesota. These two bridges cross the Mississippi River, as does the Interstate 90 bridge located just northwest of La Crosse, connecting Wisconsin and Minnesota.

====Walking and cycling====
In 2012, the City of La Crosse was the first city in Wisconsin to pass a Green Complete Streets ordinance. This ordinance requires that when roads are reconstructed the needs of stormwater management and the safety of bicycles and pedestrians are taken into account in the new design. The same year, the city passed the Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan to guide improvements to the transportation network for those walking or cycling in the city.

By 2018, La Crosse had of on-street bike lanes, of paved bike paths, and of unpaved paths. As of 2021, however, La Crosse had no protected bike lanes, while bike infrastructure has generally gone unmaintained through the winter months.

A new bikeshare system debuted in downtown La Crosse in April 2021 through a partnership of La Crosse Neighborhoods, Inc and Koloni, an Iowa based bikeshare company. It is hoped that this service will be expanded across the city in the near future. The system has grown each year from 8 bikeshare stations and 40 bikes available for use in 2021, to 10 stations and 50 bikes in 2022 and to 15 stations and 75 bikes in 2023.

The interstate Mississippi River Trail passes through La Crosse. However, the trail does not follow a dedicated multi-use path. The La Crosse River Trail and the Great River State Trail pass through the northern edge of the city. These trails combine to form one continuous trail from Trempealeau to Reedsburg. They are rail trails built on the former roadbed of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway.

====Public transit====

Public transit in La Crosse began with the opening of a horse-drawn streetcar line in 1878. Over time, more streetcar lines were added, and by 1893, all streetcars had been electrified. Beginning in the early 20th century, however, increasing car ownership led to a decline of the privately run streetcar system. As a result, buses began to replace streetcars throughout the city. By November 1945, the last streetcar line closed. The City of La Crosse took over operations of the buses in the 1970s from the Mississippi Valley Public Service Company, as the buses could no longer be operated profitably.

In 1945, in the first timetable after streetcar service had ended, there were four bus routes. The earliest bus left at 5:40 am and the last bus returned at 1:00 am. Buses ran at a 10 to 15-minute headway throughout the day. In total, the buses provided 1519.95 hours of service per week. Today, in 2021, the MTU provides only 1141.6 hours of service per week, a decline of 24.89%.

The La Crosse Municipal Transit Utility bus service, with routes reaching out to the suburbs, served over one million users in 2007. As of 2021, the MTU operates 11 routes with the earliest buses beginning their routes at 5:12 am and running until 10:40 pm at the latest.

In addition to the MTU, a regional bus service, Scenic Mississippi Regional Transit, provides service to Prairie du Chien, Viroqua, Tomah, and points in-between. The service has four routes, which only run on weekdays.

====Railroads====

The first rail line to reach La Crosse arrived in 1858 from Milwaukee constructed by the Milwaukee &amp; La Crosse Railroad. This later became the main line of the Milwaukee Road. After the Milwaukee Road went bankrupt it became part of the Soo Line Railroad in 1985 and later came under the control of Canadian Pacific Railway. This line provides the track on which the La Crosse Amtrak station is located, served daily by the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; between Chicago and Seattle or Portland. In May 2024, the station added a daily round-trip on the new &quot;Borealis&quot; train between Chicago and St. Paul.

Railroad tracks owned by Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) pass through La Crosse providing freight service. These were originally built by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad in 1886 to connect Chicago to the Twin Cities following the east bank of the Mississippi River. This line provided passenger service as well up until May 1, 1971, when Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail operations.

====Intercity bus====
Jefferson Lines serves La Crosse with one daily bus each way running between Minneapolis and Milwaukee via Rochester and Madison. In addition, Badger Bus offers service on Fridays and Sundays during the school year between Madison and Minneapolis via La Crosse. Both Jefferson Lines and Badger Bus make stops at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse Student Union, while Jefferson Lines also stops at the downtown Grand River Station transit hub.

====Waterways====
On the Mississippi River, cargo is transported to and from this area to St Paul and St Louis, using towboats, primarily moving dry bulk cargo barges for coal, grain, and other low-value bulk goods.

Lock and Dam No. 7 on the Mississippi River is located approximately upstream from Downtown La Crosse.

===Utilities===
La Crosse&#x27;s tap drinking water, which is raised from a deep underground Artesian aquifer, won the best natural tasting water award in September 2007 in a statewide tasting competition hosted by the Wisconsin Water Association. The city competed against groundwater and surface water utilities from Algoma, Appleton, Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee, Pell Lake, Shawano, Shawano Lake and Watertown at the annual meeting of the association. La Crosse&#x27;s drinking water is pumped from deep ground wells to a distribution center and is treated with chlorine and fluoride; some wells are also treated with polyphosphate.

In recent years, the city discovered PFAS in the groundwater on French Island, WI as a result of fire fighting foam used at the La Crosse Regional Airport. This has led to the closure of two municipal wells, as well as prevented residents of parts of the Town of Campbell, WI from safely using their private wells. Over 500 wells on French Island have been contaminated and the State of Wisconsin has supplied bottled water to the affected residents.

===Healthcare===
Two major regional healthcare facilities are located in La Crosse: Gundersen Health System and the Franciscan Skemp Medical Center.

Gundersen Health System is a nationally ranked health care system located in La Crosse that is also an ACS nationally certified Level II Trauma Center. It is the primary hospital associated with the Gundersen Clinic medical group and the location of the Western campus for the University of Wisconsin Medical School. With its main campus located in La Crosse, the system also manages 23 locations throughout Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa with nearly 6,000 employees. In 2014, Gundersen Health received the Healthgrades America&#x27;s 50 Best Hospitals™ designation, placing the system among the top 1 percent of hospitals nationwide.

The Franciscan Skemp Medical Center is an affiliate of the Mayo Clinic. Franciscan Skemp, which was the first western Wisconsin hospital to open its doors in 1883 as St. Francis Hospital, was started by the Catholic Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, who still are associated with the medical center. In 1995, Franciscan Skemp merged with Mayo Clinic Health Systems in Rochester, Minnesota, located 60 miles away. A new trauma and emergency department, helicopter pad, and surgery wing recently opened in 2007.

The Health Science Center, located on the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse campus, is a combined effort of both medical centers, UW–La Crosse, Viterbo University, Western College, the School District of La Crosse, and various government educational groups. The purpose was to prepare and train students for advancement in the medical field.

<text>Wiota is a town in Lafayette County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 856 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated communities of Wiota, Woodford and Five Corners are located in the town.

==History==
When William S. Hamilton, the son of Alexander Hamilton, migrated from Illinois to Wisconsin in the late 1820s, he established a lead ore mine that became known as Hamilton&#x27;s Diggings. He later renamed the settlement Wiota. Hamilton, along with Elias Shook and William Haws, settled the area in 1828 and quickly struck quality deposits of lead ore. During the 1832 Black Hawk War, a fort was erected at Hamilton&#x27;s Diggings, which was known as Fort Hamilton. Wiota was first platted in 1836 by Hamilton, and though a few buildings were built, the settlement was eventually moved from the Hamilton&#x27;s Diggings site to its present site, which was platted on July 1, 1858.

Wiota was the location of one of the earliest Norwegian settlements in the United States, begun by immigrants traveling from Chicago, including Per Ivarson Undi, in 1841. The East Wiota Lutheran Church, dedicated in 1852, is the oldest continually running Norwegian Lutheran church in America. Johan Storm Munch was an early pastor at the church. His wife, Caja, kept a diary of their time in Wiota that has since been published as &quot;The Strange American Way&quot;.

<text>White Lake is a village in Langlade County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 262 at the 2020 census.

The White Lake Volunteer Fire Department is located within the village.

== History ==
The name &quot;White&quot; was given to the lake by the Native Americans who hunted and fished in the area many years ago. It was so named because of the white sand and marl in the lake bottom. In 1876, pioneer Isaac Farrow attempted to drain White Lake and make a hay meadow out of the level bottom. He failed in this venture because he did not realize the depth of the lake and the fact that it was fed by springs.

The White Lake area lies south and west of a former terminus of the Wisconsin and Northern Railroad, Van Ostrand. Service began running between Shawano and Van Ostrand in late 1907. Settlement in the area began to show preference to the White Lake area over Van Ostrand, a process that was accelerated by the construction of a new lumber mill completed at the end of 1916. The Wisconsin Northern moved its depot from Van Ostrand to White Lake at approximately that time. Van Ostrand was ultimately abandoned, while White Lake was incorporated as a village in 1926. 

A post office called White Lake was established in 1916, and has remained in operation ever since.
