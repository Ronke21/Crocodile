<doc id="138199" wikidata="Q1055845" url="?curid=138199" title="Edmonds, Washington">
<text>Edmonds is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located in the southwest corner of the county, facing Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The city is part of the Seattle metropolitan area and is located north of Seattle and southwest of Everett. With a population of 42,853 residents in the 2020 U.S. census, Edmonds is the third most populous city in the county.

Edmonds was established in 1876 by logger George Brackett, who bought the land claim of an earlier settler. It was incorporated as a city in 1890, shortly before the arrival of the Great Northern Railway. Early residents of the city were employed by the shingle mills and logging companies that operated in the area until the 1950s. The hills surrounding Edmonds were developed into suburban bedroom communities in the mid-to-late 20th century and subsequently annexed into the city. Edmonds is a regional hub for the arts, with museums, specialized facilities, and major annual festivals within the city&#x27;s downtown area.

The city is connected to nearby areas by two state highways and the state ferry system, which operates a ferry route to Kingston on the Kitsap Peninsula. Public transit service in Edmonds is centered around the downtown train station, served by Amtrak and Sounder commuter trains, and includes several Community Transit bus routes that travel through outlying neighborhoods.

==History==

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Prior to the 19th century, the Edmonds area was inhabited by the Suquamish tribe, who foraged and fished near the flat beach forming modern-day downtown. No archaeological evidence of a permanent settlement in Edmonds has been found, despite claims that a fishing village had existed near the modern-day downtown.

An exploratory expedition of Puget Sound led by Charles Wilkes charted the Edmonds area in 1841, naming &quot;Point Edmund&quot; (now Point Edwards) to the southwest of the modern-day downtown. A land claim for the area was filed by Pleasant Ewell in 1866 and was sold to various landowners before being eventually purchased by Canadian-born logger George Brackett in 1872 for $650. Brackett had allegedly found the future site of Edmonds in 1870 while searching for potential logging areas on his canoe, which was blown ashore during a storm. Brackett and his family moved from Ballard to Point Edmund in 1876, intent on creating a town. He drained a marshland near the waterfront and began logging the area, then known as &quot;Brackett&#x27;s Landing&quot;. Additional settlers arrived over the next few years, necessitating the construction of a wharf and general store by 1881. In 1884, the settlement was platted and gained its first post office, christened with the name &quot;Edmonds&quot;, either a misspelling of Point Edmund or the name of George Franklin Edmunds, a U.S. Senator from Vermont who Brackett admired.

By the end of the decade, Edmonds had gained its first schoolhouse, sawmill, hotel, and drug store. The Town of Edmonds was formally incorporated as a fourth-class village of on August 14, 1890, following an election by residents on August 7. To meet the minimum population of 300 residents required for incorporation, a popular legend states that Brackett added the names of his two oxen to the census conducted prior to the election. Edmonds is the oldest incorporated city in Snohomish County. Brackett was elected as the town&#x27;s mayor for several months, and the new town council passed ordinances to regulate or ban saloons, gambling establishments, and boarding houses. The same year, Edmonds was selected as a stop on the Seattle and Montana Railroad (later absorbed into the Great Northern Railway), sparking interest from real estate investors. The Minneapolis Realty and Investment Company bought of the townsite from Brackett for $36,000,and built a new hotel and wharf. The railway arrived in 1891, but failed to spark a land rush and the investment plan fell apart during the Panic of 1893, leaving Brackett to foreclose on the land.

Edmonds was supported by four shingle mills that prospered in the 1890s, along with an iron foundry that manufactured steel plates for shingles. By 1908, the town had gained its own water system, electricity, paved streets, and telephone service. In September 1908, Edmonds voted to become a third-class city, with a reported population of 1,546 residents. The city unsuccessfully lobbied for a branch of the interurban line from Everett to Seattle, which would have supplemented passenger steamships on the Mosquito fleet and passenger trains operated by Great Northern. A major fire on July 8, 1909, destroyed one block of buildings on Main Street and caused $20,000 in damage. After the fire, the destroyed buildings were bought by a member of the city council, and replaced by a two-story concrete building.

The first automobile owned by an Edmonds resident arrived in 1911 and was followed by the completion of the North Trunk Road through modern-day Lynnwood. A branch road to Edmonds was completed in 1915 and stagecoach lines were extended to the city. Automobile ferry service began in 1923, with the inauguration of the Kingston ferry, which would be acquired by the Puget Sound Navigation Company and continue to serve the city after the decline of the Mosquito fleet. During the 1920s, Edmonds expanded its wharf and ferry dock, while a site on the south end of the waterfront was acquired by the Union Oil Company (later Unocal) for the construction of an oil terminal in 1922. A second major fire struck downtown Edmonds on April 11, 1928, damaging several buildings on the same block of Main Street as the 1909 fire. Despite the increasing scarcity of local timber, the sawmills on the Edmonds waterfront remained the city&#x27;s main industry in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, all but two mills continued to operate and were supplemented by local improvement projects organized by the federal Works Progress Administration, including regraded streets, new parks, and the addition of an auditorium and sportsfields to the high school.

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===

The popularity of new materials for roof shingles and scarcity of available timber in the state forced most of Edmonds&#x27; mills to close by 1951. New companies were established in place of the mills, including an aluminum fabricator and an asphalt refinery at the Unocal terminal. The now vacated waterfront was redeveloped under the direction of the Port of Edmonds, established in 1948 by a public referendum. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Port constructed a breakwater, marina, public beach, and a new ferry terminal for the Washington State Ferries system. The hills surrounding downtown Edmonds to the north and east were developed into suburban subdivisions, centered around small commercial centers, and were annexed by the city. Edmonds reached its present eastern boundary along State Route 99 in May 1959, a few weeks after the incorporation of Lynnwood as a city. By 1963, the city had completed its largest annexations and petitioned to become a first-class city, with a population of 19,000 that placed it second among cities in Snohomish County. Despite population growth, Edmonds restricted the construction of multi-family dwellings in an effort to keep the downtown area and older neighborhoods &quot;rural-like&quot; and low density. By the end of the 1960s, Edmonds had also gained a new hospital, a community college, and civic center campus.

In the 1970s, the number of businesses in downtown Edmonds declined as suburban shopping centers lured away customers. After a number of buildings in the downtown area were demolished and replaced with condominiums and office buildings, a movement to preserve and restore historic buildings emerged with the support of the city government. The &quot;Main Street Project&quot;, funded by local businesses, restored empty storefronts and attracted restaurants to the city in the late 1980s, fueling a downtown revival. Portions of the waterfront were acquired by the city and redeveloped into a public beach, named Brackett&#x27;s Landing Park, and a public fishing pier was opened in 1979 as the first saltwater fishing pier in the state. Edmonds celebrated its centennial in 1990 with a series of events and the dedication of the Centennial Plaza. Several neighborhoods in southern Edmonds were annexed between 1995 and 1997, forming the city&#x27;s southern boundary at the King County line.

The Point Edwards oil terminal on the city&#x27;s waterfront was closed by Unocal in 1991 and the site was sought by Edmonds and Snohomish County for redevelopment. The city favored the construction of a new multimodal transportation hub at the site, including a ferry terminal and commuter rail station, while the county proposed the construction of a sewage treatment plant to be used by King and Snohomish counties. The sewage treatment plant was opposed by the city government and citizen groups, and was ultimately moved to an alternative site near Woodinville in 2003. The transportation plan was put on hold after costs increased and the state ferry system diverted funding to other projects. The hilltop portion of the site was cleaned up in the 2000s and redeveloped into condominiums that opened between 2007 and 2008.

==Geography==
Edmonds is located in the southwest corner of Snohomish County in Western Washington, and is considered a suburb of Seattle, located to the south. The city is bordered to the west by Puget Sound and the city of Woodway, which lies south of Pine Street and west of 5th Avenue South. To the south of the county boundary at 244th Street Southwest is Shoreline in King County. The city&#x27;s southeastern border with Mountlake Terrace is defined by the Interurban Trail, while the eastern and northern borders with Lynnwood run along 76th Avenue West, Olympic View Drive, and Lund&#x27;s Gulch. The unincorporated area of Esperance, located in the southeast corner of the city, is an enclave of Edmonds and has resisted several attempts at annexation. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Edmonds has of shoreline, which is crossed by several small streams. The Puget Sound makes up 86 percent of the city&#x27;s drainage basin, with other streams flowing into Lake Ballinger to the southeast. The city&#x27;s main commercial districts are Downtown Edmonds, situated in a valley known as the &quot;bowl&quot;, and the State Route 99 corridor at its east end. The downtown area and &quot;bowl&quot; have views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. The city has several outlying suburban neighborhood with their own commercial centers, including Firdale, Five Corners, Perrinville, Seaview, Sherwood, and Westgate.

==Economy==

, Edmonds has an estimated workforce population of 22,152 and an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent. As of 2019, most of the city&#x27;s employed residents commute to neighboring cities for work, including 11 percent to Seattle, 6 percent to Lynnwood, 6 percent to Everett, and 5 percent to Shoreline. Only 11.7 percent of residents work at employers within Edmonds city limits. The average one-way commute for Edmonds residents was approximately 31 minutes; 71 percent of commuters drove alone to their workplace, while 9 percent carpooled and 9 percent used public transit. The most common occupational industry for Edmonds residents is in educational and health services, employing 23 percent, followed by retail (13%) and professional services (12%). The nearest shopping malls are Alderwood in Lynnwood and Aurora Village in Shoreline, the latter of which was seen as a potential annexation target by Edmonds in the 1990s.

The city has over 13,000 jobs, a ratio of 0.325 jobs per capita—a figure that is lower than neighboring cities. Approximately 70 percent of jobs in Edmonds are in the services sector, which includes health care and professional services. Other large industries in Edmonds include retail (12%), education (6%), and construction (4%). The city&#x27;s largest employers are the Edmonds School District, Swedish Medical Center, and large retailers, which includes grocery stores and car dealerships. The car dealerships, which are primarily located along the State Route 99 corridor, account for $152 million in annual retail sales, which contributes to the city&#x27;s general sales tax revenue.

==Demographics==
Edmonds is the third most populous city in Snohomish County, behind Everett and Marysville, with 39,709 people counted during the 2010 U.S. census. The city had an estimated population of over 40,000 in 2015 and is growing at an annual rate of 1 percent. Between 1960 and 1990, Edmonds&#x27; population tripled from 8,000 to over 30,000 due to a series of annexations and natural growth. The population growth also brought an influx of Asian immigrants and their descendants to Edmonds, predominantly Koreans, who now make up about 7 percent of the population and are the largest non-white group in the city. The city&#x27;s population is expected to reach 45,000 by 2035.

The municipal government employs 224 people full-time and operates on an annual budget of $98 million that is mostly funded by property and retail sales taxes. The budget funds the city&#x27;s various departments, which includes parks and recreation, public works, water utilities, the municipal court, and emergency services. The city&#x27;s fire department was disbanded in January 2010 in favor of contracted service from Fire District 1 (now South County Fire), a regional entity serving several areas in southwestern Snohomish County.

At the federal level, Edmonds has been part of the 2nd congressional district since 2022 alongside Everett and most of Northwestern Washington. The city had previously been part of the 7th congressional district from 2012 to 2022. At the state level, the city is divided between the 21st and 32nd legislative districts. Edmonds is wholly part of the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 3rd district along with Lynnwood and Woodway.

==Culture==

===Arts and events===

Edmonds is considered a major hub for the arts in Snohomish County, with a dozen galleries and other arts facilities. The city government established the Edmonds Art Commission in 1975 and developed its public arts program in the following decades. The city has a collection of 35 outdoor art installations, 22 flower pole structures, and maintains several facilities dedicated to various arts. One of its initiatives was the 1979 conversion of the former Edmonds High School building into the Frances Anderson Cultural and Leisure Center, which hosts art classes, exhibitions, ballet classes, community events, child-care programs, and recreational sports leagues. The city also renovated the high school auditorium into the Edmonds Center for the Arts in 2006, serving as the home of theatrical performances, concerts, performing arts, and films.

The annual Edmonds Arts Festival has been held since 1957, with three days of art exhibitions and performances over Father&#x27;s Day weekend in June. The festival is one of the largest in the Pacific Northwest, attracting 75,000 visitors, and has 200 participating artists with booths along Main Street and at the Frances Anderson Center. The Cascadia Art Museum opened in 2015 at the location of a former grocery store in downtown Edmonds and focuses on regional Northwest art. Downtown Edmonds also has a single-screen movie theater that was built in the 1920s and remains independently owned and operated.

In addition to the visual arts, Edmonds has several active performing arts organizations. The Driftwood Players host year-round theatrical performances at the Wade James Theatre near Yost Park, while the Phoenix Theatre is based at Firdale Village. The city also hosts the annual Edmonds Jazz Connection over Memorial Day weekend in late May, with several school jazz groups and professional performers. In November 2018, Edmonds was designated as the first creative district in Washington by ArtsWA, the state art agency.

One of the city&#x27;s main landmarks is a small fountain located at the center of a roundabout on Main Street. The first fountain, which included a twisted sculpture at its center, was installed in 1973 and drew criticism from local residents and merchants for its ugliness. It was destroyed in 1998 by a drunk driver and replaced with a temporary gazebo, which had been used as a prop for a TV series. The gazebo was popular and replaced with a bronze structure in 2000, which was later destroyed by a driver five years later. The gazebo was rebuilt in 2006 and has remained since.

Edmonds is home to a weekly farmers&#x27; market that runs from June to October on Saturdays and is sponsored by the Edmonds–South Snohomish County Historical Society. The city also has several annual summer festivals, including the Edmonds Waterfront Festival in early June, the Edmonds Art Festival in mid-June, the Edmonds in Bloom garden festival in July, and the Taste of Edmonds food festival in August.

===Media===

Edmonds was served by one weekly newspaper, the &quot;Edmonds Tribune-Review&quot;, for most of the 20th century. The newspaper was formed by the merger of two rival publications in 1910 and ran until 1982, when it was replaced by an Edmonds section in &quot;The Enterprise&quot;, a regional newspaper based in Lynnwood. Today, Edmonds is served by &quot;The Everett Herald&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. Since 1986, the &quot;Edmonds Beacon&quot; has published a free weekly newspaper alongside sister papers in Mukilteo and Mill Creek. Edmonds is also home to a local blog, MyEdmondsNews.com, that has covered city affairs since 2009 and is an affiliate of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;.

The Edmonds library was established in 1901 and moved into a permanent building funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie in 1911. The Carnegie Library served as a dual library and city hall until 1962, when a new civic center opened. The city government built a new library in 1982 that features of space and an outdoor plaza overlooking Puget Sound. Service was initially contracted out to the Sno-Isle Libraries system until Edmonds was annexed outright in 2001. The Edmonds library was severely damaged by a burst pipe on June 24, 2022, and was closed indefinitely; the library&#x27;s collection of books and other materials were mostly undamaged by the incident. A temporary location at an adjacent city building opened the following month with most services and limited materials while the original library was repaired and renovated. The library reopened on January 13, 2024.

===Parks and recreation===
Edmonds has 23 city parks with of open and preserved space, along with several facilities shared with the school district and the county government, totaling . Downtown Edmonds has several major parks, including the public beach at Brackett&#x27;s Landing on both sides of the ferry terminal, City Park overlooking Edmonds Marsh, and the future Civic Field. A small 9/11 memorial, including a steel beam from the World Trade Center, is located at a fire station near downtown Edmonds and was dedicated in 2015.

In addition to the neighborhood and community parks in Edmonds, the city also maintains dog parks, sports fields, a seasonal swimming pool, and a skate park. Edmonds Stadium, which was home to high school sports and minor league football and soccer teams (including the North Sound SeaWolves), was opened in 1937 and closed in 2017. The Edmonds senior center first opened in 1967 in a former two-story warehouse building, expanding into a former boat showroom shortly afterward; both were replaced by a new building, named the Edmonds Waterfront Center, that held a virtual opening event in 2021 due to local COVID-19 pandemic restrictions before holding a grand opening the following year.

The city also has several urban forests and natural reserves, which preserve the original vegetation of the area and provide hiking and walking trails. Edmonds Marsh Park, on south of downtown, preserves one of the few remaining saltwater marshes in the state and is home to 225 species of bird and several walking trails. The largest wooded space in the city is the county-run Southwest County Park, with of land along Olympic View Drive at the north end of the city. In 2023, the Edmonds city government planned to acquire a shopping center on State Route 99 for use as a public park, but chose not to pursue the $37 million plan in 2024 due to budget issues.

The Port of Edmonds maintains the city&#x27;s public marina, which has 890 slips and is one of the largest in the Puget Sound region. The marina is dredged to a depth of and located southwest of downtown Edmonds. Further north and offshore from Brackett&#x27;s Landing, the city also maintains a marine park called the Edmonds Underwater Park, which was developed primarily for scuba diving. The park attracts 25,000 visitors annually and is one of the most popular diving spots in the state. The park features man-made reefs, several shipwrecks, a submerged dock, and habitats for marine life.

===Historical preservation===
Edmonds&#x27; sole entry on the National Register of Historic Places, the Carnegie Library, was added in 1973 and currently houses the Edmonds Historical Museum, a local museum operated by the Edmonds–South Snohomish County Historical Society.

The city government created its own historical commission in 2007 and now maintains a separate register of historic places with 18 buildings. The city&#x27;s historic designation, unlike the national register, comes without design or building restrictions and primarily includes historic homes and businesses.

===Sister city===

Edmonds has one sister city relationship, established in 1988 with Hekinan in Japan&#x27;s Aichi Prefecture. The relationship is commemorated with a totem pole and plaque on the waterfront. Three times per year, the two cities send visiting delegations, including exchange students, in addition to regularly exchanging gifts and holiday greetings.

==Education==

Edmonds is wholly within the boundaries of the Edmonds School District, which also serves Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, and Woodway. The city is home to Edmonds Woodway High School, of the district&#x27;s five high schools, which was formed in 1990 after the merger of Edmonds and Woodway and moved in 1998 to a new campus east of the city. The high school has 1,800 students and hosts an IB Diploma Programme. The school district also operates an alternative high school, Scriber Lake, two K–8 schools, five elementary schools, and two combined elementary–middle schools within Edmonds city limits.

Edmonds is located near the campus of Edmonds College, which actually lies within Lynnwood city limits. The city was formerly home to the private Puget Sound Christian College, which operated from 1977 to 2001 at the former Edmonds High School building (now the Edmonds Center for the Arts). Edmonds is also home to several private schools, which accommodate grade levels from preschool to high school.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Edmonds is served by several modes of transportation that converge in the downtown area, including roads, railroads, ferries, and buses. The city&#x27;s ferry terminal is located at the west end of Main Street at Brackett&#x27;s Landing Park and is served by a ferry route to Kingston on the Kitsap Peninsula. From 1979 to 1980, Washington State Ferries also ran ferries to Port Townsend during repairs to the Hood Canal Bridge. The Edmonds train station lies a block southwest of the terminal and is served by Amtrak&#x27;s intercity &quot;Cascades&quot; and &quot;Empire Builder&quot; trains as well as Sound Transit&#x27;s Sounder commuter train. These trains operate on the BNSF Railway, which runs along the Edmonds waterfront and is primarily used for freight transport. Two state highways, State Route 104 and State Route 524, connect the downtown area to eastern Edmonds and other points in southern Snohomish County and northern King County. An additional state highway, State Route 99, runs north–south in eastern Edmonds and connects the city&#x27;s commercial district to Seattle and Everett.

Public transportation in Edmonds is provided by Community Transit, which serves most of Snohomish County and covers 74 percent of Edmonds residents. Community Transit&#x27;s local buses run on major streets and connect downtown Edmonds to transit hubs at Aurora Village, Lynnwood Transit Center, and Edmonds Community College. It also operates the Swift Blue Line on State Route 99, a bus rapid transit service connecting Aurora Village and Everett. Until 2024, Community Transit operated direct express buses to from park and ride lots in Edmonds to Downtown Seattle and the University District. They were replaced by the Link light rail extension to Lynnwood and a new express bus that connects Downtown Edmonds to Mountlake Terrace station.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Edmonds is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. In 2017, the city signed a clean energy pledge that would mandate the use of renewable energy sources to generate all of its electricity by 2025. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city&#x27;s residents and businesses.

The city&#x27;s municipal tap water is provided by the Alderwood Water District, which sources its water from Everett&#x27;s Spada Lake Reservoir. The city government maintains its own sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment services, including a treatment plant in downtown; wastewater is also sent to the regional Brightwater plant near Maltby, which was originally planned to be built in Edmonds. Disposal of garbage, recycling, and yard waste is contracted by the city government to three private companies serving different areas of Edmonds.

===Health care===

Edmonds is home to one general hospital, a branch of Swedish Health Services, which is located on State Route 99. It opened on January 26, 1964, as Stevens Memorial Hospital (named for Washington territorial governor Isaac Stevens), and was initially run as a private facility until 1967, when Snohomish County Public Hospital District 2 was formed to oversee it. The public hospital district was led by a five-member elected board of commissioners from within the district, which eventually encompassed Brier, Edmonds, Esperance, Lynnwood, Mountlake Terrace, and Woodway as well as parts of Bothell and unincorporated Snohomish County. Stevens Hospital was expanded with the addition of a nine-story medical tower in 1972 as demand increased from population growth in surrounding areas, but demand faltered as mismanagement plagued its reputation among locals in the early 2000s. The public hospital district ultimately reached an agreement with Swedish in 2010, with the latter leasing the hospital from the former starting on September 1; the former rebranded as the Verdant Health Commission the following year and refocused its efforts as a public health department.

Prior to Stevens/Swedish, a general hospital existed in downtown Edmonds in the mid 1920s, while another one existed in the early 1950s. The hospital sits at the center of a district of medical and professional services offices along State Route 99.

===Annexation===
Five times in the last 50 years, the City of Edmonds has looked at annexing Esperance into the city. In each case, voters in the enclave have rejected the annexation.

Issues for annexation include a desire for a contiguous City of Edmonds, continuity of services and a belief that services will be easier to provide. Arguments against annexation include desire to remain part of unincorporated area of Snohomish county, an expectation that taxes may rise with annexation, and the desire to take part in activities that are possible in the county that would not be permitted under city regulations. The latter includes less regulation for building certain structures and the ability to keep animals.

<text>Gold Bar is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located on the Skykomish River between Sultan and Index, connected by U.S. Route 2. The population was 2,403 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Skykomish people have lived in the area around what is now Gold Bar long before the arrival of American settlers. The Skykomish had a community at the present site of Gold Bar. The village was populated by 40 families, roughly equating to 240 people. The community was large, stretching to the Wallace River, and had many houses, including the largest potlatch house on the Skykomish River. The village was used as a base camp for travelers coming to the area to hunt in the Sultan Basin.

The modern settlement of Gold Bar started as a prospectors camp in 1869, named by a miner who found traces of gold on a river gravel bar. After Gold Bar became a construction camp for the Great Northern Railway, anti-Chinese sentiment was inflamed by a shooting fray started by disreputable camp followers. To save the lives of the threatened Chinese, construction engineer Eduard Bauer slipped them out of camp in hastily constructed coffins. Gold Bar was officially incorporated on September 16, 1910. The 1940 population was 307.

In 2012, the city government considered disincorporation to avoid bankruptcy due to low sales tax revenue and high expenses attributed to filling public records requests and fighting lawsuits from an activist. The city council voted against disincorporation and placed a property tax levy on the ballot, which was rejected by voters in November 2012.

<text>Granite Falls is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located between the Pilchuck and Stillaguamish rivers in the western foothills of the Cascade Range, northeast of Lake Stevens and Marysville. The city is named for a waterfall north of downtown on the Stillaguamish River, also accessible via the Mountain Loop Highway. It had a population of 3,364 at the 2010 census.

The site of Granite Falls was originally a portage for local Coast Salish tribes prior to the arrival of American settlers. The settlement was founded in 1883 and prospered after the discovery of gold and silver in the Monte Cristo mines located east of Granite Falls on the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway. Granite Falls was platted in 1891 and incorporated as a fourth-class town on November 8, 1903.

==History==

The Pilchuck River and Upper Stillaguamish basin was historically inhabited by the Skykomish people, who used the modern-day site of Granite Falls as a portage along with other Coast Salish tribes. Several Skykomish archaeological sites were discovered in the 1970s between modern-day Granite Falls and Lochsloy, with over 700 artifacts recovered from later excavation.

The first permanent European settler was Joseph Sous Enas from the Azores, who staked a homestead claim in 1883 on land south of the present city. He was joined by other homesteaders who took advantage of open land that had been cleared by an earlier wildfire, nicknamed &quot;the Big Burn&quot;. A school district was established in 1886, initially using an abandoned cabin as a one-room schoolhouse until a permanent school was built in 1893. The discovery of gold and silver in the Cascades, particularly around Monte Cristo, lured miners and settlers to the Granite Falls area.

A general store and post office were established in 1890 at the corner of four homesteads, which would later form the center of the townsite platted in August 1891. The name &quot;Granite Falls&quot; was chosen for the settlement to replace the earlier name of &quot;Portage&quot;. The Everett and Monte Cristo Railway reached Granite Falls on October 16, 1892, building a station for the town on the route between Monte Cristo and the county seat of Everett.

On November 8, 1903, Granite Falls voted to become a city. It was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on December 21, 1903. At the time, it had approximately 600 residents and several lumber mills. Electricity, sewers, sidewalks, telephones, cars, and all the amenities of modern life soon followed. A power plant was also constructed at the falls.

By World War I, the once bustling mining towns of Monte Cristo and Silverton were no longer shipping out ore. The railroad, now owned by Northern Pacific, stopped running and the tracks were torn out in the early 1930s to make way for the Mountain Loop Highway.

Granite Falls between the world wars was a lumber town; logging companies felled trees, sawmills created lumber and shingle mills created shingles. The Great Depression, however, took its toll. By 1935, the population of Granite Falls was half what it was in 1925. Mills closed and people left to find work elsewhere. On April 26, 1933, a fire destroyed the Cascade Hotel in downtown Granite Falls and threatened other buildings. The historic hotel was rebuilt at the same site.

At the end of World War II, things looked bleak. The opening of Miller Shingle in 1946 (now the country&#x27;s largest specialty lumber mill) meant jobs both in the woods and at the mill. Construction booms through Snohomish and King counties also meant jobs at the gravel pits dotted around Granite Falls. The city later became a bedroom community for commuters working in Everett and Lake Stevens for large companies.

Hard times would come again. In 1986, the United States Forest Service severely limited logging in old-growth forests under its protection in an effort to save the northern spotted owl from extinction. In June, 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department declared the spotted owl an endangered species, and in 1991, a federal court judge ruled the Forest Service&#x27;s logging plan to save the owl was inadequate. Over one-fourth of old-growth forest on both public and private land were put off-limits to logging.

In the 21st century, Granite Falls has focused on attracting visitors to the natural environment and recreational opportunities along the Mt. Loop Highway. Expanded housing development has brought an increased population of families who commute to Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside to work. In 2001, the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America was given a 17-acre (7 ha) plot of land next to Kannagara Jinja (built by the Reverend of the shrine) in Granite Falls, which was built upon, combining the two places.

A truck bypass around the north side of downtown Granite Falls opened in 2010 to serve several quarries to the northeast. A new high school campus was built near the bypass, along with a housing development with 327 homes in the late 2010s.

A downtown revitalization project began in the 2000s with renovations to buildings and a small city park. A new civic center is planned along South Granite Avenue, including a city hall that opened in 2019, a public plaza, a community center, and a gymnasium for the Boys &amp; Girls Club that will also serve as an emergency shelter. The city government has also proposed promoting Granite Falls as a location for outdoor recreation retailers and businesses.

==Geography==
Granite Falls is located in Snohomish County, approximately east of Everett, the county seat, and northeast of Seattle. It lies on a plateau in the western foothills of the Cascade Range between the South Fork Stillaguamish River to the north and the Pilchuck River to the south. Granite Falls is also the southern entrance to the Mountain Loop Highway, a scenic highway that continues into the Cascades to Darrington.

The city limits are defined to the north by the Stillaguamish River, to the east by Iron Mountain, to the south by the Pilchuck River, and to the west by 174th Avenue Northeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

It is situated where the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River leaves its narrow mountain valley, which includes the namesake Granite Falls. The falls has a fishway and a tunnel that were built in 1954, at the time the longest fish tunnel in the world. The area where the city was founded was called the &quot;portage&quot; by native tribes in the area, who used the flat area between the two rivers to portage their canoes when traveling. Iron Mountain, which sits at above sea level, lies east of downtown and is home to a quarry. The Rogers Belt, a series of local faults, runs northwest from Granite Falls towards Mount Vernon.

===Climate===
The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and most of the rainfall occurs between October and May. Temperatures in the summer can be up to 10 degrees warmer than nearby Everett, due to its slightly inland location.

<text>Index () is a town in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 155 at the 2020 census, making it the smallest incorporated municipality in the county. Index lies at an elevation of along the North Fork Skykomish River in the Cascade Mountains. It is connected to surrounding communities by U.S. Route 2.

The town was established in 1889 by Amos Gunn and his family after they purchased an existing claim to build a home and hotel. It was named for Mount Index (now Baring Mountain), which resembled an index finger. Index became a stop on the Great Northern Railway in 1893 and was platted the same year amid a boom in mineral exploration in the area. The town reached its peak population of 1,000 residents by 1900 and was incorporated as a municipality on October 11, 1907.

Index&#x27;s economy originally relied on mining, lumber, and a granite quarry, but these industries declined by the middle of the 20th century. The town lost many of its businesses and the permanent population shrank for decades before stabilizing between 150 and 200 residents; vacation homes and seasonal residents became more prevalent as the area continued to be a hub for outdoor recreation. Rock climbing on the cliffs of the Index Town Wall and rafting on the Skykomish River brought new tourism to the Index area and forms part of the modern economy.

==History==

Prior to settlement by European Americans, the Skykomish people had many villages along the Skykomish River between Sultan and Index. One large and important village of the band was at (derived from , meaning &quot;sawbill duck&quot;) in modern-day Index. At the village were several longhouses, including a large potlatch house. was the base camp for people traveling into the Cascades for hunting and gathering. The Skykomish people were signatories of the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott and many were moved to the Tulalip Indian Reservation, where they later amalgamated with the Snohomish and Snoqualmie tribes. Some members of the tribe elected to stay in the Skykomish Valley, primarily near Gold Bar and Sultan.

The first non-native settlers in the area were prospectors who placed individual mineral rights for claims in the Cascades, beginning with a gold rush in 1874 along Silver Creek near what later became the community of Galena. Amos Gunn, a Civil War veteran from Illinois, arrived at the fork of the Skykomish River with his wife and six children in 1889 and bought a squatter&#x27;s claim to establish a homestead. He constructed a home that also served as a hotel for prospectors and railroad workers on the Great Northern Railway. His wife Persis named their site &quot;Index&quot; for nearby Mount Index (later renamed Baring Mountain), itself named for its resemblance to an index finger. Mount Persis and Gunn&#x27;s Peaks were also named for the family. Mines in the area yielded gold, silver, copper, and galena among other minerals, which spurred further settlement around the North Fork Skykomish River.

Index was assigned a post office in November 1891 and Amos Gunn served as postmaster, delivering parcels by horseback from Wallace (now Startup) on a overland trail. The Gunns&#x27; hotel was expanded two years later to accommodate an increasing number of prospectors who arrived on the Great Northern and traveled onward towards Galena and Mineral City. The railroad across Stevens Pass had been completed in January 1893 and a stagecoach road was opened from Index to Galena within a few years. The town plat for Index was filed by Amos Gunn on April 25, 1893, shortly after a controlling interest in the settlement was acquired by the Everett Terminal Land and Milling Company. The plat reserved for the main street, which had been surfaced with gravel due to frequent flooding from the Skykomish River and was sought for use for a branch railroad to Galena. A fire destroyed the Gunns&#x27; hotel, general store, and several residences in the town on July 22 of that year, but had not damaged the Great Northern depot. The town&#x27;s buildings were rebuilt as mining activity had temporarily subsided due to the Panic of 1893 and was eclipsed by logging and farming as the main local industry. The Copper Bell and Sunset mines were opened in 1898 and brought the town to its peak population of 1,000 in 1900. The Sunset Mine was the largest in the area and produced of gold, of silver, and of copper during its lifetime.

Amos Gunn sold his properties in Index in 1899 shortly after the death of his wife Persis. The town continued to grow with the arrival of social clubs, a schoolhouse, and its first newspaper, the &quot;Index Miner&quot; (later the &quot;Index News&quot;), in 1899. In November 1902, a second major fire destroyed several buildings in the town, including the assay office, and killed one person. A granite quarry also opened east of Index in 1904 and later provided materials for the Washington State Capitol building in Olympia. It became one of the main employers in the area, along with logging to supply a new sawmill that was later acquired by the Index-Galena Lumber Company. Plans to build a hydroelectric dam and a pulp mill at sites along both forks of the Skykomish River were proposed but never began construction. Index was also promoted as a tourist destination for sport fishing and mountaineering; by 1905, it had five hotels and drew hundreds of visitors by train during the summer season.

Index was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on October 11, 1907, with several hundred residents. A volunteer fire department was established and moved into a permanent fire station in 1913; its old facility was converted into a town hall with a jail. An unpaved county road was completed from Gold Bar to Index in 1911, which brought regular automobiles to the area and scheduled bus service. The road included a bridge over the Skykomish River that was destroyed by one of two major floods in 1917 and later rebuilt. The Stevens Pass Highway (now part of U.S. Route 2) opened on July 11, 1925, and opened the area to skiing with the development of a new ski area a few years later. The Great Northern&#x27;s local &quot;Dinkies&quot; trains, which made daily stops in every Skykomish Valley settlement and provided Index with passenger and postal service, was discontinued in 1925 after the highway opened. The Stevens Pass Highway was rebuilt by the state government in 1933 and bypassed Index, which reduced tourist traffic to the town and caused several businesses to close.

The town&#x27;s major industries saw reduced business during the early years of the Great Depression, which resulted in the shutdown of lumber mills and mines in the area. The granite quarry closed permanently after its warehouse was destroyed by a fire in May 1932; it was not rebuilt due to the decreased demand for granite. A Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established east of Index in 1934 to provide jobs for unemployed men and improve lands owned by the United States Forest Service in the Cascades. On August 16, 1939, a wildfire that formed west of Index swept into the town and destroyed the church and seven residences; hundreds of firefighters from the United States Forest Service and local fire departments in the region prevented the fire from causing further damage before it retreated into the forests. The Sunset Mine, the last remaining copper mine in the area, had financial issues and was taken over by its workers after a dispute over unpaid wages; it was shut down in 1942 by a federal order to halt mining of non-essential materials during World War II. A natural hot springs near the town continued to draw tourists and was developed into a major resort named the Garland Mineral Springs; during World War II, it was converted into a Coast Guard training camp.

Index entered a period of economic stagnation and reduced employment following the Great Depression and World War II, as most of its industries had closed and were not replaced. Local families left the town and were replaced by a population of retirees and urban residents who maintained vacation homes; by 1975, there was a permanent population of 171 residents in Index and the surrounding area. By the 1980s, Index had a single restaurant, a general store, and a tavern; the nearest gas station and medical clinics were further west on U.S. Route 2. The local high school was closed in 1942 and students were moved to Sultan Senior High School; the other school buildings were condemned by the state fire marshal in 1952 and replaced three years later by a new consolidated school. From 1962 to 1964, Great Northern rebuilt its railroad through Index on an embankment with a wider curve that cut off several streets and split the town into two halves. The original railroad depot in the town was also demolished and the lone grade crossing was made steeper, creating a blind hill. A replacement of Index&#x27;s wooden water main and reservoir system, which are supplied by a mountain spring, began in 1967 and was completed a decade later by the town government using federal and state grants.

The town has been frequented by rock climbers since routes on the Index Town Wall were mapped in the 1950s and developed in the early 1970s by enthusiasts from Seattle. The Bush House, a historic hotel that opened in 1898 and closed in the 1930s, was renovated and reopened as a restaurant in 1975 and for lodging two years later. Much of the town was damaged by a major flood in December 1980 that washed away eight homes and the water main for Index; buildings and roads were later rebuilt by residents. A few years later, the town had organized emergency medical services and a new historical society; in 1984, 19 business licenses were issued by the town government, mostly to cottage industries and home businesses.

The town council adopted a resolution to support the Nuclear Freeze campaign, which proposed a halt to development of new nuclear weapons, in 1983 amid rumors that some nuclear warheads would be transported on the railroad through Index. The Index Town Wall was the site of a drilling experiment in 1984 for a local company that planned to supply a new machine to an Australian diamond mine. The experiment created a tunnel that ran deep into the granite face of the Town Wall; the tunnel was later repurposed by the University of Washington for physics experiments. The population of Index declined to approximately 150 by the end of the 20th century.

The town and county governments began development of trails and facilities for hikers on Heybrook Ridge in 2016.

==Geography==
Index lies in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains on the north side of the North Fork Skykomish River, just above its confluence with the main channel of the Skykomish River. The town is in southeastern Snohomish County, approximately east of Gold Bar and west of Stevens Pass. It is connected to nearby areas by U.S. Route 2, a major highway that runs south of the town and travels west to Everett and east across the Cascades. Index is bisected by the Scenic Subdivision of the BNSF Railway, a railroad originally built by the Great Northern Railway that carries freight trains and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; passenger service.

The town has a total area of , all of it land, according to the United States Census Bureau. Index and its outlying unincorporated areas are surrounded by the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest and other protected lands; the Wild Sky Wilderness area is east of the town. The southern boundary is the North Fork Skykomish River, while the northern border is defined by the Index Town Walls and Forks of the Sky State Park. The Town Walls are a series of granite cliffs in Forks of the Sky State Park that rise above the valley and are popular with rock climbers. The cliffs are also home to nests for peregrine falcons, which necessitate occasional closures to climbing for protection.

Index sits at an elevation of , while the surrounding mountains range from in height. These include Mount Index to the south at and Gunn Peak to the east at . The mountains around Index are primarily batholiths that formed from cooled magma lifted to the surface approximately 34million years before present. The town also lies near the Straight Creek Fault, a major strike-slip fault that generates seismic activity. The area southeast of Index includes several waterfalls on the South Fork Skykomish River. Sunset Falls is south of Index and comprises a drop in a granite chute. Eagle Falls is southeast of the town and is the site of frequent rescues due to its popularity and fast-moving rapids.

The Index area has a moderate summer climate with approximately 213 frost-free days and average annual precipitation of . The area north of the town is designated a &quot;high risk&quot; area for wildfires, while other areas are within the 100-year flood zone for the Skykomish River. Index and neighboring areas were placed under mandatory evacuation orders on September 10, 2022, due to the nearby Bolt Creek Fire. The order was modified two days later to allow residents to return to their homes, but U.S. Route 2 remained closed to most travel for several days. The fire burned approximately and was contained in late October.

==Economy==
The area had several granite quarries that were used to supply building materials for the Washington State Capitol Building and the base of the Smith Tower in Seattle. Since the 20th century, the local economy has transitioned from resource extraction industries to tourism, particularly outdoor recreation in the summer months. Index&#x27;s residents are a mix of retirees, commuters to other areas, and those who work in cottage industries and businesses that cater to tourists. Paradise Sound maintained a recording studio where albums were recorded by Alice in Chains and The Walkabouts.

As of the 2023 &quot;American Community Survey&quot; estimates, the most common employers for Index residents are in the retail sector, followed by construction and educational services. Approximately 62 residents are employed outside of the town; the most common commuting destinations are Seattle (17.7%), Monroe (14.5%), and Everett (11.3%). The mean one-way commute for the town&#x27;s workers was 39.3 minutes; 81 percent of commuters drove alone to their place of employment.

==Government and politics==
Index is an incorporated town with a mayor–council form of government. The mayor and five-member town council are elected to four-year terms by residents who are eligible to vote. , Norm Johnson is the town&#x27;s mayor. Index&#x27;s government has three employed positions: a clerk for day-to-day management, a maintenance person, and a water distribution manager to oversee the water supply. The town contracts with the county government to provide additional services such as fire and building inspections and land use planning. The Snohomish County Sheriff&#x27;s Office provides law enforcement and search-and-rescue services, while Sky Valley Fire is contracted for firefighting and protection in a partnership with the volunteer firefighter district.

The town had the highest voter turnout of any municipality in Snohomish County from 2013 to 2023, with 60 percent of residents returning a ballot in the 2023 general election. At the federal level, Index is part of the 8th congressional district, which encompasses the eastern portions of the Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties as well as the entirety of Chelan and Kittitas counties. It was part of the 1st congressional district until 2022, when the 8th district was extended into Snohomish County. At the state level, the town is part of the 12th legislative district, which also crosses the Cascade Mountains and includes Skykomish, part of Snoqualmie, and all of Chelan County except for Wenatchee. Index was previously part of the 39th legislative district until it was moved into the cross-mountain district as part of a redistricting compromise in 2022. The town also lies within the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 5th district, which includes the Skykomish Valley, Snohomish, and Lake Stevens.

==Culture==
The town&#x27;s museum, the Index-Pickett Historical Museum, opened in June 1986 and is maintained by the Index Historical Society. The museum is named for Dorothy Pickett, a local schoolteacher and wife of Great Northern Railway photographer Lee Pickett. It was originally located in a toolshed the Picketts used until the museum was moved to their former home. The Red Men Hall, a fraternal lodge and the largest building in Index, was constructed in 1903 and served as the center for social life in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 but collapsed in 2009 after a severe snowstorm and was subsequently demolished. Another historic building in Index, the Bush House, was opened as a hotel in 1898 and closed multiple times throughout its history, leading to its listing as an endangered landmark by the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation in 2009. A major renovation began in 2012 and the Bush House reopened for use as a hotel and event venue in 2017; a new restaurant at the hotel was opened in June 2023.

The Index Arts Festival was founded in 2004 and is held annually at Doolittle Pioneer Park during the first weekend in August. It includes exhibitions, outdoor musical performances, poetry, and live demonstrations of specialty arts. The Index area has been used for several film and television productions, including the 1987 film &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; and 2016 film &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;.

===Religion===

The town is home to the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, a Wicca church that was established in Seattle and moved to Index in 1979. The church was among the first modern Pagan institutions to be recognized by the state government; it also operates an online seminary based in Index. The Aquarian Tabernacle also organizes Wiccan holiday events at nearby state parks that draw more than 200 worshippers. The town is also home to a Protestant Christian church. The Snow Mountain Monastery, a Buddhist monastery and retreat, moved from Skykomish to Index in 2013.

==Parks and recreation==
Index lies along the Cascade Loop Scenic Byway and is west of Stevens Pass, which has a ski area and other winter activities. The Index Town Wall, a set of granite cliffs that face the town, is among the most popular crags in Washington and draws climbers from the Puget Sound region. It includes 402 routes for climbing and bouldering that range in difficulty, including beginner&#x27;s courses that are nicknamed the &quot;classroom&quot;. Most of the climbing area lies within Forks of the Sky State Park, created in 2010 after the state government acquired private lands that were being used by climbers. Non-profit climbing groups have also purchased parcels near the Town Wall for recreation and conservation, including donations to expand the state park.

The Skykomish River is a popular whitewater rafting corridor with several companies based out of Index that operate along the river and within the Wild Sky Wilderness area. The river includes sections that are rated from Class III to V on the international scale. The river is also used for fishing, particularly for steelhead trout, and has swimming areas around waterfalls east of the town. The sole urban park in Index is Doolittle Pioneer Park, which includes a picnic shelter and public barbeque. Doolittle Pioneer Park was opened in 1976 for the national bicentennial and displays a rock-cutting saw from the former granite quarry near Index. A rail trail, named Crescent Trail, follows the former trackbed of the Great Northern Railway west of the town.

The surrounding area also includes several hiking trails maintained by the United States Forest Service and the Snohomish County Parks &amp; Recreation Department. The Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest includes the Lake Serene Trail, which records 45,000 visitors annually and leads to the base of Mount Index. An outdoor shooting range on national forest property near Index was opened in 1947 and operated until 2004, including for several decades without a valid special use permit from the Forest Service. The range was permanently closed due to lead contamination. Heybrook Ridge County Park, which has several trails and a historic fire lookout, opened in 2017 after nine years of development by the county government. The land was acquired in a public–private partnership with a volunteer conservation group in 2008 to prevent the area from being clearcut. Another trail in the county park, Erinswood Trail, opened at the bottom of the ridge in 2021 with full accessibility for wheelchairs.

==Education==

The Index School District serves the town and surrounding areas in the southeast corner of Snohomish County. It has a single combined elementary–middle school with an enrollment of 28 students and three full-time teachers . The school district was established in 1892 and built its first schoolhouse in 1899 for a class of 40 students; the schoolhouse was replaced in 1908 by the Index School, a larger building with four classrooms. A high school was opened in 1918, but was only used until 1942 as enrollment declined; high school students have been bused to Sultan Senior High School since Index High School was closed. A new school building was constructed in 1955 to replace the condemned Index School and remains in use; its original courtyard was later replaced with an indoor computer lab and the entire building was renovated in 2019.

The town is part of the Sno-Isle Libraries system, which operates a twice-monthly bookmobile service to Index. Index&#x27;s original public library was established in 1913 and was one of several small-town libraries to receive a donation of used books from the Seattle Public Library system. It was later dissolved due to low patronage and the collection was donated to a nearby resort. 

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Index is located northeast of U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which connects Everett to the Skykomish Valley and Stevens Pass. The town is connected to US 2 by Index–Galena Road, which continues northeast into the Wild Sky Wilderness. A flood in November 2006 washed out a section of the road beyond Index at milepost 6.4. The road was reopened in November 2023 after a three-year repair project that relocated sections to higher ground and added new culverts and bridges. The project cost $29 million to complete and was mostly funded by the federal government.

The town&#x27;s bridge over the North Fork Skykomish River is the Smith Bridge, a tied-arch bridge that carries two lanes of 5th Street to Index–Galena Road. It opened in September 1999 and was the first tied-arch bridge in Snohomish County, with a height of . The Smith Bridge replaced the earlier Index Bridge No. 122, a timber bridge that was constructed in 1918 and only carried one lane of traffic. The old bridge had been moved from its original site in April 1998 to be used during construction of the new bridge; the relocated bridge was also closed entirely for several days in October to prepare for flood control measures, leaving Index with only a winding gravel road to connect to the rest of the world.

===Utilities===

Electric power for Index is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The utility derives most of its electricity from hydroelectricity that it purchases from the federal Bonneville Power Administration or generates on its own. The PUD&#x27;s plan to build an inflatable dam near Sunset Falls east of Index was abandoned in 2018 due to opposition from environmentalists and local residents, who sought a wild and scenic designation for the river. Another plan by the PUD to harness geothermal energy northeast of Index at Garland Mineral Springs was shelved in 2012 after test drills found bedrock instead of more favorable underground conditions. Natural gas for the town&#x27;s residents and businesses is provided by Puget Sound Energy, a private company that serves most of the Seattle metropolitan area.

The town&#x27;s main water source is a spring that draws from groundwater and is collected by wells and stored in an underground vault. The drinking water is not treated or filter due to its minimal contact with human contamination and is regularly monitored for safety. The water supply has 129 connections, including 119 residential customers. Index lacks a sewage treatment plant and instead relies on individual septic tanks. The town&#x27;s curbside solid waste and recycling pickup is contracted out to Waste Management.

Index has limited telecommunications service that is primarily provided by satellite and mobile broadband companies. Ziply Fiber provides landline telephone and internet service to customers in the town. In 2024, the county government approved a contract with Ziply Fiber to provide broadband internet service to Index using an existing fiber line. The $4.3 million program, which also includes Verlot, is funded by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and is expected to be completed in 2025.

<text>Lake Stevens is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States, that is named for the lake it surrounds. It is located east of Everett and borders the cities of Marysville to the northwest and Snohomish to the south. The city&#x27;s population was 35,630 at the 2020 census.

The lake was named in 1859 for territorial governor Isaac Stevens and was originally home to the Skykomish in the Pilchuck River basin. The first modern settlement on Lake Stevens was founded at the northeastern corner of the lake in 1889. It was later sold to the Rucker Brothers, who opened a sawmill in 1907 that spurred early growth in the area, but closed in 1925 after the second of two major fires. The Lake Stevens area then became a resort community before developing into a commuter town in the 1960s and 1970s.

Lake Stevens was incorporated as a city in 1960, following an exodus of businesses from the downtown area to a new shopping center. The city has since grown through annexations to encompass most of the lake, including the original shopping center, and quadrupled in population from 2000 to 2010. A revitalized downtown area is planned alongside new civic buildings in the 2020s.

==History==

Lake Stevens was named in 1859 for territorial governor Isaac Stevens and was originally listed as &quot;Stevens Lake&quot; on early maps. The area around the lake was used for berry gathering by the indigenous Skykomish, who also used most of the Pilchuck River basin for hunting. The first homesteads around the lake were established by emigrants in the 1880s, beginning with Joseph William Davison&#x27;s claim along the east shore filed in 1886. A two-block townsite at the northeast end of the lake named &quot;Outing&quot; was claimed on October 8, 1889, by Charles A. Missimer and platted the following year. The construction of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway along the eastern side of the Pilchuck River Valley in 1889 spurred the creation of more settlements in the area. Among them were Machias in 1890, which was followed by Hartford (originally named &quot;Ferry&quot;), later a major junction for the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway completed in 1892.

Outing was later vacated and sold between various investors before the townsite was acquired in 1905 by the Rucker Brothers, who planned to build a sawmill after a previous venture by Jacob Falconer had failed. The Rucker Brothers constructed a railroad spur from Hartford and redirected the flow of Cassidy Creek, the main outlet of the lake, to prepare land for their shingle mill, which opened in 1907. A plat for the town of Lake Stevens was filed by the Rucker Brothers on February 8, 1908, including a business district and residences to accommodate the mill&#x27;s 250 workers. The sawmill, one of the largest in the United States, was partially destroyed in a 1919 fire and later rebuilt. It was permanently closed after a second fire in 1925 and dismantled, causing many residents to leave the area. One of the remnants from the old mill was a locomotive that sunk in the early 1910s and was rediscovered in 1995 by a U.S. Navy training team, following a request from the local historical society.

By the mid-1920s, the entire shoreline of Lake Stevens had been divided into small lots and tracts for summer homes and resorts. Following the demise of the Rucker mill, Lake Stevens was primarily a resort community that drew 3,000 visitors on busy days to fish, swim, and water-ski on the lake. While the major lakeside resorts were successful, the Lake Stevens area saw little residential and commercial development for several decades as the downtown area stagnated. The first Hewitt Avenue Trestle was completed in 1939, providing an elevated highway over the Snohomish River floodplain between Everett and Cavalero Hill, with onward connections to areas around Lake Stevens.

Suburban development around Lake Stevens began in the 1950s, shortly after plans were announced to build a large shopping center named Frontier Village at the intersection of two state highways west of the lake (later State Route 9 and State Route 204). Business owners in downtown Lake Stevens proposed incorporation in 1958 to prevent retailers from relocating to the new shopping center, offering local control of policing and street maintenance with no increase in taxes. On November 19, 1960, Lake Stevens voted 299–40 in favor of incorporating as a city, which was certified by the state government on November 29. The town boundaries were set around downtown and included an estimated 900 residents. The city government purchased a former post office building for use as a city hall, which included a jail that was never used due to a change in state laws.

The development of resorts around Lake Stevens also caused water quality to deteriorate, necessitating the creation of a voluntary drainage district in 1932 to manage runoff and pollution. It was replaced in 1963 by an independent sewer district, which mandated vegetation buffers for homes and later installed a large aeration system to slow the growth of algae in the lake. Frontier Village opened in 1960 and later expanded as State Route 9 and State Route 204 were improved through the area. A new highway bypassing downtown, State Route 92, opened at the end of the decade. The area around Frontier Village was developed into a suburban commuter town in the 1970s and 1980s with the construction of several residential subdivisions. Hewlett-Packard won approval from the county government to build a manufacturing plant northwest of Lake Stevens in 1983, despite opposition from local residents looking to preserve the area&#x27;s rural character.

By the late 1990s, the city had over 5,700 residents and was among the fastest-growing cities in the state. The unincorporated areas to the west of the lake also grew to over 20,000 people, adding multi-family housing to its existing inventory of single-family neighborhoods, and rejected an attempt to build a second shopping center and commercial complex on Cavalero Hill. Lake Stevens unsuccessfully attempted to annex the western neighborhoods in 1993, but adopted plans to create &quot;one community around the lake&quot; and revitalize its downtown. The first major annexations were completed in 2006, adding around Frontier Village and the north end of the lake. From 2000 to 2010, the city quadrupled in population to nearly 30,000 people and added . The largest annexation, consisting of in the southwest corner of the Lake Stevens urban growth area, was completed in December 2009 and added more than 10,000 residents. Further annexations of areas to the southeast of the lake are planned to complete the full encirclement of Lake Stevens.

The city government adopted plans in 2018 to redevelop downtown Lake Stevens with denser housing and commercial use, including mixed-use buildings and walkable streets. The former city hall in downtown was demolished in 2017 as part of an expansion for North Cove Park, with city services temporarily relocated at an adjacent building until a permanent replacement is built. The police station was relocated to an abandoned fire station and will open a new headquarters building on Chapel Hill in the 2020s. An earlier plan to combine city services, the police station, and a new library at a civic campus on Chapel Hill fell through after the failure of a library bond measure. The property had been acquired in 2016 and is planned to be rezoned for commercial use.

==Geography==

Lake Stevens is located northeast of Seattle and northeast of Everett, between the cities of Marysville and Snohomish. The city&#x27;s boundaries are generally defined to the north by State Route 92, to the east by the Centennial Trail, to the south by 28th Street Southeast, and to the west by State Route 204. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The eponymous lake is not part of the city, but is part of the unincorporated urban growth area that also covers several neighborhoods on the southeast side of the lake. The urban growth area has been sought for annexations in the early 21st century.

The city lies on a plateau between the Snohomish River delta, which separates it from Everett and Ebey Island to the west, and the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. It surrounds the north and east sides of Lake Stevens, the largest and deepest lake in Snohomish County, with an area of and an average depth of . The lake has of shoreline and is fed by Lundeen Creek, Mitchell (Kokanee) Creek, and Stitch Creek. It drains into Catherine Creek, which then flows to the Pilchuck River. The lake&#x27;s relatively small watershed, at , minimizes the effect of upstream pollution but reduces flow to remove pollutants. Lake Stevens installed aeration system in the 1990s to control the release of phosphorus from lake sediments, which caused unwanted algae growth. Most of the shoreline is heavily developed, with little remaining native vegetation, and Lake Stevens is used for recreational fishing, swimming, boating, and skiing.

Lake Stevens has two major commercial centers: downtown and Frontier Village. Downtown Lake Stevens is located on the northeastern arm of the lake and has been undergoing redevelopment since the 1990s. Frontier Village is located west of the lake at the intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204 and is a traditional suburban shopping center with strip malls and big box stores. The city government also has several designated neighborhoods and planning areas: Cavalero Hill, Frontier Village, the Hartford Industrial Area, and Machias.

==Economy==

, Lake Stevens has an estimated workforce population of 23,393 people, of which 15,084 are employed. The largest sectors of employment are manufacturing (18%), followed by educational and health services (17%), retail (13%), and professional services (11%). The majority of workers in the city commute to other areas for employment, including 20 percent to Everett, 13 percent to Seattle, and 4 percent to Bellevue. Approximately 6.3 percent of Lake Stevens residents work within the city limits. Over 81 percent of workers commute in single-occupant vehicles, while 2 percent take public transportation and less than 10 percent use carpools.

The city&#x27;s largest employer is the Lake Stevens School District, followed by aerospace manufacturer Cobalt Enterprises, which is headquartered in the Hartford industrial area and expanded its facilities in 2016. Over 20 percent of people with jobs based in Lake Stevens live within city limits, while the rest commute from nearby cities in northern Snohomish County.

Hewlett-Packard opened a large manufacturing facility on Soper Hill northwest of Lake Stevens in 1985 for its test and measurement division, following a planning dispute with the county government. The test and measurement division was later spun off into Agilent and shared its Lake Stevens facility with Solectron. The plant had 1,000 employees at its peak, but was closed in 2002 after several rounds of layoffs. The site was later redeveloped into a suburban housing complex in the mid-2000s.

Lake Stevens is home to a large retail district anchored by Frontier Village, a shopping center located at the intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204. It was developed beginning in the 1960s and now encompasses more than of retail space, spread across several strip malls. A Costco store opened in December 2022 at the intersection of State Route 9 and 20th Street Southeast with a building, a gas station with 30 pumps, and 800 parking stalls. A development agreement was approved by the city government in December 2019 after a year of planning and several lawsuits from residents over impacts to the environment and traffic conditions.

The council holds regular meetings twice a month at the Lake Stevens School District administrative headquarters and a work session during other weeks as needed. The mayor is a full-time position that is also elected by Lake Stevens residents and serves as the executive of the city government during a four-year term. Former city councilmember Brett Gailey, who was also employed by the Everett Police Department, was elected as mayor in 2019.

Several regional agencies provide other services, such as fire protection, library access, and water management.

In addition to elected and executive positions, Lake Stevens has seven boards and commissions that advise the city council on a variety of specific issues. They are composed of volunteer citizens who are appointed to set terms by the mayor with the approval of the city council. The boards and commissions are tasked with managing arts, civil service and police, the public library, parks and recreation, planning, city salaries, and veterans&#x27; rights.

At the federal level, Lake Stevens is part of the 1st congressional district, which is represented by Democrat Suzan DelBene and stretches from Arlington to Bellevue.

==Culture==

The city&#x27;s annual summer festival, Aquafest, is held at North Cove Park in downtown Lake Stevens over a three-day weekend in late July. It was founded in 1960 and includes a boat parade, carnival rides, a car show, and a circus. The 2018 festival was attended by 30,000 people. An annual Ironman 70.3 triathlon was added to Aquafest in the 2000s and features a course with swimming, cycling, and running segments. The triathlon also serves as a qualifier for the Ironman World Championship.

===Parks and recreation===
Lake Stevens has of parks and open space managed by the city government, Snohomish County, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The city government owns and has nine parks that are categorized as community parks, neighborhood parks, mini-parks, and other facilities. In addition to public facilities, the Lake Stevens area has of private parks and open spaces that are owned by homeowner associations and other entities.

The largest city-owned park is Eagle Ridge Community Park, located on near the northwest shore of the lake, but largely undeveloped. The county government owns three community parks in the Lake Stevens area. Cavalero Community Park opened in 2009 and consists of two fenced dog parks, an open field, and a planned skate park on . Lake Stevens Community Park is located east of downtown and includes several soccer and baseball fields on of former timber land. Davies Beach (formerly Willard Wyatt Park) lies at the foot of Chapel Hill on the western lakeshore and includes a beach, boat launch, and a boathouse for rowing teams.

Several city parks are located along the shore of Lake Stevens, providing beaches with swimming areas and fishing docks. Lundeen Park is the largest of the city&#x27;s beaches and was developed out of a former resort that opened in 1908. It also offers paddleboard and kayak rentals, a visitors center, and a concession stand. At the northeast end of the lake is North Cove Park, a downtown park that is planned to be developed into an urban gathering space. A disc golf course was opened in 2000 at Catherine Creek Park, a small park with hiking trails and natural areas.

The county government also owns Centennial Trail, an inter-city hiking, bicycling, and equestrian rail trail. It travels between Arlington and Snohomish, passing through the east side of Lake Stevens. The city has several short trails that are owned by the Lake Stevens School District and private housing subdivisions, along with informal trails along a transmission line corridor. Lake Stevens plans to develop and connect these routes into a full network, including the Bayview Trail on the transmission line in collaboration with the City of Marysville. The city government also manages a community center near the city hall and library. Several local rowing clubs use Lake Stevens, including the in-city Lake Stevens Rowing Club that was founded in 1997.

===Historical preservation===
The local historical society operated a museum adjacent to the city library that opened in 1989 and included exhibits with fixtures from historic buildings and a collection of documents and photographs. The museum grounds also included the Grimm House, a historic house that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house was constructed in 1903 for a mill worker and moved to the museum grounds in 1996, later undergoing extensive renovations before opening for public tours in 2004. The museum was closed and demolished in June 2017 as part of the North Cove Park redevelopment, which also included moving the Grimm House to a new location adjacent to a future museum site.

==Education==

The Lake Stevens School District operates a system of public schools within the city and surrounding areas, including a portion of southeastern Marysville. The school district had an enrollment of approximately 8,838 students in 2016, with 436 total teachers and 239 other staff. It has one high school, Lake Stevens High School, which opened at its current campus in 1979 and was approved for renovation work in 2016. The renovation cost $116 million and began construction in June 2018, opening its first phase in November 2019. The school district also has one mid-high school for grades 8–9, two middle schools, and seven elementary schools. The newest elementary school, Stevens Creek, opened in 2018 alongside an adjacent early learning center.

The city&#x27;s nearest post-secondary educational institutions are Everett Community College and Edmonds College. During the late 2000s, Lake Stevens was a leading candidate for a proposed branch campus of the University of Washington (UW). The city government presented a site on the southwest side of Cavalero Hill that was among the four finalists in 2007, but attracted controversy from neighbors for using land promised for a county park. The Lake Stevens proposal scored the lowest in a survey of the finalists and the project was abandoned entirely in 2008 due to a state budget shortfall.

===Library===
The first public library in Lake Stevens opened in 1946 at the home of a local resident and moved into a former post office three years later. The city government moved the library to a former pharmacy in 1985 and contracted with Sno-Isle Libraries, an inter-county system that later annexed Lake Stevens in 2008. The downtown library building was the smallest in the Sno-Isle system and was determined to be unable to support the community&#x27;s needs, necessitating plans for a replacement in the 2010s.

Sno-Isle proposed a larger library with of space as part of a civic campus on Chapel Hill near Frontier Village, which would cost $17 million and be financed by a bond issue paid through property taxes. The bond was approved by voters in the February 2017 election, but fell 749 votes short of meeting the turnout requirement to pass. A second attempt in February 2018 was also rejected after failing to meet the 60 percent threshold for bonds.

The library was demolished in June 2021 as part of renovations to North Cove Park and was replaced with a temporary library at Lundeen Park. Sno-Isle moved into a former police station in August after it was renovated into a new facility with fewer amenities. In January 2022, the city government proposed leaving the Sno-Isle system and using levy funds for the proposed civic campus as well as a privatized library system. A few days later, the proposal was withdrawn and Sno-Isle announced that it would continue to pursue plans for a permanent library building with $3.1 million in state grants. Site clearing at a site on Chapel Hill for the new library began in March 2023; the two-story library building, which will incorporate mass timber construction and include of space, is scheduled to begin construction in 2025.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Lake Stevens is traversed by three state highways that connect the area to other parts of Snohomish County: State Route 9, running north–south through the west of the city and continuing to Snohomish and Arlington; State Route 92, which continues northeast to Granite Falls; and State Route 204, which connects Frontier Village to U.S. Route 2 (US 2). The intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204 and several roads around Frontier Village were replaced by a series of four roundabouts in 2023 after a proposed interchange was scrapped. The Hewitt Avenue Trestle, which carries US 2 to Everett, is a four-lane freeway that is frequently congested and is planned to be rebuilt to fix capacity issues.

The city is also served by Community Transit, which operates bus routes between cities in Snohomish County. The agency provides all-day bus service from Lake Stevens to Everett, Granite Falls, Lynnwood, Marysville, and Snohomish. The city has a small park and ride that opened in 2004 and is served by local routes as well as an express route to Lynnwood City Center station during peak hours on weekdays. Community Transit also operates the Zip Shuttle microtransit service, which expanded to Lake Stevens in December 2024.

===Utilities===

The city&#x27;s electric power and tap water are provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The PUD sources its water from the City of Everett system at Spada Lake and Lake Chaplain, which is delivered to Lake Stevens and Granite Falls. The city is also bisected by a pair of north–south electrical transmission lines operated by the Bonneville Power Administration that travel towards British Columbia. Natural gas for Lake Stevens residents and businesses is provided by Puget Sound Energy.

The city government contracts with Republic Services and Waste Management to provide curbside collection and disposal of garbage, recycling, and yard waste for different areas of Lake Stevens. The Lake Stevens Sewer District, established in 1957, operates the city&#x27;s sewer system and is planned to merge with the city government in 2032. The sewer district built a treatment plant in 2013 at a cost of $100 million, and the debt payments on the project have caused disputes with the city.

===Healthcare===

Lake Stevens has two urgent care centers that also provide medical services: a branch of The Everett Clinic (part of UnitedHealth Optum); and a MultiCare Indigo Urgent Care Clinic that opened in 2017.

<text>Lynnwood is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The city is part of the Seattle metropolitan area and is located north of Seattle and south of Everett, near the junction of Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. It is the fourth-largest city in Snohomish County, with a population of 38,568 in the 2020 U.S. census.

Often characterized as a suburb or bedroom community, Lynnwood has the highest concentration of retailers in the region and a growing core of businesses, anchored by the Alderwood Mall. The city also has a community college, a convention center, and a major transit center. It is headquarters for several major companies, including Zumiez.

The Lynnwood area was logged and settled by homesteaders in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the development of Alderwood Manor as a planned farming community. Lynnwood, named for the wife of a realtor, emerged in the late 1940s around the intersection of Highway 99 and 196th Street Southwest. The city was incorporated on April 23, 1959, and grew into a suburban hub in the years following the completion of Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Alderwood Mall opened in 1979 and spurred the transformation of eastern Lynnwood into a retail and office district.

==History==

Prior to contact with American settlers, the Snohomish tribe of Native Americans used the area of modern-day Lynnwood for summertime activities, including hunting, fishing, berry gathering and root cultivation. The Snohomish were relocated to the Tulalip reservation, near modern-day Marysville, after the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, opening the area for American settlement.

Brown&#x27;s Bay, part of Puget Sound, and modern-day Meadowdale were surveyed by American loggers in 1859. Logging on Brown&#x27;s Bay began in 1860, and the first American settlers arrived in the 1880s. Scottish-born stonemason Duncan Hunter became the area&#x27;s first white resident in 1889, filing an land claim on modern-day 36th Avenue West after moving west from Wisconsin. The claim was inherited by Hunter&#x27;s son Basil, who lived on the property until his death in 1982; it was later turned into the city&#x27;s Pioneer Park in the late 1980s. Hunter was joined to the east by a claim from William Morrice, a fellow stonemason from Aberdeen, Scotland. Settlers from Pennsylvania homesteaded along Cedar Valley, to the south of Hunter and Morrice, and near Scriber Lake (named for Peter Schreiber) in 1888, leading to the establishment of the area&#x27;s first schoolhouse in 1895.

During the early 20th century, the Lynnwood area was gradually logged by private companies and mill operators, leaving behind plots with tree stumps. The arrival of the Seattle–Everett Interurban Railway in 1910 brought reliable transportation to the area, as well as real estate speculators. The Puget Mill Company, then the largest landowner in southern Snohomish County, established the planned community of &quot;Alderwood Manor&quot; in 1917 and marketed the area to urban dwellers wishing to build farms in the countryside. Alderwood Manor, located near an Interurban station, gained streets named for tree species and was divided into plots that sold for $200 per acre. A &quot;demonstration farm&quot; was built to educate new residents on raising crops and chickens, as well as market the Alderwood Manor plots to &quot;Little Landers&quot;, a nickname for the new residents. Alderwood Manor grew to over 1,463 people and 200,000 hens by 1922, and had electricity and telephone services to most of its residents.

The Puget Mill Company leased out its demonstration farm in 1933 and ceased operations at Alderwood Manor later in the decade, amid declining sales during the Great Depression. At the same time, the opening of the Pacific Highway (modern-day Highway 99) in 1927 and the decline of Interurban service in the 1930s shifted the center of economic growth west near Scriber Lake. Seattle realtor Karl O&#x27;Brien filed a plat along Highway 99 at 196th Street Southwest in 1937, naming the development &quot;Lynnwood&quot; after his wife Lynn. Nearby businesses adopted the name during the 1940s, leading to the formal use of &quot;Lynnwood&quot; by the chamber of commerce in 1946, instead of the suggested &quot;West Alderwood&quot;.

Lynnwood gained its first post office in 1948, after a successful lobbying campaign by the Lynnwood Commercial Club to the federal Post Office Department. Throughout the early 1950s, Lynnwood saw slow residential development, in part because of the lack of sewers and other municipal services. Local residents sought to be annexed into Edmonds, but were denied and left to organize their own city. In 1956, a committee to study incorporating Lynnwood as a city was formed, proposing an area of and population of 10,744 for the new city. A petition to incorporate was signed by 600 voters and submitted early the following year, proposing a city; during the early months of 1958, several property owners asked to be removed from the proposal over disinterest in the Lynnwood group. An incorporation measure was put before voters on the November 1958, failing by a narrow margin of 890 to 848 votes.

A second attempt at incorporation, with a revised size of and population of 6,000, was approved by a 2-to-1 margin on April 14, 1959. The successful incorporation was credited in part to the movement of dilapidated homes and structures from the right of way of Interstate 5, a freeway to be built through Alderwood Manor, into the Lynnwood area at the behest of the county government. Realtor Jack Bennett was elected the city&#x27;s first mayor, and the city council first met on April 20. The city charter was approved by the county commissioners on April 23, 1959, marking Lynnwood&#x27;s official incorporation as a third-class city. Two years after incorporation, the young city was mired in a legal dispute with neighboring Edmonds over the annexation of the Browns Bay area, which was resolved in an out-of-court settlement.

Lynnwood began offering municipal services in its first years, opening a sewage treatment plant, a public park, new streets, and acquiring a water system from the Alderwood Water District. The city began building its civic center complex in 1969, shortly after the approval of a bond issue to finance the $1.5 million project (equivalent to $ in dollars). The civic center, located at 44th Avenue West and 194th Street Southwest, came after a decade in leased facilities scattered around the city center. The first buildings on the campus, including the city hall and public library, opened in 1971. Later expansions to the civic center added a police station, a municipal courthouse, and an indoor recreation center.

The opening of Interstate 5 in 1965 moved the commercial center of Lynnwood east towards Alderwood Manor, which culminated in the proposed construction of a large shopping center in 1968. The shopping center, named Alderwood Mall and developed by Allied Stores, was put on hold during the local recession of the early 1970s and was later sold to shopping mall developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. in 1976. Alderwood Mall opened on October 4, 1979, sparking a major retail and residential boom in the Lynnwood area in the early 1980s. The Swamp Creek Interchange at Interstate 5 and Interstate 405 was completed in 1984, creating a new regional connection to Alderwood and Lynnwood from the Eastside region of King County.

During the 1980s, Lynnwood gained its first of several office parks, housing high-tech companies expanding from the Eastside and the Canyon Park area of Bothell. Shopping areas developed around Alderwood Mall at the same time, creating the county&#x27;s largest retail center, and new housing areas spread out from the city limits of Lynnwood. Despite the development boom of unincorporated areas surrounding Lynnwood, growth within the city itself slowed in the late 1980s and 1990s, attributed to few annexations and slow natural growth.

Lynnwood began developing plans for a &quot;city center&quot; near the Alderwood Mall area in the 1980s. Like other post-war suburbs, Lynnwood developed without a defined central business district and sought to consolidate cultural facilities and high-density development in a manner similar to Downtown Bellevue. In the late 1990s, the Washington State Department of Transportation rebuilt several interchanges on Interstate 5 in Lynnwood, including the construction of a full diamond interchange at 196th Street Southwest costing $80 million. The city opened a $31 million, medium-sized convention center in 2005 to anchor the future city center. The City of Lynnwood formally adopted its City Center Subarea Plan in 2007, outlining plans to re-develop a area between Lynnwood Transit Center and Alderwood Mall into a central business district. Development of the city center began in 2015, with the construction of two apartment buildings and a hotel located near the convention center.

Community Transit operates local routes and two Swift Bus Rapid Transit lines that cross the city: Swift Blue Line on State Route 99, which opened in 2009; and the Swift Orange Line, which opened in 2024 and connects Edmonds College, Lynnwood Transit Center, Alderwood, and Mill Creek. The agency also launched a ride-hailing service, Zip, in 2022 to serve areas in Lynnwood and Alderwood.

Sound Transit operates the regional Link light rail system, which was extended to Lynnwood Transit Center on August 30, 2024. The 1 Line connects Lynnwood to Downtown Seattle and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; the 2 Line is scheduled to reach Lynnwood in 2026 and add connections to Bellevue and Redmond. The light rail station also serves as a major regional bus hub with commuter bus service from across Snohomish County truncated at Lynnwood Transit Center. Sound Transit also operates express buses from Lynnwood Transit Center and Ash Way Park and Ride to Seattle and Bellevue; the Lynnwood–Bellevue service is planned to be replaced with a Stride bus rapid transit line by 2028. Link service is planned to be extended north to Downtown Everett, via Ash Way and Paine Field, by 2037 or 2041 depending on funding.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Lynnwood is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city; Lynnwood is also the terminus of a minor gas pipeline operated by the Northwest Pipeline Company.

The Alderwood Water and Wastewater District provides municipal tap water service for Lynnwood, sourced from Everett&#x27;s Spada Lake Reservoir. The City of Lynnwood handles sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment; its wastewater treatment plant treats 5 million gallons per day () that is discharged into Puget Sound. The water district serves the unincorporated areas around Lynnwood and also operates Well Number 5, an artesian well in North Lynnwood that has gained popularity for its quality. The city contracts with Republic Services and Waste Management for garbage, recycling, and yard waste disposal.

===Health care===

Lynnwood does not have any general hospitals, but is located near the Edmonds branch of Swedish Medical Center, formerly known as Stevens Hospital. The city has several community and specialty clinics operated by regional healthcare providers, including the Community Health Center of Snohomish County, Virginia Mason, and The Everett Clinic. A 16-bed mental health care center adjacent to the Lynnwood jail and police station was approved by the city government in 2021 at a cost of $20 million. The operator of the center, Recovery Innovations, withdrew from the project as it neared completion and prevented it from opening as scheduled in 2025.

<doc id="138214" wikidata="Q1479523" url="?curid=138214" title="Five lemma">
<text>In mathematics, especially homological algebra and other applications of abelian category theory, the five lemma is an important and widely used lemma about commutative diagrams.
The five lemma is not only valid for abelian categories but also works in the category of groups, for example.

The five lemma can be thought of as a combination of two other theorems, the four lemmas, which are dual to each other.

==Statements==
Consider the following commutative diagram in any abelian category (such as the category of abelian groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field) or in the category of groups.

The five lemma states that, if the rows are exact, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are isomorphisms, &quot;l&quot; is an epimorphism, and &quot;q&quot; is a monomorphism, then &quot;n&quot; is also an isomorphism.

The two four-lemmas state:

==Proof==
The method of proof we shall use is commonly referred to as diagram chasing. We shall prove the five lemma by individually proving each of the two four lemmas.

To perform diagram chasing, we assume that we are in a category of modules over some ring, so that we may speak of &quot;elements&quot; of the objects in the diagram and think of the morphisms of the diagram as &quot;functions&quot; (in fact, homomorphisms) acting on those elements.
Then a morphism is a monomorphism if and only if it is injective, and it is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective.
Similarly, to deal with exactness, we can think of kernels and images in a function-theoretic sense.
The proof will still apply to any (small) abelian category because of Mitchell&#x27;s embedding theorem, which states that any small abelian category can be represented as a category of modules over some ring.
For the category of groups, just turn all additive notation below into multiplicative notation, and note that commutativity of abelian group is never used.

So, to prove (1), assume that &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are surjective and &quot;q&quot; is injective.
: 
* Let &quot;c′&quot; be an element of &quot;C′&quot;.
* Since &quot;p&quot; is surjective, there exists an element &quot;d&quot; in &quot;D&quot; with &quot;p&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;t&quot;(&quot;c′&quot;).
* By commutativity of the diagram, &quot;u&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;d&quot;)) = &quot;q&quot;(&quot;j&quot;(&quot;d&quot;)).
* Since im &quot;t&quot; = ker &quot;u&quot; by exactness, 0 = &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;(&quot;c′&quot;)) = &quot;u&quot;(&quot;p&quot;(&quot;d&quot;)) = &quot;q&quot;(&quot;j&quot;(&quot;d&quot;)).
* Since &quot;q&quot; is injective, &quot;j&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = 0, so &quot;d&quot; is in ker &quot;j&quot; = im &quot;h&quot;.
* Therefore, there exists &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot; with &quot;h&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;.
* Then &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)) = &quot;t&quot;(&quot;c′&quot;). Since &quot;t&quot; is a homomorphism, it follows that &quot;t&quot;(&quot;c′&quot; − &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)) = 0.
* By exactness, &quot;c′&quot; − &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) is in the image of &quot;s&quot;, so there exists &quot;b′&quot; in &quot;B′&quot; with &quot;s&quot;(&quot;b′&quot;) = &quot;c′&quot; − &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;).
* Since &quot;m&quot; is surjective, we can find &quot;b&quot; in &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;b′&quot; = &quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).
* By commutativity, &quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;s&quot;(&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;c′&quot; − &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;).
* Since &quot;n&quot; is a homomorphism, &quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) + &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) + &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;c′&quot; − &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) + &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;c′&quot;.
* Therefore, &quot;n&quot; is surjective.

Then, to prove (2), assume that &quot;m&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are injective and &quot;l&quot; is surjective.
* Let &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot; be such that &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = 0.
* &quot;t&quot;(&quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)) is then 0.
* By commutativity, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;c&quot;)) = 0.
* Since &quot;p&quot; is injective, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = 0.
* By exactness, there is an element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;B&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;.
* By commutativity, &quot;s&quot;(&quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)) = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) = 0.
* By exactness, there is then an element &quot;a′&quot; of &quot;A′&quot; such that &quot;r&quot;(&quot;a′&quot;) = &quot;m&quot;(&quot;b&quot;).
* Since &quot;l&quot; is surjective, there is &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot; such that .
* By commutativity, .
* Since &quot;m&quot; is injective, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;b&quot;.
* So &quot;c&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)).
* Since the composition of &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is trivial, &quot;c&quot; = 0.
* Therefore, &quot;n&quot; is injective.

Combining the two four lemmas now proves the entire five lemma.

==Applications==
The five lemma is often applied to long exact sequences: when computing homology or cohomology of a given object, one typically employs a simpler subobject whose homology/cohomology is known, and arrives at a long exact sequence which involves the unknown homology groups of the original object. This alone is often not sufficient to determine the unknown homology groups, but if one can compare the original object and sub object to well-understood ones via morphisms, then a morphism between the respective long exact sequences is induced, and the five lemma can then be used to determine the unknown homology groups.

<text>In mathematics, an exact sequence is a sequence of morphisms between objects (for example, groups, rings, modules, and, more generally, objects of an abelian category) such that the image of one morphism equals the kernel of the next.

==Definition==
In the context of group theory, a sequence
:formula_1
of groups and group homomorphisms is said to be exact at formula_2 if formula_3. The sequence is called exact if it is exact at each formula_2 for all formula_5, i.e., if the image of each homomorphism is equal to the kernel of the next.

The sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for other algebraic structures. For example, one could have an exact sequence of vector spaces and linear maps, or of modules and module homomorphisms. More generally, the notion of an exact sequence makes sense in any category with kernels and cokernels, and more specially in abelian categories, where it is widely used. 

===Simple cases===
To understand the definition, it is helpful to consider relatively simple cases where the sequence is of group homomorphisms, is finite, and begins or ends with the trivial group. Traditionally, this, along with the single identity element, is denoted 0 (additive notation, usually when the groups are abelian), or denoted 1 (multiplicative notation).

* Consider the sequence 0 → &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;. The image of the leftmost map is 0. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the rightmost map (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;) has kernel {0}; that is, if and only if that map is a monomorphism (injective, or one-to-one).
* Consider the dual sequence &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot; → 0. The kernel of the rightmost map is &quot;C&quot;. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the image of the leftmost map (from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;) is all of &quot;C&quot;; that is, if and only if that map is an epimorphism (surjective, or onto).
* Therefore, the sequence 0 → &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; → 0 is exact if and only if the map from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is both a monomorphism and epimorphism (that is, a bimorphism), and so usually an isomorphism from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; (this always holds in exact categories like Set).

===Short exact sequence===
Short exact sequences are exact sequences of the form
:formula_6
As established above, for any such short exact sequence, &quot;f&quot; is a monomorphism and &quot;g&quot; is an epimorphism. Furthermore, the image of &quot;f&quot; is equal to the kernel of &quot;g&quot;. It is helpful to think of &quot;A&quot; as a subobject of &quot;B&quot; with &quot;f&quot; embedding &quot;A&quot; into &quot;B&quot;, and of &quot;C&quot; as the corresponding factor object (or quotient), &quot;B&quot;/&quot;A&quot;, with &quot;g&quot; inducing an isomorphism
:formula_7

The short exact sequence
:formula_8
is called split if there exists a homomorphism &quot;h&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;B&quot; such that the composition &quot;g&quot; ∘ &quot;h&quot; is the identity map on &quot;C&quot;. It follows that if these are abelian groups, &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to the direct sum of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;:
:formula_9

===Long exact sequence===
A general exact sequence is sometimes called a long exact sequence, to distinguish from the special case of a short exact sequence.

A long exact sequence is equivalent to a family of short exact sequences in the following sense: Given a long sequence

with &quot;n ≥&quot; 2, we can split it up into the short sequences
where formula_10 for every formula_11. By construction, the sequences &quot;(2)&quot; are exact at the formula_12&#x27;s (regardless of the exactness of &quot;(1)&quot;). Furthermore, &quot;(1)&quot; is a long exact sequence if and only if &quot;(2)&quot; are all short exact sequences.

See weaving lemma for details on how to re-form the long exact sequence from the short exact sequences.

== Examples ==

=== Integers modulo two ===
Consider the following sequence of abelian groups:
:formula_13

The first homomorphism maps each element &quot;i&quot; in the set of integers Z to the element 2&quot;i&quot; in Z. The second homomorphism maps each element &quot;i&quot; in Z to an element &quot;j&quot; in the quotient group; that is, . Here the hook arrow formula_14 indicates that the map 2× from Z to Z is a monomorphism, and the two-headed arrow formula_15 indicates an epimorphism (the map mod 2). This is an exact sequence because the image 2Z of the monomorphism is the kernel of the epimorphism. Essentially &quot;the same&quot; sequence can also be written as 

:formula_16

In this case the monomorphism is 2&quot;n&quot; ↦ 2&quot;n&quot; and although it looks like an identity function, it is not onto (that is, not an epimorphism) because the odd numbers don&#x27;t belong to 2Z. The image of 2Z through this monomorphism is however exactly the same subset of Z as the image of Z through &quot;n&quot; ↦ 2&quot;n&quot; used in the previous sequence. This latter sequence does differ in the concrete nature of its first object from the previous one as 2Z is not the same set as Z even though the two are isomorphic as groups.

The first sequence may also be written without using special symbols for monomorphism and epimorphism:
:formula_17

Here 0 denotes the trivial group, the map from Z to Z is multiplication by 2, and the map from Z to the factor group Z/2Z is given by reducing integers modulo 2. This is indeed an exact sequence:
* the image of the map 0 → Z is {0}, and the kernel of multiplication by 2 is also {0}, so the sequence is exact at the first Z.
* the image of multiplication by 2 is 2Z, and the kernel of reducing modulo 2 is also 2Z, so the sequence is exact at the second Z.
* the image of reducing modulo 2 is Z/2Z, and the kernel of the zero map is also Z/2Z, so the sequence is exact at the position Z/2Z.

The first and third sequences are somewhat of a special case owing to the infinite nature of Z. It is not possible for a finite group to be mapped by inclusion (that is, by a monomorphism) as a proper subgroup of itself. Instead the sequence that emerges from the first isomorphism theorem is 

:formula_18
(here the trivial group is denoted formula_19 as these groups are not supposed to be abelian).

As a more concrete example of an exact sequence on finite groups:

:formula_20

where formula_21 is the cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; and formula_22 is the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;, which is a non-abelian group.

=== Intersection and sum of modules ===
Let and be two ideals of a ring .
Then
:formula_23
is an exact sequence of -modules, where the module homomorphism formula_24 maps each element of formula_25 to the element of the direct sum formula_26, and the homomorphism formula_27 maps each element of formula_26 to .

These homomorphisms are restrictions of similarly defined homomorphisms that form the short exact sequence

:formula_29 

Passing to quotient modules yields another exact sequence

:formula_30

== Properties ==
The splitting lemma states that, for a short exact sequence
:formula_31 the following conditions are equivalent.
*There exists a morphism such that is the identity on .
*There exists a morphism such that is the identity on .
*There exists a morphism such that is the direct sum of and . 

For non-commutative groups, the splitting lemma does not apply, and one has only the equivalence between the two last conditions, with &quot;the direct sum&quot; replaced with &quot;a semidirect product&quot;.

In both cases, one says that such a short exact sequence &quot;splits&quot;.

The snake lemma shows how a commutative diagram with two exact rows gives rise to a longer exact sequence. The nine lemma is a special case.

The five lemma gives conditions under which the middle map in a commutative diagram with exact rows of length 5 is an isomorphism; the short five lemma is a special case thereof applying to short exact sequences.

===Weaving lemma===

The importance of short exact sequences is underlined by the fact that every exact sequence results from &quot;weaving together&quot; several overlapping short exact sequences. Consider for instance the exact sequence

:formula_32

which implies that there exist objects &quot;Ck&quot; in the category such that

:formula_33.

Suppose in addition that the cokernel of each morphism exists, and is isomorphic to the image of the next morphism in the sequence:

:formula_34

(This is true for a number of interesting categories, including any abelian category such as the abelian groups; but it is not true for all categories that allow exact sequences, and in particular is not true for the category of groups, in which coker(&quot;f&quot;) : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is not &quot;H&quot;/im(&quot;f&quot;) but formula_35, the quotient of &quot;H&quot; by the conjugate closure of im(&quot;f&quot;).) Then we obtain a commutative diagram in which all the diagonals are short exact sequences:
The only portion of this diagram that depends on the cokernel condition is the object formula_36 and the final pair of morphisms formula_37. If there exists any object formula_38 and morphism formula_39 such that formula_40 is exact, then the exactness of formula_41 is ensured. Again taking the example of the category of groups, the fact that im(&quot;f&quot;) is the kernel of some homomorphism on &quot;H&quot; implies that it is a normal subgroup, which coincides with its conjugate closure; thus coker(&quot;f&quot;) is isomorphic to the image &quot;H&quot;/im(&quot;f&quot;) of the next morphism.

Conversely, given any list of overlapping short exact sequences, their middle terms form an exact sequence in the same manner.

==Applications of exact sequences==
In the theory of abelian categories, short exact sequences are often used as a convenient language to talk about subobjects and factor objects.

The extension problem is essentially the question &quot;Given the end terms &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; of a short exact sequence, what possibilities exist for the middle term &quot;B&quot;?&quot; In the category of groups, this is equivalent to the question, what groups &quot;B&quot; have &quot;A&quot; as a normal subgroup and &quot;C&quot; as the corresponding factor group? This problem is important in the classification of groups. See also Outer automorphism group.

Notice that in an exact sequence, the composition &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 ∘ &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; maps &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; to 0 in &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;+2, so every exact sequence is a chain complex. Furthermore, only &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;-images of elements of &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; are mapped to 0 by &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1, so the homology of this chain complex is trivial. More succinctly:
:Exact sequences are precisely those chain complexes which are acyclic.
Given any chain complex, its homology can therefore be thought of as a measure of the degree to which it fails to be exact.

If we take a series of short exact sequences linked by chain complexes (that is, a short exact sequence of chain complexes, or from another point of view, a chain complex of short exact sequences), then we can derive from this a long exact sequence (that is, an exact sequence indexed by the natural numbers) on homology by application of the zig-zag lemma. It comes up in algebraic topology in the study of relative homology; the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is another example. Long exact sequences induced by short exact sequences are also characteristic of derived functors.

Exact functors are functors that transform exact sequences into exact sequences.

<text>Maltby is a census-designated place (CDP) in Snohomish County, Washington. The population was 11,277 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Maltby was first settled in 1887 after the arrival of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which was built between Seattle and the Canadian border. A work camp at the top of a hill in the area was originally named Earl; it later became known as Yew. Real estate developer Robert Maltby purchased land in the area in 1890 and subdivided it into lots for sale; the local post office was renamed to Maltby in 1893. A sawmill was constructed in the settlement and operated until the early 20th century.

Several proposals to incorporate Maltby as a city were submitted in the 1990s and 2000s amid concerns about residential development in the rural area. A 2005 proposal encompassed an area of —far larger than any city in Snohomish County—with a population of 25,000.

==Geography==

Maltby is located north of Woodinville and south of Snohomish, at the intersection of State Route 522 and State Route 524. It uses Snohomish and Woodinville addresses and is served by city services from Monroe.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 16.8 square miles (43.6 km2), of which, 16.8 square miles (43.4 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) of it (0.36%) is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 8,267 people, 2,824 households, and 2,335 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 492.9 people per square mile (190.3/km2). There were 2,897 housing units at an average density of 172.7/sq mi (66.7/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 94.12% White, 0.29% African American, 0.47% Native American, 2.38% Asian, 0.16% Pacific Islander, 0.64% from other races, and 1.94% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.13% of the population.

There were 2,824 households, out of which 41.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 74.6% were married couples living together, 4.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.3% were non-families. 12.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.93 and the average family size was 3.19.

In the CDP, the age distribution of the population shows 28.5% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 31.3% from 25 to 44, 28.5% from 45 to 64, and 6.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.1 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $77,534, and the median income for a family was $80,543. Males had a median income of $53,209 versus $36,719 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $29,330. About 1.9% of families and 3.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.1% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over. Based on per capita income, Maltby ranks 40th of 522 ranked areas in the state of Washington.

==Tourism==

A small shopping district is located at the center of Maltby. This includes a cafe located in a former school gymnasium and several boutique shops in the former Maltby School.

<text>Marysville is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States, part of the Seattle metropolitan area. The city is located north of Seattle, adjacent to Everett on the north side of the Snohomish River delta. It is the second-largest city in Snohomish County after Everett, with a population of 70,714 at the time of the 2020 U.S. census. , Marysville was also the fastest-growing city in Washington state, growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent.

Marysville was established in 1872 as a trading post by James P. Comeford, but was not populated by other settlers until 1883. After the town was platted in 1885, a period of growth brought new buildings and industries to Marysville. In 1891, Marysville was incorporated and welcomed the completed Great Northern Railway. Historically, the area has subsisted on lumber and agrarian products; the growth of strawberry fields in Marysville led to the city being nicknamed the &quot;Strawberry City&quot; in the 1920s.

The city experienced its first wave of suburbanization in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in the development of new housing and commercial areas. Between 1980 and 2000, the population of Marysville increased five-fold. In the early 2000s, annexations of unincorporated areas to the north and east expanded the city to over and brought the population over 60,000.

Marysville is oriented north–south along Interstate 5, bordering the Tulalip Indian Reservation to the west, and State Route 9 to the east. Mount Pilchuck, whose peak can be seen from various points in the city, appears in the city&#x27;s flag and seal.

==History==
===Foundation and early history===
Marysville was established in 1872 by government-appointed Indian agent James P. Comeford, an Irish immigrant who had served in the Civil War, and his wife Maria as a trading post on the Tulalip Indian Reservation. The reservation, located to the west of modern-day Marysville, was established by the Point Elliot Treaty of 1855, signed by local Native American tribes and territorial governor Isaac Stevens at modern-day Mukilteo. The treaty&#x27;s signing opened most of Snohomish County to American settlement and commercial activities, including logging, fishing and trapping.

The timber industry was the largest active industry in the area during the 1860s and 1870s, with hillsides in modern-day Marysville cleared by loggers for dairy farms. The Comefords&#x27; trading post accepted business from the reservation and logging camps that were established near the mouth of the Snohomish River. In 1874, Comeford acquired three timber claims from local loggers for $450, totaling , and cleared the land in preparation for settlement. Comeford and his wife moved to the present site of Marysville in 1877, building a new store and wharf. Although Marysville remained a one-man town until 1883, a post office and school district were both established by 1879 using the names and signatures of Native American neighbors of Comeford&#x27;s, who were given &quot;Boston&quot; names for the petition. Comeford completed construction of a two-story hotel in 1883 to welcome new settlers from outside the region.

The origin of the settlement&#x27;s name, Marysville, remains disputed. According to the Marysville Historical Society, it was to be named Mariasville for Maria Comeford, but was changed to Marysville after the postal department identified a similarly-named town in Idaho. Among the first residents to arrive in the area in the 1880s were James Johnson and Thomas Lloyd, who allegedly suggested that the town be named for their previous home of Marysville, California. Comeford sold his store and wharf to settlers Mark Swinnerton and Henry B. Myers in 1884, and moved north to the Kellogg Marsh (now part of Marysville) to farm of land he purchased.

Marysville was formally platted on February 25, 1885, filed by the town physician J. D. Morris and dedicated by the Comefords. More settlers began to arrive after the completion of the town&#x27;s first sawmill in 1887, joined by three others by the end of the decade. Marysville was officially incorporated as a fourth-class city on March 20, 1891, with a population of approximately 400 residents and Mark Swinnerton serving as the city&#x27;s first mayor. The Great Northern Railway also completed construction of its tracks through Marysville in 1891, building a drawbridge over Ebey Slough and serving the city&#x27;s sawmills. A newspaper named the &quot;Marysville Globe&quot; was established by Thomas P. Hopp in 1892 and continues to be published in the city.

===Early 20th century===

By the turn of the century, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 728, and social organizations began to establish themselves in Marysville, including a lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and a Crystal Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons. The first city hall was opened in late 1901, at a cost of $2,000; the building also housed the city&#x27;s fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply systems were both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction of a high school building.

The timber industry in Marysville peaked in 1910, at which point the city&#x27;s population reached 1,239, with 10 sawmills producing lumber on the shores of Ebey Slough. Agriculture began to grow in Marysville, with its fertile land suited for the growing of strawberries in particular. By 1920, the city had more than of strawberry fields, leading to the coining of the city&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Strawberry City&quot; and the establishment of the annual Strawberry Festival in 1932.

An automobile bridge across Ebey Slough and the Snohomish River estuary to Everett was completed in 1927, with funding from the state department of highways to complete the Pacific Highway (later part of U.S. Route 99, and present-day State Route 529). The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic hardship experienced by other nearby communities. During World War II, an ammunition depot was built on the Tulalip Reservation near present-day Quil Ceda, later being re-used as a Boeing test site after the aerospace company expanded in Everett.

===Late 20th century===

Marysville began to grow into a bedroom community of Seattle and Everett in the late 1950s, spurred by the completion of Interstate 5 in stages from 1954 to 1969. The new freeway bypassed the town, causing a minor decline in tourist revenue at businesses that later rebounded to previous levels, also eliminating a major traffic bottleneck that paralyzed the city&#x27;s downtown. The city annexed its first area outside its original city limits in 1954, growing to over 2,500 residents. Marysville was re-classified as a third-class city in March 1962 and the local Chamber of Commerce boosted the city during the Century 21 Exposition held in nearby Seattle, hosting a UFO exposition in Smokey Point that summer.

On June 6, 1969, a freight train operated by Great Northern rammed into several disconnected train cars in front of the Marysville depot, destroying the building, killing two men in an engine on a nearby siding and injuring two others. The crash, blamed on the engineer failing to adhere to the track&#x27;s speed limit, caused $1 million in damage to railroad property and resulted in the demolition of the depot, which had served the city since 1891 and was not rebuilt.

After the initial wave of suburbanization, which built homes in former strawberry fields to the north and east of Marysville, the city&#x27;s population totaled 5,544 in 1980. The city&#x27;s growth was concentrated in outlying areas, leaving downtown to weaken economically. In 1981, the Marysville City Council declared that the downtown area was &quot;blighted&quot; and in need of a facelift. The council presented a $30 million urban renewal plan in November 1982 that would add new retail and office space, mixed-use development, public parks and improve pedestrian conditions in downtown, along with a large public parking lot and an expanded public marina. The plan was opposed by the marina&#x27;s owner and other downtown property owners and produced lengthy public hearings that lasted until the following year. Mayor Daryl Brennick vetoed the plan in June 1983, citing public outcry and the high cost of the proposal, and the city council failed to overturn the decision. The city instead developed a downtown shopping mall that involved the demolition of a water tower (one of two in the city) and several historic buildings in 1987. The $17 million mall opened in August 1988 with 24 stores and of retail space.

Marysville underwent further population changes in the late 1980s and 1990s, continuing to build more housing and new retail centers after the lifting of a building moratorium. The city continued to annex outlying areas, growing to a size of and population of 25,315 by 2000. Marysville also saw a thrice-fold increase in the number of businesses from 1991 to 1996 and was close to eclipsing Edmonds in retail sales. The decade also saw the construction of new schools, a YMCA facility, a library, and a renovated senior center at Comeford Park. The Tulalip Tribes opened its first casino in 1992, the second Indian casino in the state, and began development of a large shopping mall at Quil Ceda Village in the early 2000s.

Marysville attempted to attract regional facilities in the late 1990s and 2000s, with varying degrees of success. The U.S. Navy opened Naval Station Everett in Everett in 1994, which was accompanied by a support annex in northern Marysville near Smokey Point the following year. The Puget Sound Regional Council explored the expansion of Arlington Municipal Airport into a regional airport in the 1990s to relieve Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, but decided instead to build a third runway at Sea-Tac because of existing traffic and local opposition. In September 2004, Marysville won a bid to build a NASCAR racetrack (to be operated by the International Speedway Corporation) near Smokey Point. The project was cancelled two months later after concerns about traffic impacts, environmental conditions, and $70 million in required transportation improvements arose. The NASCAR site was later pitched as a candidate for a new University of Washington satellite campus (known as UW North Sound) in the late 2000s, competing with a site in downtown Everett. The project was put on hold in 2008 after continued disagreements over the campus&#x27;s location, before being cancelled entirely in 2011, replaced by a new Washington State University branch campus in Everett.

===21st century===
From 2000 to 2006, the city annexed 23 additional areas, totaling , lengthening the city to border Arlington at Smokey Point. The largest single annexation came in 2009, with Marysville absorbing 20,000 residents and from North Marysville, an unincorporated area that comprised the majority of the urban growth area. New retail centers in North Lakewood and at 116th Street were built in 2007, leading to increased sales tax revenue for the city and increased traffic congestion in areas of the city.

The opening of the city&#x27;s waterfront park and public boat launch in 2005 spurred interest in redevelopment of downtown Marysville. The closure of the final waterfront sawmill in 2005, followed by its acquisition and demolition by the city in 2008, led city planners to propose a downtown master plan. The 20-year plan, released and adopted by the City Council in 2009, proposed the redevelopment of the Marysville Towne Center Mall into a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented area with a restored street grid. The waterfront area would include trails, residential buildings, and retail spaces, along with a new city hall and civic center. The city government acquired several parcels in the waterfront in the 2010s with the intent of partnering with a private developer. In 2015, the city of Marysville was also the recipient of grants and consultation from the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s smart growth program, identifying strategies for infill development in downtown.

By 2010, Marysville had grown to a population of 60,020 and surpassed Lynnwood and Edmonds to become the second-largest city in Snohomish County. In 2015, the city grew at a rate of 2.5 percent, the largest rate of any city in Washington state. New housing and industrial areas are under construction and planned to fuel further population growth in Marysville. The city&#x27;s school district opened a second high school, Marysville Getchell, in 2010 to serve students living in the eastern area of Marysville. The school previously consisted of four Small Learning Communities which share the same campus and athletics programs. On October 24, 2014, the cafeteria of Marysville Pilchuck High School was the site of a school shooting, in which five students (including the perpetrator) were killed and another was left seriously injured. The shooting garnered national attention amidst a debate about gun violence and gun restrictions. The cafeteria was closed for the rest of the school year and replaced by a new building opened in January 2017, funded by $8.3 million from the state legislature and school district.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2010 census, Marysville has a total area of — of land and of water. The city is located in the northwestern part of Snohomish County in Western Washington, approximately north of Seattle. Marysville&#x27;s city limits are generally bound to the south by Ebey Slough (part of the Snohomish River delta) and Soper Hill Road, to the west by Interstate 5 and the Tulalip Indian Reservation, to the north by the city of Arlington, and to the east by the Centennial Trail and State Route 9. The city&#x27;s urban growth boundary includes outside of city limits, bringing the total area to .

The city&#x27;s topography varies from the low-lying downtown, located along the banks of Ebey Slough above sea level, rising to near Smokey Point and over in the eastern highlands. Marysville sits in the watershed of two major creeks, Quilceda Creek and Allen Creek, and approximately 70 minor streams that flow into Ebey Slough and Snohomish River. During the early 20th century, repeated controlled flooding and other engineering works in the Snohomish River delta contributed to the replenishment of the area&#x27;s fertile silty soil for use in farming.

The Marysville skyline is dominated by views of Mount Pilchuck and the Cascade Mountains to the east and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The Mount Pilchuck appears on the city&#x27;s logo and flag, and is the namesake of the Marysville Pilchuck High School.

The City of Marysville&#x27;s comprehensive plan defines 11 general neighborhoods within the city and its urban growth boundary: Downtown, Jennings Park, Sunnyside, East Sunnyside/Whiskey Ridge, Cedarcrest/Getchell Hill, North Marysville/Pinewood, Kellogg Marsh, Marshall/Kruse, Shoultes, Smokey Point, and Lakewood.

==Demographics==
Until the post-World War II population boom of the 1950s, Marysville&#x27;s population never rose above 2,000 residents, who were all located within the original city limits. The city began annexing surrounding areas in the 1950s, anticipating suburban development that would replace existing farmland and forest lands. From 1950 to 1980, the city doubled in population, growing to over 5,000 residents, with an additional 15,000 residents in surrounding areas. Marysville&#x27;s population grew five-fold between 1980 and 2000, increasing to 25,000 through natural growth and annexation of developed areas.

The average one-way commute is approximately 30 minutes; 79 percent of workers drive alone to their workplace, while 12 percent carpool and 3 percent used public transit.

Marysville&#x27;s economy historically relied on lumber production and agriculture, including the cultivation of strawberries, hay and oats. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike other cities in the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a tannery, a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city&#x27;s largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. The lumber mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed the plant in 2007.

Suburban development and the rise of long-distance commuting in the 1950s led Marysville to transition toward a service-based economy. One of the largest employers of Marysville residents is the Boeing Company and their Everett assembly plant. While farms still operate in the area around the city, since 1980 the lumber industry has all but ceased and is no longer a major factor in the local economy. Since the late 1980s, the economy of Marysville has centered around retail areas, including the downtown Marysville Towne Center Mall (opened in 1987) and the Naval Support Complex (opened in 1995). The Tulalip Tribes built a new casino and new shopping center in the early 2000s to the west of Marysville, contributing to a fall in sales tax revenue. In the latter half of the decade, Marysville opened two large retail centers of its own in the annexed Lakewood neighborhood and at 116th Street NE, bringing additional jobs and sales tax revenue to the city. An auto row along Smokey Point Boulevard in northern Marysville was developed in the late 2010s and is home to several car dealerships.

Marysville is also home to manufacturing companies based in the northern part of the city near Smokey Point and Arlington&#x27;s industrial center at Arlington Municipal Airport. The cities of Arlington and Marysville lobbied for the creation of the Cascade Industrial Center from the Puget Sound Regional Council, which was approved in 2019. The industrial area is planned to encompass of land between the two cities and support 25,000 jobs by 2040; its first buildings for Amazon, Blue Origin, and other companies were opened in 2022. The city&#x27;s second-largest employer is C&amp;D Zodiac, an aerospace parts manufacturer tied to Boeing, with 670 employees at an office in northern Marysville. In 2016, outdoor footwear manufacturer Northside USA opened a new headquarters at a warehouse in northern Marysville. Space module manufacturer Gravitics has a manufacturing and design facility in Marysville that opened in 2023.

==Government and politics==
Marysville, a non-charter code city, operates under a mayor–council government with an elected mayor and an elected city council. The mayor serves a term of four years and has been a full-time position since July 1997. A proposal to change to a council–manager government was submitted as a ballot measure in 2002 and rejected by voters. The 32nd and current mayor of Marysville, Jon Nehring, was appointed on June 28, 2010, after the resignation of incumbent Dennis Kendall; Nehring was elected to a full term in November 2011, and re-elected in 2015, 2019, and 2023; he ran unopposed in 2023.

The city council is composed of seven residents who are elected in at-large, non-partisan elections to four-year terms. The elections are staggered, with three positions elected on the same ballot as the mayor, and four positions elected two years later. The council also selects a member to serve as council president for a one-year term. The council meets twice per month, excluding holidays and during the month of August, in the City Council Chambers at the city hall. A proposal to adopt a council–manager government system was defeated by voters in 2002.

According to the Washington State Auditor, Marysville&#x27;s municipal government employs 266 people and its general fund expenditures totaled $38.7 million in 2015.

City taxes, collected from retail sales, property assessment, and other sources, accounted for $34.3 million in annual revenue. , the combined sales tax rate in Marysville is 9.4 percent, of which 1.3 percent is collected by the city government and its associated transportation benefit district.

The city has several departments providing services to its residents, including a police department, municipal courts, garbage collection, planning and zoning, parks and recreational programs, engineering, street maintenance, water and wastewater services, and stormwater treatment. A new civic campus, combining a police station, city jail, and city hall, was built adjacent to Comeford Park in downtown and opened in October 2022. Marysville contracts with regional districts for other services, including a public library, public transport, electricity, natural gas, and fire protection.

The library is based in a building located on Grove Street that opened on July 27, 1995, to replace a building on the same street that opened in 1978. Recent population growth in northern Marysville near Smokey Point and Lakewood have led to the establishment of a pilot library in the area in 2018, and a recommendation to Sno-Isle to build a permanent branch by 2025.

===Historical preservation===

The Marysville Historical Society was formed in 1974 as a non-profit organization to preserve the history of Marysville and its surrounding area.

<text>Mill Creek is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located between the cities of Everett and Lynnwood, approximately northeast of Seattle. The city has a population of 20,926 as of the 2020 census. The city lies along State Route 527 and North Creek, a tributary of the Sammamish River, on the east side of Interstate 5.

The city is one of the wealthiest suburbs in the Seattle metropolitan area and was originally a planned community conceived in the 1970s. The planned development was centered around a country club and golf course, with other development occurring nearby in later phases. It was incorporated as a city in 1983, shortly after the completion of the first phase of development, and underwent major population growth due to continued suburban development and annexation of nearby areas. The city&#x27;s downtown area is centered around the Mill Creek Town Center, a mixed-use lifestyle center and retail complex that opened in 2004.

==History==

===Development===

The Mill Creek area was originally settled in the early 20th century by various farming families, from whom several local placenames are now derived. After the construction of the Bothell–Everett Highway in 1913 as part of the Pacific Highway, two junctions at Murphy&#x27;s Corner and Wintermute&#x27;s Corner gained small stores and filling stations to serve visitors. In 1931, Doctor Manch N. Garhart acquired in the area and used it to grow Gravenstein apples and Bartlett pears while also raising cattle. The Garhart property, named Lake Dell Farm for a small reservoir built by local families, was later sold in 1967 to real estate developers after the market for local lumber and fruits had declined.

The Garhart property, along with several neighboring farms, were optioned by various real estate developers in the 1960s and 1970s as a potential master planned community due to its proximity to the recently completed Interstate 5. It would be the first modern planned city in Washington state, following in the footsteps of earlier planned cities like Longview, built in 1918. The community, named &quot;Olympus&quot;, was planned to include in its first phase with for homes, an industrial park, a shopping center, and a golf course. After a local recession in the early 1970s, the development project was sold in 1973 to Tokyu Land Development and designed by a subsidiary of the Obayashi Corporation named United Development. The development was renamed &quot;Mill Creek&quot;, beating out the Chinook Jargon word &quot;Klahanie&quot;, although there had never been a mill in the vicinity and a waterway of that name was not present in the area until the 2000 renaming of Smokehouse Creek.

Mill Creek&#x27;s master plan was submitted to the county council in January 1974. A homeowners association was established in December 1974 with funding from United Development to manage the area&#x27;s security patrol, street maintenance, and other tasks. The initial plan included consist of 4,600 homes, with eventual plans to house 12,000 people, a park, and an 18-hole golf course. Construction began in early 1975 on the golf course and adjoining country club, while the first homes were under construction by the following year. The first set of homes were designed to resemble country residences, with large floorplans and prominent use of wood furnishings, and sold for an average of $65,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). Tokyu Land Development later re-used these home designs for the domestic market in Japan, where they were sold under the &quot;Mill Creek&quot; brand in the 1990s. The final phase of the original Mill Creek development, consisting of 33 condominiums, was completed in late 2003.

===Incorporation and annexations===

A majority of the first phase&#x27;s 1,767 homes and condominiums were completed by early 1983, when an incorporation petition was submitted by residents after reaching the population threshold of 3,000 needed for cityhood. At the time, the homeowners association and county government had already provided much of the area&#x27;s infrastructure and maintenance requirements, but local residents resisted attempts to raise property tax assessments. Mill Creek was officially incorporated as a city on September 30, 1983, ten days after a vote of residents passed, and encompassed . Mill Creek was the first new city to be incorporated in Snohomish County since Brier in 1965 and the newest in the state since Ocean Shores in 1970.

In the years following incorporation, Mill Creek reduced its property tax rates and formed its own police department, library, postal address, and land-use board. The city&#x27;s telephone system was split between three long-distance calling areas by GTE until the state utilities and transportation commission approved a consolidated calling area for toll-free service. Sid Hanson, the chairman of the incorporation committee, was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor and served a single term until declining to run for re-election in 1987. The city government&#x27;s offices moved four times by the end of the decade, between various leased buildings that all served as temporary city halls. A separate post office serving the city was promised at the time of incorporation, but was not opened until 1994.

The city attempted its first annexations in 1986, but an advisory vote of existing residents rejected one proposal and the city council deferred action on another. Mill Creek approved its first annexation, an parcel southeast of the main development, in July 1987, while the nearby city of Everett began its own annexations of areas to the north of Mill Creek. In 1989, the city proposed a major annexation of , a 25 percent increase in size, to add undeveloped commercial parcels on the west side of the Bothell–Everett Highway. The western annexation was initially opposed by the county government, but was approved alongside four other annexations after Mill Creek agreed to share costs for road improvements to handle additional traffic demand.

Everett attempted to annex the entire Murphy&#x27;s Corner area in the late 1980s, but was forced to split the neighborhood at 132nd Street with Mill Creek after a decision by the state court of appeals and additional arbitration by boundary review boards. The Henry M. Jackson High School was opened in 1994 and is located on the Mill Creek side of Murphy&#x27;s Corner, which was annexed the following year. A private high school, Archbishop Murphy High School, was opened in 1999 on a campus in northeastern Mill Creek. The Thomas Lake area in the northeastern corner of the city, bordered to the north by 132nd Street and east by Seattle Hill Road, was annexed in 2005 and added 2,200 residents to the city&#x27;s population. The annexations of other developed subdivisions, lacking the original development&#x27;s upscale image, created a divide between residents on the issue of further growth. Residents in several potential annexation targets preferred to be left alone by Mill Creek, due to its &quot;snobbish&quot; reputation, which faded as new neighborhoods were absorbed into the city.

===21st century===

In the late 1980s, Mill Creek drafted a comprehensive plan that would transform its newly-annexed commercial area into a mixed-use downtown area to support the growing city. The downtown development would include a large public park, shopping areas, recreational facilities, multi-use trails, and office buildings. After difficulty in finding a suitable developer, the Mill Creek Town Center began construction in 2001 and the first phase opened three years later. The second phase was completed in 2007, with 26 retail buildings, a medical clinic, condominiums, and a downtown plaza.

The Bothell–Everett Highway (now State Route 527) remained a two-lane rural highway through Mill Creek until the start of an expansion and improvement program in the 1990s. It was widened to four lanes with a center turn lane, and also gained bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and new landscaping features. The section through Mill Creek, from 164th Street to 132nd Street, was completed in 2006 and required the construction of retaining walls and detention ponds due to the limited space for the road. The project also included new bus stops that were later upgraded with the opening of the Swift Green Line bus rapid transit system in March 2019.

The city government began planning for a second urban village, to be located in newly-annexed areas at the northeast edge of the city, in 2007. The retail and residential development, named the East Gateway, would have been located on along 132nd Street, and was originally slated to be anchored by a Wal-Mart until the company scrapped plans after protests from local residents. The eastern half of the development began construction in 2012 and will encompass 210 apartments, 104 townhouses, office space, and retail. Development of the remaining western half was approved in 2019 and branded as &quot;The Farm at Mill Creek&quot;, consisting of 354 apartments, retail space, workforce housing units, and office space. It will be anchored by the first suburban Amazon Go in the state, and a hotel.

<text>Monroe is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located at the confluence of the Skykomish, Snohomish, and Snoqualmie rivers near the Cascade foothills, about northeast of Seattle. Monroe&#x27;s population was 19,699 as of the 2020 census.

Monroe was originally founded in 1864 as the town of Park Place, located at the river confluence among several existing settlements in the Tualco Valley. The townsite was previously a trading post used by the indigenous Skykomish people. Park Place was renamed to Monroe in 1890 to honor U.S. President James Monroe, and was moved northeast to be near the tracks of the Great Northern Railway, which was constructed in 1892. Monroe was incorporated in 1902 and was selected as the home of a major condensed milk plant and the state reformatory.

Monroe became a suburban bedroom community in the late 20th century, serving commuters to Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside. It is home to the Monroe Correctional Complex, which absorbed the original reformatory in 1998, and the Evergreen State Fair, which runs annually in late summer. The city is located at the junction of two highways, U.S. Route 2 and State Route 522, which were expanded in the late 20th century to serve commuters.

==History==

===Origins and establishment of Park Place===

The confluence of the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers had originally belonged to the indigenous Skykomish tribe, who predominantly occupied the area between modern-day Monroe and Index. The confluence itself was known as Tualco (Lushootseed: ), and a nearby Skykomish village named acted as a trade post between several Coast Salish groups. A separate settlement near modern-day Monroe was used by the S&#x27;dodohobc band of the Snohomish people. The land around the confluence was cleared into a prairie and used to cultivate berries, hazelnuts, and other plants. The Skykomish were among the tribes to sign the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, effectively ceding their traditional territories, including the Tualco and confluence areas.

The area around modern-day Monroe was surveyed by George B. McClellan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their expedition to find a suitable pass for a railroad across the Cascade Mountains. The Treaty of Point Elliott was not fully ratified until 1859, but the first American settlers had already arrived and claimed squatters rights to homestead in the Skykomish Valley. Robert Smallman, an English immigrant, arrived in 1855 and was the first to homestead on the land around modern-day Monroe. He was followed by Henry McClurg, an appointed county commissioner, who settled in the area with his wife Martha in 1860. McClurg later founded the settlement of Park Place in 1864, on a site west of modern-day downtown Monroe. Two other settlers arrived in 1860: Salem Woods, who claimed a small prairie to the northeast of Tualco and was later elected county sheriff; and Charles Harriman, a territorial legislator who settled in Park Place.

Park Place and Tualco, located on opposite sides of the Skykomish River, grew with the arrival of more settlers in the 1860s and 1870s. A local school district, the second in the county, was established in 1869 by McClurg, and Park Place gained a post office in 1877 with Woods as postmaster. A ferry crossing the Skykomish River was established in 1882, several years prior to the start of regular steamship service on the river as far east as Sultan. The first roads in the area were surveyed in 1882, including an wagon road connecting Park Place to Snohomish in the west. During the 1880s, settlers in Park Place and Tualco received their first shipment of dairy cattle and also began planting hops, which would briefly become a cash crop until the arrival of the hop aphid and economic panic of the 1890s ruined the harvest.

===Renaming and relocation===
The original Park Place post office and general store were abandoned and replaced by a new building that opened in 1890. John Vanasdlen, operator of new store, petitioned for the reopening of the post office but was rejected by the U.S. Post Office Department, which only allowed a single-word name for new offices. &quot;Monroe&quot; was chosen by Vanasdlen, with the input of McClurg, to honor of U.S. President James Monroe. The new post office for Monroe was granted by the U.S. Post Office Department on March 19, 1890.

The Great Northern Railway chose a route over Stevens Pass in the late 1880s for its transcontinental railroad connecting Seattle to St. Paul, Minnesota, bringing new development to the Skykomish Valley. Monroe at Park Place was platted in 1890 and gained several new businesses, including a blacksmith, grocery store, a second hotel, and a butcher. The final survey for Great Northern in 1891 placed the railroad tracks northeast of Park Place, bypassing the settlement in favor of a straighter alignment to cross the Snohomish River south of downtown Snohomish.

The railroad built a small depot named &quot;Wales&quot; on the homestead of Jack Stretch, who platted a settlement on the north side of the tracks that he named &quot;Tye City&quot; for Great Northern&#x27;s locating engineer George Tye. Great Northern completed their railroad through the Skykomish Valley in January 1893, following additional work near Snohomish to rebuild a bridge that had been destroyed in a flood. In late 1892 and early 1893, several merchants in Park Place moved their buildings to the south side of Tye City using teams of oxen, horses, and a steam thresher. After the relocation of Vanasdlen&#x27;s general store and post office, the settlement became known as Monroe.

The completion of the railroad attracted lumber operations to the Monroe area, boosted by the opening of the first shingle mill in 1894 and the first sawmill on Woods Creek in 1897. A bridge across the Skykomish River was opened in 1894 to replace the ferry and the town&#x27;s first church was established two years later. The county government chose a site north of Monroe for a 20-bed poor farm at the modern-day site of the Evergreen State Fairgrounds; it later became the Valley General Hospital. A cooperative of Monroe-area farmers built the city&#x27;s first creamery in 1895, which was destroyed in a fire four years later and later rebuilt. By the end of the decade, Monroe had also gained a new school building, telephone service, a local newspaper, a full-time doctor, and paved sidewalks.

===Incorporation and new industries===
On the morning of September 16, 1901, a fire started at the Odd Fellows community hall and spread to nearby buildings, destroying the only complete block of businesses in Monroe. The fire caused an estimated $8,100 in damage ( dollars), but the businesses and buildings were rebuilt and within two years a permanent fire department was established. Monroe was incorporated as a fourth-class town on December 20, 1902, following an 88–37 vote in favor. At the time of incorporation, the area around Monroe had over 900 residents, five general stores, eight saloons, six restaurants, four sawmills, and five shingle mills. A new town hall building was completed in November 1908, costing $7,000 ( dollars) and paid for using a saloon license tax; the building now serves as the home of a local history museum.

The new town government granted a municipal water franchise to a private company in 1903, sparking a conflict with local water companies. A competing water company unsuccessfully sued the town for franchise rights, but later acquired the original franchised company to operate Monroe&#x27;s water. The town government proposed to acquire the system through a buyout, but their offers were rejected. A separate gravity water system was constructed by the town in 1923 that bankrupted the private system. The town government also granted franchises to private companies for electricity and a hospital in 1903. Monroe gained a new road to Snohomish in 1904, which was followed a year later by a new bridge over the Skykomish River on Lewis Street (now State Route 203).

The state government chose Monroe as the site of the state&#x27;s second reformatory in 1907, ahead of competing bids from Arlington and Sultan. The first inmate at the facility&#x27;s temporary buildings in August 1908; construction of a permanent building, now part of the Monroe Correctional Complex, began in May 1910 and was completed later that year at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars). The Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company opened a milk condensery in Monroe on August 29, 1908, serving 2,000 visitors on &quot;Condenser Day&quot;. The plant was the largest producer of Carnation brand condensed milk and brought the city&#x27;s population to 2,500 within two years of opening. Within a year, the plant was producing of condensed milk per day; the Carnation condensery was later closed in 1928 and destroyed in a fire on March 23, 1944.

By the early 1910s, Monroe and the Cherry Valley were home to seven school districts serving rural communities in the surrounding area. A union high school was proposed to serve the students graduating from the seven districts and was opened on September 1, 1911. A new train depot was constructed by the Great Northern Railway in 1909 to serve the mainline as well as a branch line traversing the Snoqualmie Valley that was opened two years later by the Milwaukee Road. The local timber industry declined and was replaced by a larger reliance on agriculture, namely dairy, vegetable, and berry farms on the logged-off lands around Monroe. One of the largest farms in the area was a lettuce farm and meat-packing plant owned by Charles Frye, later the benefactor of the Frye Art Museum in Seattle.

===Civic projects and fairs===

During the 1920s, several of the larger industrial employers in Monroe expanded their operations and attracted new businesses to the area, including an early radio station. The county government opened a new 100-bed hospital on the poor farm complex in 1925 at a cost of $92,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to provide services to local residents. By the end of the decade, the town had gained new churches, a new masonic hall, a larger condensery plant, and a movie theater. A greenhouse operated by the Great Northern Railway was established in 1926 to supply passengers and decorate trains with fresh flowers. The complex later expanded to include ten greenhouses, but were demolished in 1962.

At the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, several lettuce farms in the Monroe area had folded and been acquired by the Frye Company, which provided employment through the decade for 1,000 residents. The farm was foreclosed in the late 1930s by a subsidiary of Great Northern after lettuce prices had declined. Service organizations in the town ran charity assistance programs for unemployed residents and their families, raising money from large employers to fund food and clothing donations. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) began civic improvement projects around Monroe in 1933, including repairs to damage caused by a major flood in February 1932. The WPA also funded road improvements and a new middle school with a small auditorium that is now home to the Wagner Performing Arts Center.

The local granges of the Monroe area began organizing agricultural fairs and parades in the 1930s on a semi-regular basis. The county also had its own regular fair that was hosted in Snohomish and Granite Falls until the 1920s. The granges hosted the first Cavalcade of the Valleys in 1941, which was followed by the Snohomish County Fair at the poor farm grounds in 1946. The event was renamed the Evergreen State Fair in 1949 and has been hosted annually in Monroe ever since. The fairgrounds were bisected by U.S. Route 2, the successor to an earlier highway across Stevens Pass, which opened in 1949.

Following the Great Depression and World War II, Monroe&#x27;s economy became more reliant on agriculture and smaller industries. A frozen food processing facility was located in Monroe until 1958 and was later replaced with a seafood processor. By 1949, the local government had twice rejected proposals to become a third-class city because of the increased operating costs needed; it also lacked a full-time fire department. The Valley General Hospital was established in 1961 to replace the county-run general hospital on the poor farm complex. A major earthquake struck the Puget Sound region on April 29, 1965, causing severe damage to the original Monroe High School and its annex. The high school campus was demolished and replaced by a new building that opened in October 1968 and served the city until the modern campus was built in 1999. Great Northern was consolidated into the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, and the Monroe train depot was demolished in October of that year.

===Suburban growth===

State Route 522, a new state highway connecting Monroe to Bothell, was opened to traffic on February 10, 1965. The easier car access made Monroe into a bedroom community for Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside region, with new suburban subdivisions being built around the city and annexed by the end of the decade. A new state prison, the Twin Rivers Corrections Center, was opened in 1984 and brought new jobs to the area despite opposition from residents.

The former Frye lettuce farm in western Monroe was sold in the late 1980s to an Eastside-based real estate developer, which proposed the &quot;Fryelands&quot; residential and industrial neighborhood. The Fryelands industrial park, once proposed for a Boeing 777 parts facility, was developed adjacent to another industrial park that was opened a decade earlier. The residential component of the development sold out in 1993 and began construction that year alongside other subdivisions in western Monroe. As part of mitigation for the Fryelands project, an artificial lake named Lake Tye was created to provide wetlands and a park for residents. Between 1990 and 2000, the population of the city doubled to over 13,000.

The increased residential development in Monroe caused worsened congestion on State Route 522, which was named one of the most dangerous highways in the United States. The state government began a widening and safety improvement program in 1995 that has continued since then, gradually building four-lane sections for the highway and upgrading the remaining two-lane sections. During the 1990s and 2000s, several large strip malls and big-box stores were built along U.S. Route 2 north of downtown. The North Kelsey development in the early 2010s brought a controversial Walmart to Monroe, which was challenged by neighborhood activists for violating the city&#x27;s plans for a pedestrian-friendly retail neighborhood. Since 2000, the Downtown Revitalization and Enhancement Association of Monroe (DREAM) has sponsored revitalization projects in downtown Monroe to preserve the city&#x27;s main street. More recent development in Monroe has been concentrated in the northern hills, which were annexed into the city in the 2000s.

The surrounding area includes hills and plateaus that were formed from glacial till and gravel deposits from the Skykomish River. Monroe also sits on a local fault line that produced a pair of minor earthquakes on July 12, 2019, that were felt as far as Seattle and Vancouver without causing damage.

===Climate===

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Monroe is located at the intersection of three highways: U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which travels eastward from Everett and over Stevens Pass to Eastern Washington; State Route 203, which follows the Snoqualmie River south towards Fall City and North Bend; State Route 522, an expressway which terminates in Monroe and connects the area to Seattle and Bothell to the southwest. Other major roads in Monroe include Main Street, which continues beyond the city limits towards Snohomish and Sultan; North Kelsey Street, which continues north to Chain Lake; and Fryelands Boulevard on the west edge of the city. US 2 through Monroe has routine traffic congestion issues that have resulted in plans for a highway bypass since the 1970s, but it remains unfunded.

The city is bisected by the Scenic Subdivision, a major railroad owned by BNSF Railway that is used for freight and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; passenger service. Public transit in Monroe is provided by the countywide Community Transit system, with two local bus routes traveling along the US 2 corridor between Everett and Gold Bar, with some trips during peak periods continuing to the Boeing Everett Factory. A commuter bus route from Snohomish to Downtown Seattle runs during peak periods on State Route 522 and Interstate 405, stopping at a park and ride lot in Monroe with 102 stalls. The route is planned to be truncated in 2025 to Bellevue Downtown station, where it will connect with the 2 Line of the Link light rail system. Snoqualmie Valley Transportation operates a daily shuttle service between Monroe and Duvall on weekdays.

Monroe also has a privately owned airfield, First Air Field, located adjacent to the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The single-runway facility handles an average of 50 takeoffs and landings per day and has 73 aircraft based there.

===Utilities===

The city&#x27;s public utilities are provided by the municipal government, regional agencies, and private companies. Electrical services in Monroe are provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The Snohomish County PUD delivers electricity to Monroe via a transmission corridor from their Snohomish substation to two substations in the city. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city&#x27;s residents and businesses using a pipeline from Canada. Telecommunications services, including telephones, cable television, and internet, are split between Verizon and Comcast. The city government has a waste disposal contract with Waste Management, which provides curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection.

The city government manages tap water and sewage services, which includes treatment and delivery. Monroe&#x27;s tap water is purchased from the City of Everett and sourced from Lake Chaplain in the Sultan River basin, which travels via a pipeline to the north of the city. Sewage and wastewater is collected and cleaned at a sewage treatment plant that discharges into the Skykomish River. The largest customer for the city&#x27;s water services is the Washington State Department of Corrections, which also has its own sewage treatment system.

===Health care===
Monroe has a 112-bed general hospital operated by EvergreenHealth and formerly known as the Valley General Hospital. It was opened in 1949, replacing a facility at the State Poor Farm, and was expanded several times with funds from voter-approved tax levies. It was merged into the EvergreenHealth system, based out of Kirkland, in 2014 and renamed to EvergreenHealth Monroe Medical Center the following year. The city also has several small medical clinics, including those operated by Providence Health &amp; Services and SeaMar Community Health Centers.

<text>Mountlake Terrace is a suburban city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to Shoreline and Lynnwood, and is north of Seattle. The city had a population of 19,909 people counted in the 2010 census.

Mountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by real estate developers on the site of a disused airfield, intending to provide low-cost housing for veterans. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was incorporated as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. An industrial park was developed at the northwest corner of the city, which was connected by Interstate 5 after it opened in 1965. Mountlake Terrace originally had several small shopping centers that declined due to the local economy and a pair of arsons in 1990.

The city government began developing a downtown revitalization plan with mixed-use buildings in the 2000s, with hopes of growing beyond a bedroom community for Seattle commuters. Mountlake Terrace station, a major bus hub, opened in 2009 and is also served by Link light rail service, which began in 2024. The city has several parks, including access to Lake Ballinger, and hosts an annual summer festival that is part of Seafair.

==History==
The southwestern region of Snohomish County was originally inhabited by the Snohomish people, who primarily settled along the Puget Sound and used inland areas for seasonal hunting and foraging. In 1862, Puget Mill Company acquired in the newly-formed county, including the thickly-forested plateau where modern-day Mountlake Terrace sits and the adjacent Lake McAleer. The land was logged by 1900 and was later subdivided into chicken ranches, which were sold to farmers. Judge Richard A. Ballinger purchased Lake McAleer in 1901 and renamed it to Lake Ballinger for his father, later leaving the area to become Seattle mayor. The Nile Shrine of Seattle purchased on the east side of the lake in 1927, building a clubhouse and later a private golf course.

An interurban railway between Everett and Seattle opened in 1910, improving access from the farms to various markets. Many of these small farms failed during the Great Depression and were affected by the closure of the interurban in 1939, following the completion of Highway 99. The area remained home to chicken and mink farms well into the 1950s, while areas to the south underwent suburban development.

===Development and incorporation===

A landing field was built on the north side of the King–Snohomish county line by the federal government for use during World War II. It was abandoned after the war, despite plans to expand it for civilian aviation, and acquired by real estate developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson in 1949. LaPierre and Peterson named the property &quot;Mountlake Terrace&quot; for its plateau-like setting with views of Lake Washington and Mount Rainier, and sought to develop a low-income bedroom community for returning veterans. Construction on the first 250 homes began in June 1949, using a simple floorplan with two bedrooms and basic amenities. The cinderblock homes were built in an assembly line, taking several weeks to complete and leaving landscaping and interior painting to the owners. The homes were initially priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to $ in dollars) and sold quickly, requiring expansion beyond the initial subdivision.

Mountlake Terrace was one of the first large-scale suburban developments in the Pacific Northwest, becoming the second-largest residential area in Snohomish County with 5,000 people by 1954. LaPierre and Peterson developed additional areas to the north and east of their initial subdivision, later adding larger homes that remained in an affordable price range for young families. A small shopping center opened on the south side of the county line, followed by a second in the modern-day Town Center in June 1954 with the area&#x27;s first supermarket. Mountlake Terrace remained an unincorporated area that was reliant on the county government for services, which were unable to cope with the rising population of the area. The telephone system used a party line shared between 10 homes, the water mains and septic tanks were prone to failure, and the community lacked protection due to their distance from the nearest sheriff&#x27;s precinct.

LaPierre and Peterson funded construction of a local fire station and provided a police radio to link community volunteers with the county sheriff in Everett, but response times for emergencies remained long. Patrick McMahan, a local firefighter, began organizing an incorporation campaign in 1953 after waiting a day for the sheriff to respond to an attempted burglary at his home. He first proposed an annexation into Edmonds at a city council meeting in June 1953, where he was rejected by the mayor but approached by a city councilmember who suggested incorporating as a separate city. An incorporation committee was formed by McMahan and other residents, including two attorneys, and collected 650 signatures for their petition to the county government.

The county commissioners scheduled an incorporation ballot measure and a concurrent city council election for November 23, 1954. An anti-incorporation bloc was formed by Mountlake Terrace residents who were opposed to increased taxes and potential costs that were previously covered by the county government. The vote ended 517–483 in favor of incorporating as a third-class city with a council–manager government and elected five councilmembers, including the wife of an anti-incorporation leader. The new city council convened the following day and appointed hardware store owner Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; Geiser as the first mayor of Mountlake Terrace. Geiser loaned $5 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to the city government to file an incorporation charter with the state government, which was issued on November 29 and delivered the following day. City manager Evan Peterson was hired from Bellevue and initially conducted city business from his car before renting an empty two-bedroom house to act as an interim city hall.

===Early growth===

Within a few years of incorporating, the city government had rebuilt most of Mountlake Terrace&#x27;s original roads, added of sidewalks, and begun work on a permanent water and sewer system. The early homes in the neighborhood were renovated and expanded with financial assistance from the Federal Housing Administration, which also encouraged neighborhood improvements. In 1955, the city annexed , bringing its population to over 5,400, opened its own post office, and established a police department with five full-time personnel. The Edmonds School District built several schools for the growing city, including Mountlake Terrace High School, which opened in September 1960.

Mountlake Terrace&#x27;s population increased by 50 percent within its first five years of incorporating and doubled between 1950 and 1960. LaPierre and Peterson donated land for the construction of several churches, including the St. Pius X Catholic Church, which held its first mass on June 22, 1955. In 1958, the city government signed agreements with the sewer districts of Edmonds and Ronald (now part of Shoreline) to form a &quot;Little Metro&quot; and share treatment facilities. The city also placed restrictions on relocated homes from Seattle later that year, following a surge of those displaced from the construction of Interstate 5, a major regional freeway that would later reach Mountlake Terrace.

In the early 1960s, a new industrial park was developed in Mountlake Terrace that attracted several companies, including electronics firm John Fluke Corporation, who moved 325 employees from Seattle in 1960. Several retailers and other small businesses opened at Mountlake Terrace&#x27;s shopping centers, including a pair facing each other at the intersection of 232nd Street Southwest and 56th Avenue West. The city passed a bond issue in 1961 to fund construction of a permanent city hall, which opened in October 1962 with of space for the city government, police department, and fire department. In 1964, Mountlake Terrace approved a bond issue solely for parks, which was later used to construct the Recreation Pavilion in 1968.

Interstate 5 opened on February 3, 1965, providing faster access from bedroom communities in Snohomish County to Seattle. On the same day, the adjacent area of Brier voted to be incorporated as a city, in part to prevent an annexation by Mountlake Terrace. The two cities later settled a dispute over sewer services that would allow Brier to use Mountlake Terrace&#x27;s system.

===Late 20th century===

The completion of the Boeing Everett Factory spurred continued population growth in the region, with Mountlake Terrace nearly doubling to over 16,000 residents by 1970. The prosperity was short-lived, however, as Boeing announced major layoffs after the collapse of the supersonic transport program, which caused a local recession. The city government had hoped to develop a standalone town center, but local businesses were unable to compete with the Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood, which opened in 1979 and drew away shoppers. Mountlake Terrace&#x27;s population declined slightly in the 1970s, resulting in the closure of some local schools and the post office. The number of housing units increased significantly through the construction of apartments and condominiums, but the average occupancy per household decreased. The city government had a budget deficit of $420,000 in 1979 (equivalent to $ in dollars) due to declines in revenue and its small sales tax base.

Fluke moved its headquarters in Everett in 1981 and was later replaced by Blue Cross, which moved from Seattle and became the largest employer in the city. The city government continued to encourage development of its industrial center on the northwest side of Interstate 5, including improvements to a freeway interchange and special zoning initiatives. The freeway project also included funding from the state government to improve city parks and sports fields as compensation for lost land at an elementary school in Melody Hill. A site at the southwest corner of the original subdivision with 14 homes and several small business was proposed for a hotel and commercial development that was later put on hold because of planning complications. The site was later revived in the late 1980s as Gateway Place, an office and retail complex that began construction in 1989.

Despite repeated decreases in spending, the city&#x27;s budget had a $1.3 million deficit (equivalent to $ in dollars) in 1989 due to increased administrative costs. A pair of arson fires in downtown Mountlake Terrace destroyed two shopping centers and caused $3 million in damage (equivalent to $ in dollars). As a result, one shopping center took 20 months to reopen and the other was closed permanently. The city government opposed the construction of a strip club in the 1990s and debated a comprehensive rezoning of the town center to support traditional retail and commercial uses. Mountlake Terrace rebuilt its high school in 1991 and opened a variety of recreational facilities by the end of the decade, including an indoor ice-skating rink and a section of the multi-use Interurban Trail, alongside plans for two casinos.

===21st century redevelopment===
The city government began planning for a redeveloped town center in the early 2000s, passing zoning regulations to spur the construction of mixed-use residential and commercial. The town center plan, which was adopted in 2007, allowed for building heights of up to seven stories, encouraged architectural variety, and required smaller setbacks from sidewalks. The changes were dependent on the construction of the Mountlake Terrace Transit Center, a major bus hub that opened in 2007 with a parking garage.

The first major project to use the new town center plan, a five-story apartment building with shops, was approved in 2010 and opened in 2013 as Arbor Village. Two more buildings were completed later in the decade, along with reconstruction of the city&#x27;s main street (56th Avenue West). An extension of Link light rail along Interstate 5, including a station at Mountlake Terrace Transit Center, was approved by voters in 2008 and opened in 2024. The light rail extension triggered an update to the town center in 2019 that would allow for building heights of 12 stories and encouraging walkable development with smaller blocks. A strip of land along Interstate 5 near the transit center, including the former Evergreen Elementary School, is being redeveloped into a three-building housing complex with 600 apartments and retail space that will open in stages from 2020 to 2026.

The city hall building was permanently closed on July 18, 2009, a year after a ceiling collapse in the city council chambers revealed structural issues and hidden asbestos. The city government temporarily relocated to various office spaces in the city before moving into an interim city hall at an office park. The building was demolished in 2010 and funding for a new city hall at the site was approved by voters in 2017 as the centerpiece of a civic campus adjacent to Veterans Memorial Park. The new city hall opened in September 2021 and cost $12.5 million to construct.

<doc id="138224" wikidata="Q1507307" url="?curid=138224" title="Mukilteo, Washington">
<text>Mukilteo ( ; ) is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located on Puget Sound between Edmonds and Everett, approximately north of Seattle. The city had a population of 20,254 at the 2010 census and an estimated 2019 population of 21,441.

The current site of downtown Mukilteo (also named Old Town) has been inhabited by the Snohomish people for at least 1,000 years before present. The Treaty of Point Elliott was signed in Mukilteo in 1855, opening the region to American settlement. A new town was founded at Mukilteo and served as the provisional county seat of Snohomish County in early 1861. The area remained a trading post for loggers and was home to other industries, but was overshadowed by Everett and grew slowly.

Mukilteo was used during World War II as an auxiliary fueling facility, due to its proximity to the newly built Snohomish County Airport (now Paine Field). Mukilteo was incorporated as a city in 1947 and saw new suburban development, which accelerated after the opening of the nearby Boeing Everett Factory in the late 1960s. The city annexed large suburban areas on the west side of Paine Field in the 1980s and 1990s, including Harbour Pointe and the State Route 525 corridor, while also revitalizing the Old Town area in the 2000s.

Today, Mukilteo is a bedroom community with a small job base centered around manufacturing industries. It is also a major transportation hub, with connections to Whidbey Island via the Washington State Ferries system, Sounder commuter trains to Seattle, and public transit services to nearby cities. The city is recognized for its quality of life and is one of the most affluent in Washington state, with a high median income.

==Etymology==

The name Mukilteo is derived from Lushootseed, the language of the Snohomish people and other Coast Salish tribes. The name for the area in Lushootseed is variously spelled as &quot;bəqɬtiuʔ&quot;, &quot;bəqɬtiyuʔ&quot;, &quot;bəkʷəɬtiu&quot;, and &quot;bək̓ʷəɬtiwʔ&quot;. It has been historically anglicized as Muckl-te-oh and Buk-wil-tee-whu, before finally being named Mukilteo. The etymology of is disputed. According to anthropologist T. T. Waterman&#x27;s sources from the Snohomish tribe and other written records, the name&#x27;s meaning was unclear. Other sources claim that the name means &quot;good camping ground&quot; or &quot;narrow passage&quot;.

==History==

===Establishment and early history===
The Snohomish people had a year-round village in the Mukilteo area for at least 600 years before the arrival of European and American explorers in the 19th century. Early artifacts uncovered during waterfront construction in the 2010s were carbon dated to 1,000 years before present.

The Vancouver Expedition, led by British explorer George Vancouver, visited the area on May 30, 1792, and landed at modern-day Mukilteo the following day. Lieutenant William Robert Broughton and botanist Archibald Menzies named the site &quot;Rose Point&quot; after the wild Nootka roses that grew along the shore. An American expedition led by Charles Wilkes in 1841 renamed the headland &quot;Point Elliott&quot; for Samuel Elliott, a midshipman.

After its 1853 establishment, the Washington territorial government looked to negotiate treaties with the local tribes of the Puget Sound region to secure land for settlement. On January 22, 1855, representatives from the territorial government and 82 local tribes signed the Treaty of Point Elliott, which ceded tribal territories in exchange for compensation, the establishment of Indian reservations, and access to traditional hunting and fishing areas. An American settlement at Point Elliott was established two years later by Morris H. Frost and J. D. Fowler, two merchants from New York. The two men established a store and saloon on the southwest side of Point Elliott, which was renamed to Mukilteo in 1860 by Fowler, using an anglicized name of the Lushootseed campsite.

Mukilteo was the area&#x27;s first trading post and served as the interim county seat of the newly created Snohomish County beginning January 14, 1861. In the first county elections on July 8, 1861, the county seat was moved to Cadyville (now Snohomish) by a 17–10 vote. Mukilteo remained the county&#x27;s only port and a major trading post for the Possession Sound region, and soon after received the county&#x27;s first post office and telegraph station. The town was relocated to another, more protected side of Point Elliott and supported the regional lumber industry, including regular shipments to Whidbey Island and a sawmill of its own. By the 1880s, it had also gained a brewery, a gunpowder plant, and the Puget Sound region&#x27;s first cannery. Mukilteo was planned to become the largest port on Possession Sound, with a summer resort accessible by steamship, but the efforts ceased after the establishment of nearby Everett by East Coast industrialists.

===Early 20th century===
The Seattle and Montana Railroad (later part of the Great Northern Railway) was completed in 1891, connecting Mukilteo with Everett, Edmonds, and Seattle. Mukilteo was platted in anticipation of the railroad and was on the shortlist of towns considered for the terminus of the Northern Pacific Railway, but lost out to Tacoma in 1873. Following the 1890s economic depression, the town experienced a major employment and population boom, with a larger lumber mill and gunpowder factory both built along the shore. The iconic Mukilteo Lighthouse was built in 1906 by the federal Lighthouse Service to serve the increased maritime traffic in the area.

Japanese immigrants arrived to work in Mukilteo&#x27;s mills after the turn of the century, establishing a Japantown in modern-day Japanese Gulch. Passenger ferry service between Mukilteo and Whidbey Island began in 1911 and was followed by the introduction of automobile ferry service in 1919. The town also gained a highway connection in 1914 with the completion of a road to Everett, later named Mukilteo Boulevard by the 1920s. Until the closure of the lumber mill in 1930, Mukilteo was a company town that relied on the Crown Lumber Company to assist in civic endeavors, including its parks, fire department, and water district; at its peak, it employed 250 men.

During the Prohibition Era, Mukilteo became a major transiting point for rum-running and was a stopover for smugglers transporting alcohol from British Columbia to Seattle. The town&#x27;s gunpowder plant was destroyed on September 17, 1930, in an after-hours explosion that leveled or damaged dozens of homes, causing $500,000 in damage. It was felt as far as downtown Everett and injured eight people, but none were killed. On August 30, 1938, the vacant lumber mill was destroyed in a fire during dismantling work. The fire came weeks after a mail ferry rammed into the town&#x27;s wharf, which was destroyed in the collision.

After the United States entered World War II, the site of the former lumber mill was acquired by the federal government and rebuilt as a ammunition loading dock for warships. The recently built Snohomish County Airport (later renamed Paine Field) southeast of the city was converted into a military base while retaining some civilian uses, including passenger service provided by Alaska Airlines. During the early 1950s, the loading dock was expanded with ten large storage tanks that were used to store jet fuel for military planes until 1989.

===Incorporation and late 20th century===
On April 29, 1947, Mukilteo residents voted 223 to 137 in favor of incorporating as a fourth-class city and elected school administrator Alfred Tunem as its first mayor. The incorporation was certified by the state government on May 8; at the time, Mukilteo had an estimated population of 775 people and encompassed . The new municipal government took over services that were previously handled by the self-organized Mukilteo Improvement Club, which was established in the 1930s. The area experienced additional population and commercial growth after the opening of Boeing&#x27;s Paine Field factory for passenger jetliners in 1967, which was connected to Mukilteo by a short railroad along the floor of Japanese Gulch. The Boeing Freeway was opened in 1969, linking southern Mukilteo and the Boeing plant to a junction with Interstate 5 near the newly built Everett Mall.

Mukilteo completed its first major annexation in November 1980, adding 2,500 people living on to the south along State Route 525. This annexation nearly tripled the city&#x27;s population and doubled its land area. Additional annexations and natural growth by the end of the decade brought the city&#x27;s population to 6,000. The annexation of the large Harbour Pointe community was completed in 1991 and doubled the city&#x27;s size to . A competing proposal had sought to incorporate the planned community into a new city of 24,000 people, tentatively named Highland Bay, but residents supported annexation as a mutually agreeable option to reduce their taxes and benefit from city services. The annexation was also influenced by the county government&#x27;s plans to allow passenger flights from Paine Field, which residents in Mukilteo and Harbour Pointe opposed alongside other nearby cities. The county ultimately withdrew their proposal to introduce passenger flights.

Several parties that opposed the annexation, including the county fire district, withdrew their complaints and allowed Mukilteo to annex Harbour Pointe on March 26, 1991. The annexation added 4,779 residents and to Mukilteo, doubling the city&#x27;s population to 6,662 and size to . It required the construction of two new fire stations, three schools, and a new city hall to house new employees. Kamiak High School was built in the Harbour Pointe area and opened in 1993 to serve Mukilteo, which had outgrown Mariner High School, and featured a technology-oriented curriculum. The full build-out of Harbour Pointe increased the city&#x27;s population to over 18,000 by 2000, a 1,164 percent increase from 1980. The geographic and commercial center of Mukilteo was shifted further south towards Harbour Pointe, leading to cultural clashes with residents of older neighborhoods.

===21st century===
An agreement to transfer ownership of the Mukilteo Lighthouse from the U.S. Coast Guard to the city government was signed in 1999 after a decade of partial use as a museum by the local historical society. The changeover was made on August 19, 2001, with the Coast Guard retaining use of the working lights and the city government planning rehabilitation work to support the building&#x27;s use as a tourist landmark. The adjacent Mukilteo State Park was transferred to the city government in February 2003, following an offer from the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission to donate the park in order to stave off a budget shortfall. The new city park, named Mukilteo Lighthouse Park, underwent $6.6 million in renovations that were completed in 2008 to add a playground and other park amenities.

The decommissioned fuel storage tank complex on the city&#x27;s waterfront was identified for potential redevelopment in the 1990s, including use for a new ferry terminal. The Port of Everett led environmental cleanup of the site and constructed a new pier to transport large airplane sections for the Boeing 787 project, replacing the existing pier. The cleanup was completed in late 2006 after several delays due to the discovery of Indian artifacts that triggered an archaeological investigation. The existing pier was demolished in 2015 to make way for the new ferry terminal, which opened on December 29, 2020. The new terminal includes connections to an adjacent commuter rail station, which opened in 2008 and was expanded in 2016 by Sound Transit.

A research station for the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (part of NOAA) on the tank farm site was closed in 2020 and planned to be demolished in 2020 until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic halted work. A project to build a new facility by 2022 was cancelled in March 2021 after NOAA received no bids below $40 million, which had been appropriated by the U.S. Congress; ownership of the property is expected to revert to the Port of Everett, which NOAA took over ownership from in 2001. The city government and Port of Everett has long-term plans to redevelop of space around the old ferry terminal and NOAA facility into a walkable neighborhood with a waterfront promenade and trails.

On July 30, 2016, a mass shooting occurred at a house party in the Chennault Beach neighborhood of Mukilteo, around midnight. Three people were killed using an AR-15 style rifle and another was left with serious injuries. The perpetrator, a graduate of Kamiak High School, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Mukilteo shooting—along with other high-profile mass shootings during the 2010s—was cited as the inspiration for an assault weapons restriction that was rejected by the state legislature and passed by voters in 2018 as Initiative 1639. In February 2018, an Everett resident was arrested prior to a planned school shooting that would have targeted ACES Alternative High or Kamiak High School.

==Geography==
Mukilteo is located in southwestern Snohomish County, approximately north of Seattle. The city generally runs north–south, with a length of and a width of . It is bordered to the west by the Possession Sound, a section of the Puget Sound, and to the north by Port Gardner Bay. Mukilteo&#x27;s eastern border with Everett is defined by 44th Avenue and Japanese Gulch until it reaches State Route 526. From there, the city&#x27;s eastern boundary continues along State Route 525 along the west side of Paine Field in unincorporated Snohomish County. Mukilteo&#x27;s southern border, also facing unincorporated neighborhoods, is defined by Beverly Park Road, the Picnic Point Ravine, and Hulk Creek, which drains into Possession Sound.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Mukilteo also has a designated urban growth area that extends south to 148th Street Southwest, bordering Lynnwood, and east to State Route 99. An advisory vote on whether to annex the entire urban growth area (with a population of 11,000 people) was rejected by city voters in 2010.

The majority of Mukilteo is located on a plateau overlooking Possession Sound and the Olympic Mountains to the west and Port Gardner Bay to the north. A major railroad runs along the shore, which is situated below a set of tall bluffs that are divided by ravines and gulches along several creeks. The bluffs were formed approximately 5,000 years before present and eroded away over time to form beaches and Point Elliott itself. The city has several recognized drainage basins, including Japanese Gulch, Big Gulch, the Chennault Ravines, and Picnic Point Gulch. Mukilteo is also traversed from northwest to southeast by the Southern Whidbey Island Fault, a shallow earthquake fault zone discovered in 1996.

===Neighborhoods===
With the exception of Old Town Mukilteo, the city is divided into several large neighborhoods that are named for various developed subdivisions that were annexed in the late 20th century. Among these subdivision neighborhoods are Chennault Beach, Harbour Pointe, Olympus Terrace, and Picnic Point. Mukilteo&#x27;s urban growth area includes the neighborhoods of Lake Serene, Meadowdale, and Lake Stickney.

Old Town Mukilteo is located at the north end of the city, between Port Gardner Bay and 5th Street (Mukilteo Boulevard). The city&#x27;s landmark lighthouse is located on Point Elliott at the northwest corner of Old Town, adjacent to the Washington State Ferries terminal and commuter train station. The waterfront&#x27;s sole connection to the rest of Mukilteo is via the Mukilteo Speedway (State Route 525), which also serves ferry traffic; a second street, Mukilteo Lane, was closed in 2008 after severe erosion was discovered along the road.

Mukilteo&#x27;s largest neighborhood is Harbour Pointe, located on in the south-central part of the city between Possession Sound and State Route 525. It is bordered to the south by South Gulch and Picnic Point and to the north by Big Gulch and Olympus Terrace. The site was originally owned by the Port Gamble Lumber Company and was sold to Standard Oil in 1952 as part of a plan to build an oil refinery at Picnic Point. After protests over a similar proposal for Kayak Point in the 1960s, Standard Oil abandoned plans to build refineries in Snohomish County and turned over the Picnic Point site to the county government and private real estate developers. Development of Harbour Pointe began in 1978 and its first phase was completed in 1989 with the opening of the neighborhood&#x27;s golf course. A public marina was proposed for the development&#x27;s Chenault Beach section in 1983, but was rejected due to concerns from fisheries officials over potential impacts on Indian fishing. Harbour Pointe was annexed by Mukilteo in 1991 and is now home to Kamiak High School, the city library, and a large industrial district.

===Climate===

Mukilteo has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. On average, the area gets of annual precipitation, spread over approximately seven months. Mukilteo lies within the Puget Sound Convergence Zone, a local weather phenomenon that affects areas of Snohomish County.

==Economy==

Mukilteo is primarily a bedroom community, with a concentration of employers at an industrial park near Harbour Pointe and several small office parks. The Puget Sound Regional Council estimated that the city had a total of 10,557 jobs , with the largest share in the manufacturing and services sectors. The largest employer in Mukilteo is the Mukilteo School District, followed by the Boeing Technical Center in Harbour Pointe, with over 1,200 employees. Mukilteo also has several companies that are headquartered or based in the city, including aerospace equipment manufacturing firm Electroimpact, audio equipment manufacturer Rane, furniture manufacturer Kaas Tailored, laser manufacturer Synrad, and stovemaker Travis Industries.

, Mukilteo has an estimated workforce population of 16,935 and an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent. Under 7 percent of the city&#x27;s workers have jobs located within Mukilteo city limits, with the majority commuting to employers in other cities. Over 26 percent of workers commute to Everett, home to the Boeing Assembly Plant and the county government. An estimated 19 percent travel to Seattle, 6 percent to Bellevue, and 5 percent to Lynnwood.

==Demographics==
Mukilteo is the ninth largest city in Snohomish County, with a population of 21,538 at the time of the 2020 census. The city has a significant population of Asian American residents, which began growing in the late 1980s.

Mukilteo rose to ninth place in the magazine&#x27;s 2011 list, becoming the only West Coast city in the top 10. Mukilteo was previously recognized in 2006 by &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine as one of the best affordable suburbs due to lower housing prices compared to King County cities and its low crime rate.

==Government and politics==
The City of Mukilteo operates as a non-charter code city with a mayor–council government, consisting of a mayor and a seven-member city council who are elected to four-year terms. Elections for the at-large positions are held in odd-numbered years and conducted in a nonpartisan manner, with city council seats staggered for a maximum of four seats per election. Former two-term mayor Joe Marine was re-elected to a third term as mayor in 2021, defeating former city councilwoman and two-term mayor Jennifer Gregerson, who defeated him in 2013; Marine had served as mayor since 2006. Management of the city government was also delegated to a full-time city administrator until the position was eliminated in 2014. A proposal to create the position of city manager and change to a council–manager form of government was rejected by voters in the November 2019 elections.

The city government has 113 full-time employees and operated in 2016 on a budget of $32 million that is predominantly funded by sales taxes. , the combined sales tax rate in Mukilteo is 10.6 percent, tied for the highest in Washington. Mukilteo maintains its own police and fire services, as well as departments for recreation, planning, and public works. Other services, including utilities, garbage collection, public transportation, and the library, are contracted to regional agencies and organizations. Mukilteo&#x27;s city hall is located in Harbour Pointe and was constructed in 2008, costing $8.5 million and integrating recycled materials and other environmentally friendly features. The city hall was formerly housed at the Rosehill Community Center in Old Town and was temporarily moved to a leased Harbour Pointe warehouse in 1992 to accommodate more employees. After initially approving a site near the Rosehill Center in Old Town, the city government chose the Harbour Pointe site in 2006 as a compromise between disagreeing factions of the city council.

At the federal level, Mukilteo has been part of the 2nd congressional district since 2012 and is represented by Democrat Rick Larsen. The district includes most of western Snohomish County along with Island, Skagit, and Whatcom counties. Prior to post-census redistricting in 2012, Mukilteo was part of the 1st congressional district. At the state level, the city and Edmonds comprise the 21st legislative district, which also includes unincorporated areas north of Lynnwood. Mukilteo is wholly part of the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 2nd district, which also covers Everett and the Tulalip Indian Reservation.

The city&#x27;s main annual festival is the three-day Mukilteo Lighthouse Festival, held at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park in late August or early September. It was established in 1965 and features a parade, fireworks, a fishing derby, and fun runs. The city also organizes a farmers&#x27; market at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park that runs on weekends during the summer months; the 2019 season of the farmers&#x27; market was canceled due to a shortage of volunteers and a declined request for city officials to take over the event.

===Parks and recreation===
Mukilteo has of total open space, including of public parks and of privately owned open spaces, that occupy 13 percent of the city&#x27;s total land area. The city&#x27;s largest open spaces are conservation areas in the Big Gulch and Japanese Gulch drainage basins. Mukilteo&#x27;s parks are maintained by a city department that is also tasked with organizing recreational programs for citizens; it was funded by a 1996 ballot measure that was approved by voters. In addition to city-owned parks and public spaces, Mukilteo is also located near Picnic Point Park, a county park along Puget Sound southwest of Harbour Pointe.

The Old Town neighborhood has several of the city&#x27;s major parks, including Mukilteo Lighthouse Park, a former state park that was acquired by Mukilteo in 2003 and is the city&#x27;s most-used park facility. The park includes a beach, boat launch, playground, and picnic areas. To the southeast of the waterfront park is the Rosehill Community Center, the city&#x27;s main multi-purpose recreation center. It was built in 2011 to replace the existing community center, a former school that opened in 1928 and was re-purposed for various uses between the 1970s and its demolition in 2010.

The Japanese Gulch conservation area, located between Old Town and Paine Field, is the most-used natural area in Mukilteo. The area is predominately forests and wetlands that are home to a variety of birds, as well as salmon, deer, and mountain beavers. It has several hiking trails that were developed by Japanese immigrants who settled in the gulch in the early 20th century. The city government acquired land in the gulch in stages between 1996 and 2014. A park with dirt tracks for BMX bikes was opened at the southwest end of Japanese Gulch in 2024.

===Media===

Mukilteo&#x27;s public library is operated by the inter-county Sno-Isle Libraries system and is located in Harbour Pointe. It was opened on July 27, 1998, after the city&#x27;s voters approved an annexation into the library system with a $2.8 million bond in 1996. Mukilteo&#x27;s original library opened on October 19, 1963, replacing an earlier bookmobile that was run by one of Sno-Isle&#x27;s predecessors until the city was incorporated. It closed on December 31, 1994, due to budget cuts and the defeat of a city levy to fund its operations. Prior to its formal annexation into the Sno-Isle system in 1996, Mukilteo had also considered contracting with a private library operator or joining the Everett Public Library system.

The city&#x27;s main newspaper is the &quot;Mukilteo Beacon&quot;, a weekly publication first issued on July 22, 1992; it has sister papers in Edmonds and Mill Creek. Mukilteo is also covered by &quot;The Everett Herald&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, the region&#x27;s daily newspapers.

It serves a population of 93,222, or nearly quintuple the city population, across and has a student enrollment of approximately 15,000. Seven of the district&#x27;s 24 schools are located within Mukilteo city limits, including Kamiak High School, two middle schools, and four elementary schools. Kamiak High School opened in 1993 to relieve the overcrowded Mariner High School and boasts a high student graduation rate of 94 percent.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Downtown Mukilteo is a multimodal transportation hub that is served by state highways, ferries, commuter trains, and buses. The city is bisected from north to south by State Route 525, also known as the Mukilteo Speedway, which connects the downtown ferry terminal to Harbour Pointe, State Route 99, and Interstate 5. State Route 526 (the Boeing Freeway) travels from west to east and provides direct connections to the Boeing Everett Factory and Interstate 5. Other major roads include Mukilteo Boulevard, which connects the city to Everett, and Harbour Pointe Boulevard, which encircles the eponymous neighborhood and golf course.

State Route 525 continues north from Mukilteo to Whidbey Island on the Clinton ferry, which is operated by Washington State Ferries. The Clinton–Mukilteo ferry route is the state&#x27;s busiest for automobiles and second-busiest overall, carrying 4 million passengers and 2.2 million vehicles annually. The Mukilteo ferry terminal was built in 1952 and was replaced with a new terminal, which began construction in 2018 and opened on December 29, 2020.

The city is also served by three public transportation agencies: Sound Transit, which runs Sounder commuter trains from Mukilteo station to Seattle during peak periods on weekdays; and local buses operated by Community Transit and Everett Transit. Community Transit&#x27;s buses include local routes connecting Mukilteo and Harbour Pointe to Lynnwood and the Boeing Everett Factory. Until 2024, it also ran direct express buses to Downtown Seattle. Everett Transit operates a single route in Mukilteo, connecting downtown and the ferry terminal to Everett via Mukilteo Boulevard. Mukilteo is the largest city in Snohomish County without a dedicated park and ride facility for Community Transit.

Paine Field is located southeast of Mukilteo and serves the Boeing Everett Factory, as well as general aviation and passenger flights, which resumed in 2019. The passenger terminal and general aviation facilities are located on the east side of the airport, facing Everett, while the west side in Mukilteo has two museums, the Future of Flight Aviation Center (which includes a tour of the Boeing factory) and the Historic Flight Foundation. The Mukilteo city government has opposed the airport&#x27;s use for passenger flights since the 1990s, citing concerns about noise pollution and traffic congestion.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Mukilteo is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city&#x27;s residents and businesses. The city government also contracts with Waste Management and Rubatino Refuse Removal for curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection and disposal.

Mukilteo&#x27;s tap water and sewage systems are managed by the Mukilteo Water and Wastewater District and the Alderwood Water District, two independent municipal corporations. The Mukilteo district, founded in 1920, serves most of the city and part of south Everett; the Alderwood district extends into Edmonds and Lynnwood. The city government formerly operated its own sewage treatment plant and the wastewater system until contracting in the 1990s with the Olympus Terrace Sewer District, which was merged into the Mukilteo district in 2007. The Big Gulch Wastewater Plant near Harbour Pointe was opened in 1970 and now serves as the main outflow from Mukilteo and the rest of the water district.

A major submarine communications cable system named Pacific Crossing (operated by TE Connectivity) uses fiber-optic cables that travel from Mukilteo and Grover Beach, California, to the Japanese cities of Hitachinaka and Shima. The cable&#x27;s switching center is in Harbour Pointe and provides 80 gigabyte per second for data transfers.

===Health care===

Mukilteo is located near two general hospitals: the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett and Swedish Edmonds Hospital in Edmonds.

<text>North Creek is an unincorporated community, formerly a census-designated place (CDP), in Snohomish County, Washington. Part of the community lies within the city limits of Bothell.

In 2010, the North Creek CDP was retired. The southeastern portion went to Maltby, the northeastern portion went to newly formed Clearview, the northern portion went to Martha Lake and newly formed Mill Creek East, and the western portion went to newly formed Bothell West and Bothell East.

North Creek High School is located in the community and opened in the fall of 2017.

==Incorporation==
On February 2, 1993, a special election was held to consider incorporating the North Creek community into a city. The measure failed 1,341 votes in support to 1,927 votes in opposition. Since that time, the community has grown in population, acting as a bedroom community to the nearby well-established city centers and growing business parks. North Creek remains one of the largest unincorporated communities in the county, despite its large population and commercial core.

==Geography==
The creek itself is a 12.6-mile-long creek that originates near the Everett Mall and flows southward through Snohomish County and northern King County. The North Creek community is located along the southern portion of North Creek, just north of the creek&#x27;s mouth at the Sammamish River in Bothell. The community also contains North Creek Park, a county park that features urban wetlands through which the creek flows.

<text>Priest Point is a residential area within the Tulalip Indian Reservation in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It was a census-designated place (CDP) during the 2000 census with a population of 779. The CDP was discontinued at the 2010 census.

==History==

The Snohomish people had a village at Rocky Point () that was primarily used for temporary dwellings outside of the rainy months; it was across the mouth of the Snohomish River from the more prominent village of at modern-day Preston Point in Everett. The site was partially excavated in 2001 following the discovery of human remains during construction. Rocky Point was part of the Tulalip Indian Reservation when it was established following the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott, in which the Snohomish ceded most of their lands.

The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a French Catholic missionary congregation, established a residential school for indigenous children on the Tulalip Reservation in 1857. Father Eugene Casimir Chirouse chose a site at Rocky Point, which was renamed Priest Point, and a log house was constructed for the Mission of St. Anne&#x27;s. It was moved to a new hillside location on modern-day Meridian Avenue with an adjacent cemetery. The residential school received federal funding and remained at Priest Point until it was destroyed by a fire in 1902 and replaced by a new campus near Mission Beach. Approximately two dozen unmarked graves at the Priest Point Cemetery have the remains of children who died at the residential school.

<doc id="138237" wikidata="Q1511504" url="?curid=138237" title="Smokey Point, Washington">
<text>Smokey Point is a community and former census-designated place in northern Snohomish County, Washington. The area, developed as a suburban bedroom community in the late 20th century, was annexed into the nearby cities of Arlington and Marysville in the 1990s and 2000s.

==History==

Smokey Point was settled in the early 20th century and was originally known as “Hild’s Corner”, then later referred to as Rex’s Corner, named in the 1930s after Rex and Mabel Zeek, the owners of a restaurant located at U.S. Route 99 and Lakewood Road (present-day Smokey Point Boulevard and 172nd Street NE, respective). The restaurant was sold to Eric and Pearl Shurstad in October 1946, who renovated it to a barbecue restaurant and renamed it the &quot;Smokey Point Café&quot;. U.S. Route 99 was bypassed by Interstate 5 in the late 1960s, constructing an interchange at Smokey Point and creating the Gissberg Ponds (now Twin Lakes) out of a gravel excavation site.

In 1966, the area was proposed as the location of a four-year public college, with offered by the city of Arlington. The state legislature decided to build the college instead in Olympia, becoming The Evergreen State College.

By 1977, the population of the unincorporated area between Arlington and Marysville, including Smokey Point, had increased to 16,000 people as the result of suburban development. The area&#x27;s first supermarket opened in 1978 alongside an office park and motel. In 1979, the Snohomish County Sherriff&#x27;s Office established a precinct in Smokey Point at an existing fire station. Smokey Point&#x27;s largest retail center, a 15-store strip mall with a Safeway, opened in 1991.

By the early 1990s, Smokey Point was rezoned to support industrial development to offset a regional shortage of affordable land for industrial use. After the opening of a new naval base in Everett in 1994, the U.S. Navy selected Smokey Point to house a support complex with a commissary, offices and a college. The support complex broke ground in 1993 and opened in 1995.

The Puget Sound Regional Council explored the expansion of Arlington Municipal Airport into a regional airport in the 1990s to relieve Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, but decided instead to build a third runway at Sea-Tac because of existing traffic and local opposition. In September 2004, Marysville won a bid to build a NASCAR racetrack (to be operated by the International Speedway Corporation) south of Smokey Point. The project was cancelled two months later after concerns about traffic impacts, environmental conditions, and $70 million in required transportation improvements arose. The NASCAR site was later pitched as a candidate for a new University of Washington satellite campus (known as UW North Sound) in the late 2000s, competing with downtown Everett, before the project was put on hold in 2008 and cancelled in 2011.

===Annexation dispute===
In the early 1990s, after a controversial land-use was proposed for the area, several property owners began an effort to petition the City of Arlington to annex a large portion of the Smokey Point community. Around the same time, another group of property owners began an effort to annex much of the same territory into the City of Marysville. The group working on annexing into Arlington was able to reach the required 60% assessed value threshold first, enabling their annexation to move forward.

The City of Marysville, having a vested interest by being the sewer and water utility provider for the area and having an interest in annexing Smokey Point, challenged the annexation, along with the residential community whose property was added to the annexation boundaries by the state Boundary Review Board for Snohomish County.

At that time, there was a single Arlington-Smokey Point-Marysville Urban Growth Boundary, causing confusion as to what city could potentially annex which area of Smokey Point. After many meetings with Snohomish County officials, the two cities ended up with separate urban growth boundaries for future annexation. Arlington was given the northeast portion of Smokey Point; Marysville was given the western and southern portions. However, when this proposal was presented to the local community, there was overwhelming opposition, as the community desired to have their entire community be annexed into one city, not split between two. The County Council had the final say and approved the territory divisions.

To further complicate things, there was a little-known state law on the books that would have transitioned the annexed territory from the Lakewood School District that served Smokey Point to the school district of the annexing city. Being that nearly all of the commercial area of Smokey Point was petitioned to be annexed into Arlington, the loss of such a tax base would have been devastating to the Lakewood School District. Local residents in Smokey Point and Lakewood also circulated petitions to incorporate the area as a separate city to preserve the school district&#x27;s taxing base.

Because of these issues, local residents in the area formed a group called Save Our Community and Schools (SOCS). SOCS worked tirelessly with their local state representatives to change the law to protect the Lakewood School District. Those efforts were successful, and the Lakewood School District remains intact today.

After receiving much input from the local community with the desire to keep their community intact, SOCS filed a Notice of Intent for Incorporation, which would create the City of Smokey Point-Lakewood. The proposal was put on hold, however, since state law mandated that incorporations cannot occur while an annexation involving land in the same area is still pending.

After years of controversial court battles, lawsuits, redrawn boundaries, and strong opposition by the residential community, the annexation question was finally resolved in 1999, when the City of Arlington annexed the northeast portion of Smokey Point. The actual land annexed was but a small percentage of the originally-petitioned area, due to the redrawn urban growth boundaries. As a result of the annexation, the effort to keep the Smokey Point community intact ended, along with the hopes of incorporation. As expected, in the years since then, the southern and western portions of Smokey Point have been annexed into the City of Marysville.

===Commercial growth===
There has been substantial commercial growth in Smokey Point. The western side of Smokey Point (within the City of Marysville) has received much of this growth. In late 2006, the commercial area called &quot;Lakewood Crossing&quot; opened, just west of the Interstate 5 exit to Smokey Point (exit 206).

A stretch of Smokey Point Boulevard was developed into an auto row in the late 2010s, with several car dealerships relocating from Marysville. Plans for a major industrial center in the neighborhood were formed in the 1990s and 2000s by the cities of Arlington and Marysville. The Cascade Industrial Center was established in 2019 and designates near Smokey Point for industrial and manufacturing uses. Several industrial warehouses were constructed in the early 2020s, including an Amazon distribution center, a Tesla warehouse, and a Frito-Lay distribution center.

<text>Snohomish () is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 10,126 at the 2020 census. It is located on the Snohomish River, southeast of Everett and northwest of Monroe. Snohomish lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 2 and State Route 9. The city&#x27;s airport, Harvey Airfield, is located south of downtown and used primarily for general aviation.

The city was founded in 1859 and named Cadyville after pioneer settler E. F. Cady and renamed to Snohomish in 1871. It served as county seat of Snohomish County from 1861 to 1897, when the county government was relocated to Everett. Snohomish has a downtown district that is renowned for its collection of antique shops and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

The Snohomish River Valley was originally inhabited by the Snohomish people, a Coast Salish tribe who lived between Port Gardner Bay and modern-day Monroe. An archaeological site near the confluence of the Snohomish and Pilchuck Rivers has indications of human habitation that began as early as 8,000 years before present. A village, &quot;sbadaʔɬ&quot;, was at the site of the modern-day city that now bears the tribe&#x27;s name. The Snohomish had contact with white explorers in the early 19th century, with their name recorded as &quot;Sinnahamis&quot; by John Work of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, among the first to also use the name to describe the river. The Snohomish were signatories of the Point Elliott Treaty in 1855, which relocated the tribe to the Tulalip Indian Reservation.

In the early 1850s, the territorial government planned to construct a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, with a ferry crossing of the Snohomish River at Kwehtlamanish, a winter village of the Snohomish people. The road, proposed in the wake of the Pig War, was intended to be built far enough inland to be safe from British naval attacks. The confluence of the Snohomish and Pilchuck rivers, located near Kwehtlamanish, was sought by several American settlers from Steilacoom who arrived in 1859 to file homestead claims. Edson F. Cady and Heil Barnes, representing carpenter Emory C. Ferguson, settled near the proposed ferry landing, while Egbert H. Tucker filed a claim for a plot on the other side of the Snohomish River. The settlement was originally known as &quot;Cadyville&quot; and changed its name to Snohomish City in 1871. The name &quot;Snohomish&quot; comes from the name of the dominant local Native American tribe &quot;sdoh-doh-hohbsh&quot; (), whose meaning is widely disputed.

Although the military road was never completed, Snohomish quickly became a center of commerce in the expanding region. In 1861, Snohomish County separated from Island County and the Village of Snohomish was voted the county seat. The first school in the settlement was organized in 1867 or 1867. Snohomish was incorporated as a town in 1888 and re-incorporated as a city in 1890 after Washington had achieved statehood. The first class graduated from Snohomish High School in 1894. The city lost its status as county seat in 1897, when the government relocated to the larger, yet much newer neighboring city of Everett after a controversial and contested county-wide vote.

By 1899, Snohomish had 2,000 residents, 25 businesses, and 80 homes. After First Street was paved with brick in 1903, a three-day celebration was held by residents to mark the occasion. The city&#x27;s first public library was opened in 1910 with funds from industrialist Andrew Carnegie; the Snohomish Carnegie Building, the oldest public building in the city, remained in use as a library until it was replaced by a modern building at a different site in 2003. On May 30, 1911, a major fire struck First Street and destroyed one block of buildings between Avenues B and C, affecting 35 businesses. It caused $170,000 in damage and prompted much of downtown to be rebuilt with brick. The population of Snohomish grew to over 3,000 in 1920 and remained relatively stable for the next 40 years. The city was connected to Everett by an interurban railway that ceased operations in 1921 after a trestle was damaged during a major flood.

The Great Depression was not acutely felt in Snohomish due to its primarily agrarian economy. One of the area&#x27;s largest employers, the Bickford Ford car dealership, was founded in 1934 and flourished. The 1930s brought Snohomish national notice as the hometown of baseball star Earl Averill, the first Washingtonian elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Averill played from 1929 to 1941, mostly with the Cleveland Indians. An airport, named Harvey Airfield, was built south of downtown Snohomish by a local family and remains privately operated.

By the 1960s, Snohomish had entered a period of urban decay and investigated potential urban renewal plans to revitalize downtown. A plan presented in 1965 to demolish the south side of First Street and remodel existing buildings was opposed by residents and ultimately not realized due to a lack of funding. Several abandoned buildings on the south side were demolished for a riverfront park, while the city began annexing areas to the north of downtown Snohomish. In 1973, the city established a 26-block historic district and adopted design ordinances to retain historic buildings and encourage new construction in the same style. The Snohomish Historic Business District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Larger stores moved away from First Street into newer developments and strip malls that spread out along Second Street and Avenue D.

In 1974 the Seattle-Snohomish mill was gutted by fire and rebuilt by its owners. In 1975 a severe flood struck the area, damaging over 300 homes and killing 3,500 head of livestock, but the community rallied to support those who were affected. In 1985, U.S. Route 2 was rerouted around Snohomish on a bypass, which relieved downtown of chronic traffic congestion. In the 1990s, First Street was redeveloped to encourage tourism to the historic district. Sidewalks were rebuilt and public restrooms added, while the city hall and police station were moved away from First Street.

==Geography==

Snohomish is located along the north bank of the Snohomish River near where it is joined by the Pilchuck River. The city lies on the Getchell Hill Plateau, a low hill in the Snohomish River Valley that interrupts the wide, flat river valley. Some neighborhoods of the city are on a ridge that is west of the Pilchuck River, as well as Dutch Hill on the opposite bank. Blackmans Lake (formerly Stillaguamish Lake) is located north of downtown Snohomish and has a boat launch maintained by the city government. The river valley was formed approximately 14,000 years before present by the outflow of a glacial lake during the Vashon Glaciation event. The river itself floods during the winter season, occasionally breaching the dikes in Downtown Snohomish.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Snohomish&#x27;s city limits are generally defined by the Snohomish River to the south, Fobes Hill to the west, several city streets to the north, and the Pilchuck River to the east. The city also has an urban growth area that extends north towards U.S. Route 2 and south of the Snohomish River to include Harvey Airfield.

The historic business and residential center of the town constitutes the Snohomish Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Many houses bear plaques with the year the house was built and the name of the people who originally occupied it. Each year the city gives tours of the historic houses; one of them, the Blackman House, is a year-round museum.

==Government and politics==

Snohomish is a noncharter code city that has a strong mayor–council government, with an elected mayor and an elected city council. The seven part-time city councilmembers are elected at-large to four-year terms that are staggered, with odd years for elections. The city operated under a council–manager government from 1971 to 2017 after a vote in November 1971 to change the system of government. Snohomish switched back to a mayor–council system in 2017 after a vote that passed by a margin of 11 votes. Former city councilmember Linda Redmon was elected mayor in 2021 as part of a shift to more progressive officials.

The city government has 50 full-time employees and operated under a $22.7 million budget in 2016. It is led by the city administrator, an unelected position appointed by the mayor and confirmed by a city council vote. Heather Thomas has served in the role since 2022.

At the federal level, Snohomish is part of the 1st congressional district, represented by Democrat Suzan DelBene. The district encompasses parts of Snohomish and King counties between Arlington and Bellevue that generally lie east of Interstate 5. At the state level, the city is part of the 44th legislative district, which also includes Mill Creek, southeastern Everett, and unincorporated areas. Snohomish is also wholly part of the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 5th district, which also includes Lake Stevens and the Skykomish Valley.

==Parks and recreation==

The city government has nine developed parks with of space reserved for public recreation, nature preserves, or other uses. These include Ferguson Park and Hill Park on Blackmans Lake; Morgantown Park and Pilchuck Park on the Pilchuck River; and Cady Park and KlaHaYa Park in downtown on the Snohomish River. These parks include playgrounds, walking trails, picnic areas, boat launches, and sports fields. The city also owns the local Boys and Girls Club and senior center, leasing them out to their respective organizations. The Snohomish area is also home to several county parks and privately owned recreational spaces that are primarily used for organized youth sports, such as soccer and baseball.

Snohomish is the southern terminus of the Centennial Trail, an intercity multi-use path for pedestrians, cyclists, and equestrians. It travels from the city through Lake Stevens and Arlington along a former railroad, terminating to the north at the Skagit County. The trail is maintained by the county government and is planned to be extended south from Snohomish to Woodinville, where it would connect with the Eastrail network. A new trail to the west along the Snohomish River is planned to connect the Centennial Trail to the Interurban Trail in Everett. The Snohomish city government maintains its own network of multi-use paths, which range from gravel and unpaved trails along the Snohomish River to paved connections between downtown and Blackmans Lake.

The city is home to the Snohomish Aquatic Center, a public pool complex built by the Snohomish School District for its high school swim teams. It opened in 2014 at a cost of $22.2 million and was partially funded by the city government, which provides discounts for residents. The facility replaced the Hal Moe Pool, which originally opened in 1972 as an outdoor pool and covered in the 1989 by the school district. The pool was closed in 2007 and was demolished in 2018 to make way for a city park.

==Education==
The Snohomish School District operates public schools that serve residents of Snohomish and nearby unincorporated areas, including Cathcart, Machias, and Three Lakes. , the district has a total enrollment of 9,421 students, 488 teachers, and 18 total schools. It has two conventional high schools, Snohomish High School and Glacier Peak High School, and an alternative high school program. These high schools are fed by two middle schools, which in turn draw from ten elementary schools. The district is governed by a five-member school board and had a budget of $154 million for the 2020–21 school year.

The Snohomish area also has several private schools operated by churches and other organizations. The St. Michael Catholic Church founded its parish school in 2007, becoming the sixth in Snohomish County operated under the Archdiocese of Seattle. Other Christian schools include Lighthouse Christian Academy, the Academy of Snohomish, and Zion Lutheran School.

==Culture==

===Arts===

The city&#x27;s largest performing arts venue is Tim Noah&#x27;s Thumbnail Theater, a non-profit theater at the historic Church of Christ, Scientist. It was founded in 2003 and hosts theatrical performances, concerts, and improv comedy among other forms of entertainment.

Several films have been shot in Snohomish, including 1981 comedy-drama &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot; and the 1985 drama &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot;. The city&#x27;s high school was also a setting in the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;, which was primarily filmed in California.

===Events===

Snohomish hosts an annual summer festival called Kla Ha Ya Days, which attracts up to 25,000 visitors and began in 1913. It is one of several community events affiliated with the regional Seafair, held annually in July.

===Media===

The city is part of the Seattle–Tacoma media market and is served by a daily newspaper, &quot;The Everett Herald&quot;. A local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Snohomish County Tribune&quot;, is published in Snohomish.

Snohomish&#x27;s public library is operated by Sno-Isle Libraries, a regional system that annexed the city-run library. Located near downtown, the building is the third-largest in the Sno-Isle system and serves over 5,000 weekly patrons. It opened in July 2003 at a cost of $8 million, replacing an earlier Carnegie library building that was a third of the size. The Snohomish library was named one of the favorite libraries of book commentator and celebrity librarian Nancy Pearl in 2008.

The city was home to Snohomish County&#x27;s first lending library, founded by local citizens in 1876. A permanent library building funded by Andrew Carnegie opened in 1910 and was expanded in 1968 with the construction of an annex that doubled its size. The building was determined to be too small to adequately meet Snohomish&#x27;s needs in the 1990s, leading to proposals to build a second annex or replace it with a new building. The library building was converted into a temporary space for art exhibits following its closure in 2003 and was later used as a rentable community center. The building closed again in 2017 to undergo a $2.7 million renovation, which included demolition of the 1968 annex and restoration of an original crystal chandelier. It reopened in 2021.

===Sports===

Snohomish has several semi-professional soccer teams and hosts major youth soccer tournaments at Stocker Fields. The tournaments are organized by Snohomish Youth Soccer, which also operates Snohomish United, a USL League Two team that is planned to debut in 2025. The Snohomish Sky was founded in 2023 and operates men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in the United Premier Soccer League and Western Indoor Soccer League. The Snohomish Soccer Dome also hosts practices for the Washington Wolfpack, an Arena Football League team that plays in Everett.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Snohomish is bisected by two major highways: U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which bypasses the city to the north and east, continuing on to Everett and Stevens Pass; and State Route 9, which runs north–south and connects to Woodinville and Lake Stevens. Other major roads in Snohomish include Bickford Avenue (which continues south as Avenue D), which formerly carried US 2 and is named for a local car dealership, Machias Road (Maple Avenue), and 2nd Street (92nd Street).

Community Transit, the countywide public transit authority, provides bus, paratransit, and vanpool service to Snohomish from surrounding cities. Two routes travel from Everett Station (with limited service to the Boeing Everett Factory) to Snohomish and continue east along US 2 to Monroe, Sultan, and Gold Bar. Another route travels from Lynnwood and Mill Creek to Snohomish and follows the State Route 9 corridor north to Lake Stevens. Community Transit also operates a commuter bus route that connects Snohomish and Monroe to Downtown Seattle with intermediate stops on Interstate 405 and State Route 520. The city has one park and ride lot, located near Avenue D and State Route 9, that is owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).

The city was formerly served by the Everett–Snohomish Interurban, an electric interurban railway that ceased operations in 1921. A small replica train depot was opened in 2005 near the Avenue D Bridge to serve as a visitors center.

A privately owned airport, Harvey Airfield, is situated to the south of downtown Snohomish. It was established in 1944 and remains under the ownership of the Harvey family. The airport is generally used for general aviation and small businesses, including skydiving clubs and hot air balloon operators.

===Utilities===

Utility services for residents and businesses in Snohomish are split between the city government and other providers. The Snohomish County Public Utility District provides electric power to customers Snohomish and most of the county, while Puget Sound Energy supplies natural gas. The city government contracts with Republic Services for collection and disposal of curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste. Since the closure of the Cathcart Landfill near Snohomish in 1992, garbage is generally sent to a landfill in Roosevelt for processing and burial.

The city government manages tap water service within Snohomish, which is delivered through a system of pipes. The city purchases 90 percent of its water from the City of Everett, which sources from Spada Lake and the Sultan River basin; the remainder is purchased from the Snohomish County Public Utility District, which treats well water near Lake Stevens. The city government operated its own water treatment plant on the Pilchuck River near Granite Falls until 2017, when it was determined to be too costly to maintain and upgrade to meet modern fish passage standards. A portion of Snohomish is within the service area of the Cross Valley Water District, which primarily serves unincorporated areas south of the city.

Snohomish&#x27;s wastewater system consists of a combined overflow for downtown and other older neighborhoods and a separated sewage and stormwater system for the rest of the city. A plan to replace the combined overflow system was approved in 2014 following interventions by the Washington State Department of Ecology. The city&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant on the Snohomish River was upgraded, replacing an earlier proposal to send sewage to the City of Everett for treatment.

===Health care===

The city&#x27;s nearest general hospital is EvergreenHealth Monroe, managed by a public hospital district that includes Snohomish and the Skykomish Valley. Until its affiliation with the EvergreenHealth system in 2015, it was known as the Valley General Hospital. Snohomish is home to several general and specialty clinics, including those managed by Providence Health &amp; Services and The Everett Clinic.

<text>Stanwood is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The city is located north of Seattle, at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River near Camano Island. As of the 2020 census, its population is 7,705.

The Stanwood area has been home to the Stillaguamish people for thousands of years, who originally had a village at the present site of Stanwood. The modern city of Stanwood was later founded in 1866 as Centerville, adopting its current name in 1877 after the arrival of postmaster Daniel O. Pearson. It was platted in 1888 and incorporated as a city in 1903. The city was bypassed by the Great Northern Railway, which built a depot east that grew into its own separate town, incorporated in 1922 as East Stanwood. The two Stanwoods were civic rivals for several decades, until their governments were consolidated after a 1960 referendum was approved by voters.

The city was historically home to several food processing plants, which were its largest employers, and was mainly populated by Scandinavians. Since the 1990s, Stanwood has grown into a bedroom community for Seattle and Everett and has annexed uphill areas that were developed into suburban subdivisions. Stanwood is primarily served by State Route 532, which connects Camano Island to Interstate 5, and also has a train station that opened in 2009.

==History==
The Stillaguamish, a Coast Salish tribe, have inhabited the area around the Stillaguamish River delta for several thousand years. At the time of the Point Elliott Treaty in 1855 there was a Stillaguamish village at the mouth of the river consisting of three large potlatch houses with an estimated population of 250 people. There were several other villages around the delta that totaled approximately 800 people, as well as graveyards that were later destroyed by settlers. The area at the mouth of the river is known as , meaning &quot;strait&quot; or &quot;slough&quot; in Lushootseed.

The area&#x27;s first American expedition was led by George O. and G. L. Wilson, who were led by Snohomish guides on a canoe expedition up the Stillaguamish River in 1851 and reported on its economic potential. The first permanent American settlement at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River was Centerville, a trading post established in 1866 by Robert Fulton on the south side of the river. Centerville gained a post office in 1870, and the settlement was moved to the north side of the river three years later. The post office was renamed to Stanwood in 1877 by its sixth postmaster Daniel O. Pearson, after his wife Clara&#x27;s maiden name; Pearson also ran a general store and built a new steamboat wharf on the Stillaguamish River shortly after arriving. Pearson had arrived from Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1866; two of his sisters were among the original &quot;Mercer Girls&quot;.

The surrounding area was cleared by loggers and managed using a series of levees along the Stillaguamish River before being opened for settlement by farmers and ranchers. The establishment of a Norwegian Lutheran church in 1876, the first to be built in the Pacific Northwest, brought the area&#x27;s first wave of Scandinavian immigrants. The townsite&#x27;s plat was filed by W. R. Stockbridge in 1888, ahead of a failed attempt to petition the county commission for incorporation as a city. Stanwood suffered from a major fire on June 2, 1892, which destroyed the church and thirteen buildings and caused damages of approximately $26,100 ( dollars); several businesses and the town&#x27;s liquor supply were saved by volunteers from the town&#x27;s Good Templars lodge, who had been at a regular meeting. By the end of the decade, the town had rebuilt its main street and gained a weekly newspaper, cannery, horse racing track, creamery, and a shingle mill. Stanwood was officially incorporated on October 19, 1903, a month after the town&#x27;s men voted 74–16 in favor of becoming a city. Stanwood&#x27;s businesses relocated a block away from the riverfront in the 1920s and 1930s after the main flow of the Stillaguamish River shifted to another slough. The change in the river rendered the wharf too shallow for steamboats and damaged dikes after several major floods.

The Seattle and Montana Railroad (later absorbed into the Great Northern Railway) was constructed through the Stanwood area in 1891, but bypassed the town
 to the east, where it built a depot on ground that was less prone to flooding. Several businesses relocated to the area around the depot, including a bank and Washington state&#x27;s first cooperative general store. Merchants in the old town boycotted the railroad and acquired a steamboat, the &quot;City of Stanwood&quot;, in 1893; the ship was lost after catching fire on Port Susan the following year.

A short railroad, known as the Hall and Hall Railway, was constructed in 1904 between the depot and downtown Stanwood and would operate until 1938. The community around the depot was platted in 1906 as &quot;East Stanwood&quot;, but initially relied on a commercial club to govern in lieu of a formal town government. East Stanwood was incorporated on February 7, 1922, after a series of civic disputes highlighted the need for a city government. East Stanwood was eventually bisected by the Pacific Highway in the 1920s and connected to Stanwood and Camano Island by paved roads constructed a decade earlier.

The &quot;Twin City&quot; maintained separate government facilities, schools, banks, sawmills, creameries, and frozen food plants. The school systems for the two cities were merged in 1944, ending a decades-long football rivalry between the two high schools. By the early 1950s, the competitiveness between merchants and citizens of both Stanwoods had softened and groups cooperated on events and various initiatives. A formal merger of the two cities was proposed in 1954 and placed on the April 30 ballot; Stanwood voted in favor of the merger, but it failed to reach a majority in East Stanwood. The high cost of a modern sewage treatment system, required by the state government before further expansion could occur, spurred leaders in both cities to place a second consolidation referendum before voters on March 8, 1960. The referendum was passed by an overwhelming majority of voters in both cities and the merged government immediately approved a $520,000 sewer installation contract.

Development of a new suburban commercial center east of the city began in the 1980s, centered around the relocated Stanwood High School campus. A farm at the intersection of State Route 532 and 72nd Avenue Northwest was redeveloped into a $50 million shopping and entertainment center. The commercial center opened in 1995 and has 50 businesses, 10 restaurants, office buildings, a movie theater, and an arcade. The development was later expanded to include multi-story condominiums and upscale apartments with ground-floor retail space. The area surrounding the center was developed into suburban subdivisions, contributing to a doubling of the city&#x27;s population to nearly 4,000 people by 2000. The subdivisions were annexed by the city government in the early 2000s, despite testimony from citizens against further growth. In 2005, the city rejected a bid by Wal-Mart to build a store in Stanwood after public outcry from supporters of downtown businesses.

The high school campus was replaced with a new building in 2021 that cost $147.5 million to construct. An adjacent site is planned to be developed into a large residential complex with 444 apartments and 72 townhomes. The complex is also planned to incorporate retail, amenity spaces, and expanded wetlands.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Stanwood has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is at the northwestern corner of Snohomish County, and is considered part of the Seattle metropolitan area. It is west of its nearest neighboring town, Arlington, and north of Everett, the county seat. The city is also north of Seattle and south of Mount Vernon.

Stanwood&#x27;s city limits are generally defined to the south by the Stillaguamish River; to the west by 104th Drive Northwest; to the north by 276th Street Northwest and 290th Street Northwest; and to the east by 68th Avenue Northwest. Approximately 59 percent of land within Stanwood city limits is used for housing, while 10 percent is zoned for commercial use and 7 percent for industrial uses. The urban growth area of Stanwood consists of an additional outside city limits, including the unincorporated area of Northwest Stanwood.

The city is located at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River, where it flows into Port Susan, an arm of the Puget Sound, and Skagit Bay, the mouth of the Skagit River. To the west is Davis Slough, which separates Stanwood from Camano Island and forms the border between Snohomish and Island counties. Elevations in Stanwood range from above sea level near the Stillaguamish River to in the northeastern hills. The city is home to five creeks and drainage basins that flow into the Stillaguamish River and Puget Sound: Church Creek, Douglas Creek, Irvine Slough, the Skagit River, and the Stillaguamish River. The Stanwood area was formed during the Pleistocene glaciation and was further shaped through the rise and fall of the sea level as well as sedimentary deposits from the Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers.

Much of downtown Stanwood is located in a 100-year flood zone and is at risk of flooding from the Stillaguamish River, as well as the Skagit River. Much of the Stillaguamish delta was reclaimed using a series of levees and dikes that were built in the 1870s and improved by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s and the city government in the 1990s. Some of the failure-prone dikes were later removed in the 2010s to restore habitat areas for native wildlife. Several civic buildings have also been relocated uphill from the downtown area to prevent floods from hampering the city&#x27;s vital functions. In 2020, the city government began construction of flood controls to redirect stormwater into the Stillaguamish River rather than the sloughs to prevent flooding. The project is expected to cost $11 million and take 10 years to complete over six phases.

==Economy==

, Stanwood has an estimated workforce population of 4,644 and an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent. The most common occupations for Stanwood residents are in the education and health care sector, which employs 24.1 percent, followed by manufacturing (17.5%), retail (13.3%), and entertainment and food services (11.2%). Only 14 percent of employed residents work within Stanwood city limits, while the rest commute to other cities for work. The most common commuting destinations for Stanwood residents include Everett, with 15 percent of traffic, Seattle (8.5%), Mount Vernon (5%), Arlington (4.6%), and Marysville (4.5%). The average one-way commute for the city&#x27;s workers was approximately 27.5 minutes; 83.5 percent of commuters drove alone to their workplace, while 7.4 percent carpooled and 2.8 percent used public transit.

The city&#x27;s largest employers are the Stanwood-Camano School District and the Josephine Sunset Home, which provide approximately 550 and 303 jobs, respectively. One of the city&#x27;s other large employers was the Twin City Foods frozen food processing plant, which packaged frozen vegetables and fruits until it ceased operations in 2017. The original plant was destroyed in an accidental fire on April 28, 1996, causing $50 million in damage and leaving 111 full-time workers unemployed until a new plant opened the following July.

==Demographics==
Stanwood is among the smallest cities in Snohomish County, with a population of 7,705 people as of the 2020 census. By 2035, the city and its surrounding urban growth area is expected to have a population of 11,085. The greater Stanwood area, which includes Camano Island and other nearby communities, has a total population of 33,000 people.

Stanwood was noted for its historically large Scandinavian population, particularly Norwegians, who settled in the region in the early 20th century. As late as 1949, over 60 percent of Stanwood residents were of Norwegian, Swedish, or Danish descent. By 2000, however, only 17.6 percent of residents identified themselves as having Scandinavian ancestry.

==Government and politics==
Stanwood is a non-charter code city that operates under a mayor–council government. The city council&#x27;s seven members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms in non-partisan elections. City councilmember Sid Roberts was elected mayor in 2021, replacing interim mayor Elizabeth Callaghan. The council conducts regular meetings twice per month at the Stanwood-Camano School District administrative offices. The city hall was built in 1939 and renovated in the 1960s and 2013, but remains too small to host city council meetings. The city has long-term plans to relocate the city hall out of the downtown flood zone to a property near Church Creek Park.

The city government employs 28 people full-time and operates on a budget with annual expenses of $16.2 million. The budget funds various departments run by the government, including water utilities, parks and recreation, development planning, and clerks. Stanwood also outsources its policing services to the county sheriff&#x27;s office and its fire and emergency services to the North County Regional Fire Authority. The sheriff&#x27;s office provides several deputies and officers, while the vehicles and uniforms are marked with the city logo.

At the federal level, Stanwood is part of the 2nd congressional district, which is represented by Democrat Rick Larsen. At the state level, Stanwood is part of the 10th legislative district along with Arlington, southwestern Skagit County, and the entirety of Island County. Stanwood is wholly part of the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 1st district, which covers northern areas of the county.

==Culture==

===Arts and events===

Stanwood&#x27;s arts community is centered around the Stanwood–Camano Arts Guild, which organizes an annual spring art show and the Art by the Bay festival in the summer. The guild also programs public art at local businesses and public venues. Stanwood is also a center for glass artwork due to its proximity to the Pilchuck Glass School, founded in 1971 by a group of glassblowing artists led by Dale Chihuly.

Stanwood also hosts several annual festivals and events that are organized by community groups and the city government. In February, the area hosts a glass treasure hunt and a birding festival to coincide with the migration of snow geese and other winter flocks. During the summer months, the city organizes weekend concerts at various venues around downtown and hosts a farmers&#x27; market on Fridays from June to October. Stanwood&#x27;s two late summer festivals, the Community Fair and Harvest Jubilee, are focused around the region&#x27;s agricultural tradition. The Community Fair, held since 1932 in early August and billed as the &quot;Best Lil&#x27; Fair in the West&quot;, draws 12,000 visitors annually and features 4-H presentations, livestock exhibitions, a parade, and carnival rides. The Harvest Jubilee, held since 2007 in late September, includes fine art exhibitions, produce contests, and self-guided tours of local farms.

===Parks and recreation===

Stanwood has eight public parks that have a combined of public open and preserved space. The parks range from nature sanctuaries to neighborhood parks, playgrounds, sports fields, and boat launches. The city&#x27;s largest park is Heritage Park, located in downtown and covering ; it is shared with the school district and includes sports fields, walking trails, picnic areas, a dog park, and a skate park. Stanwood&#x27;s nearest regional parks are Kayak Point County Park, which also includes an adjacent golf course, and Wenberg County Park on Lake Goodwin.

In 2014, the city began development of new multi-million dollar parks at the former Hamilton lumber mill and Ovenell dairy farm, both located along the Stillaguamish River near downtown. The Hamilton site includes an iconic smokestack that is decorated during the holiday season and will be incorporated into the new park, which will include a boat launch and public dock. The Ovenell site was cleared of its historic barn in 2017 and will include a boat launch, natural habitats, and a demonstration farm when fully completed in the 2020s.

===Media===
Stanwood has one weekly newspaper, the &quot;Stanwood Camano News&quot;, which originated in 1903 as the &quot;Stanwood Tidings&quot; and later ran under the name of the &quot;Twin City News&quot;. The newspaper was acquired by the Pioneer News Group, publishers of the Mount Vernon-based &quot;Skagit Valley Herald&quot;, in 2015. At the time, the &quot;News&quot; had a weekly circulation of 2,200.

Stanwood&#x27;s public library is operated by the countywide Sno-Isle Libraries system and is housed in a building. The city&#x27;s first library was built in 1922 and replaced in 1970 with the modern building, which was expanded in 1986.

===Historic buildings===

The twin downtowns of Stanwood and East Stanwood have several blocks of historic buildings that date back to the early 20th century and were preserved by the city&#x27;s residents. A portion of the eastern downtown was nearly destroyed in a two-alarm fire on August 27, 1997, which burned through three shops.

Stanwood has two buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which evaluates historic sites under private ownership. The D. O. Pearson House, was built in 1890 as the home of the founding Pearson family and was listed in 1973. It was acquired by the Stanwood Area Historical Society in 1975 and now serves as a pioneer museum. The city&#x27;s other NRHP listing, the three-story Stanwood IOOF Public Hall, was built in 1903 for use by various fraternal organizations (including the International Order of Odd Fellows) until it was acquired by the historical society in 1996. The IOOF building was reopened in 2003 as the Floyd Norgaard Cultural Center and now serves as a museum, community center, and events venue.

The district had an enrollment of approximately 4,554 students in 2014 and has eleven total schools, including one high school, two middle schools, and four elementary schools located in Stanwood. The old high school, opened in 1971, was replaced in 2021 by a new, three-story building on the existing campus to accommodate the area&#x27;s growing population.

Stanwood&#x27;s nearest post-secondary education institutions are Skagit Valley College, located in Mount Vernon, and Everett Community College, located in northern Everett. In 2006, the city offered near Interstate 5 to the state government for a potential four-year university campus. The university project was eventually awarded to other bids in Everett before being cancelled entirely in 2008.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Stanwood is located on State Route 532, an east–west highway connecting Camano Island to Interstate 5 east of Stanwood. The city is also served by two other major highways: Pioneer Highway, historically part of State Route 530 and the Pacific Highway (U.S. Route 99), which continues north to Conway and east towards Silvana and Arlington; and Marine Drive, which continues south to Florence, Warm Beach, the Tulalip Indian Reservation, and Marysville.

Public transportation in Stanwood is provided by Community Transit and Island Transit, the transit authorities of Snohomish and Island counties, respectively. Community Transit runs local bus service from Stanwood to Warm Beach, North Lakewood, and Smokey Point. On weekdays, it also runs express buses to Lynnwood City Center station, the northern terminus of the Link light rail system, and peak-only service to the Boeing Everett Factory from a park-and-ride near Interstate 5. Island Transit provides service to Camano Island on two routes, as well as commuter service to Mount Vernon and Everett. A separate service, named Snow Goose Transit, debuted in 2022 and provides minibus service in Stanwood and parts of Camano Island. It is operated by a local retirement home and was funded by the Washington State Department of Transportation.

Stanwood is served by a north–south railroad owned by BNSF Railway, which operates freight and passenger rail service to the city. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cascades&quot; provides daily passenger rail service at Stanwood station in downtown Stanwood, continuing south to Seattle and north to Vancouver, British Columbia. The train station opened on November 21, 2009, restoring passenger rail service that had been discontinued in 1971.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Stanwood is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County and neighboring Camano Island. Cascade Natural Gas provides natural gas service to the city&#x27;s residents and businesses, as part of its service area in northwestern Washington. Stanwood has two major broadband internet providers: Frontier and Wave Broadband; the latter also offers cable television.

The city government provides water and water treatment to residents and businesses within a service area that includes the entire city and some surrounding unincorporated areas. The city&#x27;s water supply is sourced primarily from several wells that draw from an underground aquifer. Wastewater and stormwater are collected and treated at two treatment plants, built in 1963 and 2004. Solid waste and recycling collection within Stanwood is contracted by the city government to Waste Management.

===Health care===

Stanwood&#x27;s nearest general hospital is the Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington. The city has two medical clinics operated by The Everett Clinic and Skagit Valley Hospital. The Stanwood General Hospital operated until 1943, and a replacement was planned in the late 1950s, but never built.

<doc id="138242" wikidata="Q1505643" url="?curid=138242" title="Sultan, Washington">
<text>Sultan is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located approximately east of Everett at the confluence of the Skykomish River and the Sultan River, a minor tributary. The city had a population of 5,146 at the 2020 census.

The city was founded in 1880 at the site of a Skykomish village and initially settled during a small gold rush. Sultan was platted in 1889, just prior to the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, and was a hub for mining and the lumber industry. It was incorporated on June 28, 1905, with a population of 700. The city was home to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp during the Great Depression and undertook several civic improvements in the post-war years.

Sultan has since become a bedroom community for large employment centers in the Puget Sound region. The city has several public parks, a historic museum, and is located near outdoor recreation areas in the Cascade Mountains. It is connected to nearby cities by U.S. Route 2.

==History==

The area around the Sultan and Skykomish rivers was occupied by the Skykomish, a branch of the Snohomish people, prior to the arrival of American settlers. The Skykomish had a permanent village at the confluence named , along with a nearby fishery named . Following the discovery of a rich gold vein along the Sultan River, the land around the confluence was claimed for a homestead by John Nailor and his wife in 1880. Among the first arrivals to the area were Chinese prospectors, who later settled the land but were evicted in 1885. Nailor built a small store and hotel to serve miners and loggers, eventually serving as the first postmaster after the settlement received a post office in 1885. The town and river were named &quot;Sultan&quot;, an anglicization of (also known as Tseul-dan), then chief of the Skykomish tribe.

The Nailors sold of their homestead to William B. Stevens in 1889, who filed the first plat for Sultan City that October. The Great Northern Railway placed a supply depot for its railroad workers in Sultan in 1891, meeting river steamboats and contributing to the town&#x27;s early growth. Sultan gained its first sawmill in 1891 and a shingle mill in 1895, as the local economy transitioned away from mining and towards logging. Sultan was officially incorporated as a city on June 28, 1905. At the time, the city had a population of 700 people and three general stores, along with a variety of small industries. By 1912, the city had a public library, electrical service, paved streets, and was considering a plan to build a hydroelectric dam that would also provide municipal water service. A bridge across the Skykomish River was built in 1908 to connect to new farms on the south bank.

An economic slowdown after World War I led to a population decrease in the Skykomish Valley, causing Sultan voters to approve a reduction in the city&#x27;s size in June 1920. The area was home to various illicit industries during the Prohibition era and experienced several major crimes, including the murder of town marshal Percy Brewster on March 2, 1927, by a serial robber who later escaped from prison before being re-captured. The area also experienced an economic downturn during the Great Depression and was home to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp that primarily dealt with firefighting and forest management. The Works Progress Administration also completed several projects in the city, including two expansions of the high school and its gymnasium in 1929 and 1939. Several major fires struck Sultan in the 1940s, including one in October 1945 that destroyed a block of buildings on Main Street and another in 1947 that decimated the Sultan Union High School.

Sultan residents participated a civic improvement program during the 1950s and 1960s that upgraded or replaced several major facilities, often with assistance from the state government. A new city hall was opened in 1954, the elementary school was expanded in 1957, and a new landing field for airplanes and helicopters opened in 1958. The city annexed of rural land to the southeast in 1958 and it was subsequently developed for housing. The Skykomish River Bridge was also replaced by a new span in 1961. The Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD) constructed the Culmback Dam on the Sultan River, creating the Spada Lake reservoir and providing electricity and drinking water for Everett and much of the county beginning in 1965.

The Sky River Rock Festival and Lighter Than Air Fair, one of the first outdoor U.S. music festivals, was hosted at a raspberry farm south of Sultan beginning August 30, 1968. The three-day festival, organized by radio station KRAB and the &quot;Helix&quot; newspaper, attracted an estimated 20,000 hippies, of whom 13,000 had paid tickets, and was considered to be a forerunner for later festivals like Woodstock. Musical acts at the festival included Santana, the Grateful Dead, Country Joe McDonald, Muddy Waters, Buffy St. Marie, and John Fahey, among others. The Sultan city government declined to allow the festival to return the following year due to the traffic and logistical issues that were experienced, including the venue running out of drinking water. The event was largely forgotten by local residents, but was revived for a one-time festival in 2017.

Sultan has since developed into a bedroom community for workers commuting to Everett, Seattle, and Bellevue. Several suburban subdivisions were built in the 1990s and early 2000s, contributing to a population boom and political strife over the area&#x27;s rural and small-town character. The Department of Veteran Affairs considered the Sultan area for a new national military cemetery, but ultimately chose a site near Kent. Sultan celebrated its centennial in 2005 with several festivals and the dedication of a new visitor&#x27;s center. Despite the population growth, the city&#x27;s traditional businesses have left Sultan and caused a decline in local employment options.

In an effort to resolve development issues and a city budget shortfall, a Monroe city councilmember unsuccessfully suggested merging the two cities during the 2007 financial crisis. The Sultan city government instead began outsourcing its policing and library services to county agencies while undergoing other reforms. The city government has endorsed schemes to lure new industries, including offering tracts of land and opening new parks and a shooting range in a bid to appeal to outdoor recreation companies.

==Geography==
Sultan is located along the Skykomish River at its confluences with the Sultan and Wallace rivers in south-central Snohomish County, approximately east of Everett, the county seat.

The city government has 15 full-time employees and had a budgeted expenditure of $11.1 million in 2016. The city funds various departments and services, including public sanitation, water and sewer systems, planning, and parks. Other services, including fire services and the library, are contracted out to regional agencies. The local police department was disbanded in 2008 and transitioned to services from the Snohomish County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for public safety.

Sultan&#x27;s public library was established in 1927 by the Women&#x27;s Improvement Club, but was later transferred to city control. It is currently operated by the countywide Sno-Isle Libraries system and located in the city hall building in downtown. The library was formerly operated by the city government, but was annexed into the Sno-Isle system in March 2008 due to a potential shutdown caused by the budget shortfall.

At the federal level, Sultan is part of the 8th congressional district, which encompasses the eastern portions of the Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties as well as the entirety of Chelan and Kittitas counties. It was part of the 1st congressional district until 2022, when the 8th district was extended into Snohomish County. At the state level, the city is part of the 12th legislative district, which also crosses the Cascade Mountains and includes Skykomish, part of Snoqualmie, and all of Chelan County except for Wenatchee. Monroe was previously part of the 39th legislative district until it was moved into the cross-mountain district as part of a redistricting compromise in 2022. The city lies within the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 5th district, which includes the Skykomish Valley, Snohomish, and Lake Stevens.

==Culture==
===Arts and events===

The city hosts an annual three-day street fair in July, known as the &quot;Sultan Shindig&quot;, which was established in 1983 and attracts 20,000 visitors. It includes carnival rides, street vendors, live music, games, a parade, and a car show. 
The celebration also honors the history of the Skykomish Valley by holding several logging contests, including axe throwing, firewood chopping, speed climbing, and wood sculpting. The 2018 festival marked the debut of the Shindig Shandy, a sweet beer produced by Timber Monster Brewing for the event. Another festival is held in late September to commemorate the return of spawning salmon to the Sultan River.

===Parks and recreation===

Sultan has four city parks, all located near downtown, and several athletic and recreational facilities. The city&#x27;s largest park is the Osprey Park, located along the eastern bank of the Sultan River and home to a regular salmon spawning ground. The park also features picnic tables, sports fields, basketball courts, and a dog park. Traveler&#x27;s Park on U.S. Route 2 features a tree round from a 1,000-year-old Douglas fir that was donated to the city government in 1976 by a local logging company. Sultan opened a skate park in 2008. The city is also home to a Boys &amp; Girls Club that opened at its current location in 2015, five years after a fire destroyed the previous club.

* John Koster, former state legislator and county councilmember
* Boeda Strand, basket weaver and member of the Snohomish tribe

==Education==

Public schools in the Sultan area are operated by the Sultan School District, which also covers nearby Gold Bar and other rural areas north and west of Index. The school district had an enrollment of approximately 1,992 students in 2016, with 104 total teachers. It has one high school, one middle school, and two elementary schools (of which one serves Sultan). The current high school was constructed in 1951 to replace an earlier building that was destroyed four years prior. A $56 million bond issue to upgrade the district&#x27;s four schools and construct a new administrative building was rejected by voters in 2016. The Sky Valley Historical Society maintains a small local museum in the city&#x27;s post office building in downtown Sultan.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Sultan is connected to nearby communities by U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which runs east–west along the Skykomish and Snohomish rivers from Everett to Eastern Washington via Stevens Pass. The nearest cities on the highway are Monroe, to the west, and Gold Bar to the east. The highway carries daily average of approximately 18,000 vehicles through Sultan, with higher volumes during summer months and ski season. Due to its high rate of accidents, including more than 2,600 in the county in the early 2000s and 100 within Sultan city limits from 1999 to 2000, the highway is considered one of the most dangerous in the state. Sections of US 2 near Sultan were rebuilt to add safety features, including roundabouts, rumble strips, warning signage, and additional policing. A plan to widen the highway to four lanes through Sultan and add additional roundabouts was endorsed by the city government in 2023. The BNSF Railway&#x27;s Scenic Subdivision also runs along U.S. Route 2, connecting Everett to Eastern Washington and also carrying Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; train. The highway and railroad cross over the Sultan River on a pair of truss bridges, while a third is planned to be built for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Public transit service along US 2 is operated by Community Transit and consists of two routes that travel from Everett Station to Snohomish, Monroe, Sultan, and Gold Bar. The city also has a small park and ride lot that is served by Community Transit. A private airfield, Sky Harbor Airport, is located near Sultan and is open to small aircraft. It has a single, unpaved runway.

===Utilities===

Electric power for Sultan residents and businesses is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The PUD operates the Culmback Dam north of Sultan, which generates electricity for the region and also provides 80 percent of Snohomish County&#x27;s water supply. The Sultan city government provides water and water treatment to residents and businesses, via a separate city-owned reservoir located north of Sultan. Wastewater and stormwater is treated at a treatment plant that discharges into the Skykomish River. Solid waste collection is provided by the city government, while recycling and yard waste collection is contracted to Allied Waste.

===Health care===

Sultan&#x27;s nearest general hospital is the Valley General Hospital in Monroe, part of the EvergreenHealth system. EvergreenHealth also operates one of two medical clinics in Sultan, which was previously an independent operation from 2003 to 2015. The other clinic, Cascade Health Clinic, remains independent.

<text>Warm Beach () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,990 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
What is now Warm Beach was the site of a village of the Stillaguamish and Snohomish peoples. The village had one longhouse and several smaller cedar houses. According to James Dorsey, the chief of the Stillaguamish Tribe in 1927, it was a gathering place for members of the Stillaguamish and other neighboring tribes. In their language, Lushootseed, Warm Beach is called .

Seattle real estate developer Clarence Dayton Hillman acquired along Port Susan in 1906 and began to sell property for a future seaport city named &quot;Birmingham&quot; for his Michigan hometown. By 1910, he had sold plots and ran an excursion steamer to the site, where paid actors were used to create the illusion of a thriving city. The scheme was later uncovered and Hillman was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for mail fraud. A community at the site was established and renamed to Warm Beach in 1924.

A Christian summer camp was established at Warm Beach in 1956 by the Free Methodist Church and opened two years later. It hosts an annual Christmas lights festival in December that was inspired by the Opryland Themepark in Tennessee. The Free Methodist Church also operates a senior living center in Warm Beach that includes nursing home and assisted living units.

<text>Woodway is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,318 at the 2020 census.

Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Woodway ranks sixth of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked, and ranks first in Snohomish County.

==History==

The community was founded in 1914 by attorney turned real estate developer David Whitcomb, who acquired and began developing &quot;Woodway Park&quot;. The city includes areas north and south of the original Woodway Park which offer one third acre lots and lots in addition to the lots in the park where the original secluded, wooded environment remains.

Woodway was officially incorporated on February 26, 1958, in an effort to protect the heavily forested area from development and avoid annexation by Edmonds. Lot sizes were deed restricted to a minimum of (though existing smaller lot sizes were grandfathered) and also mandated nunneries for lots larger than . as a way of grandfathering in the existing convent, Rosary Heights, mother house of the Edmonds Dominican Sisters (originally built as the estate of Boeing vice-president Philip G. Johnson). The city was named for its natural setting by a real estate developer. At that time, Woodway high school students attended the old Edmonds High school until the new Woodway High School was opened in 1970. In 1990, this school merged with Edmonds High School to create Edmonds Woodway High School.

Woodway was reclassified as a “city” in 1986 due to changes in state law, but continues to refer to itself as the Town of Woodway on its letterhead and web site. It is served by the Edmonds post office, sharing the 98020 ZIP Code. Well into the 1980s, the city lacked businesses, sidewalks (except on parts of Woodway Park Road), and parks; it was almost entirely zoned for single-family homes, which were among the most expensive in Snohomish County. Its first major development since incorporation, the 94-home Woodway Highlands, was approved in 1999 following disputes between residents and the Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board. Its first homes were completed in 2003. As of 2021, no part of Woodway is zoned for commercial use.

Woodway is the only city in Snohomish County to have telephone numbers in the 206 area code, but some areas were switched to area code 425 in 1997. Landline phone numbers in Woodway originally shared LIncoln prefixes (542 and 546) with Richmond Beach, but PRospect prefixes (771, 774, 775, 776) shared with Edmonds were later added.

==Geography==

Woodway is located at the southwestern edge of Snohomish County, bordered to the north and east by Edmonds and the south by Shoreline in King County. Puget Sound lies to the west of the town, including an unincorporated area known as Point Wells. The town sits on a bluff that overlooks Puget Sound; the BNSF Railway has railroad tracks along the shoreline, which was also home to a clothing-optional beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Airway Heights is a city in Spokane County, Washington, United States, just west of Spokane. It is part of the Spokane metropolitan area and had a population of 10,757 at the 2020 census. The city&#x27;s name was taken from its close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport.

==History==
Airway Heights was founded in 1942 and officially incorporated on June 28, 1955.

Growth in the city was spurred by the opening of the Airway Heights Corrections Center by the Washington State Department of Corrections in 1992 and the opening of the Northern Quest Resort &amp; Casino by the Kalispel Indian Tribe in 2000. In the decades since, Airway Heights has seen the addition of new retailers, several new apartment buildings and housing developments, the expansion of the Northern Quest Casino, and the opening of the Spokane Tribe Casino.

==Geography==
Downtown Spokane is located eight miles by road east of Airway Heights. In 2012, the City of Spokane incorporated the Spokane International Airport and surrounding area, since which the city Spokane has bordered the city of Airway Heights to the east and south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The community lies in the northeastern corner of the flat Columbia Plateau. While the plateau tends to be flat, the terrain locally is quite rugged as it is part of the Channeled Scablands. The &quot;heights&quot; in the city&#x27;s name references its location at a higher elevation than the city center of Spokane. Traveling into Airway Heights along U.S. Route 2, the main road into the city, from Downtown Spokane, one will climb over 500 feet.

Rushing initially refused, stating he was not a racist. This follows an earlier incident in 2015 in which Rushing resigned his position as a school bus driver after he was charged with a misdemeanor for leaving the scene of an accident.

In August 2015 Rushing submitted his resignation. He stated, &quot;I find it difficult to continue due to my declining health issues.&quot; He was succeeded by then-Deputy Mayor Kevin Richey.

<text>Cheney ( ) is a city in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The full-time resident population was 13,255 as of the 2020 census. Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney. When classes are in session at EWU, the city&#x27;s population reaches approximately 17,600 people temporarily.

==History==
Named for Boston railroad tycoon Benjamin Pierce Cheney, Cheney was officially incorporated on November 28, 1883.

The City of Cheney is located in Spokane County and is home to 13,255 residents, according to the 2020 Census. Cheney is proud of its small-town nature, which is enhanced by the diverse influence of Eastern Washington University, a public regional university with over 10,000 full-time students. The Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League held the majority of their summer training camps at EWU, from 1976 to 1985, and again from 1997 through the 2006 training camp.

Cheney developed into the city known today because of its strong ties to education, trail riding, and agriculture. This provided a strong economic base for the community and was the result of a much larger event that took place in the United States. In 1858, the last Native American defense occurred in Eastern Washington. Because isolated Eastern Washington was an area of this Native American unrest during the early part of the territorial period, it was not until the late 1860s and early 1870s that settlers made homes in the area. In the latter part of that decade, settlers attracted by plentiful water and timber and the promise of a railway line made their homes near a group of springs bubbling through a willow copse from the bank where the Burlington Northern depot now stands.

The name of the community, originally Section Thirteen, became Willow Springs, then became Depot Springs, because of its ties to the railroad, then Billings, in honor of a president of the Northern Pacific Company, and finally Cheney, Washington in honor of Benjamin P. Cheney, a director of the Northern Pacific Railroad.

Benjamin P. Cheney was the eldest son of a blacksmith who was born in 1815 in Hillsborough, New Hampshire. At age 16, he began working as a stagecoach driver between Nashua and Keene. Five years later he had become a stage agent in Boston and soon organized an express between Boston and Montreal. He later consolidated that stagecoach line with others to form the United States and Canada Express Company, which 37 years later he merged with American Express, becoming American Express&#x27;s largest shareholder. The only time Cheney visited the town of Cheney was on September 18, 1883, following the &quot;Last Spike Ceremony&quot; which was the joining of the eastern and western divisions of the railroad. Cheney made donations to establish the Benjamin P. Cheney Academy in the town. The railroad donated of land so that the educational facility could be built. In 1880 the railroad was graded through the town, and in 1883 the town was incorporated with the streets laid out in the shape of a triangle with the base parallel to the tracks. The railroad tracks were not in a true east-west line, however, so the original town is askew with the map; the newer part of Cheney was built more to the compass.

After a series of boundary changes caused by legislative acts, Spokane County was created with a permanent county seat still to be selected. Contenders for the honor were Cheney and Spokane Falls (now Spokane). Cheney received a majority of the votes, but due to alleged irregularities at the polls, the election was won by Spokane Falls. When this was taken to court, a circuit court judge agreed to a ballot recount. Such a recount failed to materialize, however, and the citizens of Cheney took matters into their own hands.

On a night when most of the residents of Spokane Falls were at a gala wedding celebration, a delegation of armed &quot;Cheneyites&quot; invaded Auditor&#x27;s office and took possession of the books, conducted their ballot recount which showed Cheney as the victor, and made off into the darkness with the records. The &quot;Grand Steal&quot; was not contested and was confirmed by a court decision in 1881.

Cheney remained the county seat until 1886 when the faster-growing Spokane Falls again brought the issue to a vote and regained the seat. From this point on, the history of Cheney revolves around the growth of the State Normal School, later Eastern Washington College of Education, later Eastern Washington State College, and finally Eastern Washington University. The fierce determination of Cheney to build and promote its college was largely to regain its lost prestige over the county seat.

When Washington became a state in 1889, Cheney was able to obtain legislation establishing one of the state&#x27;s normal schools, mandatory under the Enabling Act, in Cheney. Its most convincing argument was that it already had the physical beginnings of a normal school in the Benjamin P. Cheney Academy.

Disagreement between legislators and governors resulted in three appropriation vetoes for the normal school in the next 25 years, but in each case, the citizens of Cheney somehow raised the funds to keep the college going until the next legislative session. The growth of the Cheney Normal School and the transformation of the frontier land into a thriving community were the basis for the changing attitudes in this area. The innovators who created the small community atmosphere were the women of the frontier. All of the energies that were once focused on making the West home for their families were transformed into creating a vision of preferred lifestyle choices for the youth.

===The Battle of Four Lakes===
==Geography==
Cheney is located at (47.488634, -117.578581), at an elevation of .

Cheney is at the highest point on the railroads between Spokane and Portland and sits atop the route of the gentlest gradient from the Spokane Valley to the Columbia Plateau, which was the reason for much of its early growth and railroad activity. The town is built on rolling Palouse hills overlooking Channeled Scablands carved out by the pre-historic Missoula Floods to the south and east. These scablands now host &quot;pothole&quot; lakes and wetlands, and are home to Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge. There are numerous lakes, along with the Spokane River and Little Spokane River, that are located within of Cheney that provide abundant recreational opportunities such as boating, swimming, water skiing, and fishing.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
Cheney is located on the edge of the semi-arid region leading up to the foothills of the Selkirk Mountains, where the summers are hot and dry, and winters are cold, wet, and windy.

==Metropolitan area==
===Downtown historic district===
Located approximately four blocks from the EWU campus, Historic Downtown Cheney offers a traditional mix of retail and service businesses as well as government offices. In 1999, Eastern Washington University, the City of Cheney, and the downtown business community formed a university/community partnership called &quot;Pathways to Progress.&quot; Pathways to Progress quickly adopted the tenets and principles of the Main Street approach to downtown revitalization, formed a board of directors, and began the process of becoming a 501c(3) nonprofit corporation. Pathways to Progress is not a registered 501c(3) nonprofit corporation.

Immediately, Pathways to Progress undertook several major projects, including pedestrian streetscape enhancements along First Street (Main Street), and College Avenue. Additionally, Pathways facilitated talks between EWU and a private developer that led to the construction of Brewster Hall, a mixed-use student residence in the downtown core.

Pathways to Progress is no longer an active organization.

Downtown Cheney has since evolved into a more traditional &quot;university district&quot;, hosting numerous community festivals, a farmers&#x27; market, and businesses catering to the college crowd.

Cheney&#x27;s downtown area is also home of the Cheney Historical Museum which is dedicated to gathering, preserving, and sharing information and artifacts concerning the history of the Four Lakes, Marshall, Cheney, Tyler, and Amber districts of southwest Spokane County in eastern Washington. Volunteers open the museum at various times by season and by appointment as well as engage in research and preserving and caring for the collection. Another historic site, the Sterling-Moorman House, is also under development.

Downtown Cheney is the region&#x27;s gateway to the Columbia Plateau Trail and the Fish Lake Trail, both of which explore the unique geology of the Great Ice Age Floods.

===Fairchild Air Force Base===

Fairchild Air Force Base, located approximately north of Cheney and established in 1942, has been a key part of the U.S. defense strategy and its personnel are a substantial portion of the Cheney community. Originally established as a World War II repair depot, it has transitioned over the years from a Strategic Air Command bomber wing during the Cold War, to Air Mobility Command air refueling wing during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, Fairchild&#x27;s aircraft and personnel make up the backbone of the Air Force&#x27;s airborne refueling tanker fleet on the West Coast. Fairchild&#x27;s location north of Cheney and west of Spokane, resulted from a competition with the cities of Seattle and Everett in western Washington. The War Department chose Spokane for several reasons: better weather conditions, the location from the coast, and the Cascade Range providing a natural barrier against possible Japanese attacks.

Fairchild Air Force Base is also the United States Air Force&#x27;s primary training facility for Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Techniques (SERE). SERE is a U.S. military training program developed at the end of the Korean War to provide service members with training in the Code of Conduct, survival skills, evading capture, and dealing with being taken prisoner. It was created by the U.S. Air Force but was expanded to the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy after the Vietnam War. The SERE school at Fairchild AFB is intended to train aircrews, special forces, and other service members who operate in dangerous areas and are thus more likely to be captured.

==Demographics==
The education level of residents in Cheney of the age of 25 is:

* High school or higher: 95.6%
* Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher: 42.3%
* Graduate or professional degree: 13.1%

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 census, there were 10,590 people, 3,902 households, and 1,669 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 4,183 housing units at an average density of .

<text>Country Homes is a census-designated place (CDP) in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 6,251 at the 2020 census. The campus of Whitworth University is located in Country Homes. It is a largely suburban area that blends into the north side of the city of Spokane and the neighboring CDPs of Town and Country and Fairwood.

==History==
What is now Country Homes was part of the traditional homeland of the Spokane people since prehistoric times. The tribe made great use of the nearby Little Spokane River which flows just north of the CDP. The first permanent European presence in the area near Country Homes came in 1810 with the construction of Spokane House by the North West Company of fur traders. The trading post was established where the Little Spokane meets the Spokane River, approximately four-and-a-half miles northwest of the current CDP.

Whitworth University was established in 1890 on the west side of the state and moved to its current location in Country Homes in 1914. Division Street, the main north–south thoroughfare through the north side of Spokane, which carries U.S. Highway 395 through Country Homes, was an unpaved road through the area until 1932 when pavement reached from downtown Spokane to north of &quot;The Y&quot; where U.S. Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 395 fork on the southeastern edge of Country Homes. Further integration with the expanding city of Spokane to the south occurred in 1965 with the construction of Country Homes Boulevard which cuts diagonally across the CDP in a southwest–northeast direction. Country Homes Boulevard connected the expanding suburban areas of Country Homes and areas to the north and northeast of Spokane with the core of the city and the at-the-time new Maple Street Bridge.

As the city of Spokane has grown and expanded north over the decades, Country Homes has remained an unincorporated area of Spokane County. This is despite the city of Spokane annexing areas to the east of Country Homes in 1967 and again in 1985. Areas to the west of Country Homes along the bluff of Five Mile Prairie were annexed in 1975 with additional annexations in 1984 and 1986.

==Geography==
Country Homes is a suburban area on the north side of the Spokane urban area, just over five miles due north of Downtown Spokane. Roughly triangular in shape, the Census Bureau defines the CDP&#x27;s bounds as from Five Mile Road in the northwest, along the northern edge of the Whitworth Campus and to U.S. Highway 2 in the northeast. Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 395, locally known as Division Street, mark the eastern boundary south until Country Homes Boulevard. The boundary follows Country Homes Boulevard southwest to Wall Street. The western boundary is more irregular, largely following a steep bluff which rises up to the Five Mile Prairie neighborhood of Spokane. In addition to Five Mile Prairie, Country Homes borders Spokane&#x27;s Shiloh Hills neighborhood on the east, the CDP of Town and Country to the south and the CDP of Fairwood to the north.
Terrain within the bounds of Country Homes is largely flat and gently sloping to the north from approximately 2,000 feet above sea level in the south to 1,900 feet in the north. There is a steep bluff immediately to the west of Country Homes which rises to over 2,400 feet on what is known as the Five Mile Prairie. The northwestern corner of the CDP is located on the gentlest part of the bluff where development is possible. The southern portion of the bluff is much steeper and less developed, and also contains the Holmberg Conservation Area and park. Another shorter bluff runs along much of the northern boundary, falling off into the valley of the Little Spokane River, which flows just over one mile north of the CDP. A small, ephemeral has cut a valley through the western side of the Whitworth University campus along Waikiki Road down to the Little Spokane.

Country Homes is located at (47.745690, -117.417558). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Deer Park is a city in Spokane County, Washington, United States. The population was 3,652 at the time of the 2010 census, up from 3,017 in 2000.

==History==
North of Spokane, the city of Deer Park was officially incorporated on June 24, 1908. Deer Park got its name when railroad surveyors saw deer grazing in the area. It was settled in 1889 when a railroad siding was built for the Spokane Falls &amp; Northern Railway. Soon the Standard Lumber Company sawmill was established by William Short and George Crawford to provide the lumber needed to rebuild the nearby city of Spokane Falls (later renamed Spokane) following the great fire of 1889. By 1900 the population of Deer Park was approximately 300 residents. In addition to the sawmill, the community consisted of three general stores (owned separately by P. Kelly, Dan Weis, and A. Baldwin), a blacksmith and harness shop, a livery and feed stable, Jeff Moore&#x27;s hotel, Dr. Prince&#x27;s drug store, a public school with approximately 75 students, and a Congregational church led by Rev. F. McConaughy. By this time there were as many as eight sawmills within ten miles of Deer Park, all of which got their supplies in, and employed residents of, the town.

Arcadia Apple Orchards Company was established around 1906, and orchards of apple trees were planted on the land surrounding Deer Park which had been cleared by the logging activity.

The municipal airport east of the city was built during World War II and dedicated in August 1944 with three paved runways, all at in length. During the early 1960s, an Atlas missile site (567-1) near the airport was operated by the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron of Fairchild AFB. Soon obsolete, the site was decommissioned in 1965 and sold for salvage in 1967.
