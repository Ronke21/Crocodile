<doc id="138730" wikidata="Q1569619" url="?curid=138730" title="De Pere, Wisconsin">
<text>De Pere ( ) is a city in Brown County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 25,410 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area.

==History==
When the first European, Jean Nicolet, visited the place in 1634–35, De Pere was the site of a polyglot settlement of several thousand attracted by the fishing at the first rapids of the Fox River. In 1671, French Jesuit explorer Père Claude-Jean Allouez founded the St. Francis Xavier Mission at the last set of rapids on the Fox River before it enters The Bay of Green Bay. The site was known as Rapides Des Pères (rapids of the fathers) which became modern day De Pere.

The present city of De Pere had its beginnings in 1836, when John Penn Arndt and Charles Tullar incorporated the De Pere Hydraulic Company and drew up the first plat of the town. In 1837, a popular vote established De Pere as the county seat of Brown County; it maintained this status until 1854, when another election moved the county seat to Green Bay. 

Politically, under the first township plan for Brown County, the area that is now the city of De Pere fell on the boundary between the town of Howard (which comprised much of the area west of the Fox River) and the town of &quot;Mason&quot;, which comprised roughly the southern half of the county. In 1838, the area was first formally established by the territorial government as a separate township entity. At that time it was named the town of &quot;Wilcox&quot;, for Randall Wilcox, who was then president of the De Pere Hydraulic Company, and it comprised most of the area of the current city of De Pere as well as the area that is now the town of Ledgeview, Wisconsin. 

In 1839, the town of Wilcox was divided along the Fox River, with the eastern half becoming the town of De Pere (Ledgeview); the area west of the river was re-integrated into the town of Howard. The village of De Pere was incorporated within the town of De Pere by an act of the state legislature on March 6, 1857. West De Pere, on the west side of the river, was eventually set off from Howard as a separate town, and in 1870, the village of West De Pere was incorporated. 

The west–east division at the river persisted until 1890. In 1883 the village of De Pere was re-incorporated as the city of De Pere, that same year the village of West De Pere was re-incorporated as the city of Nicolet (after voyageur Jean Nicolet). In 1887 the city of Nicolet was renamed the city of West De Pere, and in 1890 the city of West De Pere was finally consolidated into the city of De Pere to form a single city government.

St. Norbert College, which abuts the banks of the Fox River on the city&#x27;s west side near the Claude Allouez Bridge, was founded by Norbertine Abbot Pennings in 1898.

<text>Denmark is a village in Brown County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 2,408 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village is located within the town of New Denmark.

Denmark began to be settled by Danish immigrants in 1848, and has been referred to, along with Hartland, Wisconsin, as the &quot;nuclei of what developed into one of the most important regions of Danish immigration in the United States.&quot;

==History==
===Early settlement===
In 1846, a Prussian immigrant, John Bartlme, purchased 40 acres of land in the area of what is now Denmark.

In 1848, the second settler, and the first Danish immigrant, a man named Niels Gotfredsen, bought 160 acres in the area. He and his wife were referred to as the &#x27;King and Queen of Denmark&#x27;, because they were the first Danish settlers of the town of Denmark.

====Big bribe of 1854====
In 1854, the residents of Brown County, Wisconsin voted on whether Green Bay or De Pere would be the county seat. This was also the year that the residents of Denmark wanted to build a church, but they did not have any money. A man from De Pere came to the town, and offered to pay two dollars for every vote the people of Denmark would cast in favor of De Pere.

On election day, 15 men and boys from Denmark turned out to cast their votes for De Pere, and the town was given $30. But instead of building a church, as was originally intended, the town built a school.

====First business====
In 1871, Hans Beyer immigrated from old Denmark to New York City, from which he traveled to Green Bay. From Green Bay, Beyer traveled seven hours by ox team to get to Denmark. In 1875, Beyer opened a store in Denmark, which was the first business in the new town, using a loan of $200. In 1896, Beyer built a new store and cheese factory next to the old store.

===Turn of the 20th century===
In 1906, the Chicago &amp; Northwestern railroad was built through the village. The depot was built in the downtown area. The railroad was originally planned to travel through Cooperstown, Wisconsin, rather than Denmark, but railroad officials decided against this plan.

On June 15, 1915, the town of Denmark held a special election of the issue of incorporation. The official vote tally was 109 in favor, and 26 against. Later that year, the Denmark was officially incorporated into a village.

In 1915, the Kriwanek Brothers established a Ford dealership in the village, which was second oldest Ford dealership in the state of Wisconsin.

On March 3, 1949, Denmark State Bank was robbed of $38,000 at gunpoint. This was the first bank robbery in Brown County, Wisconsin. The Federal Bureau of Investigation became involved, and the perpetrators were caught over the next few weeks.

===Later history===
The last passenger train to come through the village was on April 30, 1971.

In 1981, Interstate 43 opened just west of the village.

On September 7, 1988, a Chicago &amp; Northwestern train derailed as it was passing the Lake to Lake cheese plant. 20 of the 144 train cars derailed, including several that were carrying sulfuric acid and fuel oil. The train also had cars that were carrying chlorine, however, the engineer did not know which cars contained the chemical, and the wind was blowing towards a residential district. This information led the village and county officials to evacuate a large portion of the village. It was soon found that none of the chemicals had leaked, and residents were allowed to return to their homes.

In 1996, Wisconsin Central Ltd., which had bought the train line from Chicago &amp; Northwestern, abandoned the tracks between Denmark and Rockwood, Wisconsin The abandoned rail line was converted into the Devil&#x27;s River State Trail, which was completed in 2013.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
Denmark has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with some moderation due to the village&#x27;s proximity to Lake Michigan.

==Infrastructure==

===Highways===
* Interstate 43 Northbound leads to Green Bay. Southbound leads to Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
* WIS 96 begins on the western edge of Denmark, Wisconsin and travels west to Fremont, Wisconsin.
* begins on the western edge of Denmark, Wisconsin and travels east, ending just south of Stangelville, Wisconsin.

===Railroad===

<text>Hobart is a village in Brown County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 10,211 at the 2020 census. Hobart is a part of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village is located entirely within the treaty boundaries of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin.

==History==
On May 13, 2002, the Town of Hobart incorporated as a village. Hobart is named for Episcopal Bishop John Henry Hobart of New York who sent missionaries to the Oneida people and ministered to them after removal from New York to Wisconsin.

==Tribal relations==

Hobart&#x27;s local political scene has been characterized by numerous clashes with the Oneida Nation regarding their sovereignty over the reservation land on which Hobart sits. In 2008, a federal judge upheld restrictive property covenants added to deeds by the Village of Hobart to prevent transfer of certain reservation properties into Oneida federal trust land. In 2010, the village denied a liquor license to an Oneida business on the grounds that the tribe had not paid over $100,000 in stormwater fees for parcels held in tribal trust land; the tribe held that the village had no jurisdiction to charge such fees on tribal trust land. The federal court ruled in favor of the Oneida, and the village&#x27;s appeal was not taken up by the US Supreme Court.

In 2016, the village of Hobart fined the tribe for holding their annual Big Apple Fest on Oneida-owned non-trust land, without first obtaining a village permit. The Oneida Nation sued Hobart in US District Court, and appealed the initial ruling in favor of the village. In 2020, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in the wake of the landmark McGirt v. Oklahoma decision, holding that the tribe had the right to hold its annual event whether or not it received a permit from the village. Public records indicate that in the nine-year period from 2011–2020, Hobart spent nearly $1,000,000 in litigation costs for these court cases.

<text>Suamico ( ) is a village in Brown County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 12,820 at the time of the 2020 census. Suamico is part of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area, and contains the neighborhood community of Flintville.

==History==

&quot;The Indian name Oussuamigong, now spelled Suamico, has several disputed meanings. Father Chrysostom Verwyst explains the meaning as &#x27;place of the yellow beaver.&#x27; Father Jones translates it as &#x27;at the beaver&#x27;s tale.&#x27; Rev. E.P. Wheeler of Ashland, whose study of the Wisconsin Indians has made him an authority, says it means &#x27;yellow residence place.&#x27; It has also been accepted that it means &#x27;point or tail of land,&#x27; or &#x27;the beaver&#x27;s tail,&#x27; which suits us best.&quot;
It is believed the name comes from an Indian word meaning small or little beaver, although this has not been determined with certainty. The original settlement of Suamico was a small fishing community on Green Bay. Little evidence of it, apart from some small housing plots, remains.

Suamico is pronounced (swam ĭ kō). The name Suamico is believed to have come from the Menominee Indians which means: Mäte Sue&#x27;mako Tusi&#x27;niniu, &quot;Great Sand Bar People,&quot; on the sand dunes at what is now called Big Suamico, on Green Bay. Other sources also indicate that the name stands for: beaver tail, yellow beaver, or swan.
Big Suamico was the unofficial name for the river, township, and village called Suamico. It was used to distinguish themselves from the Little Suamico River and Township immediately north in Oconto County. The Suamico and Fort Howard Road was the first declared county road in Brown County laid out between Big Suamico and Fort Howard in 1849–1850. It followed a former Indian trail. The Suamico River flows generally eastward through Pittsfield and Suamico Townships into Green Bay.
Suamico was first established by Legislature on August 2, 1848, from Howard. It was apparently dropped when Oconto County was established on February 6, 1851. It was then re-established to its current size by the County Board on March 16, 1858. Suamico was an excellent farming country and raising stock was profitable. Industry of the 1850s and 1860s was milling and there were large sawmills along the Suamico River. The Suamico Post Office was established on July 20, 1857, with John Bruce as Postmaster. It was platted by John Bruce in 1873.

In a referendum in September 2003, the Town of Suamico voted to become incorporated, becoming the village of Suamico. The village is a bedroom community mostly developed since 1980.

The Winona Junction rail station, a passenger station of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, was formerly located in the town.

This station was first located at the crossing of the Chicago and North Western Railroad before it reached the Winona Rail Bridge. This is where the original approach road for the old wagon bridge ran. When the new Main Channel Bridge was constructed, and the wagon bridge removed, the Winona Junction station was moved to the Northwest, away from the actual crossing, along the CB&amp;Q tracks near to the new approach road. The Flyway trail that opened in 2020 has a bridge that goes directly over the original East Winona junction of the two railroads.

The city is located on a bend in the Mississippi River, where the river flows right at the base of the bluffs on the east side of the valley. Because of this, at some points, the city is only two houses wide; one on each side of Wisconsin Highway 35. Eagle Creek and Waumandee Creek flow into Fountain City Bay northwest of the city limits. Eagle Creek flows around the base of Eagle Bluff, one of the tallest bluffs along the Mississippi.

<text>Potter is a village in Calumet County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 244 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Potter was established near a Native American village along the Manitowoc River. It was originally named Muskratville because of the large number of muskrats that lived in the river and were trapped for their fur. American Civil War Captain Orin R. Potter settled in Potter in 1859 and established a feed mill. That same year he renamed the village Potter Mills, which was later shortened to Potter.

===150 years celebration===
The village celebrated its 150th anniversary on July 19, 2009, with the second parade in the village&#x27;s history. The first parade was a 1907 &quot;Medicine man parade.&quot; Five of Potter&#x27;s great-great grandchildren attended the parade.

==Geography==

<doc id="138789" wikidata="Q5403171" url="?curid=138789" title="Flintlock">
<text>Flintlock is a general term for any firearm that uses a flint-striking ignition mechanism, the first of which appeared in Western Europe in the early 16th century. The term may also apply to a particular form of the mechanism itself, also known as the &quot;true flintlock&quot;, that was introduced in the early 17th century, and gradually replaced earlier firearm-ignition technologies, such as the matchlock, the wheellock, and the earlier flintlock mechanisms such as the snaplock and snaphaunce.

The true flintlock continued to be in common use for over two centuries, replaced by percussion cap and, later, the cartridge-based systems in the early-to-mid 19th century. Although long superseded by modern firearms, flintlock weapons enjoy continuing popularity with black-powder shooting enthusiasts.

==History==

French court gunsmith Marin le Bourgeoys made a firearm incorporating a flintlock mechanism for King Louis XIII shortly after his accession to the throne in 1610. However, firearms using some form of flint ignition mechanism had already been in use for over half a century. The first proto-flintlock was the snaplock, which was probably invented shortly before 1517 and was inarguably in use by 1547. Their cost and delicacy limited their use; for example around 1662, only one in six firearms used by the British royal army was a snaphaunce, the rest being matchlocks. The development of firearm lock mechanisms had proceeded from the matchlock to wheellock to the earlier flintlocks (snaplock, snaphance, miquelet, and doglock) in the previous two centuries, and each type had been an improvement, contributing design features to later firearms which were useful. Le Bourgeoys fitted these various features together to create what became known as &quot;the&quot; flintlock or &quot;true&quot; flintlock.

Flintlock firearms differed from the then more common and cheaper to manufacture matchlock arms in that they were fired by the spark of the flint against the powder charge rather than by the direct application of a lighted length of cord or (as it was then called) &quot;match&quot;. This was particularly important with men armed with muskets guarding artillery trains where a lighted cord (&quot;match&quot;) would have been a dangerous fire hazard. Such men armed with these flintlocks were called &quot;fusiliers&quot; as flintlocks were then called &quot;fusils&quot; from the French word for such. Various types were in use by elite infantry, scouts, artillery guards (as noted), and private individuals in European armies throughout most of the 16th and 17th centuries, though matchlocks continued to overwhelmingly outnumber them. The early Dutch States Army used flintlocks on an unusually large scale, issuing snaphances to its infantry in the 1620s and true flintlocks by 1640. While it is known that the Dutch were the first power to adopt the flintlock as the standard infantry weapon, the exact chronology of the transition is uncertain.

The new flintlock system quickly became popular and was known and used in various forms throughout Europe by 1630, although older flintlock systems continued to be used for some time. Examples of early flintlock muskets can be seen in the painting &quot;Marie de&#x27; Medici as Bellona&quot; by Rubens (painted around 1622–1625). These flintlocks were in use alongside older firearms such as matchlocks, wheellocks, and miquelet locks for nearly a hundred years. The last major European power to standardize the flintlock was the Holy Roman Empire, when in 1702 the Emperor instituted a new regulation that all matchlocks were to be converted or scrapped. The &quot;true&quot; flintlock was less expensive to manufacture than earlier flintlocks, which along with general economic development allowed every European soldier to have one by the 18th century. Compared to the earlier matchlock, flintlocks could be reloaded roughly twice as fast, misfired far less often, and were easier to use in various environments due to the fact that they did not require a lit match. This instantly changed the calculus of infantry combat; by one calculation, a formation equipped entirely with flintlocks (with paper cartridges) could output ten times as many shots in an equivalent period of time as a typical early 17th-century pike and shot formation equipped with matchlocks (pike:shot ratio of 3:2).

Various breech-loading flintlocks were developed starting around 1650. The most popular action has a barrel that was unscrewed from the rest of the gun. This is more practical on pistols because of the shorter barrel length. This type is known as a Queen Anne pistol because it was during her reign that it became popular (although it was actually introduced in the reign of King William III). Another type has a removable screw plug set into the side or top or bottom of the barrel. A large number of sporting rifles were made with this system, as it allowed easier loading compared with muzzle loading with a tight-fitting bullet and patch.

One of the more successful was the system built by Isaac de la Chaumette starting in 1704. The barrel could be opened by three revolutions of the triggerguard, to which it was attached. The plug stayed attached to the barrel and the ball and powder were loaded from the top. This system was improved in the 1770s by Colonel Patrick Ferguson and 100 experimental rifles used in the American Revolutionary War. The only two flintlock breech loaders to be produced in quantity were the Hall and the Crespi. The first was invented by John Hall and patented c. 1817. It was issued to the U.S. Army as the Model 1819 Hall Breech Loading Rifle.

The Hall rifles and carbines were loaded using a combustible paper cartridge inserted into the upward tilting breechblock. Hall rifles leaked gas from the often poorly fitted action. The same problem affected the muskets produced by Giuseppe Crespi and adopted by the Austrian Army in 1771. Nonetheless, the Crespi System was experimented with by the British during the Napoleonic Wars, and percussion Halls guns saw service in the American Civil War.

Flintlock weapons were commonly used until the mid 19th century, when they were replaced by percussion lock systems. Even though they have long been considered obsolete, flintlock weapons continue to be produced today by manufacturers such as Pedersoli, Euroarms, and Armi Sport. Not only are these weapons used by modern re-enactors, but they are also used for hunting, as many U.S. states have dedicated hunting seasons for black-powder weapons, which includes both flintlock and percussion lock weapons.

Even after it became dominant in Europe, the flintlock did not proliferate globally. Flintlocks were far more complicated to manufacture than simple matchlocks, thus less-developed countries continued to use the latter into the mid 19th century, long after Europe had made the switch in the late 17th. In the Indian subcontinent, the natively-manufactured toradar matchlock was the most common firearm type until about 1830. The Sinhalese Kingdoms locally produced flintlock mechanisms for long-barreled muskets known as the Bondikula known for its unique bifurcated butt and heavy ornamentation. These were widely used during the 17th-18th centuries. In China, some flintlocks had been acquired and illustrated by 1635, but they were not adopted by the army. An 1836 British report about the Qing dynasty&#x27;s military strength noted that all Chinese firearms were &quot;ill-made&quot; matchlocks, with no flintlocks or any of the other &quot;tribes of firearm.&quot;

Southeast Asia was in a similar position to China and India. The Vietnamese were introduced to flintlocks by the Dutch in the 1680s, and bought some from European merchants. Flintlocks began to appear in Javanese arsenals in the first decade of the eighteenth century and the Dutch began to supply flintlocks to the rulers of Surabaya in the 1710s and 1720s. But matchlocks remained prominent until the mid-19th century, and the Southeast Asian states generally lacked the ability to natively produce the flintlock. The Jiaozhi arquebus was still the main firearm of Nguyễn dynasty musketeers at the end of the 18th century. The Burmese only obtained a majority of flintlocks in their armed forces by the 1860s (the Burmese kings demanded to be paid in surplus European muskets instead of currency), at which point the European powers had already moved on to percussion cap firearms.

==Subtypes==

Flintlocks may be any type of small arm: long gun or pistol, smoothbore or rifle, muzzleloader or breechloader.

===Pistols===
Flintlock pistols were used as self-defense weapons and as a military arm. Their effective range was short, and they were frequently used as an adjunct to a sword or cutlass. Pistols were usually smoothbore although some rifled pistols were produced.

Flintlock pistols came in a variety of sizes and styles which often overlap and are not well defined, many of the names we use having been applied by collectors and dealers long after the pistols were obsolete. The smallest were less than long and the largest were over . From around the beginning of the 1700s the larger pistols got shorter, so that by the late 1700s the largest would be around long. The smallest would fit into a typical pocket or a hand warming muff and could easily be carried by women.

The largest sizes would be carried in holsters across a horse&#x27;s back just ahead of the saddle. In-between sizes included the coat pocket pistol, or coat pistol, which would fit into a large pocket, the coach pistol, meant to be carried on or under the seat of a coach in a bag or box, and belt pistols, sometimes equipped with a hook designed to slip over a belt or waistband. Larger pistols were called horse pistols. Arguably the most elegant of the pistol designs was the Queen Anne pistol, which was made in all sizes.

Arguably the high point of the mechanical development of the flintlock pistol was the British duelling pistol; it was highly reliable, water resistant and accurate. External decoration was minimal but craftsmanship was evident, and the internal works were often finished to a higher degree of craftsmanship than the exterior. Dueling pistols were the size of the horse pistols of the late 1700s, around long and were usually sold in pairs along with accessories in a wooden case with compartments for each piece.

===Muskets===

Flintlock muskets were the mainstay of European armies between 1660 and 1840. A musket was a muzzle-loading smoothbore long gun that was loaded with a round lead ball, but it could also be loaded with shot for hunting. For military purposes, the weapon was loaded with ball, or a mixture of ball with several large shot (called buck and ball), and had an effective range of about . Smoothbore weapons that were designed for hunting birds were called &quot;fowlers.&quot; Flintlock muskets tended to be of large caliber and usually had no choke, allowing them to fire full-caliber balls.

Military flintlock muskets tended to weigh approximately 10 pounds (4.53 kg), as heavier weapons were found to be too cumbersome, and lighter weapons were not rugged or heavy enough to be used in hand-to-hand combat. They were usually designed to be fitted with a bayonet. On flintlocks, the bayonet played a primarily a deterrence role - casualty lists from several battles in the 18th century showed that fewer than 2% of wounds were caused by bayonets.

Antoine-Henri Jomini, a celebrated military author of the Napoleonic period who served in numerous armies during that period, stated that the majority of bayonet charges in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contacts were made. Flintlock weapons were not used like modern rifles. They tended to be fired in mass volleys, followed by bayonet charges in which the weapons were used much like the pikes that they replaced. Because they were also used as pikes, military flintlocks tended to be approximately in length (without the bayonet attached), and used bayonets that were approximately in length.

===Rifles===

In Germany, the Jäger rifle was developed by the late 18th century. It was used for hunting, and in a military context, skirmishing and by specialist marksmen.
In the United States, the small game hunting long rifle (&quot;Pennsylvania rifle&quot; or &quot;Kentucky rifle&quot;) was developed in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1700s. Based on the Jäger rifle, but with a much longer barrel, these were exceptionally accurate for their time, and had an effective range of approximately . They tended to fire smaller caliber rounds, with calibers in the range of being the most common - hence being sometimes referred to as a &quot;pea rifle.&quot;

The Jezail was a military long flintlock rifle, developed near and popular throughout Afghanistan, India, Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.

However, while European military tactics remained based on loosely-aimed mass volleys, most of their flintlocks were still smoothbore - as the spiral grooves of rifling made rifles take more time to load, and after repeated shots black powder tended to foul the barrels.

Rifled flintlocks saw most military use by sharpshooters, skirmishers, and other support units. While by the late 18th century there were increasing efforts to take advantage of the rifle for military purposes, with specialist rifle units such as the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps of 1756 and Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), smoothbores predominated until the advent of the Minié ball – by which time the percussion cap had made the flintlock obsolete.

===Multishot flintlock weapons===

====Multiple barrels====

Because of the time needed to reload (even experts needed 15 seconds to reload a smooth-bore, muzzle-loading musket), flintlocks were sometimes produced with two, three, four or more barrels for multiple shots. These designs tended to be costly to make and were often unreliable and dangerous. While weapons like double barreled shotguns were reasonably safe, weapons like the pepperbox revolver would sometimes fire all barrels simultaneously, or would sometimes just explode in the user&#x27;s hand. It was often cheaper, safer, and more reliable to carry several single-shot weapons instead.

====Single barrel====

Some repeater rifles, multishot single barrel pistols, and multishot single barrel revolvers were also made. Notable are the Puckle gun, Mortimer, Kalthoff, Michele Lorenzoni, Abraham Hill, Cookson pistols, the Jennings repeater and the Elisha Collier revolver.

==Drawbacks==

Flintlocks were prone to many problems compared to modern weapons. Misfires were common. The flint had to be properly maintained, as a dull or poorly knapped piece of flint would not make as much of a spark and would increase the misfire rate dramatically. Moisture was a problem, since moisture on the frizzen or damp powder would prevent the weapon from firing. This rendered flintlock weapons unusable in rainy or damp weather. Some armies attempted to remedy this by using a leather cover over the lock mechanism, but this proved to have only limited success.

Accidental firing was also a problem for flintlocks. A burning ember left in the barrel could ignite the next powder charge as it was loaded. This could be avoided by waiting between shots for any leftover residue to completely burn. Running a lubricated cleaning patch down the barrel with the ramrod would also extinguish any embers, and would clean out some of the barrel fouling as well. Soldiers on the battlefield could not take these precautions. They had to fire as quickly as possible, often firing three to four rounds per minute. Loading and firing at such a pace dramatically increased the risk of an accidental discharge.

When a flintlock was fired it sprayed a shower of sparks forwards from the muzzle and another sideways out of the flash-hole. One reason for firing in volleys was to ensure that one man&#x27;s sparks didn&#x27;t ignite the next man&#x27;s powder as he was in the act of loading.

An accidental frizzen strike could also ignite the main powder charge, even if the pan had not yet been primed. Some modern flintlock users will still place a leather cover over the frizzen while loading as a safety measure to prevent this from happening. However, this does slow down the loading time, which prevented safety practices such as this from being used on the battlefields of the past.

The black powder used in flintlocks would quickly foul the barrel, which was a problem for rifles and for smooth bore weapons that fired a tighter fitting round for greater accuracy. Each shot would add more fouling to the barrel, making the weapon more and more difficult to load. Even if the barrel was badly fouled, the flintlock user still had to properly seat the round all the way to the breech of the barrel. Leaving an air gap in between the powder and the round (known as &quot;short starting&quot;) was very dangerous, and could cause the barrel to explode.

Handling loose black powder was also dangerous, for obvious reasons. Powder measures, funnels, and other pieces of equipment were usually made out of brass to reduce the risk of creating a spark, which could ignite the powder. Soldiers often used pre-made paper cartridges, which unlike modern cartridges were not inserted whole into the weapon. Instead, they were tubes of paper that contained a pre-measured amount of powder and a lead ball. Although paper cartridges were safer to handle than loose powder, their primary purpose was not safety related at all. Instead, paper cartridges were used mainly because they sped up the loading process. A soldier did not have to take the time to measure out powder when using a paper cartridge. He simply tore open the cartridge, used a small amount of powder to prime the pan, then dumped the remaining powder from the cartridge into the barrel.

The black powder used in flintlocks contained sulfur. If the weapon was not cleaned after use, sulfur dioxide in the powder residue would absorb moisture, producing sulfuric and sulfonic acids which would erode the inside of the gun barrel and the lock mechanism. Flintlock weapons that were not properly cleaned and maintained would corrode to the point of being destroyed.

Most flintlocks were produced at a time before modern manufacturing processes became common. Even in mass-produced weapons, parts were often handmade. If a flintlock became damaged, or parts wore out due to age, the damaged parts were not easily replaced. Parts would often have to be filed down, hammered into shape, or otherwise modified so that they would fit, making repairs much more difficult. Machine-made, interchangeable parts began to be used only shortly before flintlocks were replaced by caplocks.

==Method of operation==

* A cock tightly holding a sharp piece of flint is rotated to half-cock, where the sear falls into a safety notch on the tumbler, preventing an accidental discharge.
* The operator loads the gun, usually from the muzzle end, with black powder from a powder flask, followed by lead shot, a round lead ball, usually wrapped in a piece of paper or a cloth patch, all rammed down with a ramrod that is usually stored on the underside of the barrel. Wadding between the charge and the ball was often used in earlier guns.
* The flash pan is primed with a small amount of very finely ground gunpowder, and the flashpan lid or frizzen is closed.

The gun is now in a &quot;primed and loaded&quot; state, and this is how it would typically be carried while hunting or if going into battle.

To fire:

* The cock is further rotated from half-cock to full-cock, releasing the safety lock on the cock.
* The gun is leveled and the trigger is pulled, releasing the cock holding the flint.
* The flint strikes the frizzen, a piece of steel on the priming pan lid, opening it and exposing the priming powder.
* The contact between flint and frizzen produces a shower of sparks (burning pieces of the metal) that is directed into the gunpowder in the flashpan.
* The powder ignites, and the flash passes through a small hole in the barrel (called a vent or touchhole) that leads to the combustion chamber where it ignites the main powder charge, and the gun discharges.

The British Army and the Continental Army both used paper cartridges to load their weapons. The powder charge and ball were instantly available to the soldier inside this small paper envelope. To load a flintlock weapon using a paper cartridge, a soldier would

* move the cock to the half-cock position;
* tear the cartridge open with his teeth;
* fill the flashpan half-full with powder, directing it toward the vent;
* close the frizzen to keep the priming charge in the pan;
* pour the rest of the powder down the muzzle and stuff the cartridge in after it;
* take out the ramrod and ram the ball and cartridge all the way to the breech;
* replace the ramrod;
* shoulder the weapon.

The weapon can then be fully cocked and fired.

==Cultural impact==
Firearms using some form of flintlock mechanism were the main form of firearm for over 200 years. It was not until Reverend Alexander John Forsyth invented a rudimentary percussion cap system in 1807 that the flintlock system began to decline in popularity. The percussion ignition system was more weatherproof and reliable than the flintlock, but the transition from flintlock to percussion cap was a slow one, and the percussion system was not widely used until around 1830. The Model 1840 U.S. musket was the last flintlock firearm produced for the U.S. military. However, obsolete flintlocks saw action in the earliest days of the American Civil War. For example, in 1861, the Army of Tennessee had over 2,000 flintlock muskets in service.

As a result of the flintlock&#x27;s long active life, it left lasting marks on the language and on drill and parade. Terms such as: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; remain current in English. In addition, the weapon positions and drill commands that were originally devised to standardize carrying, loading and firing a flintlock weapon remain the standard for drill and display (see manual of arms).

<text>Anson is a town in Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 2,076 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated communities of Anson and Jim Falls are located in the town. The town was named after Anson Burlingame, a Massachusetts politician, diplomat and lawyer.

==History==
The squares that became Anson were first surveyed in the fall of 1848 by crews working for the U.S. government. In August 1849, a crew marked all the section corners, walking the woods and wading the rivers on foot, measuring with chain and compass. When completed, the deputy surveyor filed this general description of the six by six square that contains southeastern Anson, but not the Chippewa river:
&quot;In the Northern half of this Town, except a portion of the 5th and all of the west range of Sections, the Surface is flat and the Soil wet and poor. The Southern part generally level, and except in the vicinity of Streams, the Soil is dry and Sandy, as is also part of the 5th and 6th tiers of Sections. Yellow River, which courses through the Southern tier of Sections, is the only Stream in the town upon which there are any Mill Sites, on whose banks are calculated for Such purposes. The banks of the Small Streams are composed of Sand and generally low and the currents Sluggish. There is no Pine timber worthy of note in this town. Tamarack appears to be the prevailing kind, particularly in the North-eastern part. In the remaining portion of the town there are several varieties, viz: Aspen, Birch, Ash, Maple, Elm and Small Pine.&quot;

<text>Chippewa Falls () is a city located on the Chippewa River in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 14,731 in the 2020 census. Incorporated as a city in 1869, it is the county seat of Chippewa County. The city&#x27;s name originated from its location on the Chippewa River, which is named after the Ojibwe. It is a principal city of the Eau Claire–Chippewa Falls metropolitan area.

Chippewa Falls is the birthplace of Seymour Cray, known as the &quot;father of supercomputing&quot;, and the headquarters for the original Cray Research. It is also the home of the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company, the Heyde Center for the Arts, a showcase venue for artists and performers; Irvine Park, and the annual Northern Wisconsin State Fair. Chippewa Falls is from the annual four-day music festivals Country Fest and Rock Fest.

==History==
For thousands of years the Chippewa River was a water highway through a wilderness of forests and swamps, travelled by Ojibwe people, Lakota and others. More recently, Native Americans guided European explorers up the river and around the Falls. Pierre LeSueur &quot;discovered&quot; the Chippewa Spring in 1700 when this area was part of New France. Jonathan Carver traveled up the river with his party in 1768 when the area was claimed by Britain.

White settlement of the Chippewa Falls area began in 1838, when Lyman Warren and his mostly-Chippewa wife started a farm and blacksmith shop five miles above the Falls. As agreed at the 1825 treaty of Prairie du Chien, Warren was to act as a sub-agent for the U.S. government to the Chippewas. Intertwined with that, Warren&#x27;s farm served as a trading post for the American Fur Company.

The Chippewa River&#x27;s watershed held a huge amount of valuable timber - more than the Wisconsin River, and before railroad and roads, the only way to transport much of it out was down the river, through what would become Chippewa Falls. When the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters opened this part of northern Wisconsin to logging, Jean Brunett led a team up the Chippewa River to build a sawmill at the Falls. With great effort and expense, they managed to build the first mill there. It survived until June 1846, when a storm flooded the river and destroyed most of the millworks. The mill was rebuilt quickly and sawing resumed.

A settlement grew around the sawmill at the Falls, and in 1854 Chippewa Falls was chosen to be the seat of Chippewa County. A school, a post office, a mercantile store, the first churches, and the first newspaper had all opened by 1857. The city incorporated in 1869 with about 2,500 people. In the 1870s boardwalks were added along Bridge Street, gas streetlights were installed, and a telephone line was run up from Eau Claire.

Railroads also arrived in the 1870s. In 1870, the West Wisconsin Railway had built a line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Milwaukee, running ten miles to the south through Eau Claire. In 1875 the Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls Railway connected that line from Eau Claire to Chippewa Falls. In 1880, the CF&amp;W was joined by the Wisconsin and Minnesota Railway pushing its way west from Abbotsford. This was followed in 1881 by the Chippewa Falls &amp; Northern Railroad, which built a line north from Chippewa Falls to Bloomer, eventually extending it to Superior.

Lumbering continued to grow. By the 1880s the Chippewa valley held the best stand of white pine left in the Midwest. The sawmill at Chippewa Falls was run by the Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company, and the company&#x27;s logging crews cut trees on their lands upstream in winter and drove logs down to the sawmill at the Falls each spring. The company employed 400 people and the mill at Chippewa was said to be &quot;the largest sawmill under one roof in the world.&quot;
The Chippewa Spring gained renewed attention in 1887 when politician Thaddeus C. Pound founded the Chippewa Springs Health Club, and at one point oversaw the company that bottled the spring water for sale. A Spring House was built over the original spring in 1893. It remains today, across from the modern water bottling plant on Park Ave.

Other industries started in the 1880s and 1890s: flour mills, a brewery, a woolen mill, cigar factories, a shoe factory, and a broom factory. By 1902 it had become clear that the pineries were not as inexhaustible as many had thought, and a group of business leaders began to promote more diverse industries. They succeeded in starting more shoe factories, a sugar beet factory, and a glove factory. The big sawmill closed in 1911, but the other industries kept the community going. By 1920 the city had fifty manufacturers who employed 3,000 workers.

In November 1849 a crew marked all the section corners of the 6 by 6 township that is now entirely within Colburn, walking the woods and swamps on foot, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;There is but little land fit for agricultural purposes in this Township. The surface is level and Swampy. There is Some good Pine in it – Considerable Hemlock and Fir, Birch, Sugar, Ash [?]. Yellow River runs through the Township from North to South.

<text>Cornell is a city in Chippewa County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,453 at the 2020 census, down from 1,467 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Chippewa River, upstream from Lake Wissota and Chippewa Falls, where Highway 64 crosses the river and Highway 27.

==History==
The Cornell area was long visited by Sioux and Chippewa people passing up and down the Chippewa River.

The early white settlement was called &quot;Brunet Falls&quot;, named for Jean Brunet, who opened a trading post in the area in 1843. Brunet was a French-born American who served in the U.S. Army and led the building in 1836 of the first dam and sawmill in the then-wilderness at Chippewa Falls. After that he moved up the river another 30 miles and built a log cabin a mile below what would become Cornell on the west bank of the river. From his log cabin he ran a trading post that initially served Indians, and later grew into a stopping place (inn) for loggers and traders heading upriver.

The city was named for Ezra Cornell, one of the founders of Western Union, who owned a very large amount of timber land in the area. Upon his death in 1874, this land became a part of the endowment for the Ivy League university that bears his name.

Cornell has the U.S.&#x27;s only surviving pulpwood stacker, a huge device built next to the Chippewa River in 1911 to quickly and safely stack large quantities of pulpwood logs for storage until they could be processed in the paper mill nearby. The stacker has been unused since 1971, but is considered a historical treasure.

==Geography==

==Demographics==
As of 2000 the median income for a household in the city was $30,690, and the median income for a family was $38,313. Males had a median income of $30,776 versus $19,808 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,494. About 6.8% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.1% of those under age 18 and 5.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Attractions==
Brunet Island State Park is adjacent to the city. The northern trailhead for the Old Abe State Trail, a paved rail-trail, is located downtown.

Cornell has the world&#x27;s only surviving pulpwood stacker. The stacker helped to launch the huge timber industry in the Northwoods of Wisconsin in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It was used to move large quantities of pulpwood logs, making the process of stacking wood faster, safer, and easier. The stacker has been unused since 1972, but is considered a historical treasure. An annual town fair, known as the Stacker Festival, continues today.

==History==
The first settlers in this area settled along the Chippewa River. In 1848, when the first surveyors passed through for the U.S. government, they found few &quot;improvements&quot; in the land away from the river, but along the river they noted a number of settlers, in what would become the town of Eagle Point. For the square that includes the part of Eagle Point below modern Jim Falls, the surveyor wrote this general description:
The Surface of this Township except in the vicinity of the Streams is level or gently rolling.

The Soil East of the River is Sandy 3rd rate West of the River Loam &amp; Sand 2nd rate.

North of Gauthier Creek and west of the River the Surface is covered with Aspen thickets and Oak timber. East of Chippewa River and North of Yellow River are Pileti(?) Pine openings South of Yellow River and along the Chippewa Yellow and White Pine of a good quality. The Swamps in Sections 34 and 35 are timbered with Tamarac Black Ash and Birch.
The Prairie in this Township is nearly level has a light sandy soil and can be easily brought into cultivation.

A Saw Mill and 4 dwelling houses on the N.W. 1/4 of Section No. 25. belonging to Moses &amp; Co. A Saw Mill and Dwelling House on the N.E. 1/4 of Section No. 16 belonging to Henry O&#x27;Neal. A Dwelling House Blacksmith Shop &amp; other buildings at the mouth of Gauthier Creek belonging to Gauthier A farm on Section 20 and a House on Section 21 belonging to Stephen McCan and a House near the center of Section 29 belonging to Warren(?) and a small field near the North side of Section 32 and a Dwelling House At the foot of Eagle Rapids belonging to James Allen are all the improvements in This Township.

The same crew surveyed the next six-mile square up the river, north of modern Jim Falls, finding more settlers:
This Township has a gently rolling surface is well watered and has a good soil of Loam, Sand and gravel.

It is well timbered in every part with White Pine White &amp; Black Oak Lind Elm Ash and Sugar tree.

The White Pine growing indiscriminately in the Swamps on the(?) ridges and along the Streams but it is more plenty(?) on the borders(?) of the Swamps and Streams than it is in the Swamps or on the ridges.

The Swamps are generally timbered with Tamarac Spruce Birch Black Ash and Maple White Cedar and Hemlock These Swamps are covered with a thick layer of Moss Which usually rests on a sand &amp; gravel bottom(?). In many places the vegetable deposit is several feet thick.

There are six dwelling Houses in this Township, one on the N.W. 1/4 of the N.W. 1/4 of Section 2 One on the S.W. 1/4 of N.W. 1/4 of Section 2 belonging to Daniel McCan. One in Section 20 belonging to Donaldson &amp; Co on the East Side of the river One on the West side of the River owned by Gauthier(?) One on the West side of the River in Section 30 and a farm in Sections 30 and 31 on the West side of the River belonging to David(?) Armitager(?) Who lives on the N.E. 1/4 of the S.W. 1/4 of Section No. 30

The rapids in This Township in Section 16 fall about 10 feet in one fourth of a Mile and offer every(?) facility for mill builders Also the rapids in(?) Section 30. Called Armitagers(?) falls afford Water power to any amount of the River falling about 50 feet in 3/4 of a Mile.

In 1861, Daniel McCann, who was a resident of Eagle Point, encountered Ahgamahwegezhig. This Indian had captured an eaglet, which he gave to McCann in exchange for a bushel of corn. After McCann sold the eagle to soldiers of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, she became their mascot Old Abe and accompanied them during many battles of the Civil War.

<text>:&quot; Lake Holcombe is also a popular name for the Holcombe Flowage&quot;.
Lake Holcombe is a town in Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Its population was 1,031 at the 2010 census. The census-designated place of Holcombe is located in the town.

==History==

The area that would become Holcombe was first surveyed in 1852 by crews working for the U.S. government. One crew marked all the section corners of the township, walking through the woods and wading the rivers, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains a few(?) small Cedar &amp; Tamarac Swamp, All unfit for cultivation. The surface is generally level, soil second rate and most of (?) fit for cultivation. The Township is covered with timber mostly Pine, Hemlock, Tamarac, Cedar and some Sugar Birch and Maple. The Chippewa River runs in a southerly direction through the west part of the Township and Fisher River runs through the South East part Both of the streams have a rapid current and furnish good motive power for Mills.&quot;

Originally called Little Falls in the 1870s, the community was established by the Union Lumbering Company along the Chippewa River and came to be known as Holcombe years later.

The original Little Falls dam was built in 1878 by Elijah Swift and Joseph Viles for the Chippewa River Improvement and Log Driving Company. It was big for the time, a wooden dam wide and high with 32 floodgates. Its main aim was to provide reliable water for floating logs downstream, even when natural water levels were low. With its gates wide open it could raise the Chippewa , downstream. Parts of the dam were washed out by floods in 1880 and 1884. After the second washout, a dam-building specialist named Billy &quot;the Beaver&quot; England was brought in. He and his crew rebuilt the dam in the winter of 1884–1885, and it survived the floods for many years after. The journal of the dam&#x27;s keeper from 1882 to 1890 still survives, briefly describing log drives and jams and the flood of 1884. A terrible accident occurred in 1905, when eleven log drivers drowned trying to get to a log jam near the dam. The dam functioned until 1910, when logging operations ceased. It washed out in the 1920s.

The current hydroelectric dam was built in 1950 by the Wisconsin-Minnesota Light and Power Company, producing the current Holcombe Flowage. The flowage is a popular recreation area, and the shores are thick with homes and cottages.

==Geography==

The town of Lake Holcombe is roughly a by 6 mile square, except that the west end is cut off by the Chippewa River, and a few square miles are added in the southwest. The Holcombe Flowage (&quot;Lake Holcombe&quot;) takes up the northern part of the town&#x27;s western boundary, impounding the Chippewa River itself but also extending east across the northern part of the town where the Jump River enters.

<text>Sampson is a town in Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 892 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The squares that would become Sampson were first surveyed in June 1852 by a crew working for the U.S. government. That fall other crews marked all the section corners of the six mile squares, walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description of the western six miles:
This Township contains numerous small ponds many of them have no outlet the bottoms are sand or gravel the water clear and abound in fish, The Lake superior Trail comes in in section 34 with a N.N.W. cours passes over a divideing ridge between the waters of Oneals creek and those of Duncans Creek and goes out of sec 6, West of this Trail is a large swamp unfit for cultivation, the largest portion of this Township is well Timbered with Pine &amp; Hard Wood

A different crew surveyed the eastern six miles of the town, describing it thus:
This Township contains a great many Lakes and Swamps one Stream of water on the East Side. The Timber on dry land principally pine some maple and Birch. The Soil Generally is 2d Rate on dry land; in the swamps unfit for Cultivation.

The town is named for Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, a hero of the Spanish–American War.

<text>Stanley is a city in Chippewa and Clark counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 3,804 at the 2020 census. Of this, 3,804 were in Chippewa County, and none were in Clark County.

== History ==
Stanley was settled and platted in 1881 in the Town of Delmar when the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line through Chippewa County. The settlement was named for Lemuel C. Stanley, a merchant and railroad man from Chippewa Falls who was involved in that first plat. The main early businesses were a small steam sawmill and some charcoal kilns built by the York Iron Company in 1887.

In 1891 the Northwestern Lumber Company from Eau Claire started a big lumber mill at Stanley. Starting in the 1860s, Northwestern had sawed its lumber at its company town Porter&#x27;s Mills, on the Chippewa River four miles below Eau Claire. But by the early 1890s Northwestern had exhausted its holdings of timber easy to drive down the river. Timber stands still remained on land away from the rivers, so Northwestern switched its model from river-logging to railroad-logging, and shut down Porter&#x27;s Mills. The company built a new mill at Stanley and spawned the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway to haul logs out of the country to the north and south. (The railway never reached Merrill or Phillips; its furthest reach was Walrath, to the north of Jump River.) The mill in Stanley sawed wood until 1920, when Northwestern&#x27;s timber holdings in the area were largely exhausted. Over that period, the mill is estimated to have sawed 850 million board feet of lumber.

Through the 1890s the population of Stanley increased from 500 to 2500. Stanley became a village in 1895 and separated politically from the Town of Delmar as the City of Stanley in 1898. In 1897, attracted by rail connections and the supply of hemlock bark, the U.S. Leather Company opened a tannery in Stanley which employed 200 men and by 1908 tanned 75,000 hides shipped in from Chicago to South America. Stanley&#x27;s other big early industry was the Big Four Canning Factory on the north side of town, where immigrant farmers brought wagonloads of peas, cabbage, corn and beets grown on the logging cutover. In 1914 Big Four produced up to 100,000 cans of vegetables per day, shipping them all over the country.
On May 18, 1906, a fire started in one of the Northwest Lumber Company buildings east of the current Chapman Lake in what is now Fandry Park. The fire quickly spread to other businesses and into the residential area to the east. It ended up destroying a number of business buildings, two churches, and about seventy homes. But neighbors helped neighbors, businesses rebuilt (some with fireproof brick), and the city moved on. The Northwestern Lumber Company had started a brickyard around 1900, digging its clay north of Chapman Park&#x27;s location. After the fire in 1906, production increased greatly to rebuild Stanley and buildings as far off as Eau Claire and Auburndale.

On May 20, 2002, the City of Stanley annexed a portion of land in the Town of Thorp in Clark County.

On December 15, 2021, an EF2 tornado went through the city starting southwest and went northeast. It damaged several buildings including the historic train depot. There was no Injuries/Deaths.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Stanley is located primarily on the north side of Wisconsin State Highway 29. It is mostly in Chippewa County, but parts of the east side are in Clark County.

==Demographics==

The per capita income for the city was $19,421. About 4.0% of families and 8.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.8% of those under age 18 and 11.2% of those age 65 or over.

There are 14.6 primary care physicians per 100,000 population in Stanley compared to the statewide average of 75.6. By 2035, the area is expected to have a 53% deficit in physicians, the fifth largest predicted deficit in Wisconsin. There are no behavioral health physicians in Stanley.

<text>Curtiss is a village in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 216 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Curtiss is located at (44.953574, -90.433228).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
Curtiss was established as a rural railroad station in 1882 and is named after the chief engineer who built the railroad. The village of Curtiss was platted November 17, 1882, having been surveyed by Edwin Parks. The surrounding area was occupied primarily by Norwegian and German emigrants. The primary industries were dairy farming and lumber. By the 1890s, several cheese factories were established in the surrounding townships of Mayville, Hoard and Colby. Additionally, A. D. Bass operated a large sawmill in the southern part of the village. An application for incorporation of the village was made to the State of Wisconsin on October 14, 1914: however, actual incorporation was not granted until March 30, 1917 (Curtiss Centennial Booklet). A two-room school served elementary grades until 1966 when the school was consolidated with the nearby Abbotsford Public Schools.

Perhaps the most famous person to come out of the Village of Curtiss was Army Colonel Franklin Matthias, who oversaw the construction and early operation of the Hanford Site during World War II. The young Colonel Matthias was so proud of his work that he accompanied the first plutonium produced at Hanford to Los Alamos.

On June 8, 1905, a hail storm damaged nearly every building in the village.

On October 15, 1974, Curtiss was the site of a protest by the National Farmers Organization (NFO). NFO farmers slaughtered and buried in a trench 638 calves, mostly less than two weeks old. The protest was in response to the low price of veal. At the time, veal calves were selling for $0.17 per pound, resulting in a net loss to the farmer due to high feed costs. Public backlash against the NFO and the protest was great, with President Ford weighing in to call it &quot;shocking and senseless.&quot;
In 1976, the US EPA aided the village with a grant to establish a municipal sewer and water system. The system was expanded in the 1990s and again in the 2000s to account for industrial growth related to the meat packing industry.
