<text>Franklin is a town in and the county seat of Pendleton County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 486 at the 2020 census. Franklin was established in 1794 and named for Francis Evick, an early settler.

==History==
The Town of Franklin is situated in the Allegheny Mountains on the eastern edge of the Monongahela National Forest and along the South Branch of the Potomac River. This region was populated by Native American cultures for centuries prior to the arrival of English immigrants in the mid-18th century. During the French and Indian War, conflict between the early settlers and Native American populations included two battles at frontier fortifications at Upper Tract and Fort Seybert in 1758, both ten miles distant from the future location of Franklin. The land on which Franklin was laid out was first patented by brothers Francis and George Evick in 1769.
Pendleton County was divided from parts of Augusta, Hardy, and Rockingham Counties (Virginia) by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1787. The earliest court sessions in the new county were held at the home of Captain Zeruiah Stratton near the present-day village of Ruddle until Francis Evick offered a part of his land to become a county seat around 1789. Additional lots were divided off of Evick&#x27;s land to form the new town. On December 19, 1794, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the town of Franklin and recognized it as the seat of Pendleton County. Franklin grew steadily over the first half of the 19th century, becoming a local center of commerce and industry. In 1834, there were two stores, two tanneries, three saddlers, two carpenters, two shoemakers, two blacksmiths, one gunsmith, one tailor, one hat-maker, and one cabinet-maker listed among the town&#x27;s residents.

At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Pendleton County voted to uphold Virginia&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession, despite strong Union sympathies from many of its residents. Localized fighting occurred between northern and southern regiments throughout the war, but the only major battle to impact the Franklin area occurred in May 1862. Following the First Battle of Kernstown, Confederate Major General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson initiated his Valley Campaign to draw attention of the Union Army away from its Peninsula Campaign nearing the Confederate capitol at Richmond. On May 8, 1862, Jackson clashed with Union regiments from West Virginia and Ohio under the command of Brigadier General Robert H. Milroy at the Battle of McDowell (some 30 miles from Franklin). After a day of fighting, the Union forces withdrew from the battle and began retreating towards Franklin, pursued by Jackson for nearly a week. The armies clashed briefly at McCoy&#x27;s Mill (three miles south of Franklin, now a National Historic Site), but Jackson withdrew and returned to the Shenandoah Valley to continue his campaign.

Franklin did not grow significantly in the years following the American Civil War until the early twentieth century. In 1917, the town&#x27;s boundaries were expanded, the streets were macadamized, and public water and electricity were brought into the town. However, tragedy struck on April 17, 1924, when a massive fire destroyed the entire business district and caused $500,000.00 (~$6.5 million adjusted for present inflation) in damages. Most of the town&#x27;s center, its commercial district, and the Pendleton County Courthouse were constructed following the 1924 fire. Another disaster struck the town in 1985. The South Branch of the Potomac River in Franklin crested at 22.6 feet during the 1985 Election day floods. Flood stage at the time in the shallow riverbed was only 7 feet.

===Historic sites===

Much of the town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Franklin Historic District in 1986.
* Bank of Franklin (1925) Situated at the center of Franklin&#x27;s commercial district, the Bank of Franklin building was constructed following the fire of 1924 to house one of Franklin&#x27;s two banking institutions. The new building, constructed of brick, was designed in Neoclassical style inspired by the Beaux-Arts movement. The bank was closed after the passage of the Emergency Banking Act in 1933, along with the other two banks in Pendleton County.
* Dr. Preston Boggs House (1900) Located on North Main Street, the Dr. Preston Boggs House was constructed around 1900 in an elaborate interpretation of Queen Anne Style. The house features an octagonal turret positioned on its northeast corner and multiple bay window projections. A wraparound porch on the first floor is surmounted by a smaller porch on the second floor centered on the front facade of the house.

* Ernest Bowman House (1900) Neighboring the Dr. Preston Boggs House, the Ernest Bowman House is situated at the corner of Main Street and Dogwood Drive. Erected around 1900, the Ernest Bowman House also displays Queen Anne Style with projecting bays and ornate porches. The south facade of the house features a unique second story porch positioned overtop a bay window on the first floor.
* Franklin Presbyterian Church (1922) The Presbyterian Church at Franklin was organized August 19, 1866, near the village of Upper Tract. The congregation first moved to Franklin in 1876 and erected a church across the street from the present edifice (today the Walnut Street United Methodist Church). Construction of the present structure began in 1918 but was delayed due to an influenza outbreak and was still partially completed when the fire of 1924 destroyed Franklin&#x27;s commercial district (though leaving the new church untouched). The congregation sold its old building to the county for use as a temporary courthouse in 1924 and occupied the present building, which was designed by Stanholpe Johnson of Lexington, Virginia. The Franklin Presbyterian Church is an example of Gothic Revival style.

* Franklin United Methodist Church (1881) Methodism in Pendleton County originated with the arrival of Rev. Ferdinand Lair in 1800. The congregation worshipped in Franklin&#x27;s Union Church from 1809 until the construction of the present church in 1881, designed by H.H. Smally of Lilly, Virginia. Constructed of brick, Franklin United Methodist Church displays elements of Gothic Revival and Italianate design.
* McCoy House (1848) Located on Main Street opposite the Pendleton County Courthouse, the McCoy House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Built by slave labor in 1848, the house was constructed for William McCoy, who served at various times as deputy sheriff of Pendleton County, a justice of the county court, and represented Pendleton County in the state legislature. The McCoy House is a two-story, brick &quot;I-House&quot; designed in Greek Revival Style with an Ionic portico.

* Johnson House and Drug Store (1878) Located on Main Street catty-corner to the present courthouse. The property housed the Johnson family until the 1980s who operated a drug store and lived on-site in the brick structure.  Much like the neighboring McCoy house, this structure is a brick &quot;I-House&quot; in a more Victorian style.
* Pendleton County Courthouse (1925) Franklin was the site of three courthouses prior to the present edifice. A log structure was built in 1788 by Thomas Collett, which served the county for 28 years until a brick courthouse was built in 1816–17. A third, larger courthouse was erected in 1889 by Franklin resident John Add Crigler, which was destroyed by the fire of 1924. The court convened in the old Presbyterian Church (today the Walnut Street United Methodist Church) until the present, fourth courthouse was completed in 1925. Designed by the Snyder Brothers of Keyser, West Virginia, the new courthouse cost $62,577.00 to erect. The Pendleton County Courthouse is an example of Colonial Revival Style.
* The Ananias Pitsenbarger Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The Priest Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

<text>Hillsboro is a town in Pocahontas County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 232 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
 Hillsboro was named for pioneer John (Richard) Hill, from North Carolina, who built a log cabin near what is now Lobelia. Most of the early settlers were Scots-Irish and worked in agriculture and stock raising.

In the 1800s the town of Hillsboro centered on the educational institution Little Levels Academy. Established in 1842, the school closed 18 years later at the onset of the Civil War. In 1865, the county purchased the building and ran it as a public school through the 1880s, and it became a school of higher order for boys called Hillsboro Academy. The basement of the Methodist Church served as a school of high order for girls called Hillsboro College, or Little Levels Seminary. Eventually the brick Academy was torn down and replaced by a wood-frame school for both boys and girls. Later the school was rebuilt in brick as Hillsboro High School.

Millpoint, in northern Hillsboro, was once the site of a small industrial village, &quot;including within its limits proper a store, a blacksmith shop, two flour mills, and three homes.&quot; One of the mills has been restored and can be seen along Route 219.

In 1892, the author Pearl S. Buck was born in a large white two-story house at the northern end of town. Shortly thereafter, her family, Presbyterian missionaries, returned to China, but her West Virginia roots nevertheless had a significant impact on Buck through her mother Carrie.

The Dutch-style &quot;city house,&quot; now on the National Register of Historic Places, has been restored into a museum, the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace. It displays an array of antiques from the 1892 period, including many family originals. Also on the National Register of Historic Places are the Richard Beard House and Locust Creek Covered Bridge.

In late June, the town hosts the annual Little Levels Heritage Fair to celebrate the history of the region.

Hillsboro is also featured in the movie &quot;Patch Adams,&quot; where Dr. Patch Adams purchased land to build a medical clinic based on his philosophy of doctor-patient interaction. A medical clinic is planned but has not yet been constructed, as fund-raising is still underway. Currently, the Gesundheit Institute host people at the facility to engage in learning and volunteering.

<text>Buffalo is a town in Putnam County, West Virginia, United States, located along the Kanawha River. The population was 1,211 at the time of the 2020 census It is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==History==
Along with numerous sites in the Kanawha River Valley, Buffalo was originally settled by waves of ancient cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples. Clovis points indicate the presence of inhabitants more than 10,000 years ago. One of the last cultures, that of the Fort Ancient people, had a few villages such as Buffalo and Marmet that survived into the time of European exploration.

Historic tribes such as the Huron, from the Great Lakes region, and the Conoy (also spelled &quot;Conois&quot; and &quot;Kanawha&quot;) were driven out of the central valley by the Iroquois&#x27; invading from their base in present-day Western New York. Many of the Conoy by the early 17th century had resettled on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay and below the Potomac River. After decades of encroachment by English colonists, surviving Conoy (also called Piscataway by then) went north to Pennsylvania and allied with the Susquehannock and Iroquois.

The town was named after the American buffalo which once roamed here.

<doc id="138570" wikidata="Q2649771" url="?curid=138570" title="Hurricane, West Virginia">
<text>Hurricane ( ) is a city in Putnam County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 6,977 at the 2020 census. Located roughly equidistant from Charleston and Huntington, it is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==History==
Hurricane was named after Hurricane Creek, which was, in turn, named after a group of trees at the arm of the river bent in one direction. A party of surveyors commissioned by George Washington noted the site appeared to have been struck by a hurricane, giving rise to the name. Locals pronounce the town (HURR-i-KINN) not (HURR-i-CANE). Less than southeast of Hurricane is a post office named Tornado.

A town named Hurricane Bridge was located where West Virginia Route 34 now crosses the creek, near current-day Hurricane. The town can be traced back to an 1811 Virginia map. The town primarily consisted of a large Inn. On March 28, 1863, Union and Confederate forces fought a Civil War battle at Hurricane Bridge, now known as the Battle of Hurricane Bridge.

Hurricane itself can be traced back to 1873, when a railroad track was laid through the town and a small depot was constructed. It was during this period that Main Street developed, along with other businesses in the area. Hurricane was a trading and residential town for tobacco growers and other farmers in the early 1900s. The fire department was established March 2, 1936. It was incorporated as a town in 1889, and as a city in the 1970s.

The three oldest continuously operating businesses are:
*The &quot;Hurricane Breeze&quot;, a weekly newspaper established October 1900.
*Putnam County Bank, established October 25, 1901.
*Rappold&#x27;s Barber Shop, established June 1906.

In the early 1990s, the old depot, which once served as the catalyst for the town&#x27;s development, was torn down and replaced with a small gazebo. It was also during the 1990s that the city began to see a surge in urban growth as several subdivisions were established in the city limits. The population increase resulted in the widening of Route 34, a connecting road to Teays Valley, and an expansion of Hurricane High School.

==Geography==
Hurricane is located at (38.432483, -82.019718).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Hurricane is also unique as it sits on a very active rift.

When the community became eligible for a post office in the early 1900s, the residents discovered another West Virginia town already had the name. The town adopted the name &quot;Oxley&quot;, after a Huntington man who ran a clothing store there. In 1929 or 1930, Grover Hedrick bought Ritter Lumber Company and had the community name changed to &quot;Glen Hedrick.&quot; The residents petitioned the federal government for another name change and finally, the community was officially named Beaver in 1939.

<doc id="138575" wikidata="Q813745" url="?curid=138575" title="Beckley, West Virginia">
<text>Beckley is a city in and the county seat of Raleigh County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 17,286 at the 2020 census, making it the ninth-most populous city in the state. It is the principal city of the Beckley metropolitan area of Southern West Virginia, home to 115,079 residents in 2020. Beckley was founded on April 4, 1838, and was long known for its ties to the coal mining industry. It is the home of the West Virginia University Institute of Technology, as well as an annex of Concord University and the University of Charleston.

Beckley hosts the Beckley VA Medical Center (VAMC) offering comprehensive medical services to veterans. Additionally, the city is home to Raleigh General Hospital and Beckley Appalachian Regional Hospital (BARH), both of which provide a wide range of healthcare services to the local and surrounding communities.

Apart from its significance in healthcare, Beckley is renowned for the Tamarack Marketplace. Situated off Interstate 64, Tamarack stands as a cultural cornerstone, showcasing the artistic heritage and craftsmanship of West Virginia. The venue features work from state artisans, offering visitors a glimpse into the region&#x27;s culture and traditions.

==History==

The area surrounding Beckley was long home to many indigenous peoples. Early encounters describe the land as being an ancestral home of the Catawba-speaking Moneton people, who referred to the surrounding area as Okahok Amai, and were allies of the Monacan people. The Moneton&#x27;s Catawba speaking neighbors to the south, the Tutelo (since absorbed into the Seneca-Cayuga Nation) may have absorbed surviving Moneton communities, and claim the area as ancestral lands. Cherokee and Shawnee and Yuchi peoples also claim the area as included in their traditional lands. Conflicts with European settlers resulted in various displaced Indian tribes settling in West Virginia, where they were known at &quot;Mingo&quot;, meaning &quot;remote affiliates of the Iroquois Confederacy&quot;.

Beckley was named in honor of John James Beckley, who was the first Clerk of the House of Representatives and the first Librarian of Congress. It was founded by his son, Alfred Beckley (US Army lieutenant and brigadier general of Virginia militia), who was from the District of Columbia.

Although founded in 1838, Beckley existed only on paper at that time. Alfred Beckley said he &quot;was frequently jeered and laughed at for his Paper Town...&quot; Early in its history, the town was known as Beckley, Raleigh Court House, and, occasionally, Beckleyville.

The town was originally located in Fayette County, Virginia. In 1850 the act of the Virginia legislature creating Raleigh County named Beckley the county seat. The city is sometimes called the &quot;Smokeless Coal Capital&quot;, &quot;The City of Champions&quot; and the &quot;Gateway To Southern West Virginia.&quot;

During the presidential primaries of 1960, the vehicles of rivals John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey stopped at the same streetcorner in Beckley. Recognizing each other, the two men got out and chatted briefly.

After Byrd had collected the $10 joining fee and $3 charge for a robe and hood from every applicant, the Grand Dragon Joel L. Baskin for the mid-Atlantic states came down to Crab Orchard, to officially organize the chapter... &quot;When it came time to choose the Exalted Cyclops, the top officer in the local Klan unit, Byrd won unanimously.&quot;

Crab Orchard was named for the many crab apple trees near the original town site.

== Agriculture ==
In 1990 the Daniel Vineyards and winery was created from a former golf course location.

<doc id="138585" wikidata="Q1070438" url="?curid=138585" title="Chert">
<text>Chert () is a hard, fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline quartz, the mineral form of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Chert is characteristically of biological origin, but may also occur inorganically as a chemical precipitate or a diagenetic replacement, as in petrified wood.

Chert is typically composed of the petrified remains of siliceous ooze, the biogenic sediment that covers large areas of the deep ocean floor, and which contains the silicon skeletal remains of diatoms, silicoflagellates, and radiolarians. Precambrian cherts are notable for the presence of fossil cyanobacteria. In addition to microfossils, chert occasionally contains macrofossils. However, some chert is devoid of any fossils.

Chert varies greatly in color, from white to black, but is most often found as gray, brown, grayish brown and light green to rusty red and occasionally as dark green. Its color is an expression of trace elements present in the rock. Both red and green are most often related to traces of iron in its oxidized and reduced forms, respectively.

== Description ==

In petrology, the term &quot;chert&quot; refers generally to all chemically precipitated sedimentary rocks composed primarily of microcrystalline, cryptocrystalline and microfibrous silica. Most cherts are nearly pure silica, with less than 5% other minerals (mostly calcite, dolomite, clay minerals, hematite, and organic matter.) However, cherts range from very pure cherts with over 99% silica content to impure nodular cherts with less than 65% silica content. Aluminium is the most abundant minor element, followed by iron and manganese or potassium, sodium, and calcium. Extracrystalline water (tiny inclusions of water within and around the quartz grains) make up less than 1% of most cherts.

The Folk classification divides chert into three textural categories. Granular microquartz is the component of chert consisting of roughly equidimensional quartz grains, ranging in size from a fraction of a micron to 20 microns, but most typically 8 to 10 microns. Chalcedony is a microfibrous variety of quartz, consisting of radiating bundles of very thin crystals about 100 microns long. Megaquartz is composed of equidimensional grains over 20 microns in size. Most chert is microcrystalline quartz with minor chalcedony and sometimes opal, but cherts range from nearly pure opal to nearly pure quartz chert. However, little opal is over 60 million years old. Opaline chert often contains visible fossils of diatoms, radiolarians, and glass sponge spicules.

Chert is found in settings as diverse as hot spring deposits (&quot;siliceous sinter&quot;), banded iron formation (&quot;jaspilite&quot;), or alkaline lakes. However, most chert is found either as &quot;bedded chert&quot; or as &quot;nodular chert&quot;. Bedded chert is more common in Precambrian beds, but nodular chert became more common in the Phanerozoic as the total volume of chert in the rock record diminished. Bedded chert is rare after the early Mesozoic. Chert became moderately abundant during the Devonian and Carboniferous and again became moderately abundant from the Jurassic to the present.

===Bedded chert===

Bedded chert, also known as ribbon chert, takes the form of thinly bedded layers (a few centimeters to a meter in thickness) of nearly pure chert separated by very thin layers of silica-rich shale. It is usually black to green in color, and the full sequence of beds may be several hundred meters thick. The shale is typically black shale, sometimes with pyrite, indicating deposition in an anoxic environment. Bedded chert is most often found in association with turbidites, deep water limestone, submarine volcanic rock, ophiolites, and mélanges on active margins of tectonic plates. Sedimentary structures are rare in bedded cherts. The typically high purity of bedded chert, like the high purity of other chemically precipitated rock, points to deposition in areas where there is little influx of detrital sediments (such as river water laden with silt and clay particles.) Such impurities as are present include authigenic pyrite and hematite, formed in the sediments after they were deposited, in addition to traces of detrital minerals.

Seawater typically contains between 0.01 and 11 parts per million (ppm) of silica, with around 1 ppm being typical. This is far below saturation, indicating that silica cannot normally be precipitated from seawater through inorganic processes. The silica is instead extracted from seawater by living organisms, such as diatoms, radiolarians, and glass sponges, which can efficiently extract silica even from very unsaturated water, and which are estimated to presently produce of opal per year in the world&#x27;s oceans. Diatoms can double their numbers eight times a day under ideal conditions (though doubling once per day is more typical in normal seawater) and can extract silica from water with as little as 0.1 ppm silica. The organisms protect their skeletons from dissolution by &quot;armoring&quot; them with metal ions. Once the organisms die, their skeletons will quickly dissolve unless they accumulate on the ocean bottom and are buried, forming siliceous ooze that is 30% to 60% silica. Thus, bedded cherts are typically composed mostly of fossil remains of organisms that secrete silica skeletons, which are usually altered by solution and recrystallization.

The skeletons of these organisms are composed of opal-A, an amorphous form of silica, lacking long-range crystal structure. This is gradually transformed to opal-CT, a microcrystalline form of silica composed mostly of bladed crystals of cristobalite and tridymite. Much opal-CT takes the form of &quot;lepispheres&quot;, which are clusters of bladed crystals about 10 microns in diameter. Opal-CT in turn transforms to microquartz. In deep ocean water, the transition to opal-CT occurs at a temperature of about while the transition to microquartz occurs at a temperature of about . However, the transition temperature varies considerably, and the transition is hastened by the presence of magnesium hydroxide, which provides a nucleus for the recrystallization. Megaquartz forms at elevated temperatures typical of metamorphism.

There is evidence that the variety of chert called porcelainite, which is characterized by a high content of opal-CT, recrystallizes at very shallow depths. The Caballos Novaculite of Texas also shows signs of very shallow water deposition, including shallow water sedimentary structures and evaporite pseudomorphs, which are casts of crystals of soluble minerals that could have formed only in near-surface conditions. This novaculate appears to have formed by replacement of carbonate fecal pellets by chert.

====Subvarieties====
Bedded cherts can be further subdivided by the kinds of organisms that produced the silica skeletons.

&quot;Diatomaceous chert&quot; consists of beds and lenses of diatomite which were converted during diagenesis into dense, hard chert. Beds of marine diatomaceous chert comprising strata several hundred meters thick have been reported from sedimentary sequences such as the Miocene Monterey Formation of California and occur in rocks as old as the Cretaceous. Diatoms were the dominant siliceous organism responsible for extracting silica from seawater from the Jurassic and later.

&quot;Radiolarite&quot; consists mostly of remains of radiolarians. When the remains are well-cemented with silica, it is known as &quot;radiolarian chert&quot;. Many show evidence of a deep-water origin, but some appear to have formed in water as shallow as , perhaps in shelf seas where upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water support high organic productivity. Radiolarians dominated the extraction of silica from seawater prior to the Jurassic.

&quot;Spicularite&quot; is chert composed of spicules of glass sponges and other invertebrates. When densely cemented, it is known as &quot;spicular chert&quot;. They are found in association with glauconite-rich sandstone, black shale, clay-rich limestone, phosphorites, and other nonvolcanic rocks typical of water a few hundred meters deep.

Some bedded cherts appear devoid of fossils even under close microscopic examination. Their origin is uncertain, but they may form from fossil remains that are completely dissolved in fluids that then migrate to precipitate their silica load in a nearby bed. Eolian quartz has also been suggested as a source of silica for chert beds. Precambrian bedded cherts are common, making up 15% of middle Precambrian sedimentary rock, and may have been deposited nonbiologically in oceans more saturated in silica than the modern ocean. The high degree of silica saturation was due either to intense volcanic activity or to the lack of modern organisms that remove silica from seawater.

===Nodular chert===

Nodular chert is most common in limestone but may also be found in shales and sandstones. It is less common in dolomite. Nodular chert in carbonate rocks is found as oval to irregular nodules. These vary in size from powdery quartz particles to nodules several meters in size. The nodules are most typically along bedding planes or stylolite (dissolution) surfaces, where fossil organisms tended to accumulate and provided a source of dissolved silica, but they are sometimes found cutting across bedding surfaces, where the chert fills fossil burrows, fluid escape structures, or fractures. Nodules under a few centimeters in size tend to be egg-shaped, while larger nodules form irregular bodies with knobby surfaces. The outer few centimeters of large nodules may show desiccation cracks with secondary chert, which likely formed at the same time as the nodule. Calcareous fossils are occasionally present that have been completely silicified. Where chert occurs in chalk or marl, it is usually called flint.
Nodular chert is often dark in color. It can have a white weathering rind that is known in archaeology as &quot;cortex&quot;.

Most chert nodules have textures suggesting they were formed by diagenetic replacement, where silica was deposited in place of calcium carbonate or clay minerals. This may have taken place where meteoric water (water derived from snow or rain) mixed with saltwater in the sediment beds, where carbon dioxide was trapped, producing an environment supersaturated with silica and undersaturated with calcium carbonate. Nodular chert is particularly common in continental shelf environments. In the Permian Basin (North America), chert nodules and chertified fossils are abundant in basin limestones, but there is little in the carbonate buildup zone itself. This may reflect dissolution of opal where carbonate is being actively deposited, a lack of siliceous organisms in these environments, or removal of siliceous skeletons by strong currents that redeposit the siliceous material in the deep basin.

The silica in nodular chert likely precipitates as opal-A, based on internal banding in nodules, and may recrystallize directly to microquartz without first recrystallizing to opal-CT. Some nodular chert may precipitate directly as microquartz, due to low levels of supersaturation of silica.

===Other occurrences===
The banded iron formations of Precambrian age are composed of alternating layers of chert and iron oxides.

Nonmarine cherts may form in saline alkaline lakes as thin lenses or nodules showing sedimentary structures suggestive of evaporite origin. Such cherts are forming today in the alkaline lakes of the East African Rift Valley. These lakes are characterized by sodium carbonate brines with very high pH that can contain as much as 2700 ppm silica. Episodes of runoff of fresh water into the lakes lowers the pH and precipitates the unusual sodium silicate minerals magadiite or kenyaite, After burial and diagenesis, these are altered to Magadi-type chert. The Morrison Formation contains Magadi-type chert that may have formed in the alkaline Lake T&#x27;oo&#x27;dichi&#x27;.

Chert may also form from replacement of calcrete in fossil soils (paleosols) by silica dissolved from overlying volcanic ash beds.

==Fossils==
The cryptocrystalline nature of chert, combined with its above average ability to resist weathering, recrystallization and metamorphism has made it an ideal rock for preservation of early life forms.

For example:
* The 3.2 Ga chert of the Fig Tree Formation in the Barberton Mountains between Eswatini and South Africa preserved non-colonial unicellular bacteria-like fossils.
* The Gunflint Chert of western Ontario (1.9 to 2.3 Ga) preserves not only bacteria and cyanobacteria but also organisms believed to be ammonia-consuming and some that resemble green algae and fungus-like organisms.
* The Apex Chert (3.4 Ga) of the Pilbara craton, Australia preserved eleven taxa of prokaryotes. However, these findings have been disputed.
* The Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin, Central Australia, preserves 850 Ma cyanobacteria and algae.
* The Rhynie chert (410 Ma) of Scotland has remains of a Devonian land flora and fauna with preservation so perfect that it allows cellular studies of the fossils.

==Prehistoric and historic uses==
Chert is of only modest economic importance today as a source of silica (quartz sand being much more important.) However, chert deposits may be associated with valuable deposits of iron, uranium, manganese, phosphorite, and petroleum. 

===Tools===
In prehistoric times, chert was often used as a raw material for the construction of stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone, like when a plate-glass window is struck by a small object such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake&#x27;s bulb of force.

When a chert stone is struck against an iron-bearing surface, sparks result. This makes chert an excellent tool for starting fires, and both flint and common chert were used in various types of fire-starting tools, such as tinderboxes, throughout history. A primary historic use of common chert and flint was for flintlock firearms, in which the chert striking a metal plate produces a spark that ignites a small reservoir containing black powder, discharging the firearm.

===Construction===

Cherts can cause several problems when used as concrete aggregates. Deeply weathered chert develops surface pop-outs when used in concrete that undergoes freezing and thawing because of the high porosity of weathered chert. The other concern is that certain cherts undergo an alkali-silica reaction with high-alkali cements. This reaction leads to cracking and expansion of concrete and ultimately to failure of the material.

==Varieties==
There are numerous varieties of chert, classified based on their visible, microscopic and physical characteristics. Examples are:
* Flint is a compact microcrystalline quartz. It was originally the name for chert found in chalk or marly limestone formations formed by a replacement of calcium carbonate with silica. Commonly found as nodules, this variety was often used in past times to make bladed tools. Today, some geologists refer to any dark gray to black chert as flint. The dark color is from inclusions of organic matter. Among non-geologists, the distinction between &quot;flint&quot; and &quot;chert&quot; is often one of quality – chert being lower quality than flint. This usage of the terminology is particularly prevalent in Great Britain where most true flint (found in chalk formations) was of better quality than &quot;common chert&quot; (from limestone formations).

* &quot;Common chert&quot; is a variety of chert which forms in limestone formations by replacement of calcium carbonate with silica. This is the most abundantly found variety of chert. It is generally considered to be less attractive for producing gem stones and bladed tools than flint.

* Jasper is a variety of chert formed as primary deposits, found in or in connection with magmatic formations, and owes its typical red color to hematite inclusions. Jasper frequently also occurs in black, yellow and green, depending on the type of iron it contains. Jasper is usually opaque to near opaque. Jasper is also present in banded iron formation, where it is described as jaspilite.

* Radiolarite is a variety of chert formed as primary deposits and containing radiolarian microfossils. Many show evidence of a deep-water origin, but some appear to have formed in water as shallow as .

* Chalcedony is a microfibrous quartz.

* Agate is distinctly banded chalcedony with successive layers differing in color or value.

* Onyx is a banded agate with layers in parallel lines, often black and white (&quot;sardonyx&quot;).

* Magadi-type chert is a variety that forms from a sodium silicate precursor in highly alkaline lakes such as Lake Magadi in Kenya.

* Novaculite is a very dense, fine-grained, and uniform form of very pure white chert with a high content of extracrystalline water. It is most common in the mid-Paleozoic rocks of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas in the south-central United States, where it has undergone some metamorphism.

* Porcelanite is a term used for fine-grained siliceous rocks with a texture and a fracture resembling those of unglazed porcelain. It likely forms in shallow water and is composed mostly of opal-CT.

* Tripolitic chert (or tripoli) is a light-colored porous friable siliceous (largely chalcedonic) sedimentary rock, which results from the weathering (decalcification) of chert or siliceous limestone.

* Siliceous sinter is porous, low-density, light-colored siliceous rock deposited by waters of hot springs and geysers.

* Mozarkite a varicolored, easily polished Ordovician chert that takes a high polish. It is the state rock of Missouri.

Other lesser used archaic terms for chert are firestone and silex.

==Etymology==

The community takes its name from a nearby spring. “The ‘Shady Spring’ was an enduring landmark, never known to ‘run dry’ and served as a focal point for the community, especially for the women, many of whom would come bearing washtubs...,” according to “A History of Shady Spring District.&quot; The first business in Shady was the Pioneer Inn and Tavern, established in 1832 by Henry Hull and his brothers. The first official post office was established on Aug. 25, 1925, and the first postmistress was Mrs. Sarah Willis.

General Rutherford B. Hayes, future President of the United States, was in the area during the Civil War. He “described the spring in 1862: ‘A large spring gives the name to this place. The water gushes out copiously, runs on the surface a few rods and runs again into the earth,” according to “Raleigh County: West Virginia” by Jim Wood.

Basil L.Plumley, a decorated soldier who fought in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War was a native of Shady Spring. He was best known for the role he played in the Battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam.

<text>Beverly is a town in Randolph County, West Virginia, United States. Founded in 1787, it is the oldest settlement in the Tygart River Valley. It had a population of 628 at the 2020 census. Beverly was the county seat of Randolph County for over a century—from 1790 until 1899—after which the nearby settlement of Elkins assumed that role following an intense local political &quot;war&quot;.

==History==

The first white settlers in the area that would become Beverly (and in fact in the whole of the Tygart Valley) arrived in 1753 when David Tygart (for whom the valley and river are named) and Robert Files (or Foyle) established cabins at separate choice spots. Although there had been no recent history of conflicts between whites and Indians in that immediate area, that summer a party of Indians traveling the Shawnee Trail discovered the Files cabin and killed seven members of the family. One son escaped and alerted the Tygart family, allowing all to escape. Thereafter, no other white settlement was attempted in present Randolph County until 1772.

On May 29, 1787, officers of the newly established Randolph County authorized local settler and landowner James Westfall, Sr (1747–1800) to plat out a town to accommodate a new county seat. The settlement was at first named Edmundton to further honor the namesake of the new county—Virginia Governor Edmund Randolph. In December 1790, however, the Virginia General Assembly officially established the town as “Beverley”. By this time, Randolph&#x27;s first cousin (once removed), Beverley Randolph, was governor and the town was accordingly renamed for him. (Apparently, without discussion, the third “e” was soon dropped from the name, and &quot;Beverly&quot; has been the conventional spelling ever since.)

The Assembly directed the citizens to erect “a dwelling house sixteen feet square with a brick or stone chimney.” The first houses, along with a courthouse, jail, and school, were all of the characteristic single-pen log structure. Randolph County was at this time much larger than today, encompassing all of present-day Tucker County, and parts of present-day Preston, Barbour, Upshur, Lewis, Braxton, Nicholas, Webster, and Pocahontas Counties.

Jacob Westfall (1761–1801), first cousin once removed of James Westfall, received permission in 1794 to erect a sawmill near the town. Soon frame houses had joined the original log structures. After the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike arrived (1841), the town developed rapidly as a regional center for transportation and trading. Both sides occupied Beverly at various times during the American Civil War (1861–65) and various buildings were pressed into service as hospitals or quarters. In January 1865 Confederate General Thomas L. Rosser took 300 men, crossed the Allegheny Mountains to Beverly in deep snow and bitter cold and surprised and captured two Union infantry regiments in their works there. Some 580 prisoners were taken. (Most of the men in Rosser&#x27;s command were recruits from [West] Virginia.) Rosser&#x27;s troops partially burnt the Beverly Covered Bridge (built 1846–47), the earliest of Lemuel Chenoweth&#x27;s celebrated wooden covered bridges, but Chenoweth rebuilt it in 1872 and &#x27;73.

Beverly lost its preeminence as county seat in 1899 to the rapidly developing railroad and timbering center of Elkins. In 1980 the entire town was entered on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Today, a number of Beverly’s more historic structures have been restored.

<text>Elkins is a city in and the county seat of Randolph County, West Virginia, United States, along the Tygart Valley River. The community was incorporated in 1890 and named in honor of Stephen B. Elkins, a U.S. Senator from West Virginia. The population was 6,950 at the 2020 census and estimated at 6,895 in 2021. Elkins is home to Davis and Elkins College and the Mountain State Forest Festival, held in early October every year.

==History==

Thomas Skidmore (&quot;ca.&quot; 1733-1807), born in Maryland, obtained a title to 400 acres of land (“by virtue of a settlement”) in the future Elkins area before 1778. This land, on the east side of the Tygart Valley River, was surveyed by John Poage in 1780 and included the land that is now most of downtown Elkins. Thus, Skidmore was probably the first white settler in what became Elkins.

Before its major development, the area that would become Elkins was known as Leadsville, and was the site of a few scattered homesteads – a place where the local farmers&#x27; corn crop was loaded onto boats and floated down the Tygart Valley River. The City of Elkins was developed by U.S. Senators Henry G. Davis (1823–1916) and Stephen B. Elkins (1841–1911) – and named for the latter – in 1890. (Elkins was Davis&#x27; son-in-law.) The two founders developed railroad lines, coal mines, and timbering businesses. Together, they built the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway into Elkins in 1889, opening a vast territory to industrial development by the late 1890s. After an intense county seat war with nearby Beverly, where the new county courthouse building was burned down in 1897 under suspicious circumstances, Elkins became the county seat in 1899. This was resolved, however, only after multiple referendums, court judgments, and the mobilization of armed bands in both towns. In the end, bloodshed was averted.

In 1904 the new Randolph County Courthouse – designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style – was completed in Elkins. As the railroad (merged into the Western Maryland Railway in 1905) expanded, Elkins experienced the luxury of passenger train service. In 1930, 18 passenger trains were arriving and leaving Elkins daily. All passenger service was discontinued in 1958.

Where the view of the new town was most delightful and picturesque, Davis and Elkins each built permanent places of residence, known as Graceland (1893) and Halliehurst (1890), respectively.

Today, Elkins has an active economic development authority, chamber of commerce, downtown business organization and numerous social, fraternal and service organizations that sponsor annual events like the Mountain State Forest Festival, which brings thousands of people into the city every year.

==Geography==
Elkins is located at the confluence of the Tygart Valley River and Leading Creek. The average elevation is above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Elkins is headquarters for the Monongahela National Forest, a federal reserve encompassing the &quot;High Alleghenies&quot; area to the east of the city.

In 1995, a second edition of &quot;The 100 Best Small Towns in America&quot;, written by Norman Crampton, featured Elkins among the special places in the United States. Crampton quoted then Editor Emerita of &quot;The Inter-Mountain&quot;, Eldora Marie Bolyard Nuzum, &quot;You can stand on any street in Elkins and turn in all directions and see forest covered mountains rimming the city. It is unbelievable.&quot;

<text>Harrisville is a town and the county seat of Ritchie County, West Virginia, United States. Harrisville is located at the junction of State Routes 31 and 16, five miles south of U.S. 50. Within the community are an elementary school, the county board of education, many businesses, three banks, a library, offices of the &quot;Ritchie Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Pennsboro News&quot;, a municipal park, and North Bend Golf Course. North Bend Lake and North Bend State Park are located just outside town limits. Municipal elections are held every two years.

==History==

The town was laid out in 1822 by Thomas Harris, who had moved his family there in 1807. The town was chartered in 1832, and the first post office opened in 1833, under the name Solus. The name was later changed to Ritchie Court House, and then changed again to Harrisville in 1895, when the town was named for Gen. Thomas Harris, nephew of the founder. Ritchie County was formed in 1843, and the first courthouse was built in 1844. It was replaced by a brick structure in 1874. The present courthouse, a Harrisville landmark, was completed in late 1923.

The Pennsboro &amp; Harrisville Railroad was built in 1875, operating between the two communities of its name. The broad-gauge Harrisville Southern Railroad ran to Cornwallis between about 1909 and 1929.

Harrisville High School was established on the west end of town in 1894. That structure now houses the General Thomas M. Harris School Museum. A new school built overlooking Harrisville in 1924 served as Harrisville High School until 1986. The same school building served as Ritchie County High School until it was closed in 1994. The school building was demolished on December 16, 2017. A small portion of the original school building remains and is the headquarters of “Ritchie Regional Health Center.” The Harrisville High School gym still remains and is now a community workout center using the name &quot;The Gym,&quot; restored by the Harrisville First Assembly of God using funds generated from grants, memberships and donations.

General Harris, Harrisville&#x27;s most distinguished citizen, died there in 1906. A medical doctor, Union officer and state adjutant general (1869–1871), he served on the military commission that tried the conspirators responsible for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. His son, John T. Harris, long-time clerk of the state Senate, founded the West Virginia Blue Book in 1916. The Harrisville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

The Harrisville Historic District, Harrisville Grade School, and the Ritchie County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is home to historic Berdine&#x27;s Five and Dime.

<text>Grafton is a city in and the county seat of Taylor County, West Virginia, United States, along the Tygart Valley River. The population was 4,729 at the 2020 census. It originally developed as a junction point for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, serving numerous branches of a network that was vital to the regional coal industry.

Grafton is the home of both of West Virginia&#x27;s national cemeteries, and was where the West Virginia Equal Suffrage Association formed in 1895. Mother&#x27;s Day was founded in Grafton on May 10, 1908, and the city is home to the International Mother&#x27;s Day Shrine. Grafton was also among the first cities in the United States to observe Memorial Day.

==History==
===Etymology===
The origin of the name &quot;Grafton&quot; — originally Grafton Junction — is disputed. The city may have been named for John Grafton, a civil engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Alternatively, railroad crews may have referred to the town as &quot;Graftin&quot; because it was the point at which a number of branch railroad lines met (grafted to) the railroad&#x27;s mainline.

===Earliest settlers===
Grafton developed from early white settlements at the confluence of Three Fork Creek with the Tygart Valley River, part of the headwaters region of the Monongahela River watershed. In 1776, Virginia&#x27;s remote District of West Augusta was divided into three counties, including Monongalia County, which included what are now Taylor County and Grafton.

Among the earliest settlers were James Current (&quot;ca.&quot; 1730–1822) and his family. He was a Scots-Irish immigrant who fought in the Revolutionary War in 1778, had landed in Maryland and moved into the interior. He was living in Monongalia County with his family by 1782 when he was recorded on a census there. According to family tradition, Current traded a &quot;gray horse&quot; for 1,300 acres of land located where present-day Grafton developed. James and his wife Margaret are buried in Bluemont Cemetery (part of his original property). Current&#x27;s grave is the only one in Grafton known to belong to a veteran of the Revolutionary War.

===Turnpike and railroad===

John Wolverton Blue (1803–1889) was in charge of the construction of Virginia&#x27;s Northwestern Turnpike from Aurora to the Tygart Valley. Visiting the future site of Grafton in 1833, he stayed overnight with the Currents. According to a local historian, &quot;Blue, upon awakening the next morning, heard the wife of Current sobbing bitterly&quot; over the impending loss of her &quot;cabin home...[and] vegetable and flower garden&quot; because of the planned right-of-way for the road. &quot;Mr. Blue, a Virginian of the old school, was greatly moved...and...an offer of $300 for 900 acres...and their ruined home...was quickly accepted.&quot;

This neighborhood (now a suburb of Grafton) became known as Blueville and it — along with the nearby area called &quot;Valley Bridge&quot; (present day Fetterman, or Ward 1) — began to grow after the Turnpike was completed in 1834. Blue also supervised the construction of a (now long gone) covered bridge over the Tygart here at this time.

In 1847, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act authorizing the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to extend its line to the Ohio River at Wheeling. The city of Grafton owes its existence to the interventions of Thomas S. Haymond (1794–1869), a lawyer and U.S. Congressman (and future Confederate colonel) from nearby Marion County. According to another local historian, &quot;Haymond never mentioned his county as desiring the [rail]road; but being well acquainted with the geography of north-western Virginia, he quietly got the following clause attached to the bill: &#x27;That the said railroad to be constructed through the territory of Virginia, shall reach or cross the Tygart&#x27;s Valley River at or within three miles of the mouth of Three Fork Creek in the county of Taylor&#x27;&quot;. This clause effectively re-routed the line away from Morgantown and forced it to pass through Haymond&#x27;s hometown of Fairmont. Grafton, which is perched in unlikely fashion on a very steep hillside at the mentioned confluence, was the accidental beneficiary, also becoming the branch point for the side line north to Morgantown. 

The B&amp;O work crews completed the line on January 11, 1852, and the first &quot;iron horse&quot; arrived two days later. This was the first trans-Appalachian railroad. The population in 1853 was reported as comprising only eight families, but within a year &quot;Grafton Junction&quot; had emerged as a booming railroad town with several more residences and stores. As the railroad facilities were developed, local land was surveyed for the new town, which was chartered on March 15, 1856, in the Virginia General Assembly. The population by this time was 606 people.

===Civil War===
Due to the importance of the B&amp;O and Northwestern Virginia Railroads for the movement of troops and supplies, Grafton became an early strategic target during the Civil War (1861-1865) and both sides tried to control it. CSA General Robert E. Lee initially vowed to protect the railroad, and sent first CSA Major Francis M. Boykin Jr., then CSA Col. George A. Porterfield (a Virginia Military Institute graduate from Charles Town across from Harpers Ferry) to recruit at Grafton, but neither had much success. Most Grafton residents, immigrants brought in to work for the railroad, sided with the Union. The Grafton Guards led by Col. George R. Latham became Company B of the 2nd West Virginia Infantry Regiment days after Virginians (over the objection of most of western Virginia) voted for secession on May 23.

The previous evening (May 22, 1861), opposing factions skirmished in the Town of Fetterman (now a part of Grafton), resulting in the death of Thornsbury Bailey Brown, the first soldier killed in the Civil War. Southern supporters joined the Confederate Letcher&#x27;s Guard.

With the Grafton Guards in Wheeling, Porterfield occupied Grafton on May 25, but left three days later for Philippi, when he realized his vastly outnumbered forces were facing a pincer movement from troops under the Wheeling militia&#x27;s Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley (soon to become a Brigadier General and who would station his Railroad Division at Grafton) as well as various Ohio and Indiana units sent by Union General George McClellan, a U.S. Army officer turned railroad man whom President Lincoln had placed in charge of the Department of the Ohio. Kelley planned to attack the Confederates and drive them away from the vital railroads. Although reinforced by about 400 men at Philippi, the Confederates, realizing themselves vastly outnumbered in the June 3 attack, fled, leaving more than 750 muskets, ammunition, wagons, horses, medical supplies and tents behind, so the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) would sometimes be called the &quot;Philippi Races.&quot; Gen. Lee soon replaced Porterfield with CSA Gen. Robert S. Garnett.

Although the Union controlled Grafton, Confederates often raided and vandalized to disrupt railroad operations. The Northwestern Virginia Railroad and its rail yard and machine shops at Grafton were also a probable objective of the Jones-Imboden Raid in April 1863. Raiders did destroy the 3-span bridge across the Monongahela River at Fairmont due north of Grafton (the largest on the line) as well as several smaller bridges, but Grafton&#x27;s rail yards, which were protected by Mulligan&#x27;s Brigade, the First and Eighth Maryland, and Miner&#x27;s Indiana battery, were not attacked.

===Post-war growth===

Following the Civil War, Grafton continued to grow and prosper, developing into a major retail and industrial center for North Central West Virginia. Grafton was visited by President U.S. Grant on September 23, 1872, as part of his reelection campaign. Grant&#x27;s speech was interrupted several times by noisy southern sympathizers.

In 1878, Grafton was designated as the county seat, replacing Pruntytown in this role. A massive flood which swept through town in 1888 wrought many changes, including destruction of the historic (1834) covered bridge at Fetterman. Most of present-day Grafton was built during the period from 1890 to 1930. John T. McGraw, a financier and major contributor to most of Grafton&#x27;s buildings, was the principal town builder. Besides his bank, McGraw built a number of buildings along Main Street, and also the streetcar system that was used for many years.

===20th century===
Tygart Dam was constructed about 2 miles south of Grafton between 1934 and 1938, by the Works Progress Administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. President Roosevelt visited the city on a stump tour, and remarked on such projects on October 1, 1936; he gained a landslide re-election the following month. Upstream of the dam, Tygart Lake State Park was designated to preserve recreation areas around the man-made lake. The Tygart Valley River flows through Grafton.

Grafton continued to prosper throughout much of the early 20th century, based on the railroad&#x27;s importance in both the area and the national economy. But in the early 1950s, the Carr China Plant closed and left hundreds of residents unemployed. In the late 1950s, Hazel Atlas Glass Plant closed and also left hundreds of residents without jobs. In 1958, the women of Grafton organized a parade on Main Street to attract jobs for residents of the community. This parade received national attention. Grafton was the chosen site of a plastic baby toys manufacturer. Because of the residents&#x27; efforts, Grafton was given an All-America City Award by the National Civic League in 1962, the smallest city that year to receive the award.

Although instrumental to the city&#x27;s early growth and economy, the railroad inhibited its expansion. In the 1920s smoke abatement experts reported that the combination of high hills, low wind velocity, and frequent railroad traffic, created air quality problems for the city and its business district, which was adjacent to the area of intense railroad activity. The resulting smoke from the railroad industry was a chief factor in hindering the growth of the city. Restructuring of the railroads and heavy industry through the late 20th century resulted in the loss of more jobs and, ultimately, population. People moved elsewhere for work.

In the early 1980s, the railroad relocated hundreds of jobs to Jacksonville, Florida, as the Chessie System aimed to form CSX. Grafton suffered a severe economic and emotional loss from these changes.

The 1985 Election day floods were notable in Grafton. Most of the 47 people killed in this incident were in Pendleton and Grant counties, according to the National Weather Service. Flooding in the Tygart Valley River basin (a tributary to the Monongahela River) set new records for peak discharge at all five of the long-term unregulated gauging stations in the basin. However, the peaks were not as extreme, relative to the previous peaks of record, as those in the Cheat River and South Branch Potomac River basins. Recurrence intervals for the peaks equaled or exceeded 50 years at all five of the aforementioned sites in the Tygart basin, and four were in excess of 100 years. Also, at one newly established gauging station, Three Forks Creek near Grafton, the peak discharge, , was estimated to exceed the 100-year recurrence interval.

===Historic places===
The Grafton Downtown Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and the Grafton National Cemetery was listed in 1982.

==National Cemeteries==

Thornsbury Bailey Brown was the first soldier killed in the Civil War, at Fetterman, now part of Grafton. He is interred at the Grafton National Cemetery. This was opened in 1868 to provide a burial ground for Union soldiers who died in West Virginia&#x27;s military hospitals and battlefields. The Federal Government selected Grafton as the site of the national cemetery for its proximity to the Maple Avenue Cemetery, which already contained the remains of many US Civil War veterans.

On June 14, the first governor of West Virginia, Arthur Boreman, officially dedicated the cemetery. The cemetery contains more than 2,100 interments, including 1,252 Union soldiers. 613 Civil War soldiers are buried as unknowns and their graves are identified with six-inch square marble markers. In 1875, an Act of Congress was passed authorizing &quot;preservation and maintenance&quot; of the cemetery. Two plaques on the lowest terrace contain stanzas from Theodore O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s poem &quot;Bivouac of the Dead.&quot;

Memorial Day services at Grafton National Cemetery include a special tradition known locally as &quot;Flower Strewing Day&quot;. Historically, each year a parade begins in downtown Grafton and winds to the cemetery, where town children place flowers at each grave marker. The day concludes with a memorial service officiated by a prominent West Virginian. Every governor, except one who served a term of only six days, has spoken at the Grafton National Cemetery at least once during their term in office.

== Folklore ==

=== The Grafton Monster ===
On June 15, 1964 Grafton Sentinel reporter Robert Cockrell spotted a mysterious creature in Grafton while he was on the road around 11 p.m. near the Tygart Valley River. This creature was large, standing around 7-9 feet tall, white, hairy and without a noticeable head. After witnessing this encounter, Cockrell was eager to write an article on the monster. The reports of this creature were thought to be unbelievable by the editors of the paper and they originally rejected his article. However, after more sources began to witness similar encounters, the news outlet allowed Cockrell to publish the report. Following Cockrell’s report, numerous individuals claimed to have seen the creature, leading to widespread interest and local investigations. Although many believe this creature to be real, no physical evidence has been found to substantiate the sightings. 

On June 15, 2024, Grafton celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Grafton Monster sighting during its Grafton Monster Festival. Hundreds of visits and vendors packed the streets of Grafton for the soft opening of the Grafton Monster Museum, located at 107 West Main St. The events that occurred during the two-day festival included guest speakers, a cryptid cosplay contest, and even a Grafton Monster calling contest, which resembled a whistling noise. The town is planning to make the Grafton Monster Festival a yearly event occurring each year on June 15.

Parsons was named for Ward Parsons, described by one source as having once owned the land on which the town was built, and by another as having been an aged wilderness pioneer in the area.

The West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway was built into Parsons in 1888. The railway caused the town to boom by the 1890s. The railway was later merged into the Western Maryland Railway and provided passenger train service until the 1950s.

In the early 1890s, a dispute known as the Tucker County Seat War took place between the people in the town of Parsons and that of St. George over the location of the county seat. Although nobody was killed in the &quot;war,&quot; the situation came to a climax when a mob of armed men from Parsons marched on St. George and took the county records by force.

===1985 flood===
The 1985 Cheat River flood caused extensive damage in Parsons. Over 90 percent of the businesses and hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed. Twenty-five years later, in 2010, several empty storefronts lined the street up to the courthouse. Bars, restaurants, clothing stores and other businesses never returned to Parsons. The floods caused an estimated $570 million in damages. More than 3,500 homes and 180 businesses were destroyed. The BF Long &amp; Co general store had a &quot;high water mark&quot; more than 7&#x27;6&quot; from the floorboards. Flood stage in the shallow riverbed was only 7 feet.

<text>Thomas is a city and former coal town in Tucker County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 623 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Thomas was platted in 1884. Thomas was named for Thomas Beall Davis (1828-1911), brother of Senator Henry Gassaway Davis. The Davis brothers, in 1883, opened a mine near Thomas and had coal ready to ship when their railway arrived a year later. By 1892, Davis Coal and Coke was among the largest and best known coal companies in the world and employed 1,600 people. At the peak of its operations in 1915, there were nine producing mines within a mile of the company&#x27;s office in Thomas.

Immigrants flocked to the area as miners, railroad laborers, or merchants. The company employed a man named Wladyslaw Dackiewicz as an interpreter. He could speak, read, and write eight languages and his services were much in demand with the influx of immigrants.

In 1901, in less than two hours, nearly half of Thomas (83 buildings) was destroyed by a fire. The city was quickly rebuilt with fine hotels and a new opera house. The Cottrill Opera House had a saloon on the first floor which was by far the most elegant of the eight bars located on Front Street. In 1909, Front Street (also known as First Street, Main Street, and East Avenue) was laid with brick to become the first paved street in the county.

Thomas claimed to have the grandest railway station between Cumberland, Maryland, and Elkins, West Virginia. Built of brick in 1901, it was destroyed by a tornado in 1944.

In 1921, coke production ceased and mining operations slowed.

The Cottrill Opera House, Davis Coal and Coke Company Administrative Building, Fairfax Stone, and Thomas Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

<text>Sistersville is a city in Tyler County, West Virginia, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 1,413 at the 2020 census. The Sistersville Ferry crosses the Ohio River to the unincorporated community of Fly in Monroe County, Ohio.

==History==
Sistersville was named because two sisters, Sarah Wells McCoy and Delilah Wells Grier, inherited the land underlying the town from their father, pioneer Charles Wells, in 1815 and laid out the town. Wells had settled on the sandy bottomland with his second wife, Elizabeth Prather and many of his 22 children (Sarah and Delilah were the 12th and 17th; his first wife Michal Owings had died in 1783 after giving birth to 10 children). The site was called Wells Landing, Wella having previously founded Wellsville and Wellsburg along the Ohio River and having served in the Virginia legislature from Brooke County in 1793. The Virginia General Assembly created Tyler County in 1814, weeks before Wells&#x27; death, and a court session was held at Wells&#x27; house in Sistersville (&quot;Welkin&quot;) in 1815 (the plat having included lots for a courthouse and lawyers&#x27; offices), but in 1816 voters selected Middlebourne, on Middle Island Creek about halfway between Pennsylvania and the Kanawha salt springs (and which incorporated in 1813) as the county seat. The Virginia General Assembly chartered Sistersville in 1839. By 1850, Sistersville had grain and wool carding mills. The ferry across the Ohio River which James Jolly had started decades earlier would still be operating in the 21st century. The Russell Building (built in 1840 as a ferry house) would survive many floods and later serve as a market and the offices of the &quot;Oil Review&quot; edited by J. Hanford McCoy.

Following the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Sistersville and Tyler County were divided, but leaned toward the Union (s did their militia group, the &quot;Sistersville Blues&quot;). Nonetheless, Confederate sympathizers seized militia equipment at Sistersville, including dozens of rifles and two small cannons, and the Ohio militiamen sent to protect Parkersburg took more than a month to recover them. Judge Abraham Soper, a New York lawyer and New Jersey judge who had moved to Sisterville in 1847, became Tyler County&#x27;s representative to the Wheeling Convention and the West Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1862–1863. Fellow delegates elected him their president for the reconvened session of February 1863 (because Congress required the new state&#x27;s constitution to contain an antislavery provision, which President Abraham Lincoln approved in December 1862). On March 26, voters overwhelmingly ratified the new Constitution (28,321 to 572), so President Lincoln soon acknowledged the revision as adequate thus creating the state of West Virginia. When West Virginia&#x27;s first legislature divided Tyler County in to districts in 1863, Sistersville was in the Lincoln District.

For years, many believed that oil and natural gas was under Sistersville, because natural gas and salt water had been bubbling up in Burning Springs since before 1836 (in what became Wirt County and development there became an oil boom beginning in 1860). However, the drill Philo Stocking used in 1865 became stuck before it reached oil, but he made sure to retain oil and gas rights to land he sold, which later made him rich. The large Sistersville Oil Field was only confirmed in 1891, with the &quot;Joshua Russell Pole Cat No. 1&quot;, successfully drilled by Russell and Edward Paden near Pole Cat creek after they drained salt water for a year. The find proved one of the more productive wells in the field, still producing oil (some refined as gasoline) in 1925. The find occurred as the oil fields in Oil City, Pennsylvania (developed beginning 1861) were running dry and technology had progressed to drain the initial water cap above the oil. Within a few years, Sistersville had ballooned into a city of 15,000 people. In 1893, Sisterville (briefly) was the &quot;oil capital of the world&quot;. Unlike some of the Pennsylvania boom towns which became ghost towns, Sistersville invested in infrastructure, and the railroad had arrived in 1884. A spur connected Sistersville to the county seat at Middlebourne.

A disastrous flood of the Ohio River in 1913 (which crested at 51.5 feet at Wheeling upriver and 69.9 feet downriver at Cincinnati) caused considerable damage in Sistersville, Otherwise, the disasters Sistersville faced usually involved fire, long before a 1970 fire that destroyed a historic downtown block. Sistersville long had several fire brigades or pumping companies. A gasoline plant was built at the oil field and in 1911 the Carter Oil company built the world&#x27;s largest gasoline print south of SIstersville, which had an explosion in 1913 but rebuilt, such that the American Petroleum Institute cited for its gas development work in 1925. Sistersville took pride in Tyler High School graduate Cecil H. Underwood (1922- 2008) who at age 22 represented the county in the House of Delegates, and became the youngest-ever West Virginia governor in 1956, then in 1996 was elected again and became the state&#x27;s oldest governor.

The Sistersville City Hall is a historic city hall building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City Hall is contributing property of the Sistersville Historic District.

Other listed historic properties in Sistersville include the Wells-Schaff House (a/k/a &quot;Welkin&quot; was built beginning in 1832 by Eli Wells, son of Charles Wells, who wanted a residence outside the flood plain, and expanded in 1896 and renovated circa 1935), the Wells Inn (opened 1895, built by Eli Wells&#x27;s son Ephraim who fostered local business development), the E. A. Durham House (built circa 1921 for oil executive E.A. Durham), and the Wells-Twyford House (built beginning 1854 by Eli Wells and owned by his heirs until acquired by the Twyford family, descended from Elizabeth Wells Archer, a different family than the Charles Wells descendants).

<text>Buckhannon is the only incorporated city in, and the county seat of, Upshur County, West Virginia, United States. Located along the Buckhannon River, the population was 5,299 as of the 2020 census. The city is southwest of Morgantown, northeast of the capital city of Charleston, and south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is home to West Virginia Wesleyan College and the , held annually during the third week of May.

==History==

According to tradition, the first settlers in the Buckhannon River Valley were brothers John and Samuel Pringle. John and Samuel were soldiers serving in the British army during the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) who, in 1761, deserted their posts at Fort Pitt (present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). They traveled southward and upstream along the Monongahela and Tygart Valley rivers, continuing up what is now called the Buckhannon River. John and Samuel are said to have arrived in present-day Upshur County in 1764 and took up residence in the hollow stump of an American sycamore tree. They lived there for three years, surviving on game and fish. When they ran out of bullets in 1765, John made the journey to settlements along the South Branch Potomac River to purchase more and found out from the locals that the war was over and the brothers were no longer wanted men. After his return, they moved to the South Branch settlements. John later went to Kentucky, but Samuel returned to the river valley in 1769 with his new wife Charity Pringle (née Cutright), her brother John Jr., friends Thomas Hughes, and John and Elizabeth Jackson with their sons George and Edward. (Edward was the grandfather of Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson).

The City of Buckhannon was established on January 15, 1816, possible named for Buckongahelas (1720-1805), the legendary Lenape Chief. A statue of Buckongahelas and his fallen son, crafted by Buckhannon sculptor Ross Straight, was erected in Buckhannon West Virginia’s Jawbone Park in 2000. Other historians think it more likely that the community and river were both named for John Buchannon, a missionary to the area in the 1780s. The city was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1852, and remained part of the Commonwealth of Virginia until the secession of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, during the American Civil War. Because of its near-central geographic location, Buckhannon was long considered a prospective site for the state capital. In 1866, the legislature approved a bill including Buckhannon among the choices for capital, but officials decided the river was not wide enough to accommodate desired commerce and ultimately settled with Charleston as the state capitol.

The first courthouse was built in 1854. It served multiple functions, including as an opera house and town hall. Electricity was installed in 1891 to replace oil lamps, but the building suffered fire damage in the first six months of electrical service, eventually being razed in 1898. In its place, a Classical Revival style courthouse, designed by Charleston architect Harrison Albright, begun construction in 1899 and was completed in 1901. An annex of the same style was added in 1995. In the cornerstone of the main building is a time capsule filled with turn of the 19th century artifacts.

The Sago Mine Disaster, January 2, 2006, killed 12 and left one survivor. Officials said that a lightning strike in the coal caused the explosion. It was the worst mining disaster in the US since a 2001 disaster in Alabama killed 13 people, and the worst disaster in West Virginia since a 1968 incident that killed 78 people. National and international news crews were in the area for upwards of three days to cover rescue and recovery efforts.

<text>Ceredo is a town in Wayne County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Ohio River. The population was 1,408 at the 2020 census. Ceredo is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649.

The city is also near the location of the Southern Airways Flight 932 aviation disaster. On November 14, 1970, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airplane carrying the Marshall University football team crashed on a hillside on approach to the Tri-State Airport, killing all 75 on board. A movie about the tragedy, &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, was released in 2006.

==History==
Ceredo was named by its founder for the bountiful harvest of corn upon the site. The name derives from Ceres, the goddess of corn and harvest.

New England Congregationalists under the American Emigrant Aid and Homestead Company founded Ceredo to demonstrate the superiority of an economic system not based on slave labor. Eli Thayer, an abolitionist congressman from Massachusetts, believed that bringing abolitionists like himself into southern states could ultimately bring about the end of slavery. While some welcomed the newcomers, several area newspapers published opinions against this &quot;invasion.&quot; The newspaper of nearby Ashland, Kentucky, however, supported this move. By 1857, the city was fully established with a newspaper and several industries. Ceredo was the only town established by Thayer and the Homestead Company due to financial issues. 

With John Brown&#x27;s raid at Harpers Ferry in 1859 and the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the situation for this abolitionist colony appeared bleak. Its purpose to bring about the peaceful end of slavery over, several residents volunteered for pro-Union regiments. The town would become the station point for the Union 5th West Virginia Infantry, until they were stationed elsewhere and the town was devastated by guerilla raids. By the end of the war, much of the industry had been destroyed and a majority of the northern emigrants had fled. Thayer eventually transferred ownership of the town to Congressmen Charles B. Hoard. Hoard and his descendants rebuilt Ceredo into a small town, although the community never reached the original vision of Thayer and the Homestead Company.

<doc id="138621" wikidata="Q1991953" url="?curid=138621" title="Fort Gay, West Virginia">
<text>Fort Gay is a town in Wayne County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Tug Fork and Big Sandy rivers. The town adjoins Louisa, Kentucky. The population was 677 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Fort Gay community traces back to 1789, when 11 people established a settlement at the junction of the Tug and Big Sandy rivers, across from what is now Louisa, Kentucky. In 1875, it was chartered as Cassville; though it was simultaneously known as Fort Gay. In 1932, the town&#x27;s name was officially changed to Fort Gay. Although there is no evidence as to why the name was changed, there are several prevalent theories: that either the railroad company or post office did not want two Cassvilles on the same route/state (there is another Cassville, West Virginia), or that a Civil War nurse named Gay became synonymous with the town.

Fort Gay is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649.

The Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Kenova District goes through the western edge of town.

In 2010, Fort Gay got media attention when Microsoft suspended an Xbox Live account that belonged to a Fort Gay resident for writing &quot;Fort Gay WV&quot; as his location, as Microsoft has language policies that prohibit references to homosexuality. Microsoft customer service representatives refused to acknowledge that Fort Gay existed, and it took an appeal from Mayor David Thompson and media coverage for the issue to be corrected.

==Geography==

==Arts and culture==

Dreamland Pool, first opened in 1926, was once the largest swimming pool in the United States east of the Mississippi River, measuring by . The original construction included a three-story pavilion that ran the length of the pool. The top floor of the pavilion included a dance floor, where many notable Big Bands played though the 1930s and 1940s and attracted big names such as Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, and Frank Sinatra. A fire in 1972 destroyed the pavilion, but the rest of the facility survived. The pool was conveyed to the City of Kenova in 1973. Presently, the Kenova Parks &amp; Recreation Board oversees the operation and management of the facility. About the size of a football field, Dreamland sports two cement floats equidistant from each other in the middle of the pool to allow swimmers a place to rest. Dreamland Pool was recently renovated in 2015.

The 1891 Victorian Joseph S. Miller House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was once visited by President Grover Cleveland. In recent years it has become known as The Pumpkin House, because of the more than 3000 hand-carved Jack-o-Lanterns which owner Ric Griffith, the town&#x27;s previous mayor and current pharmacist, adorn it with each Halloween season. The Pumpkin House has received national media attention and has been featured on segments of NBC&#x27;s The Today Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and many other media outlets. Pumpkin house owner Ric Griffith is also a longtime owner of the Griffith and Feil Drug Store, an old-time drug store with an authentic early 20th-century soda fountain that he has totally restored. His father, the longtime Kenova businessman and resident Dick Griffith worked in the pharmacy on a semi-retirement basis for many years until he was in his early 90s. He also sponsored a tennis tournament that bears his name in nearby Huntington.

==Education==
Since the closing of Ceredo-Kenova and Buffalo-Wayne High Schools in 1998, Kenova Elementary is the lone public education facility within Kenova city limits. The school has been awarded multiple national blue ribbons in academic achievement. Buffalo Elementary and Buffalo Middle schools are also located near Kenova, but just outside city limits. The former Ceredo-Kenova High School, locally known as &quot;C-K,&quot; boasted a great number of athletic state championships, including 12 in football, two in basketball, one in cheerleading, and in 1995 won their only WV State Class A Region 4 Baseball championship. Buffalo can credit championships in boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball and in football to their accomplishments. In 1998, Ceredo-Kenova and Buffalo-Wayne High Schools were closed and consolidated with Huntington-based Vinson High School to form Spring Valley High School. The former Vinson High School is now known as Vinson Middle School. In 2015 the former Ceredo-Kenova High School was demolished, and the former Buffalo-Wayne High School was razed in September 2019.

<text>Wayne is a town in and the county seat of Wayne County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,441 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==Name==
Wayne was established in 1842, by the same act of the Virginia General Assembly that created Wayne County. The county was named for General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne. The town was initially known by the name &quot;Trout&#x27;s Hill,&quot; after Abraham Trout, who donated the land upon which the county&#x27;s courthouse was built. The Wayne Courthouse Post Office was established in 1842 also. The town was known simultaneously as Trout&#x27;s Hill and Wayne Courthouse for many years. The town was incorporated in 1860 and 1882 as Fairview, but was still commonly known as Wayne Courthouse. The population in 1882 was 157. In 1890, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad was constructed up Twelve Pole Creek. The railroad placed the name &quot;Wayne&quot; on its schedule and the name caught on. The name was officially changed to Wayne in 1911.

==History==
Settlers arrived near the town of Wayne in the early 1800s. Abraham Trout began operating a mill where the town now stands in 1828 at a waterfall on Twelve Pole Creek. Later on, he built a mill dam.

By the 1830s, the population in western Cabell County was growing, and it became necessary to form a new county in the area. Initially, a group of men from the Big Sandy River attempted to get a county created in 1840 with the county seat at the forks of the Big Sandy River where present Fort Gay is now located but it failed. A year later, men from Twelve Pole began working toward a new county with the county seat near the forks of Twelve Pole Creek. They were successful, and the new county was established on January 18, 1842, and named after General Anthony Wayne.

The county seat was located on the farm of Abraham Trout, who donated land for the town square and government buildings. He then began dividing up the land around the square and selling it. The town was known as Trout&#x27;s Hill and Wayne Courthouse once a post office was established.

In 1860, it was incorporated and officially named Fairview, but the name was not very popular. Most still used the old names. In about 1860, a military unit called the Fairview Rifles was formed at Trout&#x27;s Hill and became part of the 8th Virginia Cavalry during the war.

When the Civil War erupted, celebration erupted in Trout&#x27;s Hill and the American flag was replaced by the Virginia flag. In late August 1861, a three-day skirmish raged in the streets of Trout&#x27;s Hill as Union troops from Ceredo tried to obtain the county records. The Union men camped in the courthouse, and local Rebels tried to force them out. Having accomplished their goal, the Yankees returned to Ceredo. Several more Union raids were launched against Trout&#x27;s Hill During the war.

After the war, Trout&#x27;s Hill was at the entrance to the vast timberlands and coal fields of southern Wayne County. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway built through the town in 1890 and established a station in town. Hearing the name Wayne Courthouse, the railroad shortened it to Wayne and the name has been used ever since. The name change was made official in 1911.

From the 1890s to the 1920s, the town of Wayne had to fight to keep the courthouse. The towns of Ceredo, Kenova and even Westmoreland wanted the county seat moved to their locations. During the courthouse wars, numerous buildings in the town of Wayne were burned including the courthouse in 1921. Much of the town, including the Wayne County Bank, was destroyed in 1905 when fire erupted during one of the most heated fights for the courthouse.

<doc id="138624" wikidata="Q2131995" url="?curid=138624" title="Webster Springs, West Virginia">
<text>Addison, commonly known as Webster Springs, is a town in and the county seat of Webster County, West Virginia, United States. Although it was incorporated as Addison in 1892, it is more frequently referred to as Webster Springs, the name of the town&#x27;s post office. It was named for Addison McLaughlin, upon whose land the town was originally laid out. The population was 731 at the 2020 census.

The town was famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for its numerous salt sulfur water wells. People believed that the water from the wells had medicinal qualities.

Webster Springs sits at the confluence of the Elk River and its Back Fork. The town has numerous shops, retail stores, grocery stores, pharmacies, a motel, and several restaurants. Government offices for the municipality, county, and state are available in the town. The town is served by the Addison Public Library and fire service is provided by the Webster Springs Volunteer Fire Department.

==Etymology==
The name of the town is officially &quot;Addison&quot;, but the community is most often referred to by the name of its post office, &quot;Webster Springs&quot;. It is also labeled on some maps as &quot;Addison&quot;, and some as &quot;Webster Springs&quot;. The unofficial name has gone so far that the county commission&#x27;s letterhead reads &quot;Webster Springs,&quot; rather than &quot;Addison&quot;, which it had previously.

Other names for the town have included Elk Lick and Fork Lick.

==History==

The town&#x27;s first permanent settlers were named William and Polly (maiden name, &quot;Friend&quot;) Arthur, who arrived in 1860. The first post office established in Webster County was Fort Lick, present-day Webster Springs. The postmaster at the time was a man by the name of John Hall. It is also the county seat of Webster County

The Morton House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

===Salt sulfur wells===
Hall, along with a man whose first name is not known, who is only known as Mr. Skidmore, drilled the first salt sulfur well in the county, it was known as &quot;Old Spring.&quot; The well was later owned by Colonel John T. McGraw. The salt sulfur well helped make Webster Springs a popular summer tourist location during the 19th and early 20th Century.

According to &quot;Springs in West Virginia&quot;, Webster Springs had a total of four springs: the Addison McLaughlin Well, located to the west of Court Square on the present site of the Mineral Springs Motel; Old Fork Lick Spring, located in the bed of the Elk River; Tracy Well, located on the lot of its owner, W.B. Tracy, in Webster Springs; and the William Smith Well, located in Dorrtown. The wells were popular because people believed that the water from the wells had medicinal qualities. The water was used to treat skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, acne and arthritis.

===Webster Springs Hotel===
In 1897, Senator Johnson Newlon Camden built the Webster Springs Hotel, a 265-room hotel of Victorian style architecture. It was larger than The Greenbrier Hotel, built in 1913 in White Sulfur Springs, which only has 250 rooms. The hotel contained a tennis court, horse stables, garden, bowling alley, power plant, and Russian and Victorian Turkish baths, where visitors could enjoy the &quot;medicinal&quot; qualities of its salt sulfur waters. The hotel was also the largest wood-frame hotel in West Virginia.

When first built, the hotel was a three-story dark colored building. After it was completed, construction began on a new, much larger section of the hotel, adding more rooms, and a new exterior color, white. The new section of the hotel contained up-to-date Turkish bath equipment, where guests could have a sulfur water bath. For many years, filled to capacity by guests and a greatly increased overflow which necessitated the building of smaller hotels in the town. The hotel also raised its own cattle and provided some of its own food and milk. The hotel&#x27;s ice house, according to &quot;Elizah Hedding Gillespie, His Ancestors, Descendants and Their Families&quot;, was capable of holding 150 tons of ice. The hotel was heated by steam.
In 1903, Colonel McGraw purchased the hotel and expanded it by 115 rooms, completed in the spring of 1904. Of the 89 &quot;non-guest&quot; rooms in the new section, 40 were for salt sulfur baths, which took up the entire first floor of one wing. The entire southern wing of the hotel was given to bath rooms, including; &quot;the plunge,&quot; Turkish, Russian, Needle, Shower, and Steam baths. Of which they were offered in both fresh and salt-sulfur water.

On the interior, it contained stuffed bears, elks, and other wildlife of the local county in realistic poses.

At the height of its popularity, the hotel played host to such guests as Senators Thomas Kearns (Utah), Henry G. Davis (West Virginia), his son-in-law, Stephen Benton Elkins (West Virginia), and Camden himself.

On the night of July 20, 1925, the hotel caught fire and was burned to the ground, being completely destroyed. Flames could be seen as far as one mile away, as well, the sky was seen as a bright red color, up to 19 miles away, in Camden-on-Gauley.

<text>Parkersburg is a city in and the county seat of Wood County, West Virginia, United States. Located at the confluence of the Ohio and Little Kanawha rivers, it is the state&#x27;s fourth-most populous city and the center of the Parkersburg–Vienna metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s population was 29,749 at the 2020 census, and its metro population was 89,490. The city is about south of Marietta, Ohio.

==History==
Settlers at first named the city Newport when they settled it in the late 18th century following the American Revolutionary War. A town section was laid out on land granted to Alexander Parker for his Revolutionary War service. Virginia made grants of land to veterans for their war service. The title conflicts between Parker and the city planners of Newport were settled in 1809 in favor of his heirs. The town was renamed Parkersburg in 1810. It was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1820. It was rechartered as a city in 1860.

The town was the western terminus of both the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike and the Northwestern Turnpike. In 1857, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built a branch line south to the town from Wheeling, West Virginia. Travelers wanting to connect with the Ohio Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, one of the east–west lines along the Ohio River, had to take a steamboat 14 miles north to Marietta, Ohio. Jacob Linville designed the railroad bridge planned by the B&amp;O. It was constructed in 1868–1870 between Parkersburg and Belpre, Ohio, as part of the B&amp;O&#x27;s main line from Baltimore to St. Louis, Missouri. This drew traffic and trade from Marietta. Today the structure is known as the Parkersburg Bridge.

Parkersburg served as a transportation and medical center for Union forces during the American Civil War. It developed further as a transportation hub in the gas and oil boom following that war.

In the late 19th century, Parkersburg emerged as a major oil refining center serving nearby oilfields at Volcano and Burning Springs. The Camden Consolidated Oil Company, founded in 1866 by future U.S. Senator Johnson Newlon Camden, dominated the refining business and was sold to Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Company in 1875. Camden became a Standard director and vice president and, along with John W. Davis, dominated West Virginia politics until the early 20th century.

In the post-World War II period, Parkersburg became one of the leading industrial centers of the Ohio Valley, producing chemicals, glass, O. Ames tools, textiles (especially American Viscose Company rayon), plastics and polymers, iron, and steel.

The Bureau of the Public Debt, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, was moved to Parkersburg in 1954 as a location midway between Chicago and Washington, D.C. that would be safe in the event of a national emergency. In October 2012, the Bureau of the Public Debt consolidated with the Financial Management Service to form the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is situated at the confluence of the Little Kanawha and Ohio rivers. The Little Kanawha River divides the north and south sides of the city. Worthington Creek, a tributary of the Little Kanawha River, flows through the eastern part of the city.

==Culture==

Since 1976, the Ohio River Sternwheel Festival has been a major event on both sides of the Ohio River, in the towns of Williamstown and Marietta, Ohio. The celebration was created around the races of the sternwheelers (also known as the paddle steamer) that the Mid-Ohio Valley is known for, and today there are pageants, live music, food and a grand fireworks display. The event brings many local community members back to the area around the Labor Day weekend in the month of September.

When the first Fireman&#x27;s Ice Cream Social was held in 1944, the Williamstown Volunteer Fire Company was already in its 42nd year of service to the community. &quot;The Social&quot; is a homecoming for both current and former residents. Current attendance approaches 3,500 as people of all ages gather in Tomlinson Park, the third Friday evening in July each year, to enjoy hot dogs, popcorn, soft drinks, coffee, pies and cakes that are donated by community members, and more than one hundred gallons of ice cream provided by the volunteer firefighters. The annual event brings the community together and now raises about $8,000 a year for firefighter training and equipment upgrades.

The Saturday following the Ice Cream Social, the Williamstown High School Alumni Association holds an Annual Dinner at the high school, for all WHS alumni. Most WHS class reunions are also held that same July weekend.

==Fenton Glass==
Founded in 1905 by brothers Frank L. and John W. Fenton, the Fenton Art Glass Company is the largest manufacturer of hand made glass in the United States. The firm is now led by third- and fourth-generation Fenton family members.

After officials of Fenton Art Glass announced the fifth generation family company would shut down the 100-year-old factory at the end of 2007, thousands of loyal Fenton customers reacted with an outpouring of orders, selling out the QVC show that was to be its last in just minutes instead of the scheduled 2-hour show. Fenton is now open and working to stay open; tours are run daily through the gift shop and orders are placed online, on QVC and via its decades-old catalog. Fenton Art Glass Company has officially stopped making glass.

As of May 24, 2012 completion the sale of selected assets as scheduled. This included the sale of the name and logo, the formulas for the glass, molds and other materials that were used by the company. However, today the company now makes handcrafted glass jewelry; including beads and Teardrop earrings. The jewelry is made in many of the classic Fenton colors and styles popular with collectors.

On June 2, 2017, the Wood County Board of Education purchased the factory and surrounding properties to build a new elementary school.

<doc id="138642" wikidata="Q2186059" url="?curid=138642" title="Mullens, West Virginia">
<text>Mullens is a city in Wyoming County, West Virginia. The population was 1,475 at the time of the 2020 census.

Located in a valley along the Guyandotte River within a mountainous region of southern West Virginia, the town was nearly destroyed by flash flooding in July 2001. While the town has attempted to redevelop with the aid of state and federal recovery money, many local businesses and residents have left the area permanently.

== History ==
Mullens was incorporated as a town on September 17, 1912, and operated under a charter issued by the Circuit Court of Wyoming County. It was named for A. J. Mullins, who owned the land upon which the town is built. The town&#x27;s original name was spelled with an &quot;i&quot;; a recording error accounts for the error in spelling, which was never corrected. An Act of the West Virginia Legislature granting a charter to the City of Mullens was passed February 22, 1929.

The early growth of the Mullens community came with development of the lumber and coal mining industries. In the early 20th century, coal-mining manager and developer William Nelson Page of Ansted helped open the Winding Gulf Coalfield with plans for the Deepwater Railway, a new short-line railroad. When Page ran into competitive collusion by the bigger railroads which would have wrecked his project, backed by his silent partner, wealthy industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, the plan was expanded in a secretive and massive way to build a line all the way east to the port of Hampton Roads.

Completed in 1909, the Virginian Railway (VGN) established engine terminal and yard facilities near Mullens which employed hundreds of workers during the first half of the 20th century. The VGN was merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) in 1959, and both later became part of the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). A caboose museum in Mullens celebrates the history of the railroad in the region.

The Mullens Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The nearby Wyco Church was listed in 2010.

A Beckley to Mullens section of State Route 121, the Coalfields Expressway, was opened on October 1, 2020 and dedicated in a ceremony by the Governor.

<text>Pineville is a town in and the county seat of Wyoming County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Guyandotte River. The population was 648 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pineville was settled by William Short in 1853.

In 1863, Hiram Clay first settled near the site of present Pineville. The community was once called Castlerock, and the post office there was once named Rock Castle. The town was renamed Pineville for the local pine forest and incorporated as a town under that name in 1907. It was named because it was built on the site of a black or pitch pine forest.

Pineville became the county seat in 1907, replacing Oceana after a series of disputed elections. Castle Rock, the towering sandstone formation for which Rockcastle Creek is named, is located at Pineville and is the major local landmark. The Wyoming County Courthouse (1916) is on the National Register of Historic Places.

On April 29, 1960, then Senator John F. Kennedy stopped into Pineville, drawing a crowd of 800. Kennedy spoke briefly over the local radio station WWYO during his time in the town. He then marched with the Pineville High School (West Virginia) band from the radio station to the Wyoming County Courthouse where he spoke to the crowd.

The Pinnacle Drive Inn has operated in Pineville since the late 1950s, and was operated by Carolyn Clay, a well-known native of the town. It closed for a brief period in early 2017, but reopened later that year under new ownership in honor of Clay, and her legacy of service to her community.
==Geography==
Pineville is located at (37.582925, −81.535302). The Guyandotte River flows through Pineville, and collects its tributaries Rockcastle Creek and Pinnacle Creek within the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Many subdivisions or outer areas are considered part of Pineville, including Key Rock, New Richmond, Skin Fork, Mullensville, Glover, Wolf Pen, Rock View, and others, but the town limits are much smaller than the area considered part of Pineville. Unique in the county school system, Pineville&#x27;s secondary school had no feeder schools. Only after the county&#x27;s population declined sharply in the 1990s did consolidation and closure of the Glen Rogers High School cause students who attended elementary school outside of Pineville to attend middle or high school in Pineville. Further consolidation ended the town&#x27;s high school, which was consolidated with Mullens High School to form Wyoming East High School. Students from the catchment areas of the former Herndon, Glen Rogers, Mullens, and Pineville High Schools attend this high school.

La Pointe was originally the site of a fortified French trading post from 1693 to 1698 and from 1718 to 1759. The current city began to develop in the late 18th century as an American Fur Company outpost under the leadership of Michel Cadotte.

Warren, whose mother was French-Ojibwa, learned from maternal tribal elders that the Ojibwa originally lived near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. At the time of great sickness and death, the Great Spirit interceded through Manabosho, a common uncle of the Anishinubag (spontaneous people). Through the discovery of the snakeroot they were granted the rite, enabled through their Medawe (religion), &quot;wherewith life is restored and prolonged.&quot; The great Megis (seashell) showed itself as a glossy thing reflecting on the sea. It led them first to a place near Montreal where they stayed for some time. Next it led them to Boweting (Sault Ste. Marie); again they stayed for some time. At last it led them to Moningwunakauning (La Pointe, Madeline Island), &quot;where it has ever since reflected back the rays of the sun, and blessed our ancestors with life, light and wisdom,&quot; says Warren. So the flickering shaft of light is the Megis, and La Pointe is the center of the Earth for the Ojibwa.

Kechewaishke, commonly known as &quot;Chief Buffalo&quot;, was an Ojibwa leader born at La Pointe in 1759. Recognized as the principal chief of the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwa) for nearly a half-century until his death in 1855, he led his nation into a treaty relationship with the United States Government, signing treaties in 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854. He was also instrumental in resisting the efforts of the United States to remove the Ojibwa and in securing permanent reservations for his people near Lake Superior.

Licensed Indian traders operated at this location and nearby stores at Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation and other convenient places.

Today, the town&#x27;s history is preserved at Madeline Island Historical Museum.

&quot;“The second branch&quot; [of the Bad River] &quot;from the west having, as I could learn, no name, I have called it the&quot; ‘Maringouin Fork‘ &quot;in my map in commemoration of the myriads of mosquitoes that inhabit its banks, that being the name the half-breed French give to those pests of the Bad River region. The Maringouin has its sources near Long Lake, on the west, and on the south interlocks with the upper branches of the Chippewa River, among some lakes, enclosed by drift ridges, which are, by barometrical measurement, eight hundred and seventy-one feet above Lake Superior.”&quot;

<text>In mathematics, Landau&#x27;s function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), named after Edmund Landau, is defined for every natural number &quot;n&quot; to be the largest order of an element of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the largest least common multiple (lcm) of any partition of &quot;n&quot;, or the maximum number of times a permutation of &quot;n&quot; elements can be recursively applied to itself before it returns to its starting sequence.

For instance, 5 = 2 + 3 and lcm(2,3) = 6. No other partition of 5 yields a bigger lcm, so &quot;g&quot;(5) = 6. An element of order 6 in the group &quot;S&quot;5 can be written in cycle notation as (1 2) (3 4 5). Note that the same argument applies to the number 6, that is, &quot;g&quot;(6) = 6. There are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive numbers &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; + &quot;m&quot; on which the function &quot;g&quot; is constant.

The integer sequence &quot;g&quot;(0) = 1, &quot;g&quot;(1) = 1, &quot;g&quot;(2) = 2, &quot;g&quot;(3) = 3, &quot;g&quot;(4) = 4, &quot;g&quot;(5) = 6, &quot;g&quot;(6) = 6, &quot;g&quot;(7) = 12, &quot;g&quot;(8) = 15, ... is named after Edmund Landau, who proved in 1902 that
:formula_1
(where ln denotes the natural logarithm). Equivalently (using little-o notation), formula_2.

More precisely,
:formula_3

If formula_4, where formula_5 denotes the prime counting function, formula_6 the logarithmic integral function with inverse formula_7, and we may take formula_8 for some constant &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 by Ford, then
:formula_9

The statement that
:formula_10
for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot; is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.

It can be shown that
:formula_11
with the only equality between the functions at &quot;n&quot; = 0, and indeed
:formula_12
