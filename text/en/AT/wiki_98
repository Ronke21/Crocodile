<text>An HIV vaccine is a potential vaccine that could be either a preventive vaccine or a therapeutic vaccine, which means it would either protect individuals from being infected with HIV or treat HIV-infected individuals. It is thought that an HIV vaccine could either induce an immune response against HIV (active vaccination approach) or consist of preformed antibodies against HIV (passive vaccination approach).

Two active vaccine regimens, studied in the RV 144 and Imbokodo trials, showed they can prevent HIV in some individuals; however, the protection was in relatively few individuals, and was not long lasting. For these reasons, no HIV vaccines have been licensed for the market yet. 

==Difficulties in development==
In 1984, after it was confirmed that HIV caused AIDS, the United States Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler declared that a vaccine would be available within two years. However, priming the adaptive immune system to recognize the viral envelope proteins did not prevent HIV acquisition.

Many factors make the development of an HIV vaccine different from other classic vaccines (as of 1996):
* Classic vaccines mimic natural immunity against reinfection as seen in individuals recovered from infection; there are few recovered AIDS patients.
* Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing AIDS.
* Most effective vaccines are whole-killed or live-attenuated organisms; killed HIV-1 does not retain antigenicity and the use of a live retrovirus vaccine raises safety issues.

===HIV structure===

The epitopes of the viral envelope are more variable than those of many other viruses. Furthermore, the functionally important epitopes of the gp120 protein are masked by glycosylation, trimerisation and receptor-induced conformational changes making it difficult to block with neutralizing antibodies.

The ineffectiveness of previously developed vaccines primarily stems from two related factors:
* First, HIV is highly mutable. Because of the virus&#x27;s ability to rapidly respond to selective pressures imposed by the immune system, the population of virus in an infected individual typically evolves so that it can evade the two major arms of the adaptive immune system; humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (mediated by T cells) immunity.
* Second, HIV isolates are themselves highly variable. HIV can be categorized into multiple subtypes with a high degree of genetic divergence. Therefore, the immune responses raised by any vaccine need to be broad enough to account for this variability. Any vaccine that lacks this breadth is unlikely to be effective.

The difficulties in stimulating a reliable antibody response has led to the attempts to develop a vaccine that stimulates a response by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

Another response to the challenge has been to create a single peptide that contains the least variable components of all the known HIV strains.

It had been observed that a few, but not all, HIV-infected individuals naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) which keep the virus suppressed, and these people remain asymptomatic for decades. Since the 2010s a core candidate is VRC01 and similar BNAbs, as they have been found in multiple unrelated people. These antibodies mimic CD4 and compete for the conserved CD4 binding site. These antibodies all share a germline origin in the VH chain, where only a few human alleles of the IVIG1-2 gene are able to produce such an antibody. Env is a protein on the HIV surface that enables to infect cells. Env extends from the surface of the HIV virus particle. The spike-shaped protein is &quot;trimeric&quot; — with 3 identical molecules, each with a cap-like region called glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and a stem called glycoprotein 41 (gp41) that anchors Env in the viral membrane. Only the functional portions of Env remain constant, but these are generally hidden from the immune system by the molecule&#x27;s structure. X-ray analyses and low-resolution electron microscopy have revealed the overall architecture and some critical features of Env. But higher resolution imaging of the overall protein structure has been elusive because of its complex, delicate structure. Three new papers use stabilized forms of Env to gain a clearer picture of the intact trimer. An NCI research team led by Dr. Sriram Subramaniam used cryo-electron microscopy to examine the Env structure. The study appeared on October 23, 2013, in &quot;Nature Structural and Molecular Biology&quot;.

===Animal model===

The typical animal model for vaccine research is the monkey, often the macaque. Monkeys can be infected with SIV or the chimeric SHIV for research purposes. However, the well-proven route of trying to induce neutralizing antibodies by vaccination has stalled because of the great difficulty in stimulating antibodies that neutralise heterologous primary HIV isolates. Some vaccines based on the virus envelope have protected chimpanzees or macaques from homologous virus challenge, but in clinical trials, humans who were immunised with similar constructs became infected after later exposure to HIV-1.

There are some differences between SIV and HIV that may introduce challenges in the use of an animal model. The animal model can be extremely useful but at times controversial.

There is a new animal model strongly resembling that of HIV in humans. Generalized immune activation as a direct result of activated CD4+ T cell killing - performed in mice allows new ways of testing HIV behaviour.

NIAID-funded SIV research has shown that challenging monkeys with a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based SIV vaccine results in containment of virus. Typically, virus replication and dissemination occurs within days after infection, whereas vaccine-induced T cell activation and recruitment to sites of viral replication take weeks. Researchers hypothesized that vaccines designed to maintain activated effector memory T cells might impair viral replication at its earliest stage.

Specific vaccines may also need specialized animal models. For example, vaccines designed to produce VRC01-type antibodies require human-like VH alleles to be present. For organisms like mice, the human allele must be inserted into their genome to produce a useful mimic. Murines are also experimental animals in AIDS and also murine AIDS and human AIDS are similar. Immunological analysis and genetic studies reveal resistant gene(s) in the H-2 complex of mice, an indication that genetic differences in mice could modify features of HIV disease. The defective murine leukemia virus is the major etiologic agent of MAIDS, which seems to be able to induce disease in the absence of virus replication. Target cell proliferation and oligoclonal expansion are induced by the virus, which suggests repressed immunity seen in mice thus referred to as paraneoplastic syndrome. This is further supported by the good response(s) of MAIDS mice to antineoplastic agents. This animal model is useful in demonstrating the emergence of novel hypotheses about AIDS, including the roles of defective HIV and HIV replication in the progression of the disease, and also the importance of identifying the HIV targeted cells &quot;in vivo.&quot;

==Clinical trials==

Several vaccine candidates are in varying phases of clinical trials.

===Phase I===
Most initial approaches have focused on the HIV envelope protein. At least thirteen different gp120 and gp160 envelope candidates have been evaluated, in the US predominantly through the AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group. Most research focused on gp120 rather than gp41/gp160, as the latter is generally more difficult to produce and did not initially offer any clear advantage over gp120 forms. Overall, they have been safe and immunogenic in diverse populations, have induced neutralizing antibody in nearly 100% recipients, but rarely induced CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Mammalian derived envelope preparations have been better inducers of neutralizing antibody than candidates produced in yeast and bacteria. Although the vaccination process involved many repeated &quot;booster&quot; injections, it was challenging to induce and maintain the high anti-gp120 antibody titers necessary to have any hope of neutralizing an HIV exposure.

The availability of several recombinant canarypox vectors has provided interesting results that may prove to be generalizable to other viral vectors. Increasing the complexity of the canarypox vectors by including more genes/epitopes has increased the percent of volunteers that have detectable CTL to a greater extent than did increase the dose of the viral vector. CTLs from volunteers were able to kill peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with primary isolates of HIV, suggesting that induced CTLs could have biological significance. Besides, cells from at least some volunteers were able to kill cells infected with HIV from other clades, though the pattern of recognition was not uniform among volunteers. The canarypox vector is the first candidate HIV vaccine that has induced cross-clade functional CTL responses. The first phase I trial of the candidate vaccine in Africa was launched early in 1999 with Ugandan volunteers. The study determined the extent to which Ugandan volunteers have CTL that are active against the subtypes of HIV prevalent in Uganda, A and D. In 2015, a Phase I trial called HVTN 100 in South Africa tested the combination of a canarypox vector ALVAC and a gp120 protein adapted for the subtype C HIV common in sub-Saharan Africa, with the MF59 adjuvant. Those who received the vaccine regimen produced strong immune responses early on and the regimen was safe.

Other strategies that have progressed to phase I trials in uninfected persons include peptides, lipopeptides, DNA, an attenuated &quot;Salmonella&quot; vector, p24, etc. Specifically, candidate vaccines that induce one or more of the following are being sought:
* neutralizing antibodies active against a broad range of HIV primary isolates;
* cytotoxic T cell responses in a vast majority of recipients;
* strong mucosal immune responses.

In 2011, researchers in National Biotech Centre in Madrid unveiled data from the Phase I clinical trial of their new vaccine, MVA-B. The vaccine induced an immunological response in 92% of the healthy subjects.

In 2016, results were published of the first Phase I human clinical trial of a killed whole-HIV-1 vaccine, SAV001. HIV used in the vaccine was chemically and physically deadened through radiation. The trial, conducted in Canada in 2012, demonstrated a good safety profile and elicited antibodies to HIV-1. According to Dr. Chil-Yong Kang of Western University&#x27;s Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry in Canada, the developer of this vaccine, antibodies against gp120 and p24 increased to 8-fold and 64-fold, respectively after vaccination.

The VRC01 line of research produced an &quot;eOD-GT8&quot; antigen which specifically exposes the CD4 binding site for immunization, refined over time to expose less of the other sites. As it turns out that most (but not all) humans do have the required alleles, the problem shifted to the method of delivery. In 2021, after promising results in tests with mice and primates, scientists announced that they plan to conduct a Phase 1 trial of an mRNA vaccine against HIV if a further developed (via their &#x27;env–gag VLP mRNA platform&#x27; which contains eOD-GT8) vaccine is confirmed safe and effective. On January 17, 2022 IAVI and Moderna launched a phase I trial of a HIV vaccine with mRNA technology. On March 14, 2022 the National Institutes of Health reported that it had launched a &quot;clinical trial of three mRNA HIV vaccines&quot;. The phase one trial is expected to conclude July 2023.

===Phase II===

&quot;Preventive HIV vaccines&quot;
* A recombinant Adenovirus-5 HIV vaccine (called V520) was tested in two Phase 2b studies, Phambili and STEP. On December 13, 2004, recruitment began for the STEP study, a 3,000-participant phase II clinical trial of a novel HIV vaccine, at sites in North America, South America, the Caribbean and Australia. The trial was co-funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co. Merck developed V520 to stimulate HIV-specific cellular immunity, which prompts the body to produce T cells that kill HIV-infected cells. In previous smaller trials, this vaccine was found to be safe, because of the lack of adverse effects on the participants. The vaccine showed induced cellular immune responses against HIV in more than half of volunteers. V520 contains a weakened adenovirus that serves as a carrier for three subtype B HIV genes (&quot;gag,&quot; &quot;pol&quot; and &quot;nef&quot;). Subtype B is the most prevalent HIV subtype in the regions of the study sites. Adenoviruses are among the main causes of upper respiratory tract ailments such as the common cold. Because the vaccine contains only three HIV genes housed in a weakened adenovirus, study participants cannot become infected with HIV or get a respiratory infection from the vaccine. It was announced in September 2007 that the trial for V520 would be stopped after it determined that vaccination with V520 appeared associated with an increased risk of HIV infection in some recipients. The foremost issue facing the recombinant adenovirus that was used is the high prevalence of the adenovirus-specific antibodies as a result of prior exposure to adenovirus. Adenovirus vectors and many other viral vectors currently used in HIV vaccines will induce a rapid memory immune response against the vector. This results in an impediment to the development of a T cell response against the inserted antigen (HIV antigens) The results of the trial prompted the reexamination of vaccine development strategies.
* HVTN 505, a Phase IIb study, was launched in 2009 but halted in 2013 due to meeting requirements of futility.
* Potential broadly neutralizing antibodies have been cloned in the laboratory (monoclonal antibodies) and are being tested in passive vaccination clinical trials. In May 2016, there was the launch of the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials (HVTN 703 and HVTN 704), the first phase IIb trials of a monoclonal antibody for HIV prevention. HVTN 703 and HVTN 704 found that the VRC01 monoclonal antibody, which targets the CD4 binding site, was not able to prevent HIV acquisition.
* In 2017, Janssen and the HVTN launched the phase IIb trial called HVTN 705/Imbokodo, testing the mosaic vector vaccine Ad26.Mos4.HIV and the aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted Clade C gp140 vaccines which are designed to prevent infection of all HIV subtypes around the world. In 2021 the NIH announced that the Imbokodo Phase 2b study did not provide statistically significant reduction in HIV infection.
* In 2019, Terevac-VIH, a vaccine from Cuba, was determined to have passed the first stage of clinical trials after two years and move to the second stage of development.

&quot;Therapeutic HIV vaccines&quot;

Biosantech developed a therapeutic vaccine called Tat Oyi, which targets the tat protein of HIV. It was tested in France in a double-blind Phase I/II trial with 48 HIV-positive patients who had reached viral suppression on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and then stopped antiretrovirals after getting the intradermal Tat Oyi vaccine.

===Phase III===
&quot;Preventive HIV vaccines&quot;

There have been no passive preventive HIV vaccines to reach Phase III yet, but some active preventive HIV vaccine candidates have entered Phase III.
* In February 2003, VaxGen announced that their AIDSVAX B/E vaccine was a failure in North America as there was not a statistically significant reduction of HIV infection within the study population.
* AIDSVAX B/E was a component, along with ALVAC, of the RV 144 vaccine trial in Thailand that showed partial efficacy in preventing HIV. The AIDSVAX B/E and ALVAC vaccines targeted the gp120 part of the HIV envelope. The study involved 16,395 participants who did not have HIV infection, 8197 of whom were given treatment consisting of two experimental vaccines targeting HIV types B and E that are prevalent in Thailand, while 8198 were given a placebo. The participants were tested for HIV every six months for three years. After three years, the vaccine group had HIV infection rates reduced by about 30% compared with those in the placebo group. However, after taking into account the seven people who already had HIV before getting vaccinated (two in the placebo group, five in the vaccine group) the difference was 26%. It was discovered that participants receiving vaccines in the RV 144 trial who produced IgG antibodies against the V2 loop of the HIV outer envelope were 43% less likely to become infected than those who did not, while IgA production was associated with a 54% greater risk of infection than those who did not produce the antibodies (but not worse than placebo). Viruses collected from vaccinated participants had mutations in the V2 region. Tests of a vaccine for SIV in monkeys found greater resistance to SIV in animals producing antibodies against this region. Therefore, further research is expected to focus on creating vaccines designed to provoke an IgG reaction against the V2 loop.
* In 2020, the phase IIb-III trial /&quot;Uhambo&quot; found that ALVAC/gp120/MF59 vaccinations were safe, and caused no harm, but had no efficacy in HIV prevention in South Africa. Vaccinations with the Uhambo vaccine regimen began late 2016 and stopped early 2020.
* In 2020, the Ad26.Mos4.HIV plus adjuvanted clade C gp140 vaccine regimen entered a phase III trial called HVTN 706/&quot;Mosaico&quot;. The regimen is a combination of an adenovirus vector vaccine engineered against multiple global strains of HIV, and a protein vaccine. The trial was ended in January 2023 due to ineffectiveness.
&quot;Therapeutic HIV vaccines&quot;

No therapeutic HIV vaccine candidates have reached phase 3 testing yet.

==Economics==
A July 2012 report of the HIV Vaccines &amp; Microbicides Resource Tracking Working Group estimates that $845 million was invested in HIV vaccine research in 2011.

Economic issues with developing an HIV vaccine include the need for advance purchase commitment (or advance market commitments) because after an AIDS vaccine has been developed, governments and NGOs may be able to bid the price down to marginal cost.

==Classification of possible vaccines==
Theoretically, any possible HIV vaccine must inhibit or stop the HIV virion replication cycle. The targets of a vaccine could be the following stages of the HIV virion cycle:
* Stage I. Free state
* Stage II. Attachment
* Stage III. Penetration
* Stage IV. Uncoating
* Stage V. Replication
* Stage VI. Assembling
* Stage VII. Releasing

Therefore, the following list comprises the current possible approaches for an HIV vaccine:

===Filtering virions from blood (Stage I)===
* Biological, chemical and/or physical approaches for removing the HIV virions from the blood.

===Approaches to catching the virion (Stage I-III, VI, VII)===
* Phagocytosis of the HIV virions.
* Chemical or organically based capture (creation of any skin or additional membrane around the virion) of HIV virions
* Chemical or organic attachments to the virion

===Approaches to destroying or damaging the virion or its parts (Stage I-VII)===
Here, &quot;damage&quot; means inhibiting or stopping the ability of virion to process any of the &quot;Phase II-VII&quot;. Here are the different classification of methods:
* By nature of method:
** Physical methods (&quot;Stage I-VII&quot;)
** Chemical and biological methods (&quot;Stage I-VII&quot;)
* By damaging target of the HIV virion structure:
** Damaging the Docking Glycoprotein gp120 (&quot;Stage I-III, VI, VII&quot;)
** Damaging the Transmembrane Glycoprotein gp41 (&quot;Stage I-III, VI, VII&quot;)
** Damaging the virion matrix (&quot;Stage I-III, VI, VII&quot;)
** Damaging the virion Capsid (&quot;Stage I-III, VI, VII&quot;)
** Damaging the Reverse Transcriptase (&quot;Stage I-VII&quot;)
** Damaging the RNA (&quot;Stage I-VII&quot;)

===Blocking replication (Stage V)===
* Insertion into blood chemical or organic compounds which binds to the gp120. Hypothetically, it can be pieces of the CD4 cell membranes with receptors. Any chemical and organic alternative (with the ability to bind the gp120) of these receptors also can be used.
* Insertion into blood chemical or organic compounds which binds to the receptors of the CD4 cells.

===Biological, chemical or physical approaches to inhibit the process of phases===
* Biological, chemical or physical approach to inhibit the &quot;Attachment, Penetration, Uncoating, Integration, Replication, Assembling and/or Releasing.&quot;

===Inhibiting the functionality of infected cells (Stage VI-VII)===
Inhibiting the life functions of infected cells:
* Inhibiting the metabolism of infected cells
* Inhibiting the energy exchange of infected cells

==Future work==

There have been reports that HIV patients coinfected with &quot;GB virus C&quot; (GBV-C), also called hepatitis G virus, can survive longer than those without GBV-C, but the patients may be different in other ways. GBV-C is potentially useful in the future development of an HIV vaccine.

Live attenuated vaccines are highly successful against polio, rotavirus and measles, but have not been tested against HIV in humans. Reversion to live virus has been a theoretical safety concern that has to date prevented clinical development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. Scientists are researching novel strategies to develop a non-virulent live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine. For example, a genetically modified form of HIV has been created in which the virus&#x27;s codons (a sequence of three nucleotides that form genetic code) are manipulated to rely on an unnatural amino acid for proper protein translation, which allows it to replicate. Because this amino acid is foreign to the human body, the virus cannot reproduce. Recent evidence suggests using universal CAR NK cells against HIV

<text>The Maya calendar is a system of calendars used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in many modern communities in the Guatemalan highlands, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico.

The essentials of the Maya calendar are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 5th century BC. It shares many aspects with calendars employed by other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Zapotec and Olmec and contemporary or later ones such as the Mixtec and Aztec calendars.

By the Maya mythological tradition, as documented in Colonial Yucatec accounts and reconstructed from Late Classic and Postclassic inscriptions, the deity Itzamna is frequently credited with bringing the knowledge of the calendrical system to the ancestral Maya, along with writing in general and other foundational aspects of Mayan culture.

==Overview==

The Maya calendar consists of several cycles or &quot;counts&quot; of different lengths. The 260-day count is known to scholars as the &quot;Tzolkin&quot;, or &quot;Tzolkʼin&quot;. The Tzolkin was combined with a 365-day vague solar year known as the Haabʼ to form a synchronized cycle lasting for 52 Haabʼ called the Calendar Round. The Calendar Round is still in use by many groups in the Guatemalan highlands.

A different calendar was used to track longer periods of time and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This is the Long Count. It is a count of days since a mythological starting-point. According to the correlation between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6, in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical). The GMT correlation was chosen by John Eric Sydney Thompson in 1935 on the basis of earlier correlations by Joseph Goodman in 1905 (August 11), Juan Martínez Hernández in 1926 (August 12) and Thompson himself in 1927 (August 13). By its linear nature, the Long Count was capable of being extended to refer to any date far into the past or future. This calendar involved the use of a positional notation system, in which each position signified an increasing multiple of the number of days. The Maya numeral system was essentially vigesimal (i.e., base-20) and each unit of a given position represented 20 times the unit of the position which preceded it. An important exception was made for the second-order place value, which instead represented 18 × 20, or 360 days, more closely approximating the solar year than would 20 × 20 = 400 days. The cycles of the Long Count are independent of the solar year.

Many Maya Long Count inscriptions contain a supplementary series, which provides information on the lunar phase, number of the current lunation in a series of six and which of the nine Lords of the Night rules.

Less-prevalent or poorly understood cycles, combinations and calendar progressions were also tracked. An &quot;819-day Count&quot; is attested in a few inscriptions. Repeating sets of 9 days (see below &quot;Nine lords of the night&quot;) associated with different groups of deities, animals and other significant concepts are also known. 

==Tzolkʼin==
The &quot;tzolkʼin&quot; (in modern Maya orthography; also commonly written &quot;tzolkin&quot;) is the name commonly employed by Mayanist researchers for the Maya Sacred Round or 260-day calendar. The word &quot;tzolkʼin&quot; is a neologism coined in Yucatec Maya, to mean &quot;count of days&quot; (Coe 1992). The various names of this calendar as used by precolumbian Maya people are still debated by scholars. The Aztec calendar equivalent was called &quot;Tōnalpōhualli&quot;, in the Nahuatl language.

The tzolkʼin calendar combines twenty day names with the thirteen day numbers to produce 260 unique days. It is used to determine the time of religious and ceremonial events and for divination. Each successive day is numbered from 1 up to 13 and then starting again at 1. Separately from this, every day is given a name in sequence from a list of 20 day names:

Some systems started the count with 1 Imix, followed by 2 Ikʼ, 3 Akʼbʼal, etc. up to 13 Bʼen. The day numbers then start again at 1 while the named-day sequence continues onwards, so the next days in the sequence are 1 Ix, 2 Men, 3 Kʼibʼ, 4 Kabʼan, 5 Etzʼnabʼ, 6 Kawak and 7 Ajaw. With all twenty named days used, these now began to repeat the cycle while the number sequence continues, so the next day after 7 Ajaw is 8 Imix. The repetition of these interlocking 13- and 20-day cycles therefore takes 260 days to complete (that is, for every possible combination of number/named day to occur once).

The earliest known inscription with a Tzolkʼin is an Olmec earspool with 2 Ahau 3 Ceh - 6.3.10.9.0, September 2, -678 (Julian astronomical).

==Haabʼ==


The Haabʼ was made up of eighteen months of twenty days each plus a period of five days (&quot;nameless days&quot;) at the end of the year known as &quot;Wayeb&quot;&#x27; (or &quot;Uayeb&quot; in 16th-century orthography). The five days of Wayebʼ were thought to be a dangerous time. Foster (2002) writes, &quot;During Wayeb, portals between the mortal realm and the Underworld dissolved. No boundaries prevented the ill-intending deities from causing disasters.&quot; To ward off these evil spirits, the Maya had customs and rituals they practiced during Wayebʼ. For example, people avoided leaving their houses and washing or combing their hair. Bricker (1982) estimates that the Haabʼ was first used around 550 BC with a starting point of the winter solstice.

The Haabʼ month names are known today by their corresponding names in colonial-era Yukatek Maya, as transcribed by 16th-century sources (in particular, Diego de Landa and books such as the &quot;Chilam Balam&quot; of Chumayel). Phonemic analyses of Haabʼ glyph names in pre-Columbian Maya inscriptions have demonstrated that the names for these twenty-day periods varied considerably from region to region and from period to period, reflecting differences in the base language(s) and usage in the Classic and Postclassic eras predating their recording by Spanish sources.

Each day in the Haabʼ calendar was identified by a day number in the month followed by the name of the month. Day numbers began with a glyph translated as the &quot;seating of&quot; a named month, which is usually regarded as day 0 of that month, although a minority treat it as day 20 of the month preceding the named month. In the latter case, the seating of Pop is day 5 of Wayebʼ. For the majority, the first day of the year was 0 Pop (the seating of Pop). This was followed by 1 Pop, 2 Pop as far as 19 Pop then 0 Wo, 1 Wo and so on.

Because the Haabʼ had 365 days and the tropical year is 365.2422 days, the days of the Haabʼ did not coincide with the tropical year.

==Calendar Round==
A Calendar Round date is a date that gives both the Tzolkʼin and Haabʼ. This date will repeat after 52 Haabʼ years or 18,980 days, a Calendar Round. For example, the current creation started on 4 Ahau 8 Kumkʼu. When this date recurs it is known as a Calendar Round completion.

Arithmetically, the duration of the Calendar Round is the least common multiple of 260 and 365; 18,980 is 73 × 260 Tzolkʼin days and 52 × 365 Haabʼ days.

Not every possible combination of Tzolkʼin and Haabʼ can occur. For Tzolkʼin days Imix, Kimi, Chuwen and Kibʼ, the Haabʼ day can only be 4, 9, 14 or 19; for Ikʼ, Manikʼ, Ebʼ and Kabʼan, the Haabʼ day can only be 0, 5, 10 or 15; for Akbʼalʼ, Lamat, Bʼen and Etzʼnabʼ, the Haabʼ day can only be 1, 6, 11 or 16; for Kʼan, Muluk, Ix and Kawak, the Haabʼ day can only be 2, 7, 12 or 17; and for Chikchan, Ok, Men and Ajaw, the Haabʼ day can only be 3, 8, 13 or 18.

===Year Bearer===
A &quot;Year Bearer&quot; is a Tzolkʼin day name that occurs on 0Pop, the first day of the Haabʼ. Since there are 20 Tzolkʼin day names, 365 days in the Haabʼ, and the remainder of 365 divided by 20 is 5 (), the Tzolkʼin day name for each successive 0Pop will be 5 later in the cycle of Tzolk&#x27;in day names. Similarly, since there are 13 Tzolk&#x27;in day numbers, and the remainder of 365 divided by 13 is 1 (), the Tzolk&#x27;in day number for each successive 0Pop will be 1 greater than before. As such, the sequence of Tzolk&#x27;in dates corresponding to the Haab&#x27; date 0Pop are as follows:

Thus, the Year Bearers are the four Tzolkʼin day names that appear in this sequence: Ik&#x27;, Manik&#x27;, Eb&#x27;, and Kab&#x27;an.

&quot;Year Bearer&quot; literally translates a Mayan concept. Its importance resides in two facts. For one, the four years headed by the Year Bearers are named after them and share their characteristics; therefore, they also have their own prognostications and patron deities. Moreover, since the Year Bearers are geographically identified with boundary markers or mountains, they help define the local community.

The classic system of Year Bearers described above is found at Tikal and in the Dresden Codex. During the Late Classic period a different set of Year Bearers was in use in Campeche. In this system, the Year Bearers were the Tzolkʼin that coincided with 1 Pop. These were Akʼbʼal, Lamat, Bʼen and Edznab. During the Post-Classic period in Yucatán a third system was in use. In this system the Year Bearers were the days that coincided with 2 Pop: Kʼan, Muluc, Ix and Kawak. This system is found in the Chronicle of Oxkutzcab. In addition, just before the Spanish conquest in Mayapan the Maya began to number the days of the Haabʼ from 1 to 20. In this system the Year Bearers are the same as in the 1 Pop – Campeche system. The Classic Year Bearer system is still in use in the Guatemalan highlands and in Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico.

==Long Count==

Since Calendar Round dates repeat every 18,980 days, approximately 52 solar years, the cycle repeats roughly once each lifetime, so a more refined method of dating was needed if history was to be recorded accurately. To specify dates over periods longer than 52 years, Mesoamericans used the Long Count calendar.

The Maya name for a day was &quot;kʼin&quot;. Twenty of these kʼins are known as a &quot;winal&quot; or &quot;uinal&quot;. Eighteen winals make one &quot;tun&quot;. Twenty tuns are known as a &quot;kʼatun&quot;. Twenty kʼatuns make a &quot;bʼakʼtun&quot;.

The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from the Mayan creation date 4 Ahaw, 8 Kumkʼu (August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar -3113 astronomical dating). But instead of using a base-10 (decimal) scheme, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. As the winal unit resets after only counting to 18, the Long Count consistently uses base-20 only if the tun is considered the primary unit of measurement, not the kʼin; with the kʼin and winal units being the number of days in the tun. The Long Count 0.0.1.0.0 represents 360 days, rather than the 400 in a purely base-20 (vigesimal) count.

There are also four rarely used higher-order cycles: piktun, kalabtun, kʼinchiltun, and alautun.

Since the Long Count dates are unambiguous, the Long Count was particularly well suited to use on monuments. The monumental inscriptions would not only include the 5 digits of the Long Count, but would also include the two tzolkʼin characters followed by the two haabʼ characters.

Misinterpretation of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar was the basis for a popular belief that a cataclysm would take place on December 21, 2012. December 21, 2012 was simply the day that the calendar went to the next bʼakʼtun, at Long Count 13.0.0.0.0. The date of the start of the next b&#x27;ak&#x27;tun (Long Count 14.0.0.0.0) is March 26, 2407. The date of the start of the next piktun (a complete series of 20 bʼakʼtuns), at Long Count 1.0.0.0.0.0, is October 13, 4772.

==Supplementary Series==
Many Classic period inscriptions include a series of glyphs known as the Supplementary Series. The operation of this series was largely worked out by John E. Teeple. The Supplementary Series most commonly consists of the following elements:

===Lords of the Night===

Each night was ruled by one of the nine lords of the underworld. This nine-day cycle was usually written as two glyphs: a glyph that referred to the Nine Lords as a group, followed by a glyph for the lord that would rule the next night.

===Lunar Series===
A lunar series generally is written as five glyphs that provide information about the current lunation, the number of the lunation in a series of six, the current ruling lunar deity and the length of the current lunation.

===Moon age===
The Maya counted the number of days in the current lunation. They used two systems for the zero date of the lunar cycle: either the first night they could see the thin crescent moon or the first morning when they could not see the waning moon. The age of the moon was depicted by a set of glyphs that mayanists coined glyphs D and E:

* A new moon glyph was used for day zero in the lunar cycle.
* D glyphs were used for lunar ages for days 1 through 19, with the number of days that had passed from the new moon.
* For lunar ages 20 to 30, an E glyph was used, with the number of days from 20.

===Count of Lunations===
The Maya counted the lunations. This cycle appears in the lunar series as two glyphs that modern scholars call the &#x27;C&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; glyphs. The C glyph could be prefixed with a number indicating the lunation. No prefixing number meant one, whereas the numbers two through six indicated the other lunations. There was also a part of the C glyph that indicated where this fell in a larger cycle of 18 lunations. Accompanying the C glyph was the &#x27;X&#x27; glyph that showed a similar pattern of 18 lunations.

===Lunation length===
The present era lunar synodic period is about 29.5305877 mean solar days or about 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and 2+7/9 seconds. As a whole number, the number of days per lunation will be either 29 or 30 days, with the 30-day intervals necessarily occurring slightly more frequently than the 29-day intervals. The Maya wrote whether the lunar month was 29 or 30 days as two glyphs: a glyph for lunation length followed by either a glyph made up of a moon glyph over a bundle with a suffix of 9 for a 29-day lunation or a moon glyph with a suffix of 10 for a 30-day lunation. Since the Maya didn&#x27;t use fractions, lunations were approximated by using the formula that there were 149 lunations completed in 4400 days, which yielded a rather short mean month of exactly 4400/149 = 29+79/149 days = 29 days 12 hours 43 minutes and 29+59/149 seconds, or about 29.5302 days.

==819-day count==
Some Mayan monuments include glyphs that record an 819-day count in their Initial Series. These can also be found in the Dresden codex. This is described in Thompson. More examples of this can be found in Kelley. Each group of 819 days was associated with one of four colors and the cardinal direction with which it was associated black corresponded to west, red to east, white to north and yellow to south.

The 819-day count can be described several ways: Most of these are referred to using a &quot;Y&quot; glyph and a number. Many also have a glyph for Kʼawill the god with a smoking mirror in his head. Kʼawill has been suggested as having a link to Jupiter. In the Dresden codex almanac 59 there are Chaacs of the four colors. The accompanying texts begin with a directional glyph and a verb for 819-day-count phrases. Anderson provides a detailed description of the 819-day count.

=== Synodic periods of the classical planets ===

 Moon: 1 x 819 + 8 days = 28 (synodic 29.53 d) &quot;28 months&quot;
 Moon: 4 x 819 + 2 days = 111 (synodic 29.53 d) &quot;111 months&quot;
 Moon: 15 x 819 + 0.3 days = 416 (synodic 29.53 d) &quot;416 months&quot;

 Draconic: 31 x 819 days = 933 (draconic 27.21 d) &quot;nodal months&quot;

 Mercury: 1 x 819 + 8 days = 7 (synodic 115.88 d)
 Mercury: 15 x 819 + 2 days = 106 (synodic 115.88 d)

 Venus: 5 x 819 + 8 days = 7 (synodic 583.9 d)

 Sun: 4 x 819 + 11 days = 9 (synodic 365.24 d) &quot;9 years&quot;
 Sun: 33 x 819 + 1 days = 74 (synodic 365.24 d) &quot;74 years&quot;

 Mars: 20 x 819 + 2 days = 21 (synodic 779.9 d)

 Jupiter: 1 x 819 + 21 days = 2 (synodic 398.88 d)
 Jupiter: 19 x 819 + 5 days = 39 (synodic 398.88 d)

 Saturn: 6 x 819 - 1 days = 13 (synod 378.09 d)

==Short count==
During the late Classic period the Maya began to use an abbreviated short count instead of the Long Count. An example of this can be found on altar 14 at Tikal. In the kingdoms of Postclassic Yucatán, the Short Count was used instead of the Long Count. The cyclical Short Count is a count of 13 kʼatuns (or 260 tuns), in which each kʼatun was named after its concluding day, Ahau (&#x27;Lord&#x27;). 1 Imix was selected as the recurrent &#x27;first day&#x27; of the cycle, corresponding to 1 Cipactli in the Aztec day count. The cycle was counted from katun 11 Ahau to katun 13 Ahau. Since a katun is days long, and the remainder of 7200 divided by 13 is 11 (), the day number of the concluding day of each successive katun is 9 greater than before (wrapping around at 13, since only 13 day numbers are used). That is, starting with the katun that begins with 1Imix, the sequence of concluding day numbers is 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 13, 11, ..., all named Ahau. The concluding day 13 Ahau was followed by the re-entering first day 1 Imix. This is the system as found in the colonial Books of Chilam Balam. In characteristic Mesoamerican fashion, these books project the cycle onto the landscape, with 13 &quot;Ahauob&quot; &#x27;Lordships&#x27; dividing the land of Yucatán into 13 &#x27;kingdoms&#x27;.

<text>Plant pathology or phytopathology is the scientific study of plant diseases caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Plant pathology involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, plant disease epidemiology, plant disease resistance, how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.

== Plant pathogenicity ==

Plant pathogens, organisms that cause infectious plant diseases, include fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms, phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic plants.

In most plant pathosystems, virulence depends on hydrolases and enzymes that degrade the cell wall. The vast majority of these act on pectins (for example, pectinesterase, pectate lyase, and pectinases). For microbes, the cell wall polysaccharides are both a food source and a barrier to be overcome. Many pathogens grow opportunistically when the host breaks down its own cell walls, most often during fruit ripening. Unlike human and animal pathology, plant pathology usually focuses on a single causal organism; however, some plant diseases have been shown to be interactions between multiple pathogens.

To colonize a plant, pathogens have specific pathogenicity factors, of five main types: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, toxins, effector proteins, phytohormones, and exopolysaccharides.

* Cell wall-degrading enzymes: These are used to break down the plant cell wall in order to release the nutrients inside and include esterases, glycosyl hydrolases, lyases and oxidoreductases.
* Toxins: These can be non-host-specific, which damage all plants, or host-specific, which cause damage only on a host plant.
* Effector proteins: These can be secreted by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes into the extracellular environment or directly into the host cell, often via the Type three secretion system. Some effectors are known to suppress host immune processes. This can include reducing or inhibiting the plant&#x27;s internal signaling mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production.
* Phytohormones are chemicals used by plants for signaling; pathogens can produce these to modify plant growth to their own advantage.
* Exopolysaccharides are mostly small chains of sugars that help pathogens to adhere to a plant&#x27;s surface, enabling them to begin the process of infection.

== Physiological plant disorders ==

Some abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as drought, frost, snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient deficiency; deposition of mineral salts such as sodium chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by storms; and wildfires. 

== Epidemiology ==

Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.

A disease triangle describes the basic factors required for plant diseases. These are the host plant, the pathogen, and the environment. Any one of these can be modified to control a disease.

== Disease resistance ==

Plant disease resistance is the ability of a plant to prevent and terminate infections from plant pathogens. Structures that help plants prevent pathogens from entering are the cuticular layer, cell walls, and stomata guard cells. Once pathogens have overcome these barriers, plant receptors initiate signaling pathways to create molecules to compete against the foreign molecules. These pathways are influenced and triggered by genes within the host plant and can manipulated by genetic breeding to create resistant varieties.

== Management == 

===Detection===

Ancient methods of leaf examination and breaking open plant material by hand are now augmented by newer technologies. These include molecular pathology assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RT-PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Although PCR can detect multiple molecular targets in a single solution there are limits. Bertolini et al. 2001, Ito et al. 2002, and Ragozzino et al. 2004 developed PCR methods for multiplexing six or seven plant pathogen molecular products and Persson et al. 2005 for multiplexing four with RT-PCR. More extensive molecular diagnosis requires PCR arrays. The primary detection method used worldwide is enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

=== Biological ===

Crop rotation is a traditional and sometimes effective means of preventing a parasitic population from becoming well-established. For example, protection against infection by &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, which causes gall diseases in many plants, by dipping cuttings in suspensions of &quot;Agrobacterium radiobacter&quot; before inserting them in the ground to take root.

== History ==

Plant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with Theophrastus in the ancient era, but scientific study began in the Early Modern period with the invention of the microscope, and developed in the 19th century.

<text>Qo inhibitors (QoI), or quinone outside inhibitors, are a group of fungicides used in agriculture. Some of these fungicides are among the most popular in the world. QoI are chemical compounds which act at the quinol &quot;outer&quot; binding site of the cytochrome &quot;bc&quot;1 complex.

Most QI common names end in -strobin and so are often called strobs. QoI&#x27;s are the resulting fusion of three fungicides families, the well-known family of strobilurins and two new families, represented by fenamidone and famoxadone. Some strobilurins are azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, picoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin.

==Usage==
QoI fungicides are used on a wide range of crops, such as cereals, vines, pome fruits, cucurbits, tomatoes, and potatoes.

For example, they are used as fungicides for cereals, against &quot;Erysiphe graminis&quot; f.sp &quot;tritici&quot; responsible for the powdery mildew in wheat or against &quot;Septoria tritici&quot;, responsible for septoria leaf spot in wheat.

They are also commonly used for vine culture, against &quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot;, responsible for downy mildew or in oïdium treatment.

==Resistance==
===Main group resistance===
Almost all these fungicides are in the same cross-resistance group (FRAC 11) and must be managed carefully to avoid the appearance of fungicide resistance. All group 11s are cross-resistant with each other. Some fungicide resistance has been observed in many crop pathogens (such as in the case of wheat powdery mildew), Resistance to group 11 is conferred by cytochrome b mutations G143A and F129L, and by other mechanisms.
===Tetrazolinone resistance===
The tetrazolinones consist of only one molecule, metyltetraprole. This constitutes FRAC 11A. 11A is not cross-resistant with 11 resistance conferred by G143A.

<doc id="147487" wikidata="Q486497" url="?curid=147487" title="Strobilurin">
<text>Strobilurins are a group of natural products and their synthetic analogs. A number of strobilurins are used in agriculture as fungicides. They are part of the larger group of QIs (Quinone outside Inhibitors), which act to inhibit the respiratory chain at the level of Complex III.

The first parent natural products, strobilurins A and B, were extracted from the fungus &quot;Strobilurus tenacellus&quot;.
Commercial strobilurin fungicides were developed through optimization of photostability and activity.
Strobilurins represented a major development in fungus-based fungicides. First released in 1996, there are now ten major strobilurin fungicides on the market, which account for 23-25 % of the global fungicide sales.
Examples of commercialized strobilurin derivatives are azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, picoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, oryzastrobin, dimoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin.

Strobilurins are mostly contact fungicides with a long half time as they are absorbed into the cuticle and not transported any further. They have a suppressive effect on other fungi, reducing competition for nutrients; they inhibit electron transfer in mitochondria, disrupting metabolism and preventing growth of the target fungi.

==Natural strobilurins==
===Strobilurin A===
Strobilurin A (also known as mucidin) is produced by &quot;Oudemansiella mucida&quot;, &quot;Strobilurus tenacellus&quot;, &quot;Bolinea lutea&quot;, and others. When first isolated it was incorrectly assigned as the E E E geometric isomer but was later identified by total synthesis as being the E Z E isomer, as shown.
====9-Methoxystrobilurin A====
9-Methoxystrobilurin A is produced by &quot;Favolaschia&quot; spp.
===Strobilurin B===
Strobilurin B is produced by &quot;S. tenacellus&quot;.
===Strobilurin C===
Strobilurin C is produced by &quot;X. longipes&quot; and &quot;X. melanotricha&quot;.
===Strobilurin D and G===
Strobilurin D is produced by &quot;Cyphellopsis anomala&quot;. Its structure was originally incorrectly assigned and is now considered to be identical to that of strobilurin G, produced by &quot;B. lutea&quot;. A related material, hydroxystrobilurin D, with an additional hydroxyl group attached to the methyl of the main chain is produced by &quot;Mycena sanguinolenta&quot;.
===Strobilurin E===
Strobilurin E is produced by &quot;Crepidotus fulvotomentosus&quot; and &quot;Favolaschia&quot; spp.
===Strobilurin F2===
Strobilurin F2 is produced by &quot;B. lutea&quot;.
===Strobilurin H===
Strobilurin H is produced by &quot;B. lutea&quot;. The natural product with a phenolic hydroxy group in place of the aromatic methoxy group of strobilurin H is called strobilurin F1 and is found in &quot;C. anomala&quot; and &quot;Agaricus spp.
===Strobilurin X===
Strobilurin X is produced by &quot;O. mucida&quot;.
===Oudemansins===
The oudemansins are closely related to the strobilurins and are also quinone outside inhibitors.
Oudemansin A with R1 = R2 = H was first described in 1979, after being isolated from mycelial fermentations of the basidiomycete fungus &quot;Oudemansiella mucida&quot;.
Later it was found in cultures of the basidiomycete fungi &quot;Mycena polygramma&quot; and &quot;Xerula melanotricha&quot;. The latter fungus also produces oudemansin B, with R1 = MeO and R2 = Cl. Oudemansin X, with R1 = H and R2 = MeO was isolated from &quot;Oudemansiella radicata&quot;.
==Synthetic strobilurins==
The discovery of the strobilurin class of fungicides led to the development of a group of commercial fungicides used in agriculture. Examples are shown below.

<doc id="147490" wikidata="Q215747" url="?curid=147490" title="Hugo Wolf">
<text>Hugo Philipp Jacob Wolf (; ; 13 March 1860 – 22 February 1903) was an Austrian composer, particularly noted for his art songs, or Lieder. He brought to this form a concentrated expressive intensity which was unique in late Romantic music, somewhat related to that of the Second Viennese School in concision but diverging greatly in technique.

Though he had several bursts of extraordinary productivity, particularly in 1888 and 1889, depression frequently interrupted his creative periods, and his last composition was written in 1898, before he suffered a mental collapse caused by syphilis.

== Life ==
=== Early life (1860–1887) ===
Hugo Wolf was born in Windischgrätz in the Duchy of Styria (now Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia), then a part of the Austrian Empire. Herbert von Karajan was related to him on his maternal side. He spent most of his life in Vienna, becoming a representative of a &quot;New German&quot; trend in Lieder, a trend which followed from the expressive, chromatic and dramatic musical innovations of Richard Wagner.

A child prodigy, Wolf was taught piano and violin by his father beginning at the age of four, and once in primary school studied piano and music theory with Sebastian Weixler. Subjects other than music failed to hold his interest; he was dismissed from the first secondary school he attended as being &quot;wholly inadequate&quot;, left another over his difficulties in the compulsory Latin studies, and after a falling-out with a professor who commented on his &quot;damned music&quot;, quit the last. From there, he went to the Vienna Conservatory, much to the disappointment of his father, who had hoped his son would not try to make his living from music. Once again, however, he was dismissed after two years for &quot;breach of discipline&quot;, although the oft-rebellious Wolf would claim he quit in frustration over the school&#x27;s conservatism.

After eight months with his family, he returned to Vienna to teach music. Though his fiery temperament was not ideally suited to teaching, Wolf&#x27;s musical gifts, as well as his personal charm, earned him attention and patronage. Support of benefactors allowed him to make a living as a composer, and a daughter of one of his greatest benefactors inspired him to write to Vally (&quot;Valentine&quot;) Franck, his first love, with whom he was involved for three years. During their relationship, hints of his mature style would become evident in his Lieder. Wolf was prone to depression and wide mood swings, which would affect him all through his life. When Franck left him just before his 21st birthday, he was despondent. He returned home, although his family relationships were also strained; his father was still convinced his son was a ne&#x27;er-do-well. His brief and undistinguished tenure as second Kapellmeister at Salzburg only reinforced this opinion: Wolf had neither the temperament, the conducting technique nor the affinity for the decidedly non-Wagnerian repertoire to be successful, and within a year had again returned to Vienna to teach in much the same circumstances as before.

Wagner&#x27;s death in February 1883 was another deeply moving event in the life of the young composer. The song &quot;Zur Ruh, zur Ruh&quot; was composed shortly afterward and is considered to be the best of his early works; it is speculated that it was intended as an elegy for Wagner. Wolf often despaired of his own future in the ensuing years, in a world from which his idol had departed, leaving tremendous footsteps to follow and no guidance on how to do so. This left him often extremely temperamental, alienating friends and patrons, although his charm helped him retain them more than his actions merited. His songs had meanwhile caught the attention of Franz Liszt, whom he respected greatly, and who like Wolf&#x27;s previous mentors advised him to pursue larger forms; advice he this time followed with the symphonic tone poem &quot;Penthesilea&quot;. His activities as a critic began to pick up. He was merciless in his criticism of the inferior works he saw taking over the musical atmosphere of the time; those of Anton Rubinstein he considered particularly odious. But he was as fervent in his support of Liszt, Schubert and Chopin, whose genius he recognized. Known as &quot;Wild Wolf&quot; for the intensity and expressive strength of his convictions, his vitriol made him some enemies. He composed little during this time, and what he did write he couldn&#x27;t get performed; the Rosé Quartet (led by Vienna Philharmonic concertmaster Arnold Rosé) would not even look at his D minor Quartet after it was picked apart in a column, and the premiere of &quot;Penthesilea&quot; was met by the Vienna Philharmonic, when they tried it out under their celebrated conservative conductor Hans Richter, with nothing but derision for &#x27;the man who had dared to criticize &quot;Meister Brahms&quot;&#x27;, as Richter himself caustically put it.

He abandoned his activities as a critic in 1887 and began composing once more; perhaps not unexpectedly, the first songs he wrote after his compositional hiatus (to poems by Goethe, Joseph von Eichendorff and Joseph Viktor von Scheffel) emphasized themes of strength and resolution under adversity. Shortly thereafter, he completed the terse, witty one-movement &quot;Italian Serenade&quot; for string quartet which is regarded as one of the finest examples of his mature instrumental compositional style. Only a week later his father died, leaving him devastated, and he did not compose for the remainder of the year.

=== Maturity (1888–1896) ===
1888 and 1889 proved to be amazingly productive years for Wolf, and a turning point in his career. After the publication of a dozen of his songs late the preceding year, Wolf once again desired to return to composing; he travelled to the vacation home of the Werners, family friends whom Wolf had known since childhood, in Perchtoldsdorf (a short train ride from Vienna), to escape and compose in solitude. Here he composed the &quot;Mörike-Lieder&quot; at a frenzied pace. A short break, and a change of house, this time to the vacation home of more longtime friends, the Ecksteins, and the &quot;Eichendorff-Lieder&quot; followed, then the 51 &quot;Goethe-Lieder&quot;, spilling into 1889. After a summer holiday, the &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot; was begun in October 1889; though Spanish-flavoured compositions were in fashion in the day, Wolf sought out poems that had been neglected by other composers.

Wolf himself saw the merit of these compositions immediately, raving to friends that they were the best things he had yet composed (it was with the aid and urging of several of the more influential of them that the works were initially published). It was now that the world outside Vienna would recognize Wolf as well. Tenor Ferdinand Jäger, whom Wolf had heard in &quot;Parsifal&quot; during his brief summer break from composing, was present at one of the first concerts of the Mörike works and quickly became a champion of his music, performing a recital of only Wolf and Beethoven in December 1888. His works were praised in reviews, including one in the &quot;Münchener Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, a widely read German newspaper. (The recognition was not always positive; Brahms&#x27;s adherents, still smarting from Wolf&#x27;s merciless reviews, returned the favor—when they would have anything to do with him at all. Brahms&#x27;s biographer Max Kalbeck ridiculed Wolf for his immature writing and odd tonalities; another composer refused to share a program with him, while Amalie Materna, a Wagnerian singer, had to cancel her Wolf recital when allegedly faced with the threat of being on the critics&#x27; blacklist if she went on.)

Only a few more settings, completing the first half of the &quot;Italienisches Liederbuch&quot;, were composed in 1891 before Wolf&#x27;s mental and physical health once again took a downturn at the end of the year; exhaustion from his prolific past few years combined with the effects of syphilis and his depressive temperament caused him to stop composing for the next several years. Continuing concerts of his works in Austria and Germany spread his growing fame; even Brahms and the critics who had previously reviled Wolf gave favorable reviews. However, Wolf was consumed with depression, which stopped him from writing—which only left him more depressed. He completed orchestrations of previous works, but new compositions were not forthcoming, and certainly not the opera which he was now fixated on composing, still convinced that success in the larger forms was the mark of compositional greatness.

Wolf had scornfully rejected the libretto to &quot;Der Corregidor&quot; when it was first presented to him in 1890, but his determination to compose an opera blinded him to its faults upon second glance. Based on &quot;The Three-Cornered Hat&quot;, by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón, the darkly humorous story about an adulterous love triangle is one that Wolf could identify with: he had been in love with Melanie Köchert, married to his friend Heinrich Köchert, for several years. (It is speculated that their romance began in earnest in 1884, when Wolf accompanied the Köcherts on holiday; though Heinrich discovered the affair in 1893 he remained Wolf&#x27;s patron and Melanie&#x27;s husband.) The opera was completed in nine months and was initially met with success, but Wolf&#x27;s musical setting could not compensate for the weakness of the text, and it was doomed to failure; it has not yet been successfully revived.

A renewal of creative activity resulted in Wolf&#x27;s completion of the &quot;Italienisches Liederbuch&quot; with two dozen songs written in March and April 1896, the composition of three &quot;Michelangelo Lieder&quot; in March, 1897 (a group of six had been projected) and preliminary work during that year on an opera, &quot;Manuel Venegas&quot;.

=== Final years (1897–1903) ===

Wolf&#x27;s last concert appearance, which included his early champion Jäger, was in February 1897. Shortly thereafter Wolf slipped into syphilitic insanity, with only occasional spells of wellbeing. He left sixty pages of an unfinished opera, &quot;Manuel Venegas&quot;, in 1897, in a desperate attempt to finish before he lost his mind completely; after mid-1899 he could make no music at all and once even tried to drown himself, after which he was placed in a Vienna asylum at his own insistence. Melanie visited him faithfully during his decline until his death on 22 February 1903, and Melanie died by suicide in 1906.

Wolf is buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, along with many other notable composers.

==Music==
Wolf&#x27;s greatest musical influence was Richard Wagner, who, in an encounter after Wolf first came to the Vienna Conservatory, encouraged the young composer to persist in composing and to attempt larger-scale works, cementing Wolf&#x27;s desire to emulate his musical idol. His antipathy to Johannes Brahms was fueled equally by his devotion to Wagner&#x27;s musical radicalism and his loathing of Brahms&#x27; musical &quot;conservatism&quot;.

He is best known by his lieder, his temperament and inclination leading him to more intimate, subjective and terse musical utterances. Although he initially believed that mastering the larger forms was the hallmark of a great composer (a belief his early mentors reinforced), the smaller scale of the art song proved to provide an ideal creative outlet for his musical expression and came to be regarded as the genre best suited to his peculiar genius. Wolf&#x27;s lieder are noted for compressing expansive musical ideas and depth of feeling, fed by his skill at finding the just right musical setting for the poetry that inspired him. Though Wolf himself was obsessed with the idea that to compose only short forms was to be second-rate, his organization of lyrics of particular poets (Goethe; Mörike; Eichendorff; Heyse and Geibel in the Spanish and Italian Songbooks) into semicyclical anthologies, finding connections between texts not explicitly intended by the poets he set and his conceptions of individual songs as dramatic works in miniature, mark him as a talented dramatist despite having written only one not particularly successful opera, &quot;Der Corregidor&quot;.

Early in his career Wolf modelled his lieder after those of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, particularly in the period around his relationship with Vally Franck; in fact, they were good enough imitations to pass off as the real thing, which he once attempted, though his cover was blown too soon. It is speculated that his choice of lieder texts in the earlier years, largely dealing with sin and anguish, were partly influenced by his contracting syphilis. His love for Vally, not fully requited, inspired highly chromatic and philosophical lieder that could be regarded as successors to Wagner&#x27;s Wesendonck Lieder cycle. Others were as distant from those in mood as possible; lighthearted and humorous. The rarely heard symphonic poem &quot;Penthesilea&quot;, based on the tragedy by Heinrich von Kleist, is tempestuous and highly colored as well. Although Wolf admired Liszt, who had encouraged him to complete the work, he felt Liszt&#x27;s own music too dry and academic and strove for color and passion.

The year 1888 marked a turning point in his style as well as his career, with the Mörike, Eichendorff and Goethe sets drawing him away from Schubert&#x27;s simpler, more diatonic lyricism and into &quot;Wölferl&#x27;s own howl&quot;. Mörike in particular drew out and complemented Wolf&#x27;s musical gifts, the variety of subjects suiting Wolf&#x27;s tailoring of music to text, his dark sense of humor matching Wolf&#x27;s own, his insight and imagery demanding a wider variety of compositional techniques and command of text painting to portray. In his later works he relied less on the text to give him his musical framework and more on his pure musical ideas themselves; the later Spanish and Italian songs reflect this move toward &quot;absolute music&quot;.

Wolf wrote hundreds of lieder, three operas, incidental music, choral music, as well as some rarely heard orchestral, chamber and piano music. His most famous instrumental piece is the &quot;Italian Serenade&quot; (1887), originally for string quartet and later transcribed for orchestra, which marked the beginning of his mature style.

Wolf was famous for his use of tonality to reinforce meaning. Concentrating on two tonal areas to musically depict ambiguity and conflict in the text became a hallmark of his style, resolving only when appropriate to the meaning of the song. His chosen texts were often full of anguish and inability to find resolution, and thus so too was the tonality wandering, unable to return to the home key. Use of deceptive cadences, chromaticism, dissonance, and chromatic mediants obscure the harmonic destination for as long as the psychological tension is sustained. His formal structure as well reflected the texts being set, and he wrote almost none of the straightforward strophic songs favoured by his contemporaries, instead building the form around the nature of the work.

==Recording projects==
Individual songs have been included in the recorded repertoire of many singers. Significant early Wolf recording artists included Elisabeth Schumann, Heinrich Rehkemper, Heinrich Schlusnus, Josef von Manowarda, Lotte Lehmann, Karl Erb and others. Early post-War collections were recorded by Suzanne Danco, Anton Dermota and Gérard Souzay (all before 1953), Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (1954), Hans Hotter (1954), Erna Berger (1956), Heinrich Rehfuss (1955) and Elisabeth Schumann (1958), and important individual songs by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, and Elisabeth Höngen. Gerald Moore was a distinguished accompanist in Wolf song recordings. Fischer-Dieskau recorded a large collection of Mörike songs with Moore in March 1959. Some major projects have attempted more comprehensive coverage.

===Hugo Wolf Society edition===
In September 1931 the Hugo Wolf Society was formed under the aegis of the United Kingdom&#x27;s His Master&#x27;s Voice supervised by Walter Legge for the recording of a substantial proportion of the song repertoire. These were to be issued to subscribers in limited editions. The artists participating were restricted to those under contract to this company. Each volume consisted of six His Master&#x27;s Voice red-label discs (unobtainable separately) and retailed new at $15.00 Am. The Wolf Society recordings were re-released in 1981. 
* Volume I, entirely performed by Elena Gerhardt accompanied by Coenraad V. Bos, presented a selection mainly from the Spanish and Italian songbooks and the Mörike songs. For many years this scarce set was regarded as a collector&#x27;s prize, and forms a distinct corpus within her recorded art. Later volumes always included more than one singer. 
* Volume II: 16 of the 51 Goethe songs, all (apart from McCormack&#x27;s &quot;Ganymed&quot;) accompanied by Coenraad V. Bos, but with Friedrich Schorr&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus&quot; with the orchestral accompaniment. 
* Volume III: A selection of 17 items, including three Michelangelo songs, three Mörike songs, four from the &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot; and six from the &quot;Italienisches Liederbuch&quot;. All accompanied by Coenraad V. Bos. 
* Volume IV: 30 items from &quot;Italienisches Liederbuch&quot;. Accompaniments by Coenraad V. Bos, Michael Raucheisen and Hanns Udo Müller. 
* Volume V: A selection of 20 songs (mainly Mörike and &quot;Spanisches Liederbuch&quot;). 
* Volume VI: Settings of Mörike, Robert Reinick, Goethe, Heyse and Geibel, Just and Kerner. 

Artists included Alexander Kipnis (III, IV, V); Herbert Janssen (II, V, VI); Gerhard Hüsch (II, III, IV, V); John McCormack (accompanied by Edwin Schneider) (II); Alexandre Trianti (II, III); Ria Ginster (IV, V); Friedrich Schorr (II); Elisabeth Rethberg (IV, V); Tiana Lemnitz (VI); Helge Roswaenge (VI); Marta Fuchs (VI) and Karl Erb (VI). Each volume was accompanied by a booklet containing a short essay by Ernest Newman (I: &quot;Words and Music in Hugo Wolf&quot;, II: &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Goethe Songs&quot;, III: &quot;A Note of Wolf as Craftsman&quot;, IV: &quot;The Italienisches Liederbuch&quot;) together with German texts, English translations (by Winifred Radford) and notes on each song (by Newman).

===DGG Hugo Wolf Lieder Edition===
A Hugo Wolf Lieder Edition was recorded by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Daniel Barenboim during the 1970s for DGG, each volume containing three records. Volume I (1974): Mörike Lieder (Paris Grand Prix du Disque). Volume II (1976): Lieder on poems by Goethe, Heine and Lenau. Volume III (1977): Lieder on poems by Eichendorff, Michelangelo, Robert Reinick, Shakespeare, Byron, Hoffmann von Fallersleben, Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, etc. The accompanying volumes include essays by Hans Jancik, texts of the poems, and translations by Lionel Salter (English) and Jacques Fournier and others (French).

===Oxford Lieder Festival edition===
The first project to record every song by Wolf was commenced in 2010, the 150th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth, by Stone Records and the Oxford Lieder Festival. This series of live recordings, featuring a wide variety of singers and Oxford Lieder Festival&#x27;s artistic director Sholto Kynoch at the piano, was completed in 2023 with the release of the 11th disc.

===Austrian Radio Anniversary edition===
In 2010 Austrian Radio and the Departure Centre for Creative Design in Vienna marked Hugo Wolf&#x27;s anniversary with a recital series in which 188 of the songs were performed against visuals created by leading designers. The series was intended to bring Lieder to a new audience and was held at the initiative of baritone Wolfgang Holzmair, who was joined by a team of Austrian singers and pianists. The concerts were released on DVDs the following year, and in 2012 Bridge Records released the Spanish and Italian songbooks on CDs.

<doc id="147494" wikidata="Q628958" url="?curid=147494" title="Pre-ejaculate">
<text>Pre-ejaculate (also known as pre-ejaculatory fluid, pre-seminal fluid or Cowper&#x27;s fluid, and colloquially as pre-cum) is a clear, colorless, viscous fluid that is emitted from the urethra of the penis during sexual arousal and in general during  sexual activity. It is similar in composition to semen but has distinct chemical differences. The presence of sperm in the fluid is variable from low to absent. Pre-ejaculate functions as a lubricant and an acid neutralizer.

==Origin and composition==
The fluid is discharged from the urethra of the penis during arousal, masturbation, foreplay or at an early stage during sexual intercourse, some time before the individual fully reaches orgasm and semen is ejaculated. It is primarily produced by the bulbourethral glands (Cowper&#x27;s glands), with the glands of Littré (the mucus-secreting urethral glands) also contributing. The amount of fluid that is issued varies widely among individuals. Some individuals do not produce any pre-ejaculate fluid, while others emit as much as . 

Pre-ejaculate fluid contains chemicals associated with semen, such as acid phosphatase, but other semen markers, such as gamma-glutamyltransferase, are absent.

==Function and risks==
Pre-ejaculate neutralizes acidity in the urethra caused by residual urine, creating a more favorable environment for the passage of sperm. The vagina is normally acidic, so the deposit of pre-ejaculate before the emission of semen may change the vaginal environment to promote sperm survival. Pre-ejaculate also acts as a lubricant during sexual activity, and plays a role in semen coagulation.

Low levels or no sperm exists in pre-ejaculate, although studies examined small samples of men. Two contrary studies found mixed evidence, including individual cases of a high sperm concentration. There is evidence – dating to a 1966 Masters and Johnson study – that pre-ejaculate may contain sperm that can cause pregnancy, which is a common basis of argument against the use of coitus interruptus (withdrawal) as a contraceptive method.

Studies have demonstrated the presence of HIV in most pre-ejaculate samples from infected men.

==Overproduction==
In rare cases, an individual may produce an excessive amount of pre-ejaculate fluid, which may be treatable by a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, such as finasteride.

<doc id="147496" wikidata="Q340233" url="?curid=147496" title="MS Achille Lauro">
<text>MS &quot;Achille Lauro was a [[cruise ship]] based in [[Naples]], Italy. It was built between 1939 and 1947 as the [[ocean liner]] Willem Ruys&quot; for Royal Rotterdam Lloyd. In 1965 Achille Lauro bought the ship, had it converted into a cruise ship, and renamed it after himself. In 1985 it was hijacked by members of the Palestine Liberation Front.

The ship was also involved in two serious collisions: in 1953 with the , and in 1975 with the cargo ship &quot;Youseff&quot;. It also suffered four onboard fires or explosions: in 1965, 1972, 1981, and 1994. In the last of these, in 1994, the ship caught fire and sank in the Indian Ocean off Somalia.

==Concept and construction==
Ordered in 1938 to replace the aging ships on the Dutch East Indies route, she was laid down in 1939 at Koninklijke Maatschappij &#x27;De Schelde&#x27;. Scheepswerf en Machinefabriek in Vlissingen, Netherlands, for Rotterdamsche Lloyd (now part of Nedlloyd). Interrupted by World War II and two bombing raids, the ship was finally launched in July 1946, as &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;. The ship was named after the grandson of the founder of Rotterdamsche Lloyd, whom the Germans had taken hostage and shot during the war.

&quot;Willem Ruys&quot; was completed in late 1947. At that time, the Rotterdamsche Lloyd had been granted a royal prefix in honour of its services during the war. &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; was in length, in beam, had a draught of , and measured 21,119 gross register tons. Eight Sulzer engines drove two propellers. She could accommodate 900 passengers. She featured a superstructure very different from other liners of that era; &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; pioneered low-slung aluminium lifeboats, within the upper-works&#x27; flanks. The next ship to adopt this arrangement was the in 1961. Today, all cruise ships follow this layout, with fibreglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) used for lifeboat hulls.

==Service history==

===As the &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;===
====On the East Indies route====
As &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;, the ship began her maiden voyage on 5 December 1947. Together with her main competitor and running mate, the MS &quot;Oranje&quot; of the Netherland Line, she became a popular fixture on the Dutch East Indies route. However, when the East Indies gained independence from The Netherlands in 1949, passenger numbers decreased.

The future prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, travelled aboard &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; as a fresh graduate upon completing his studies in the United Kingdom.

====Collision with &quot;Oranje&quot;====
On 6 January 1953, &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; collided in the Red Sea with running mate , which was heading in the opposite direction. At that time, it was common for passenger ships to pass each other at close range to entertain their passengers. During the (later heavily criticized) abrupt and fast approach of &quot;Oranje&quot;, &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; made an unexpected swing to the left, resulting in a collision. &quot;Oranje&quot; badly damaged her bow. Due to the possibility that she would be impounded for safety reasons, she was unable to call at Colombo as scheduled, and went directly to Jakarta. &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; suffered less damage. There was no loss of life involved. Later, it was determined that miscommunication on both ships had caused the collision.

====&quot;Journey to Java&quot;====
During 1957, the English diplomat, author and diarist Harold Nicolson and his wife, the author and poet Vita Sackville-West, toured the Far East for two months aboard &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;. The voyage is documented in &quot;Journey to Java&quot;, his published journal of the trip, which provides a detailed account of first class travel on the vessel in the 1950s interlarded with rambling literary reflections.

====Later years====
After repairs, Royal Rotterdam Lloyd decided to release &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; on the North Atlantic run. First, she was placed on the New York service, and later Canada was included.

In 1958, the Royal Rotterdamsche Lloyd and the Netherland Line signed a co-operative agreement to create a round-the-world passenger service. The joint fleet would sail under the banner of &quot;The Royal Dutch Mail Ships&quot;. Together with &quot;Oranje&quot; and &quot;Johan van Oldenbarneveldt&quot;, &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; underwent an extensive refit to prepare her for this new service. She made two charter trips to Montreal for the Europa-Canada service. Then, from 20 September 1958, until 25 February 1959, she underwent a major facelift at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard in Amsterdam, turning her from a passenger liner into a cruise ship. Her original four class distinctions became First and Tourist Class. A hundred new cabins were installed and air-conditioning was extended throughout all accommodations. The Javanese crew members were replaced by Europeans, who required upgraded crew accommodation. Externally, she was fitted with a new glazing in Tourist Class Wintergarden, her forward funnel was heightened and stabilizers were fitted. &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; was now able to accommodate 275 first class and 770 tourist class passengers, although there were many interchangeable cabins which had additional berths fitted, which could increase the maximum passenger number to 1167. Her new specifications would see her tonnage increase from 21,119 to 23,114 gross register ton.

On 7 March 1959, &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; went off on her new world service to Australia and New Zealand. She departed from Rotterdam, sailing via Southampton, the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, Fremantle, Melbourne, Sydney, New Zealand, returning via the Panama Canal. The Royal Dutch Mail Ships (&quot;Willem Ruys&quot;, &quot;Johan van Oldenbarnevelt&quot; and &quot;Oranje&quot;) became a popular alternative to the British liners.

At the end of 1964, due to a strong drop in passenger numbers, &quot;Willem Ruys&quot; was laid up in Rotterdam and put up for sale.

=== As &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; ===

In 1965, she was sold to the Flotta Lauro Line and renamed &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; after the company&#x27;s owner. She was extensively rebuilt and modernized after an August 1965 onboard explosion, and entered service in 1966 carrying passengers to Sydney, Australia. The ship played a role in evacuating the families of British servicemen caught up in unrest in Aden, and made one of the last northbound transits through the Suez Canal before its closure during the Six-Day War.

&quot;Achille Lauro&quot; was converted to a cruise ship in early 1972, during which time she suffered a disastrous fire. A 1975 collision with the cargo ship &quot;Youseff&quot; resulted in the sinking of the latter, and another onboard fire in 1981 took her out of service for a time. She was laid up in Tenerife when Lauro Lines went bankrupt in 1982. The Chandris Line took possession of her under a charter arrangement in 1985, shortly before the hijacking.

The ship was chartered by a private group for the duration of the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup series held in Fremantle, Western Australia, to act as a viewing platform and accommodation for 1,400 visitors. It also housed the international jury which oversaw the races.

====1985 hijacking====

On 7 October 1985, four members of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) took control of the liner off Egypt as she was sailing from Alexandria to Port Said. Holding the passengers and crew hostage, they directed the vessel to sail to Tartus, Syria, and demanded the release of 50 Palestinians then in Israeli prisons. After being refused permission to dock at Tartus, the hijackers killed disabled Jewish-American passenger Leon Klinghoffer and then threw his body overboard.

The ship then headed back towards Port Said, and after two days of negotiations, the hijackers agreed to abandon the liner in exchange for safe conduct and were flown towards Tunisia aboard an Egyptian commercial airliner. This airliner, however, was intercepted by U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft and directed to land in Sicily. There, the United States Delta Force unsuccessfully attempted to extract the hijackers in order to try them in the United States, thereby causing the Sigonella Crisis. The four terrorists were ultimately sentenced to prison terms by the Italian courts, while the operation&#x27;s mastermind, who had not taken part in the actual hijacking, was given passage to Yugoslavia and escaped.

====Later years, fire, and sinking====
The ship continued in service. She was re-flagged in 1989 when the Lauro Line was taken over by the Mediterranean Shipping Company to become &quot;StarLauro&quot;.
In the evening of 30 November 1994 she caught fire off the coast of Somalia while &quot;en route&quot; to South Africa, with 979 passengers and crew aboard. At that time, Italian officials said the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette. Later analysis suggests that the fire started in the engine room after one of the crankcases exploded which allowed cooling oil to get into the exhaust. Because of a lack of supervision, the fire burned out of control before its discovery. The crew battled the fire unsuccessfully for several hours, first with hoses and then by passing buckets from the swimming pool. Entertainer Moss Hills, who led rescue efforts during the sinking of MTS &quot;Oceanos&quot; in 1991, recalled that pouring water on an oil fire was ineffective, while making the conflagration worse. The vessel was abandoned in the morning after developing a list. A small number of crew and passengers were unable to board the main lifeboats due to flames coming up from the hull, so they climbed down a rope ladder from the stern to reach inflatable boats. Two died and eight were injured during the evacuation and transfer to rescue ships. Among the ships that responded to the call were USS &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and . &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; sank on 2 December 1994, which was witnessed by a fire tugboat that had arrived to assess salvageability. The wreck has not been located since.

<text>, originally &quot;Nine Gods Divine (from heaven) School&quot; (also translated as &quot;Nine Demon Divine (from heaven) School&quot; by many modern groups having different lineages) is a Japanese martial art allegedly founded in the 14th century CE by Kuki Yakushimaru Ryūshin (Yakushimaru Kurando). It is a &quot;sōgō&quot; bujutsu, meaning that it teaches several different weapons/arts such as taijutsu, bōjutsu, naginatajutsu, kenpō, hanbōjutsu, sōjutsu and heiho. Kukishin-ryū and its founder are listed in the Bugei Ryūha Daijiten or &quot;The Encyclopedia of Martial Art Schools&quot;, a record of modern (gendai) and old lineage (koryū) Japanese martial schools.

==The Legend of Kukishin-ryū==
Ryushin Yakushimaru, the founder of Kukishin-ryū, was born to Dōyu Shirōhōgan at Kumano-Hongu in Wakayama prefecture on January 1, 1318. He was born into one of the most influential clans in Kumano, who were the descendants of the Fujiwara clan who served for generations as &quot;bettō&quot;, or “Shrine Supervisors.&quot; The family eventually entered into the Taira-Minamoto War and commanded the Kumano Navy. Ryushin&#x27;s mother was Chigusa-hime, whose brother was Suketomo Dainagon Hino, a member of the Southern Imperial court. Because Chigusa-hime had difficulty in conceiving she made a pilgrimage to Enryaku-ji temple at Mt. Hiei where she prayed to the Yakushi Buddha (Bhaisajyaguru-Vaiduryaprabha) for help. Soon after, she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy, which she named Yakushimaru after the deity.

Ryushin learned the martial arts and military sciences (Shinden Fujiwara Musō-ryū) handed down in his family from his grandfather Dōjitsu and Shingu-Bettō Ariie. After learning shugendō (mountaineering asceticism) from his father Dōyu, Ryushin then went to Kyoto where he learned esoteric Buddhism from the Buddhist monk Jōkai at Sanmaku-in temple. He also trained in martial arts at Mt. Kurama and was said to be master of Kuji-hihō and Onmyo-do.

In 1335, when Ryushin celebrated his coming of age, he joined the Northern Court under Takauji Ashikaga in a war against the Southern Court. In June, 1336 Ryushin and his vanguard led an attack on the Southern Court&#x27;s fort on Mt. Hiei. The fort eventually fell and the Southern Court Emperor, Go-Daigo, and his loyal vassals were captured and kept at the old palace of former Emperor Kazanin. Takauji&#x27;s treatment of the prisoners was so abhorrent that Ryushin was quoted as saying &quot;It is possible to loose the emperor from the harsh treatment he receives. I will plot his rescue.&quot; With other conspirators Ooe Gyōbu Daiyu Kageshige, Bessho Saburō Takanori (Kojima Takanori), Hiyoshi Iga Nyudō and Kisshuin Sōshin Hōgen, Ryushin broke into the palace of Kazanin and escaped to Yoshino with Emperor Go-daigo.

Tadayoshi Kuragari-Tōge, the younger brother of Takauji, was alerted of the escape and sent an army of about ten thousand men in pursuit. The army caught up with Ryushin and the conspirators at Kuragari-Tōge, a mountain pass situated on the borders of Osaka and Nara prefectures. It was here that they made a stand against the army, each choosing a weapon they were proficient with. Kageshige took a sword, Takatoku a bow and arrow, and Ryushin a halberd (naginata). As the army outnumbered them completely, it was a battle of strategy and evasion; eventually the blade of Ryushin&#x27;s Naginata was cut off. So Ryushin used the remains of his naginata to knock down enemies near him and put enemies at bay by swinging the staff in the air, drawing out the kuji-kiri as he did. It is said that the Bōjutsu in Kukishin Ryū was later devised on the techniques Ryushin used on this occasion.

Reinforcements from Yoshino eventually arrived and they could safely take the Emperor Godaigo to a small temple-like hut located at Mt. Kinpusen. Ryushin also succeeded in re-capturing the “Three Treasures of the Imperial House” which he had concealed in a scripture-warehouse at Yokawa in Mt. Hiei. The Emperor Go-Daigo praised Ryushin&#x27;s dedication and inquired about his secret techniques. Ryushin answered, &quot;It is a secret technique passed on in my family. It is The secret art of Kuji.&quot; The emperor then made an announcement as follows: &quot;God knows your loyalty. You shall change your surname Fujiwara to Kuki.&quot;
The &quot;Ku&quot; of Kuki stands for &quot;Ku&quot; or “nine” in Japanese. &quot;Ki&quot; can be pronounced &quot;Kami&quot; if the character is pronounced in the Japanese way, meaning &quot;Oni-gami&quot;(holy spirit) as opposed to &quot;Oni&quot; (evil spirits). &quot;Ku-ki&quot; is therefore actually &quot;Ku-kami.&quot; However, it has been customarily pronounced Kuki since the Edo period.

After the war Ryushin&#x27;s mother Chigusa Hino, whose family belonged to the Southern Court, lamented over the fact that Ryushin took the side of the Northern Court. She traveled to Musashi (modern day Hino city in Tokyo,) where the Hino family still lived and she died despondently. After his mother&#x27;s death, Ryushin created the Kukishin Bojutsu in honor of his mother which he called &quot;Juji-Roppou-Kujidome&quot;　devoted and himself to protecting the Emperor Go-Daigo

The records of the Kuki family are kept in scrolls and transcriptions which have been rarely shown, but which have been seen and accounted for by scholars. These ancient documents came to be known to the public when Miura Ichiro published &quot;A Study of the Kuki Archives&quot; in 1941. The scrolls are known for containing supplementary records concerning the mythological age, complementing the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, the two major ancient documents in Japan. Volumes on Ko-shinto, martial arts and Kumano Honzan Shugendō were accounted. Until Miura&#x27;s publication, the only mention of the scrolls was in volume two of Sontoku Okina Yawa that detailed Kuki Takahiro, the 24th head of the Kukis, giving &quot;ten volumes of books concerning Shintoism&quot; to the scholar Ninomiya Sontoku. After Miura&#x27;s publication came Kuki-shinden-zensho by Ago Kiyotaka, a leading figure in the study of ancient history, detailing some of the contents of the scrolls, including the origins and history of Kukishin-ryū.

==About the Name==

*九 &quot;Ku&quot; stands for “nine&quot; in Japanese.
*鬼 &quot;Ki&quot; as seen on the far left is actually an incorrect kanji for the name. It is supposed to be an older Chinese based kanji meaning &quot;Kami&quot; or god but it is now long obsolete (compare above). This is because over the years the older character became lost due to the need to simplify/unify the Chinese characters used in Japanese writing. So, the similar, original character of 鬼 (oni or demon) is used in its stead. This inadvertently changes the meaning of the name to modern readers, who rightly believe that it reads &quot;Nine Demons;&quot; yet in fact the character was originally pronounced as &quot;Oni-gami&quot;(holy spirit) as opposed to &quot;Oni&quot; (evil spirits). The name &quot;Ku-ki&quot; is therefore actually &quot;Ku-kami&quot; yet, it has been customarily pronounced as &quot;Kuki&quot; since the Edo period.
*神 &quot;Shin&quot; or &quot;kami&quot; means god or spirit- the English interpretation of &quot;spirit&quot; works better as &quot;Nine Gods God School&quot; sounds redundant and creates problems in comprehension.
*流 &quot;Ryū&quot; translates originally as &quot;flow,&quot; however when related with the transmission of traditions as martial arts and appended to the name of a style or system, it means &quot;school.&quot;

==Techniques==
The teachings of the Ryū are detailed in the Kukishin &quot;Densho&quot; (scrolls).

Kukishin Ryu transmits its traditions and knowledge in six main martial disciplines: Taijutsu, Bōjutsu, Kenpō, Naginatajutsu, Hanbōjutsu and Sōjutsu. Heiho (military strategy), complements this training. Besides these major disciplines, practitioners may also learn secret weapons, hidden teachings and Onakatomi shinto (Ko-shinto) practices.

===Taijutsu (体術)===
This art (jutsu) consists of locks, entanglements, strangling, striking and kicking, as well as the use of small weapons such as shuriken.
The Taijutsu techniques of Kukishin-ryū were altered by the seventh head of the school Kiyotaka Kuki, and organized by his son Sumitaka. This was because the techniques of Atekomi (striking) originated at times when armor was worn and became outdated. These techniques were modified to fit in with the early edo jidai. In the late Edo era, the twenty-fifth Soke, Takatomo Kuki, devised the Kihongata that consisted of eight techniques used for teaching the basics of the Ryu arts to beginners- however, this review did little to quell its brutality in learning and teaching. In an effort to make safer to learn and teach, Takatomo altered the techniques so that beginners could practice without suffering injuries. Takatomo served at Nijō Castle in Kyoto, where on February 28, 1864 he visited the Imperial Court and demonstrated his new methods to the emperor.

Kukishin-ryū and Takagi-Yōshin-ryū Taijutsu

There is a strong relationship between the taijutsu of Kukishin-ryū and Takagi-Yoshin-ryū. According to Takamatsu Chōsui, the story of blending of Takagi-ryū Taijutsu into Kukishin-ryū (and Kukishin-ryū bōjutsu into Takagi-ryū) is as follows:

The untimely death of inheritor Sadataka Kuki left Kukishin-ryū without an heir. Therefore, the eldest son of Yoshitaka Kuki, named Kihei, became the successor. During the time of his inheritance, Kihei&#x27;s health was very poor and he was bedridden. Eventually he grew stronger and was able to head the ryū properly, even becoming a mountaineering ascetic and traveling far across Japan. During one of his journeys Kihei happened to meet the son of Gennoshin Takagi in Akou (present day Hyōgo Prefecture), who was named Umanosuke. During their visit together, they compared the acumen of their two ryu. Whereas Takagi exceeded in Taijutsu, Kihei&#x27;s Bōjutsu was superior. So in agreement, they altered the basic format of the two ryū. Since this time the basic Taijutsu of Kukishin-ryū is Takagi-ryū while the Bōjutsu, Spear and Naginata techniques have remained Kukishin-ryū. r

===Bōjutsu (棒術)===
The bōjutsu of Kukishin Ryū is best described as a method used to defeat/trick wielders of other weapons. It has special striking techniques that allow the Bō to feign quickly and re-direct its aim; a special method of &quot;twirling&quot; (Bofurigata) designed to confuse opponents and keep them at bay; and thrusting techniques that correlate with throwing the staff as a projectile (nagebō). Aspects of the Bōjutsu are gleaned from two other weapons within the school: naginata and the spear.

Bōjutsu, Sensudori and the Kaiden-Gata

There are actually three sizes of bō that could be categorized as bōjutsu within Kukishin Ryū: Rokushaku-bō (long), Han-bō (medium) and the Tan-bō (small). However, what is called &#x27;Bōjutsu&#x27; in Kukishin Ryū involves the use of the Rokushaku-bō; nevertheless, this is really only the start of the Bōjutsu practice. The Han-bō is traditionally taught independently of the other techniques, which are formally contained in what is called &#x27;Sensudori,&#x27; the upper echelon of the schools teachings (Kaiden-gata). Additionally the Han-bō is categorized into &#x27;Tessenjutsu&#x27; and taught as part of the Taijutsu as a close-quarters weapon. In Sensudori, the basic Kukishin Ryū strategy of &quot;Gō, Ri, Hō, Chi, Shin&quot; is exemplified. The beginner will use a staff of 180 cm, then 90 cm and finally one of 26 cm. This is concurrent with the ideology of Gō, Ri, Hō, Chi, Shin in application.

===Kenpō (剣法)===
The kanji for this means &quot;sword law&quot; (not &quot;fist law&quot;). It consists of evasion, slashing, stabbing, blocking and countering. It also includes the use of bōshuriken.
One of the signature movements of Kukishin Ryū Kempō is the upward slashing. The ninth head of the family, Yoshitaka Kuki, participated in the war against Korea under Hideyoshi Toyotomi. In the marine battle off the shore of Ulusan, the belly-shot Yoshitaka jumped aboard the enemy&#x27;s ship and slashed upward into the crotch of the admiral with his sword. After this, the technique became well-renowned.
The Kenpō also includes the use of &#x27;Token-jutsu&#x27;, or the method of throwing blades and swords (shurikenjutsu). While it teaches the use of bōshuriken, it is also considered an alternative method of using a dagger and long sword.

===Naginatajutsu (薙刀術)===
The Kukishin Ryū Naginata is 225 cm in overall length. It has a double edged blade that is 21 cm long and is attached to the shaft by wires. It is used to slash, parry, strike, stab and deflect; the blade is also used to hook and arrest.
Naginata is a weapon of primary importance in Kukishin Ryū as the Bōjutsu owes its origin to the Naginata. It stands as another signature weapon of Kukishin Ryū and it is perhaps the base of the ryu&#x27;s creation.

===Hanbōjutsu (半棒術)===
The hanbō of Kukishin-ryū is used to parry, strike, crush and stab. It integrates with taijutsu as well. The hanbō is most directly related to the spear and staff, however these influences are superficial. It is safe to say that although the spear was in fact the origin of the hanbō itself, it truly plied its techniques from the sword.

Ukon Kuriyama is thought to have created and introduced the hanbō techniques to Kukishin-ryū during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Legend has it that he was well known for his skill with the short spear. Kuriyama participated in the Battle of Nagashino on May 4, 1575, on the side of Nobunaga Oda. While fighting against general Katsuhisa Tangonokami Suzuki, Kuriyama&#x27;s spear was cut in half. Kuriyama kept on fighting with the cleft spear and eventually defeated Suzuki. Then it is said that he continued into battle, overwhelming the enemies&#x27; swords and thoroughly beating them down. From this legend, it is believed that the hanbō was officially included in Kukishin-ryū during the early Edō era.

===Sōjutsu (槍術)===
The Kukishin Ryū spear has a total length of 270 cm. The 36 cm to 45 cm spearhead is connected to the shaft with wire, and it has three edges or &quot;blades.&quot; It is used to parry, slash, stab, strike and to unbalance opponents.

The spear techniques in Kukishin-ryū integrate a myriad of complex variations and nuances and this is perhaps the most difficult weapon in the curricula to learn. It has a number of targets which can be reached from both long and short distances and at each distance, a slight divergence in the way the weapon is used is needed in order to make it effective. This makes it one of the most complicated and complex weapons, depending entirely on distance and timing for the wielder to use it correctly.

==Kukishin-ryū Today==
Today there are older and modern branches of the ryū still active.

There some Schools which still train Kukishin Ryu:
* Kukishin-ryu Bojutsu under 19. Soke Fumon Tanaka
* Hontai Yōshin-ryū under 19. Soke Kyoichi Inoue
* Motoha Yoshin Ryu under Soke Yasumoto Akiyoshi
* Takagi Ryu under 19. Soke Kusuhara Juhei
* Bujinkan teaches a branch called Kuki Shinden-Ryū Happō Biken under Masaaki Hatsumi, Unsui Manaka of the Jinenkan, Sukh Sandhu of the Gi Yu Kyo Kai, and Shoto Tanemura of the Genbukan have their own branches. 

The Kuki family maintains the family line, which is called &quot;Kukamishin Ryu&quot; (the name before 2016 was &quot;Kukishin-Ryu Tenshin Hyoho&quot;), led by Eichoku Takatsuka under the supervision of the current 28th Soke, Ietaka Kuki. The &quot;Kukishinden Tenshin Hyoho&quot; is a different line and uses just a similar name. Kogenshakai teaches a branch called &quot;Kukushin-ryu Tenshin Hyoho&quot; under Fumio Hirokawa and David Alonso.

These branches maintain their own lineages, techniques and histories, usually stemming from the main family line.

<text>Sir Bruce Joseph Forsyth-Johnson (22 February 1928 – 18 August 2017) was an English entertainer and television presenter whose career spanned more than 75 years.

Forsyth came to national attention from the late 1950s through the ITV series &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. He went on to host several game shows, including &quot;The Generation Game&quot;, &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;You Bet!&quot;. He co-presented &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; from 2004 to 2013.

During his time as host of &quot;The Generation Game&quot;, Forsyth began using what would become his signature &#x27;call and response&#x27; greeting with the studio audience, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see you, to see &quot;you&quot;...&quot;, to which the audience would loudly reply, &quot;Nice!&quot;; he used this on many shows he later hosted for the rest of his career. Forsyth was also known for his &quot;The Thinker&quot; pose, emulating Rodin&#x27;s sculpture, which he used on many shows he later hosted.

Forsyth was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to entertainment and charity. In 2012, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognised Forsyth as having the longest television career for a male entertainer.

==Early life==
Forsyth was born on Victoria Road in Edmonton, Middlesex, on 22 February 1928, the son of Florence Ada (&quot;née&quot; Pocknell) and John Thomas Forsyth-Johnson. His family owned a car repair garage and, as members of the Salvation Army, his parents played brass instruments; his mother was a singer.

His great-grandfather Joseph Forsyth Johnson was a landscape architect who worked in several countries, and Bruce believed that his great-great-great-great-grandfather was William Forsyth (1737–1804) a founder of the Royal Horticultural Society and the namesake of the plant genus &quot;Forsythia&quot;. However both of William&#x27;s sons died without heirs so William had no direct male descendants.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Forsyth was evacuated to Clacton-on-Sea. Shortly after he arrived, Forsyth&#x27;s parents allowed him to return to London because he felt homesick. On 21 May 1943, Forsyth&#x27;s older brother John, who was serving as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, was killed aged 20 during a training exercise at RAF Turnberry; he is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial. Forsyth attended the Latymer School. After watching Fred Astaire in films at the age of eight, he trained in dance in Tottenham and then Brixton.

==Career==
===Boy Bruce, the Mighty Atom===
Forsyth started his live public performances aged 14, with a song, dance and accordion act called Boy Bruce, the Mighty Atom. His first appearance was at the Theatre Royal in Bilston, with The Great Marzo at the top of the bill. He had made his television debut in 1939 as a child, singing and dancing on BBC talent show &quot;Come and Be Televised&quot;, broadcast from Radiolympia and introduced by Jasmine Bligh.

===Post-war work===
After the war, with the goal of joining Moss Empires theatres, he spent years on stage with little success and travelled the UK working seven days a week, doing summer seasons, pantomimes and circuses, where he became renowned for his strong-man act. His act was interrupted by national service when he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force at the age of 19, which he later reflected taught him &quot;respect and discipline&quot;.

In 1958, an appearance with the comedian Dickie Henderson led to his being offered the job of compère of Val Parnell&#x27;s weekly TV variety show, &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. He hosted the show for two years, followed by a year&#x27;s break, then returned for another year. His schedule of stage performances, which continued throughout the 1960s, forced him to give up the job of host.
Forsyth appeared in the London production of &quot;Little Me&quot;, along with Avril Angers in 1964. In the musical film &quot;Star!&quot; (1968), a biopic of stage actress Gertrude Lawrence, he played alongside lead performer Julie Andrews as Lawrence&#x27;s father.

In January 1968 Pye Records issued as a single &quot;I&#x27;m Backing Britain&quot;, supporting the campaign of the same name, written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent, and sung by Forsyth. The chorus included &quot;The feeling is growing, so let&#x27;s keep it going, the good times are blowing our way&quot;. All involved in making the single took cuts in their fees or royalties so that the single sold for 5s. instead of the going rate of 7s. d. Forsyth happily endorsed the campaign, saying &quot;The country has always done its best when it is up against the wall. If everyone realises what we are up against we can get out of trouble easily.&quot; The song did not make the charts, selling only 7,319 copies.

On 7 October 1968, he was top of the bill on the opening night of the Golden Garter nightclub, Wythenshawe. Two years later, he played Swinburne in the Disney fantasy film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;. In 1976, he appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where he took on the duo Statler and Waldorf.

===Game show host===
During his spell of hosting &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; as part of the show he hosted the 15-minute game show &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. Forsyth&#x27;s next success was &quot;The Generation Game&quot; (BBC1, 1971–1977, 1990–1994), which proved popular and attracted huge Saturday evening audiences. It was on this show that Forsyth introduced his &quot;The Thinker&quot; pose, emulating Rodin&#x27;s sculpture, appearing in silhouette each week after the opening titles. This pose is reminiscent of the circus strong-man attitude, and Forsyth used it on many shows he later hosted. He also wrote and sang the theme for the show &quot;Life is the Name of the Game.&quot; Millions of viewers became familiar with the rasp of Forsyth&#x27;s north London accented voice and his &quot;distinctively pointy&quot; chin that he emphasised in poses such as the &quot;human question mark&quot;, with chin over raised knee. During his time as host of &quot;The Generation Game&quot; he began using what would become his signature &#x27;call and response&#x27; greeting with the studio audience, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see you, to see &quot;you&quot;...&quot;, to which the audience would loudly reply, &quot;Nice!&quot;; he used this on many shows he later hosted for the rest of his career. He was replaced on &quot;The Generation Game&quot; by Larry Grayson.

In 1977 he announced that he was leaving television to take the star role in a new musical, &quot;The Travelling Music Show&quot;, based on the songs of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. The show did reasonably well in provincial theatre, but received poor reviews when it moved to London and it closed after four months in July 1978.

London Weekend Television persuaded him to return to the screen later that year to present &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot;, a two-hour Saturday-night show on ITV encompassing a variety of different entertainment formats (later reduced to 90 minutes). However, the show was not a success and lasted for just one series. Forsyth remained with ITV, hosting the game show &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;, which was the UK version of the US original &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, from 1980 to 1987, 1994 to 1999, and a brief period from 2002 to 2003, before the show was pulled mid-run.

In 1986, he went to the United States to host a game show on ABC, &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot;, which ran for 65 episodes from January to April that year. Shortly after, Forsyth was considered by Mark Goodson to be a candidate for hosting the revival of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;; ultimately the jobs went to Bob Eubanks (for the daytime version that aired on CBS), and Bill Rafferty (who hosted the night-time syndicated version). Forsyth starred in the Thames Television sitcom &quot;Slinger&#x27;s Day&quot; in 1986 and 1987, a sequel to &quot;Tripper&#x27;s Day&quot; which had starred Leonard Rossiter, whom Forsyth replaced in the new show. He was the original host of &quot;You Bet!&quot; (1988 to 1990).

Forsyth fronted the third version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (1995 to 2001). His unsuccessful gameshows include &quot;Takeover Bid&quot; (1990 to 1991), &quot;Hollywood Or Bust&quot; (1984), and &quot;Didn&#x27;t They Do Well!&quot; (2004). During the 1970s Forsyth featured in the Stork margarine adverts on television, and then during the 1980s and 1990s he appeared in an advertising campaign for the furniture retailer Courts, in which he dressed as a judge.

Forsyth celebrated his 70th birthday in 1998 and appeared in a week-long run of his one-man show at the London Palladium. In 2000, Forsyth hosted a revived series called &quot;Tonight at the London Palladium&quot;.

===Career revival===
In 2003, and again in 2010, Forsyth was a guest presenter on the news and satire quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Forsyth had called Paul Merton, one of the team captains on the show, to suggest himself as a guest presenter. He co-presented &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; from 2004 to 2013, formally stepping down from hosting the regular live show in April 2014. This decision was made to reduce his workload and for the preparation of pre-recorded specials.

On 7 April 2010, Forsyth became one of the first three celebrities to be subjected to the British version of the American institution of a comedy roast, on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;A Comedy Roast&quot;. Forsyth was the subject of the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast on 19 July 2010. On 20 March 2010, Forsyth appeared on the autobiography-interview programme &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, which was broadcast on ITV.

In 2011, Forsyth released a collection of songs on CD called &quot;These Are My Favourites&quot;. He chose the songs for their personal and musical importance, including a duet with his granddaughter, Sophie Purdie. &quot;These Are My Favourites&quot; also includes a recording of &quot;Paper Moon&quot; with Nat King Cole.

==Tributes and honours==

Forsyth&#x27;s showbiz awards include Variety Club Show Business Personality of the Year in 1975; &quot;TV Times&quot; Male TV Personality of the Year, in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978; and BBC TV Personality of the Year in 1991.

On 7 June 1959 Forsyth was inducted into the elite entertainers&#x27; fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats, Water Rat number 566.

In 1987, a fan club was created – the Great Bruce Forsyth Social Club. They would later go on to assist Forsyth in singing his opening number, &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot;, at his &quot;Audience With&quot; show. He repaid this favour by adding the society to his busy schedule in June 1997 and appeared at their 10th annual general meeting in Plymouth.

Forsyth was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1998 Birthday Honours, and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours.

On 27 February 2005, the BBC screened &quot;A BAFTA Tribute to Bruce Forsyth&quot; to mark the entertainer&#x27;s 60 years in show business. He had a bronze bust of himself unveiled at the London Palladium in May 2005. The sculpture was created by his son-in-law and is on display in the theatre&#x27;s Cinderella Bar.

In 2008, Forsyth received the BAFTA Fellowship. In 2009, he was awarded the Theatre Performer&#x27;s Award at the annual Carl Alan Awards. Hosted by the International Dance Teachers&#x27; Association, the awards are voted for by the leading dance organisations in the United Kingdom and recognise those who have made an exceptional contribution to the world of dance and theatre.

Forsyth received a Royal Television Society Lifetime Achievement Award on 17 March 2009. On 26 January 2011 he received the National Television Awards special recognition award.

Forsyth was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to entertainment and charity. This followed a years-long public campaign to award him a knighthood. His investiture, by the Queen, took place on 12 October 2011 and he became Sir Bruce Forsyth CBE.

In July 2012, Forsyth was given the honour of carrying the Olympic flame through London, as it finally reached the city on the penultimate day of the London 2012 Torch Relay.

Forsyth earned a place in the 2013 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the male TV entertainer having had the longest career, calling it a &quot;wonderful surprise&quot;. He also appeared at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival on the Avalon stage, becoming the oldest performer to ever play at the festival. In 2018 the NTAs honoured the memory of Sir Bruce by naming an NTA award after him.

==Personal life==
Forsyth was married to Penny Calvert from 1953 until their divorce in 1973, with whom he had three daughters named Debbie, Julie, and Laura. Julie is a songwriter, who composed the UK&#x27;s entry in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest.

In 1973, he married Anthea Redfern, the hostess on &quot;The Generation Game&quot;. They had daughters Charlotte and Louisa, before they too divorced in 1979. Asked to judge the 1980 Miss World competition, Forsyth met Puerto Rican beauty queen Wilnelia Merced, who was the 1975 winner and a fellow judge. They were married from 1983 until his death in 2017. They had one son together named Jonathan Joseph (who is better known as &quot;JJ&quot;). By his six children, Forsyth had nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Forsyth was a supporter and ambassador for the children&#x27;s charity Caudwell Children, regularly appearing at many of their fundraising events.

Forsyth lived on the Wentworth Estate in Surrey. Until 2000, he also occupied a flat in Nell Gwynn House, Sloane Avenue, Chelsea.

==Politics==

Forsyth was a supporter of the Conservative party, admired Margaret Thatcher and attended fund raising events for the party.

In August 2014, Forsyth was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Illness and death==
Towards the end of his life, Forsyth suffered from ill health, which reduced his appearances in public. On 8 October 2015, he was admitted to hospital for cuts and minor concussion after tripping over a rug at his home and hitting his head. A month later, he made his last full TV appearance on &quot;Strictly Children in Need Special&quot;, with filming for this taking place prior to him undergoing surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm on 12 November. As a result of his surgery, Forsyth was unable to host that year&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special&quot; as planned, but a spokesman representing him later stated he would play a part in the production, recording a special video message for it.

After 2015, Forsyth made no further public appearances, as his health began to decline, with his wife commenting that he struggled to move easily following his surgery. On 26 February 2017, he was again admitted to hospital with a severe chest infection and spent five days in intensive care, before returning home on 3 March 2017.

On 18 August 2017, Forsyth died of bronchial pneumonia at his Wentworth Estate home in Virginia Water, aged 89. Several celebrities paid tribute to Forsyth following his death, including his former &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; co-host Tess Daly; his friends Michael Parkinson, Jimmy Tarbuck, and Des O&#x27;Connor, the BBC director general Tony Hall and the then Prime Minister, Theresa May. BBC One aired &quot;Sir Bruce Forsyth – Mr Entertainment&quot;, in place of the scheduled &quot;The One Show&quot;, in tribute. Forsyth was cremated on 5 September 2017 in a private ceremony attended only by close family and friends.

A few days later, on 9 September 2017, when that year&#x27;s series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; began, it paid tribute to Forsyth with a special ballroom dance routine from their professional dancers. On 14 December 2017, the BBC announced that it would produce a tribute show to Forsyth at the London Palladium on 21 February 2018. Hosted by his &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; co-host Tess Daly, &quot;Sir Bruce: A Celebration&quot; was broadcast on BBC One on 11 March 2018. On 18 August 2018, the first anniversary of his death, Forsyth&#x27;s ashes were laid to rest beneath the stage at the London Palladium in a private ceremony.

==In popular culture==
Neopets, a virtual pet website, had a collectible character which was originally a direct representation of Forsyth himself. The pet was later renamed to just &quot;Bruce&quot; and his appearance changed to that of a penguin to better fit with the other pets on the platform. Despite the change, the pet retained Forsyth&#x27;s iconic bow tie.

<text>David Dickinson (born David Gulesserian; 16 August 1941) is an English antiques dealer and television presenter. Between 2000 and 2004, Dickinson hosted the BBC One antiques show &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;, where he was succeeded by Tim Wonnacott. Dickinson left the BBC in 2005, and between 2006 and 2024, he hosted the ITV daytime show &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s Real Deal&quot;. The show saw members of the public bringing antiques and collectables to sell to a dealer or take to the auction.

In April 2003, Dickinson hosted his own daytime chat show series &quot;The David Dickinson Show&quot; and in 2017, he presented &quot;David Dickinson&#x27;s Name Your Price&quot; for ITV.

==Origins==
Dickinson was born on 16 August 1941 in Cheadle Heath, Stockport, Cheshire, the son of Eugenie Gulesserian (born 1919 in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Lancashire), a daughter of Hrant Gulesserian, an Armenian textile merchant who had moved from Constantinople to Manchester in 1904. Dickinson was placed for adoption as an infant and never again met his biological mother although he corresponded with her in later life when she was living in Jersey. Dickinson&#x27;s biological father is unknown. David was subsequently adopted by the Dickinsons, a local couple. Mr Dickinson died when David was 12, and as his mother worked hard to keep the family together, David was partly brought up by his adoptive paternal grandmother, Sarah.

==Early life==
Dickinson began an apprenticeship at an aircraft factory when he was 14, but quickly left to work in the cloth trade in central Manchester. At 19, Dickinson served three years of a four-year prison sentence for mail-order fraud. The majority of his sentence was spent at Strangeways in Manchester.

Dickinson set up in Manchester with the assistance of an old customer as silent partner, and the business ran until 1991 when, in light of forthcoming recession, the shop was closed. Dickinson decided to concentrate on selling antiques at prestigious fairs, taking stands at Olympia and other major antiques fairs three or four times a year, dealing in 18th- and 19th-century furniture and works of art.

==Personal life==
Dickinson met his wife, Lorne Lesley, a cabaret performer, in a nightclub in the 1960s, and they married in 1968. As a wedding gift Lorne gave David an antique regency mourning ring, set with a rose cut diamond. Lorne is of African, Welsh and Scottish ancestry; she hails from Tiger Bay, Cardiff. The couple live in the village of Prestbury in Cheshire. They have two grown-up children, and four grandchildren, Aim&#x27;ee and Lauren, Miles and Finley. Finley appeared alongside Dickinson on the second series of &quot;Big Star&#x27;s Little Star&quot;. Miles, who is now an entrepreneur, featured on Series 20 of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;, becoming the youngest contestant to successfully secure investment from a Dragon. 

Dickinson&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Duke&quot;, a reference to his wardrobe. For forty years he has used the same tailor, Chris Nicolaou, who appeared as a guest for Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; programme, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at an auction house in Folkestone in November 2002.

Until May 2008, Dickinson drove a bright blue Bentley Continental GT. He owns two vehicles, the first being an eco-friendly electric Smart EV and the second a Reliant Regal van; this van was one of the famous yellow Trotters Independent Traders vans from the sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, which Dickinson bought in 2007 for over £44,000.

==Television career==

In 1998, a chance meeting with a TV producer at a barbecue led to Dickinson&#x27;s TV appearance, a two-part documentary for the BBC made about him and his preparation for a show at Olympia. His dark complexion (often implied to be a fake tan, but he says that it is because of his Armenian ancestry) and numerous catchphrases quickly caught the viewers&#x27; attention.

Dickinson came to public attention as an antiques expert on &quot;This Morning&quot; and BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Antiques Show&quot;. His career break as a television celebrity came from presenting &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; on BBC One at lunchtimes which gained a keen following amongst daytime viewers including students.

A primetime evening version of &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; was broadcast for a few years following the success of the daytime show. Dickinson left the daytime edition of &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; in 2003 and was replaced by Tim Wonnacott on the daytime slot while Dickinson carried on presenting the primetime, celebrity and Christmas versions of the show. He went on to present a reality show, &quot;Dealing With Dickinson&quot; on BBC One in 2005 which was cancelled after only one series. Dickinson left the BBC once the primetime editions of &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; were cancelled.

Dickinson moved to ITV in 2006 to present a new daytime antiques programme, &quot;Dickinson&#x27;s Real Deal&quot;, which is broadcast on daytime weekday afternoons. Old episodes are frequently repeated. The show visits locations around the UK and asks people to come in and either sell their antiques and collectables for valuation by an antiques dealer who may offer to buy the item for cash. Alternatively, the participants can take a gamble and go to auction if the dealer&#x27;s offer is refused or no offer is made to buy the object. The participant risks taking a lower price than offered by the dealer if the object fails to exceed the dealer&#x27;s offer or fails to meet its reserve. Dickinson&#x27;s job is to act as a mediator to help the sellers obtain the best prices from the dealers or to help them with the decision about whether to refuse the offer and to take the item to auction.

From 17 May 2010, &quot;The David Dickinson Show&quot;, a celebrity variety show, was broadcast on ITV for 10 episodes. In 2017, he presented &quot;David Dickinson&#x27;s Name Your Price&quot; for ITV.

==Catchphrases==
* &quot;Real bobby-dazzler&quot; (particularly excellent item). Dickinson&#x27;s biography is entitled &quot;What a Bobby Dazzler&quot;.
* &quot;Cheap as chips&quot; (bargain)
* &quot;See you, and don&#x27;t be late.&quot; or &quot;TTFN, that&#x27;s ta-ta for now.&quot; (Usually at the end of a programme.)
==Guest appearances==
In 2002, Dickinson appeared as a guest on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; joining Team B led by Ulrika Jonsson with Johnny Vegas.

In 2004, Dickinson was one of several celebrities to have their portraits painted in the BBC One television series &quot;Star Portraits with Rolf Harris&quot;, and, also in 2004, he appeared in the first series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.

In 2005, Dickinson appeared on the ITV reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, where he first announced that he had used heroin in his younger years. He also presented information slots for viewers on how to bid on satellite shopping channel Bid TV. He appeared in one episode of the ITV drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, playing an antiques dealer.

Dickinson explored his family background in an episode of the third series of the BBC genealogical documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; broadcast in the UK on 4 October 2006. He was able to trace relatives in both the UK and Istanbul.

On one radio episode of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, The Doctor (voiced by Jon Culshaw) telephoned Dickinson to ask him how much he could get for a magnetic core extractor that was believed to have been owned by the Doctor when he was played by Jon Pertwee. Dickinson described the extractor as &quot;a bit of a bobby dazzler&quot;.

In March 2014, Dickinson appeared in the eleventh series of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. The duo disguised themselves with prosthetics and fake accents to dupe Dickinson into believing there was a live argument and subsequent car crash on the set of his new &#x27;fake&#x27; show &quot;Long Lost Treasures&quot;. During the aftermath of the wind up and following the big reveal from Ant &amp; Dec, Dickinson said &quot;you two have done me up like a kipper!&quot;

He played the Emperor in the third episode of &quot;The Keith &amp; Paddy Picture Show&quot; (&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;).

<doc id="147513" wikidata="Q158021" url="?curid=147513" title="Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)">
<text>The Treaty of Frankfurt (; ) was a peace treaty signed in Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, at the end of the Franco-Prussian War.

== Summary ==

The treaty did the following:
* Established the frontier between the French Third Republic and the German Empire, which involved the ceding of 1,694 French villages and cities to Germany in:
** Alsace: the French departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, except for the city of Belfort and its territory;
** Lorraine: most of the French department of Moselle, one-third of the department of Meurthe, including the cities of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg, and the cantons Saales and Schirmeck in the department of Vosges. 
* Gave residents of the Alsace-Lorraine region until 1 October 1872 to decide between keeping their French nationality and emigrating, or remaining in the region and becoming German citizens.
* Set a framework for the withdrawal of German troops from certain areas.
* Regulated the payment of France&#x27;s war indemnity of five billion francs (due within five years).
* Recognized the acceptance of Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor.
* Required military occupation in parts of France until the indemnity was paid (France paid the indemnity quicker than the agreed time).

The treaty also established the terms for the following:

* The use of navigable waterways in connection to Alsace-Lorraine 
* Trade between the two countries
* The return of prisoners of war

== Factors that influenced the boundary ==
=== Strategy ===
The German military spoke up for control of the Alsace region, up to the Vosges (mountain range) and the area between Thionville (Diedenhofen) and Metz as a requirement for the protection of Germany. Most importantly, the German military regarded control of the route between Thionville and Metz as the most important area of control if there were ever to be a future war with France.

=== Politics ===
Without a westward shift in the boundary, the new empire&#x27;s frontier with France would have been largely divided between the states of Baden and Bavaria whose governments were less than enthusiastic with the prospect of having a vengeful France on their doorstep. It also would have necessitated the stationing of substantial imperial forces within these states&#x27; borders, possibly compromising their ability to exercise the considerable autonomy that the southern states were able to maintain in the unification treaty. A shift in the frontier alleviated these issues.

=== Nationalism ===
The new political border largely (though not entirely) followed the linguistic border. The fact that the majority of the population in the new Imperial Territory (&quot;Reichsland&quot;) territory spoke Germanic dialects, and had previously been a part of the German-focused Holy Roman Empire until they had been gradually obtained by France over the previous two centuries, allowed Berlin to justify the annexation on nationalistic grounds. However, the conquest of French-speaking areas such as the city of Metz sparked outrage in France, and was used as one of the main arguments for French revanchism.

=== Economy ===
Natural resources in Alsace-Lorraine (iron ore, and coal) do not appear to have played a role in Germany&#x27;s fight for the areas annexed. Military annexation was the main stated goal along with unification of the German people.
At the same time, France lost 1,447,000 hectares, 1,694 villages and 1,597,000 inhabitants. It also lost 20% of its mining and steel potential.
The treaty of trade of 1862 with Prussia was not renewed but France granted Germany, for trade and navigation, a most-favoured nation clause. France would respect the clauses of the Treaty of Frankfurt in their entirety until 1914.

France also had to pay a full payment of 5,000,000,000 francs in gold, with one billion in 1871, before any German forces withdrawal (which occurred in September 1873).

==Legacy==
This treaty polarized French policy towards Germany for the next 40 years. The reconquest of Alsace-Lorraine, the &quot;lost provinces,&quot; became an obsession characterized by a revanchism which would be one of the most powerful motives in France&#x27;s involvement in World War I.

In 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson advocates the transfer of the territories to France as Point 8 in his Fourteen Points speech. Thus going against the right of self-determination. Alsace-Lorraine returned to France under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The Germans did surrender under the terms of the American proposal.

<doc id="147515" wikidata="Q645499" url="?curid=147515" title="NASCAR Xfinity Series">
<text>The NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) is a stock car racing series organized by NASCAR. It is promoted as NASCAR&#x27;s second-tier circuit to the organization&#x27;s top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.

The series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it is sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.

==History==

The series emerged from NASCAR&#x27;s Sportsman division, which had been formed in 1950 as NASCAR&#x27;s short track race division. It was NASCAR&#x27;s fourth series (after the Modified and Roadster series in 1948 and Strictly Stock Series in 1949). The sportsman cars were not current model cars and could be modified more, but not as much as Modified series cars. It became the Late Model Sportsman Series in 1968, and soon featured races on larger tracks such as Daytona International Speedway. Drivers used obsolete Grand National cars on larger tracks but by the inception of the touring format in 1982, the series used older compact cars. Short track cars with relatively small 300 cubic inch V-8 motors were used. Drivers used smaller current year models featuring V6 motors.

The modern-day Xfinity Series was formed in 1982, when Anheuser-Busch sponsored a newly reformed late-model sportsman series with its Budweiser brand. In 1984, the series switched sponsorship to Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Busch Beer brand and was renamed the Busch Grand National Series.

&quot;Grand National&quot; was dropped from the series&#x27; title in 2003 as part of NASCAR&#x27;s brand identity (the &quot;Grand National&quot; name was later used for the Busch East and Winston West series as part of a nationwide standardization of rules for NASCAR&#x27;s regional racing; both series are now run under ARCA Menards Series banner after NASCAR purchased the organization in 2018). Anheuser-Busch dropped the sponsorship after the 2007 season; Nationwide Insurance took over the sponsorship for the 2008 season, renaming it the Nationwide Series. The Nationwide sponsorship was a seven-year contract, and did not include the banking and mortgage departments of Nationwide. The sponsorship reportedly carried a $10 million commitment for 2008, with 6% annual escalations thereafter.

On September 3, 2014, it was announced that Comcast would become the new title sponsor of the series via its cable television and internet brand Xfinity, renaming it the Xfinity Series. In 2016, NASCAR implemented a seven-race Chase system similar to the one used in the NASCAR Cup Series.

Xfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively. During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Races held outside the U.S.==
On March 6, 2005, the series held its first race outside the United States, the Telcel-Motorola 200. The race was held in Mexico City, Mexico at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, a track that has held Formula One and Champ Car races in the past. It was won by Martin Truex Jr. On August 4, 2007, the series held its second race outside the United States, at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, another road course. It was won by Kevin Harvick, while Quebec native Patrick Carpentier finished second. In July 2008, NASCAR announced that the Nationwide Series would not return to Mexico City in 2009, and in 2012 they announced that it would not be returning to Montreal in 2013. In 2025 the Xfinity Series will return to Mexico City.

==Tracks==



While the Xfinity Series races at nearly all the same tracks as the Cup Series, there are some stand-alone weekends in the Xfinity Series, with the only one being Portland in 2024.

==Playoffs==

In 2016, the NXS and Truck Series adopted a playoff format similar to the NASCAR Cup Series Chase for the Championship. Unlike the Cup Series, whose Chase consists of four rounds, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series both use a three-round format. After each of the first two rounds, the four Chase grid drivers with the fewest season points are eliminated from the grid and Chase contention.

:* Round of 12 (races 27–29)
:** Begins with 12 drivers who qualify for the Chase grid with 2,000 points, plus the bonus Playoffs&#x27; points acquired in regular season.
:* Round of 8 (races 30–32)
:** Begins with eight drivers, each with 3,000 points
:* Championship 4 (final race)
:** The last four drivers in contention for the season title will have their points reset to 4,000 points, with the highest finisher in the race winning the NXS title.

==Television broadcasting==

===United States===
In the 1980s, races were sparsely shown, mainly by ESPN if they were covering the cup race at the same track. Starting in 1990, more races began to be shown. By the mid-1990s, all races were shown. Most standalone races were aired on TNN, which helped grow coverage of the series, while races that were companion races with Winston Cup dates mostly aired on the network airing the Cup race. TNN aired some of these races, which also aired on CBS, NBC, ESPN, ABC and TBS.

From 2001 until 2006, Fox Sports covered the entire first half of the Busch Grand National season, while NBC and TNT both aired races during the second half, with Turner Sports producing all the coverage for both networks. However, in even numbered years, coverage was changed, with the opening race at Daytona airing on NBC in 2004, on TNT in 2002 and 2006 (due to NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Winter Olympics) and the track&#x27;s July race airing on FX. Large portions of Fox&#x27;s coverage aired on sister network FX, with a few marquee events on the network itself.

From 2007 until 2014, ESPN was the home of the renamed Nationwide Series. Generally four races per season aired on ABC, with the remainder on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNews. Early in ESPN&#x27;s run, ESPN Classic was used for NNS overflow, however with less carriage of that network, this practice ended. Fox Sports made a return to the series, airing the 2011 Bubba Burger 250 at Richmond on Speed Channel, as ESPN gave up its exclusive rights to the race because of programming conflicts.

In 2015, the NXS returned to Fox Sports during the first half of the season. Like the previous time Fox held rights to the series, most of the coverage aired on cable, though this time on FS1. Four races aired on Fox itself until 2019, when all races moved to FS1. The second half of the NXS season is televised by NBC Sports. Four to five races air on NBC itself, while the others air on NBCSN (until 2020) or, during the Olympics, CNBC or USA Network (prior to 2020). Since 2021, USA Network had carried all races not aired on NBC or Fox Sports.

On July 28, 2023, it was announced the Xfinity Series will move exclusively to The CW in 2025 as part of a seven-year deal. It was then announced on April 11, 2024, that the move would begin a year early to broadcast the final eight races of the 2024 season.

===Latin America===
The NXS is available in most Latin American countries on cable and satellite TV. Since 2006, Fox Sports 3 (formerly called SPEED until 2013) carries live coverage of all events. The races are also shown on Fox Sports Latin America, some of them live and some tape-delayed depending on the network&#x27;s schedule. Televisa Deportes also broadcast a 30-minute recap every Sunday morning on national television in Mexico. In Brazil, BandSports carries all three series.

===Australia===
Network Ten&#x27;s additional high-definition service, ONE, began broadcasting races from the NXS live or near live during the 2008 season. ONE continued to air highlights packages of each race until the end of 2014. Broadcasts of the series are now exclusively shown on the Fox Sports pay TV channels.

===Canada===
All races are live on TSN channels using FOX&#x27;s or NBC&#x27;s coverage. Also, races are broadcast on RDS or RDS2 in French using the world feed produced by NASCAR.

===Europe===
In 2012, Motors TV broadcasts all Xfinity races live, delayed and highlights, until 2018 when the channel ceased operations.

In Portugal, SPORT TV broadcasts every Xfinity races live.

In the United Kingdom, the Xfinity races—in full and highlights—are available on Premier Sports 2.

===Asia===
All races are live on Sports Illustrated Television channels using FOX&#x27;s or NBC&#x27;s coverage with highlights on Fox Sports Asia.

==Cup Series drivers in the Xfinity Series==

Since the early days of the Xfinity Series, many NASCAR Cup Series drivers have used their days off to drive in the NXS. This can be for any number of reasons, most prominent or often claimed is to gain more &quot;seat time&quot;, or to familiarize themselves with the track. Examples of this would be Dale Earnhardt, who won the very first NXS race, and Kyle Busch, who has won the most races in NXS history.

In recent years, this practice had been dubbed &quot;Buschwhacking&quot; by its detractors. The colloquialism originated when Anheuser-Busch was the main sponsor of the series by combining the name &quot;Busch&quot; with the term &quot;bushwhacker,&quot; but it has gradually fallen out of use since Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s sponsorship ended. Other nicknames, such as Claim Jumper (for when Nationwide was the series sponsor), and Signal Pirate (for the current sponsor Xfinity) have never really caught on, although the generic term &quot;Cup leech&quot; is often used after the end of Busch sponsorship.

Critics claim that NASCAR Cup Series drivers racing in the NXS take away opportunities from the NXS regulars, usually younger and less experienced drivers. On the other hand, many fans claim that without the NASCAR Cup Series stars and the large amount of fan interest they attract on their own races, the NXS would be inadequate as a high-tier division. In addition, many NXS drivers have welcomed the Cup drivers because it gives them the opportunity to drive with more seasoned veterans.

In 2007, the NASCAR Cup Series began racing with the Car of Tomorrow, a radically new specification different from the NXS. NASCAR Cup Series drivers have admitted that driving the Xfinity car the day before the race does little to help with the NASCAR Cup Series race, as the cars differ greatly. This loosely resulted in the new Nationwide Series car making its debut in the 2010 Subway Jalapeño 250 at Daytona International Speedway. This car has a set-up closer to the current Cup car and some Cup drivers who have tested the car say it has similar handling characteristics. The new car has gone full-time since the 2011 season. In 2007, six out of the top ten drivers in the final point standings were Cup regulars, with Jason Leffler being the only non-Cup driver in that group to win a race in 2007. This number decreased from 2006 when 8 out of 10 drivers were Cup regulars. The decreased number is attributed to Cup regulars running only partial schedules, allowing for more NXS regulars to reach the top ten in points. However, the champions from 2006 to 2010 were all Cup regulars driving the full series schedule (Kevin Harvick, Carl Edwards, Clint Bowyer, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski). As a result, beginning with the 2011 season, NASCAR implemented a rule stating that drivers could only compete for the drivers&#x27; championship in one of three national series (Cup, Xfinity, and Truck) of the drivers&#x27; choosing.

On October 26, 2016, NASCAR announced plans to limit Cup participation in the lower series starting in 2017. Cup drivers who were competing for points in the Cup Series with at least five years of experience in the series would be allowed to compete in up to 10 NXS races, but are banned from racing in the series&#x27; regular season finale, Chase, and Dash 4 Cash races.

==Xfinity Series cars==

In the early 1980s, teams were switching from the General Motors 1971–77 X-Body compact cars with 311-cubic inch engines. Later, teams were using General Motors 1982–87 G-body cars. Ford teams have used the Thunderbird cars consistently.

In 1989, NASCAR changed rules requiring cars to use current body styles, similar to the Cup cars. However, the cars still used V6 engines. The cars gradually became similar to Cup cars.

In 1995, changes were made. The series switched to V-8s with a compression ratio of 9:1 (as opposed to 14:1 for Cup at the time). The vehicle weight with driver was set at 3,300 pounds (as opposed to 3,400 for Cup). The body style changes, as well as the introduction of V-8s, made the two series&#x27; cars increasingly similar.

The suspensions, brake systems, transmissions, were identical between the two series, but The Car of Tomorrow eliminates some of these commonalities. The Car of Tomorrow is taller and wider than the Generation 4-based vehicles in the then-Nationwide Series, and until 2010, it utilizes a front &quot;splitter&quot;, opposed to a front valance. The Car of Tomorrow also set pole speeds slower than the NXS cars at companion races.

Previously, Busch Series cars used fuel that contained lead. NASCAR conducted a three-race test of unleaded gasoline in this series that began on July 29, 2006, with a race at Gateway International Raceway. The fuel, Sunoco GT 260 Unleaded, became mandatory in all series starting with the second weekend of the 2007 series, with Daytona being the last race weekend using leaded gasoline.

Another distinction between the cars started in 2008: Goodyear had developed a rain tire for NASCAR road course racing in both series but NASCAR had yet to use them under race conditions by the time NASCAR abandoned the program for the Cup Series in 2005 (the Cup Series eventually used rain tires at the 2020 Bank of America Roval 400 and 2021 Texas Grand Prix), but the Busch Series continued to use rain tires in races at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, since the races could not be planned with rain dates. When rain started to fall at the 2008 NAPA Auto Parts 200, the tires were used in the rain for the first time.

Another distinction was added in 2012, when NASCAR changed the fuel delivery system in the Cup cars from carburetion to fuel injection. NXS cars continue to use carburetors. Furthermore, with the Cup Series&#x27; switch to Next Gen car in 2022, Xfinity cars (as well as Truck Series vehicles) continue to use traditional five-lug steel wheels and centered door numbers, as opposed to an aluminum center lock wheel and numbers being placed behind the front wheel on the Next Gen.

===Xfinity &quot;Car of Tomorrow&quot; (CoT)=== 

The then Nationwide Series unveiled its &quot;Car of Tomorrow&quot; (CoT) at the July 2010 race at Daytona International Speedway. Before being fully integrated in the 2011 season, it was also used in 2010 races at Michigan International Speedway, Richmond International Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway. The Xfinity CoT has important differences from the NASCAR Cup Series CoT, and the now-retired Generation 4 style car. The body and aerodynamic package differs from the NASCAR Cup Series cars, marketing American pony cars from the 1960s such as the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger, and Chevrolet Camaro. The change to share the same CoT chassis as the Cup series resulted in the wheelbase being lengthened from 105 to 110 inches

Each manufacturer uses a distinct body design (similar to 1960s muscle cars), built within strict aerodynamic guidelines provided by NASCAR. The Chevrolet car body currently resembles the SS, after initially running the Impala and then the Zeta-based Camaro (which coincided with GM&#x27;s Cup car being its four-door Zeta counterpart, the Holden VF Commodore based Chevrolet SS, being used in Cup at the time). Ford uses the Mustang Dark Horse. Toyota runs the Camry, reconfigured in 2015 to resemble the current production model. Toyota announced they would be running the GR Supra starting in 2019, replacing the Camry, which had been run in the series since Toyota joined the Xfinity Series in 2007. Dodge teams used the Challenger R/T model, despite the manufacturer pulling all factory support after 2012 (though it continued in Canada as FCA Canada still supports the Pinty&#x27;s Series). Following Dodge&#x27;s exit, smaller underfunded teams continued to run second-hand Challenger chassis without factory support (thus earning the nickname &quot;Zombie Dodges&quot;). As a result of a rules change after the 2018 season, all Challenger chassis were rendered ineligible for competition, as the series made the switch to composite body panels. Since FCA had pulled factory support years earlier, no new body was submitted for competition, ending the possibility of running a Challenger chassis in the series.

<text>A ladder is a vertical or inclined set of rungs or steps commonly used for climbing or descending. There are two types: rigid ladders that are self-supporting or that may be leaned against a vertical surface such as a wall, and rollable ladders, such as those made of rope or aluminium, that may be hung from the top. The vertical members of a rigid ladder are called stringers or rails (US) or stiles (UK). Rigid ladders are usually portable, but some types are permanently fixed to a structure, building, or equipment. They are commonly made of metal, wood, or fiberglass, but they have been known to be made of tough plastic.

==Historical usages==
Ladders are ancient tools and technology. A ladder is featured in a Mesolithic rock painting that is at least 10,000 years old, depicted in the Spider Caves in Valencia, Spain. The painting depicts two humans using a ladder to reach a wild honeybee nest to harvest honey. The ladder is depicted as long and flexible, possibly made out of some sort of grass.

==Variations==
===Rigid ladders===

Rigid ladders are available in many forms, such as:

* Accommodation ladder, portable steps down the side of a ship for boarding.
* Assault ladder, used in siege warfare to assist in climbing walls and crossing moats.
* Attic ladder, pulled down from the ceiling to allow access to an attic or loft.
* , a ladder laid horizontally to act as a passage between two points separated by a drop.
* Boarding ladder, a ladder used to climb onto a vehicle. May be rigid or flexible, also boarding step(s), and swim ladder.
* Cat ladder (US chicken ladder), a lightweight ladder frame used on steep roofs to prevent workers from sliding.
* Chicken ladder, a ladder comprising a single central stile with each rung projecting on either side and used by chickens to climb into a coop.
* Christmas tree ladder, a type of boarding ladder for divers which has a single central rail and is open at the sides to allow the diver to climb the ladder while wearing swimfins.
* , a fixed ladder with a lower sliding part. A system of counterweights is used to let the lower sliding part descend gently when released.
* Extension ladder or &quot;telescopic ladder&quot;, a fixed ladder divided into two or more lengths for more convenient storage; the lengths can be slid together for storage or slid apart to expand the length of the ladder; a pulley system may be fitted so that the ladder can be easily extended by an operator on the ground then locked in place using the dogs and pawls. 65 ft (20 m), 50 ft (15 m) and some 35 ft (10 m) extension ladders for fire service use &quot;bangor poles&quot;, &quot;tormentor poles&quot; or &quot;stay poles&quot; to help raise, pivot, steady, extend, place, retract and lower them due to the heavy weight. 
* Fixed ladder, two side members joined by several rungs; affixed to structure with no moving parts.
* , a ladder in the step ladder style with one or more (usually no more than three) one-way hinges. Ideal for use on uneven ground (e.g. stairs), as a trestle or when fully extended a Fixed ladder. Some variations feature a central one-way hinge with extensible locking legs.
* Hook ladder or pompier ladder, a rigid ladder with a hook at the top to grip a windowsill; used by firefighters.
* Mobile Safety Steps are self-supporting structures that have wheels or castors making them easy to move. They sometimes have a small upper platform and a hand rail to assist in moving up and down the steps.
* Orchard ladder, a three legged step ladder with the third leg made so that it can be inserted between tree branches for fruit picking.
* , a step ladder with a large platform area and a top handrail for the user to hold while working on the platform.
* , a ladder that looks like a drainpipe but can be deployed instantly when required.
* Roof ladder, a rigid ladder with a large hook at the top to grip the ridge of a pitched roof.
* , also known as a builder&#x27;s ladder, has sections that come apart and are interchangeable so that any number of sections can be connected.
* Step ladder, a self-supporting portable ladder hinged in the middle to form an inverted V, with stays to keep the two halves at a fixed angle. Step ladders have flat steps and a hinged back.
* Swim ladder, a ladder used by swimmers to get out of the water, often on boats.
* , commonly used to refer to a hybrid between a step ladder and an extension ladder with 360-degree hinges; has three parts and can be taken apart to form two step ladders; e.g. Little Giant.
* , an &quot;A-Frame&quot;-style ladder with a telescoping center section.
* Turntable ladder, an extension ladder fitted to rotating platform on top of a fire truck.
* Vertically rising ladder, designed to climb high points and facilitate suspending at said high points.
* X-deck ladder, a US patented ladder design that is a combination ladder and scaffold.
Rigid ladders were originally made of wood, but in the 20th century aluminium became more common because of its lighter weight. Ladders with fiberglass stiles are used for working on or near overhead electrical wires, because fiberglass is an electrical insulator. Henry Quackenbush patented the extension ladder in 1867.

===Flexible ladders===

*Rope ladders or Jacob&#x27;s ladders are used where storage space is extremely limited, weight must be kept to a minimum, or in instances where the object to be climbed is too curved to use a rigid ladder. They may have rigid or flexible rungs. Climbing a rope ladder requires more skill than climbing a rigid ladder, because the ladder tends to swing like a pendulum. Jacob&#x27;s ladders used on a ship are used mostly for emergencies or for temporary access to the side of a ship. Steel and aluminum wire ladders are sometimes used in vertical caving, having developed from rope ladders with wooden rungs. Flexible ladders are also sometimes used as swim ladders on boats.

==Uses==
*Dissipative ladders are portable ladders built to ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) standard. Electrostatic Discharge is a natural occurrence in which electricity is passed through the body, or other conductors, and discharges onto some object. For example, the shock sometimes felt when a doorknob is touched is an ESD. This natural occurrence is a very important topic in the field of electronics assembly due to the costly damage ESDs can cause to sensitive electronic equipment. Dissipative ladders are ladders with controlled electrical resistance: the resistance slows the transfer of charge from one point to another, offering increased protection during ESD events: ≥105 and &lt; 1012 Ω / square.
*Boarding and pool ladders, also swim ladders and dive ladders. A ladder may be used on the side or stern of a boat, to climb into it from the water, and in a swimming pool, to climb out and sometimes in. Swimming pool ladders are usually made from plastic, wood or metal steps with a textured upper surface for grip and metal rails at the sides to support the steps and as handrails for the user, and are usually fixed in place. Boarding ladders for boats may be fixed, but are usually portable, and often fold away when not in use to avoid drag when under way. Boarding ladders may also be used for other types of vehicle, or boarding steps which are supported directly by the vehicle structure.
*Assault ladders

==Safety==


The most common injury made by ladder climbers is bruising from falling off a ladder, but bone fractures are common and head injuries are also likely, depending on the nature of the accident. Ladders can cause injury if they slip on the ground and fall. To avoid this, they tend to have plastic feet or base pads which increase friction with the ground. However, if the plastic is badly worn, the aluminium may contact the ground increasing the chance of an accident. Ladder stabilizers are also available to increase the ladder&#x27;s grip on the ground. One of the first ladder stabilizers or ladder feet was offered in 1936 and today they are standard equipment on most large ladders.

A ladder standoff, or stay, is a device fitted to the top of a ladder to hold it away from the wall. This enables the ladder to clear overhanging obstacles, such as the eaves of a roof, and increases the safe working height for a given length of ladder because of the increased separation distance of the two contact points at the top of the ladder.

It has become increasingly common to provide anchor points on buildings to which the top rung of an extension ladder can be attached, especially for activities like window cleaning, especially if a fellow worker is not available for &quot;footing&quot; the ladder. Footing occurs when another worker stands on the lowest rung and so provides much greater stability to the ladder when being used. However footing a ladder should be seen as a last resort for a safe placement. The anchor point is usually a ring cemented into a slot in the brick wall to which the rungs of a ladder can be attached using rope for example, or a carabiner.

If a leaning ladder is placed at the wrong angle, the risk of a fall is greatly increased. The safest angle for a ladder is 75.5°; if it is too shallow, the bottom of the ladder is at risk of sliding, and if it is too steep, the ladder may fall backwards. This angle is achieved by following the 4 to 1 rule for a ladder placed on a vertical wall: for every four feet of vertical height, the ladder foot should move one foot from the wall. Both scenarios can cause significant injury, and are especially important in industries like construction, which require heavy use of ladders.

==Ladder classes==
The European Union and the United Kingdom established a ladder certification system – ladder classes – for any ladders manufactured or sold in Europe. The certification classes apply solely to ladders that are portable such as stepladders and extension ladders and are broken down into three types of certification. Each ladder certification is colour-coded to indicate the amount of weight the ladder is designed to hold, the certification class and its use. The color of the safety label specifies the class and use.
* Class 1 ladder – for heavy-duty industrial uses, maximum load of 175 kg. Colour-coded blue to identify.
* Class EN131 ladders – for commercial uses, maximum load of 150 kg. No specific colour code..
* Class III ladders – for light, domestic uses, maximum load of 125 kg. Colour-coded red to identify.

== Society and culture ==
A common superstition in English-speaking countries is that walking under a ladder is seen as bad luck. Some sources claim that this stems from the image of a ladder being propped up against a wall looking similar to a gallows, while others attribute it to ancient Egyptian traditions involving pyramids and triangles representing the trinity of the gods, and passing through the triangular shape made by a ladder against a wall was seen as desecration. Ladders have also been linked to the crucifixion of Christ, with author and scientist Charles Panati noting that many believe a ladder rested against the cross that Christ hung from, making it a symbol of wickedness, betrayal and death. In comedic children&#x27;s media, the image of a character walking under a ladder being the cause or result of bad luck has become a common trope.

<text>Ammerland is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the city of Oldenburg and the districts of Oldenburg, Cloppenburg, Leer, Friesland and Wesermarsch.

== History ==
The &quot;Ammerland&quot; was first mentioned in the 10th century. The word is believed to derive from &quot;Ameri&quot;, which is an old word meaning &quot;swamp&quot;. In the time of Viking raids small ring-like castles were built in order to protect the defenceless hamlets.

For many years there was little interest in this swampy region. In the 14th century it became part of the County of Oldenburg. The counts established strongholds in the region, which was the frontier against the lands of the untamable Frisians.

The district was established in 1933 in the rough borders of the historical region.

== Geography ==
Ammerland is characterised by a very flat countryside, many fens and swamps, and many windmills. The latter are a symbol of the district, which calls itself sometimes the &quot;land of windmills&quot;.

The central point of the district is the Zwischenahner Meer located near the resort town of Bad Zwischenahn, a lake with an area of 5.5 km2 (&quot;Meer&quot; is the German word for &quot;sea&quot;, but in the local Low German, as in Dutch, it means mere (lake), pond).

==Coat-of-arms==

The coat-of-arms displays:
* top left: the red stripes from the arms of the counts of Oldenburg
* top right: the golden cross of the County of Bentinck (1733-1818 in Varel; Wiefelstede was a part of this county)
* bottom left: the acorn symbolising the common oaks of the Ammerland
* bottom right: the red zigzag lines are an ancient symbol of the Ammerland

Its blazon is: &quot;Quarterly Or and Azure, I: two bars Gules; II: a Greek cross Or; III: an oak stem with leaf and acorn Or; IV: two bars dancetty Gules&quot;.

<text>The Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope (BRI) is a not-for-profit medical research facility located at and partnering with the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, United States. It is dedicated to studying normal and abnormal biological processes which may be related to cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Both basic and clinical research are carried out in cooperation with the City of Hope National Medical Center. The institute itself is organized into more than 20 departments and divisions. As of 2021, the director is Steven T. Rosen. The Beckman Research Institute also hosts the Irell &amp; Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences whose founding dean was Arthur Riggs.

==History==
City of Hope was founded by the Jewish Consumptive Relief Association as a tuberculosis sanatorium, the Los Angeles Sanatorium, in 1913. As tuberculosis was increasingly controlled by use of antibiotics, executive director Samuel H. Golter proposed that the institution expand to become a national medical center studying other diseases. City of Hope&#x27;s Cancer Research Institute was dedicated in 1952. Since then, the research scope has continued to expand, with cancer and diabetes as major foci, as well as other life-threatening diseases. In 1983, a major challenge grant of $10 million from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation enabled the research division of the City of Hope to undergo significant expansion and officially create the Beckman Research Institute. Funds were available for buildings, equipment, and endowment, but had to support research and the advancement of knowledge related to the &quot;causes, prevention, and cure of human disease&quot;. The Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope was the first of five Beckman research institutes to receive funding in the United States.

===Directors===
* Joseph T. Holden (1983–1993)
* John Steven Kovach (1993–2000)
* Arthur Riggs (2000–2007)
* Richard Jove (2008–2012)
* David Horne, (2012–2014, interim director)
* Steven T. Rosen (2014–)

== Research contributions ==

Research and treatment are closely coordinated between the City of Hope National Medical Center and the Beckman Research Institute. As of 2019, over 300 clinical trials were being conducted at any one time, and at least one-third of eligible patients were enrolled in clinical trials. A number of significant achievements have been reported by researchers affiliated with the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope. These include:

===Diabetes===

Researchers associated with the Beckman Research Institute are credited with starting the biotechnology industry. Keiichi Itakura and Arthur Riggs, with Genentech scientist Herbert Boyer, were the first to develop human recombinant gene products. Their techniques were used to successfully create synthetic somatostatin in &quot;E. coli&quot;, the first expression of a human protein in bacteria, in 1977. The techniques and tools of genetic synthesis were standardizable and applicable to many similar problems. The group successfully reported the expression of human insulin in bacteria by 1978.

Barry Forman identified the first new steroid-like hormone in 30 years, androstanol, a hormone with a different mechanism of action from others, that may be useful in treatment of diabetes.

Fouad Kandeel leads clinical trials testing the use of islet transplantation to treat patients who are incapacitated by severe type 1 diabetes.

Bart Roep leads immune intervention strategies (including gene therapy, stem cell therapy and bone marrow transportation) with the ultimate goal to cure type 1 diabetes.

===Cancer===
Arthur Riggs went on to work with Shmuel Cabilly on &quot;fundamental technology required for the artificial synthesis of antibody molecules&quot;, since used to create &quot;smart&quot; cancer drugs. Riggs has been associated with the institute in several ways, including as director of the Beckman Research Institute from 2000 to 2007, now director emeritus.

Gerd Pfeifer was able to prove a definitive link between smoking and lung cancer, by demonstrating genetic damage in lung cells, caused by a chemical in cigarette smoke.

The Beckman Research Institute has partnered with the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation in the Health of Women Study (HOW), a long-term cohort study tracking the health of women via online and mobile platforms. It will study both women who have and who do not have breast cancer. The Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation hopes to recruit one million women volunteers to become part of its participating &quot;Army of Women&quot;.

Hua Eleanor Yu and her group are studying the involvement of STAT3 with cancer cells and the immune system, and developing possible drug treatments to attack tumor cells.

===HIV/AIDS===
John Rossi has worked on treatments for AIDS-related lymphoma, pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. He was the first researcher to use RNA to block the progress of the virus that causes HIV/AIDS by degrading the HIV virus within infected cells. He is involved in ongoing work with David DiGiusto and others to develop disease-resistant immune systems by transplanting gene-modified HIV-1-resistant stem and progenitor cells. With John Zaia and others, Rossi has worked on Lentiviral vectors for delivering RNA-based gene therapy. This approach combines stem cell and gene therapy to deliver RNA molecules that can block the genes that the HIV/AIDS virus uses to infect immune cells. John Zaia is also investigating the possibility that cancer chemotherapy can perturb reservoirs of HIV, which has relevance to therapeutic interventions to cure HIV.

==Recognition==

, CharityWatch rated the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope as an &quot;A−&quot; grade charity.

<text>Yue () is a branch of the Sinitic languages primarily spoken in Southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi (collectively known as Liangguang).

The term Cantonese is often used to refer to the whole branch, but linguists prefer to reserve the name Cantonese for the variety used in Guangzhou (Canton), Wuzhou (Ngchow), Hong Kong and Macau, which is the prestige dialect of the group. Taishanese, from the coastal area of Jiangmen (Kongmoon) located southwest of Guangzhou, was the language of most of the 19th-century emigrants from Guangdong to Southeast Asia and North America. Most later migrants have been speakers of Cantonese.

Yue languages are not mutually intelligible with each other or with other Chinese languages outside the branch. They are among the most conservative varieties with regard to the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, but have lost several distinctions in the initial consonants and medial glides that other Chinese varieties have retained.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Cantonese&quot; is prototypically used in English to refer to the variety of Yue in Guangzhou, but it is also to refer to Yue as a whole. To avoid confusion, academic texts may refer to the larger branch as &quot;Yue&quot;, following the pinyin system based on Standard Chinese, and either restrict &quot;Cantonese&quot; to the Guangzhou variety, or avoid the term altogether, distinguishing Yue from its Guangzhou dialect.

People from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Cantonese immigrants abroad, generally refer to their language as . In Guangdong and Guangxi, people also use the terms and (plain/colloquial speech); for example, the expression means &#x27;Nanning colloquial speech&#x27;.

==History==
The area of China south of the Nanling Mountains, known as the Lingnan (roughly modern Guangxi and Guangdong), was originally home to peoples known to the Chinese as the Hundred Yue (or &quot;Baiyue&quot;). Large-scale Han Chinese migration to the area began after the Qin conquest of the region in 214 BC. Successive waves of immigration followed at times of upheaval in Northern and Central China, such as the collapse of the Han, Tang and Song dynasties. The most popular route was via the Xiang River, which the Qin had connected to the Li River by the Lingqu Canal, and then into the valley of the Xi Jiang. A secondary route followed the Gan River and then the Bei Jiang into eastern Guangdong. Yue-speakers were later joined by Hakka speakers following the North River route, and Min speakers arriving by sea.

After the fall of Qin, the Lingnan area was part of the independent state of Nanyue for about a century, before being incorporated into the Han empire in 111 BC. After the Tang dynasty collapsed, much of the area became part of the state of Southern Han, one of the longest-lived states of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, between 917 and 971.

Large waves of Chinese migration throughout succeeding Chinese dynasties assimilated huge numbers of Yue aborigines, with the result that today&#x27;s Southern Han Chinese Yue-speaking population is descended from both groups. The colloquial layers of Yue varieties contain elements influenced by the Tai languages formerly spoken widely in the area and still spoken by people such as the Zhuang and Dong.

===Rise of Cantonese===
The port city of Guangzhou lies in the middle of Pearl River Delta, with access to the interior via the Xi, Bei, and Dong rivers, which all converge at the delta. It has been the economic centre of the Lingnan region since Qin times, when it was an important shipbuilding centre. By 660, it was the largest port in China, part of a trade network stretching as far as Arabia. During the Southern Song, it also became the cultural centre of the region. Like many other Chinese varieties it developed a distinct literary layer associated with the local tradition of reading the classics. The Guangzhou dialect (Cantonese) was used in the popular &quot;Yuèōu&quot;, &quot;Mùyú&quot; and &quot;Nányīn&quot; folksong genres, as well as Cantonese opera.
There was also a small amount of vernacular literature, written with Chinese characters extended with a number of non-traditional characters for Cantonese words.

Guangzhou became the centre of rapidly expanding foreign trade after the maritime ban was lifted, with the British East India Company establishing a chamber of commerce in the city in 1715.
The ancestors of most of the Han Chinese population of Hong Kong came from Guangzhou after the territory was ceded to Britain in 1842. As a result, Hong Kong Cantonese, the most widely spoken language in Hong Kong and Macau, is an offshoot of the Guangzhou dialect. The popularity of Cantonese-language media, Cantopop and the Cinema of Hong Kong has since led to substantial exposure of Cantonese to China and the rest of Asia. On the mainland, the national policy is to promote Standard Chinese, which is also the medium of instruction in schools. The place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious. In 2010, a controversial proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou local television from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following widespread backlash accompanied by public protests.

== Geographic distribution ==
Yue languages are spoken in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, an area long dominated culturally and economically by the city of Guangzhou at the delta of the Pearl River. Cantonese, also spoken in Hong Kong and Macau, is the prestige variety of Yue.

The influence of Guangzhou has spread westward along the Pearl River system, so that, for example, the speech of the city of Wuzhou some upstream in Guangxi is much more similar to that of Guangzhou than dialects of coastal districts that are closer but separated from the city by hilly terrain. One of these coastal languages, Taishanese, is the most common Yue variety among overseas communities. Yue varieties are not totally mutually intelligible with one another.

Yue Chinese is the most widely spoken local language in Guangdong. Its native speakers constitute around a half (47%) of its population. The other half is equally divided between Hakka and Min languages, mostly Teochew, but also Haklau and Leizhounese.

Yue is also the most widespread Sinitic language in Guangxi, spoken by slightly more than a half of its Han population. The other half is almost equally divided between the Southwestern Mandarin, Hakka, and Pinghua; there is also a considerable Xiang-speaking population and a small Hokkien-speaking minority. Yue Chinese is spoken by 35% of the total population of Guangxi, being one of the two largest languages in that province, along with Zhuang.

In China, as of 2004, 60% of all Yue speakers lived in Guangdong, 28.3% lived in Guangxi, and 11.6% lived in Hong Kong.

==Varieties==
===Classification===

In Yuan Jiahua&#x27;s 1962 dialect manual, Yue dialects were divided into five groups:
* Yuehai, covering the Pearl River Delta and Xi River valley.
* Seiyap (&#x27;four counties&#x27;), in the coastal prefecture of Jiangmen to the southwest of Guangzhou.
* Gao–Lei, in southwestern Guangdong.
* Hamlim in southern Guangxi.
* Guinan, in southwestern Guangxi.

In the &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot;, some varieties spoken in western Guangxi formerly classified as Yue are placed in a separate Pinghua group.
The remaining Yue dialects are divided into seven groups.
Three groups are found in the watershed of the Pearl River:

* Guangfu () includes Cantonese proper, spoken in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the dialects of surrounding areas in the Pearl River Delta such as Zhongshan, Foshan, Dongguan, Zhuhai and Shenzhen, and in southern parts of the inland prefectures of Zhaoqing and Qingyuan and in parts of Guangxi such as the city of Wuzhou. Almost a half of all Yue speakers speak Guangfu dialects natively.
* Ngau–Lau dialects are spoken in inland areas of western Guangdong and eastern Guangxi, and include the dialect of Yulin (Bobai). Ngau–Lau is spoken by 17% of all Yue speakers, with two-thirds of them living in Guangxi and one-third in Guangdong.
* Yuhng–Cham is spoken mainly in the Yong–Yu–Xun valley in Guangxi, including the provincial capital Nanning. It is spoken by around 7% of Yue speakers.

The remaining four groups are found in coastal areas:

* Sze-yap or Siyi dialects are spoken in the coastal prefecture of Jiangmen to the southwest of Guangzhou. They include the Taishan variety, also known as Taishanese, which was ubiquitous in American Chinatowns before the 1970s. Sze-yap dialects are spoken by 6.5% of total Yue speakers.
* Gao–Yang dialects are spoken in areas of southwestern Guangdong such as Yangjiang and Lianjiang. They cover around 11% of all Yue Chinese speakers.
* Wu–Hua is spoken mainly in western Guangdong around Wuchuan and Huazhou. Native speakers of this variety constitute only 2.1% of all Yue speakers.
* Qin–Lian dialects are spoken in the southern Guangxi areas of Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangcheng. They are spoken by 6.5% of all Yue speakers.

Anne Yue-Hashimoto has proposed an alternative classification based on a wider sampling of features:
* Pearl River Delta
** Northern
*** Sanyi–Zhaoqing: dialects of Foshan and southeast Zhaoqing
*** Interior: western part of the Pearl River catchment, including the &quot;Atlas&quot;&#x27;s Gou–Lou and southern Pinghua dialects.
** Guangfu
*** Core: Cantonese proper (Guangzhou, Hong Kong Cantonese)
*** Interior: Gao–Yang dialects of Maoming and the Yong–Xun dialects of Nanning and Guiping.
** Southern
*** Zhongshan, including Shiqi dialect
*** Guan–Lian: dialects of the east delta region (Dongguan and the New Territories) as well as the coastal Guangxi dialects classified as Qin–Lian in the &quot;Atlas&quot;.
*** Interior: Huazhou, Wuchuan, Yulin
* Wuyi–Liangyang
** Wuyi
*** Xin–En: Xinhui, Taishan, Enping and the neighbouring Doumen District.
*** Kai-He: Kaiping and Heshan.
** Liangyang: Yangjiang and Yangchun (the eastern part of the &quot;Atlas&quot;&#x27;s Gao–Yang area)

The Dapeng dialect is a variety displaying features of both Cantonese and Hakka, spoken by 3,000–5,500 people in Dapeng, Shenzhen.

===Cantonese===
The Guangzhou (Canton) dialect of &quot;Yuehai&quot;, usually called &quot;Cantonese&quot;, is the prestige dialect of Guangdong province and social standard of Yue. It is the most widely spoken dialect of Yue and is an official language of Hong Kong and of Macau, alongside English and Portuguese respectively. It is the lingua franca of not only Guangdong, but also many overseas Cantonese emigrants, though in many areas abroad it is numerically second to the Taishanese dialect of Yue.

By law, Standard Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, is taught nearly universally as a supplement to local languages such as Cantonese. In Guangzhou, much of the distinctively Yue vocabulary have been replaced with Cantonese pronunciations of corresponding Standard Chinese terms.

Cantonese is the de facto official language of Hong Kong (along with English) and Macau (along with Portuguese), though legally the official language is just &quot;Chinese&quot;.
It is the oral language of instruction in Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Macau, and is used extensively in Cantonese-speaking households. Cantonese-language media (Hong Kong films, television serials, and Cantopop), which exist in isolation from the other regions of China, local identity, and the non-Mandarin speaking Cantonese diaspora in Hong Kong and abroad give the language a unique identity. Colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese often incorporates English words due to historical British influences.

Most &quot;wuxia&quot; films from Canton are filmed originally in Cantonese and then dubbed or subtitled in Mandarin, English, or both.

===Taishanese===
When the Chinese government removed the prohibition on emigration in the mid-19th century, many people from rural areas in the coastal regions of Fujian and Guangdong emigrated to Southeast Asia and North America. Until the late 20th century, the vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America came from the Siyi (&#x27;four counties&#x27;) to the southwest of Guangzhou.
The speech of this region, particularly the Taishan dialect, is thus the most common Yue variety in these areas.
It is only partially understood by speakers of Cantonese.

==Phonology==

Yue varieties are among the most conservative of Chinese varieties regarding the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, so that the rhymes of Tang poetry are clearer in Yue dialects than elsewhere. However they have lost several distinctions in the initial consonants and medial vowels that other Chinese varieties have retained.

===Initials and medials===
In addition to aspirated and unaspirated voiceless initials, Middle Chinese had a series of voiced initials, but voicing has been lost in Yue and most other modern Chinese varieties apart from Wu and Old Xiang.
In the Guangfu, Siyi and Gao–Yang subgroups, these initials have yielded aspirated consonants in the level and rising tones, and unaspirated consonants in the departing and entering tones.
These initials are uniformly unaspirated in Gou–Lou varieties and uniformly aspirated in Wu–Hua.

In many Yue varieties, including Cantonese, Middle Chinese has become or in most words; in Taishanese, has also changed to , for example, in the native name of the dialect, &quot;Hoisan&quot;.
In Siyi and eastern Gao–Yang, Middle Chinese has become a voiceless lateral fricative .

Most Yue varieties have merged the Middle Chinese retroflex sibilants with the alveolar sibilants, in contrast with Mandarin dialects, which have generally maintained the distinction. For example, the words and are distinguished in Mandarin, but in modern Cantonese they are both pronounced as .

Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, have a third sibilant series, formed through a merger of palatalized alveolar sibilants and velars, but this is a recent innovation, which has not affected Yue and other Chinese varieties. For example, , , and are all pronounced as in Mandarin, but in Cantonese the first pair is pronounced , while the second pair is pronounced . The earlier pronunciation is reflected in historical Mandarin romanizations, such as &quot;Peking&quot; for Beijing, &quot;Kiangsi&quot; for Jiangxi, and &quot;Tientsin&quot; for Tianjin.

Some Yue speakers, such as many Hong Kong Cantonese speakers born after World War II, merge with , but Taishanese and most other Yue varieties preserve the distinction.
Younger Cantonese speakers also tend not to distinguish between and the zero initial, though this distinction is retained in most Yue dialects.
Yue varieties retain the initial in words where Late Middle Chinese shows a shift to a labiodental consonant, realized in most Northern varieties of Chinese as .
Nasals can be independent syllables in Yue words, e.g. Cantonese , and , although Middle Chinese did not have syllables of this type.

In most Yue varieties (except for Tengxian), the rounded medial has merged with the following vowel to form a monophthong, except after velar initials.
In most analyses velars followed by are treated as labio-velars.

Most Yue varieties have retained the Middle Chinese palatal medial, but in Cantonese it has also been lost to monophthongization, yielding a variety of vowels.

===Final consonants and tones===
Middle Chinese syllables could end with glides or , nasals , or , or stops , or . Syllables with vocalic or nasal endings could occur with one of three tonal contours, called , , or . Syllables with final stops were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, the entering tone , because the stops were distributed in the same way as the corresponding final nasals.

While northern and central varieties have lost some of the Middle Chinese final consonants, they are retained by most southern Chinese varieties, though sometimes affected by sound shifts. They are most faithfully preserved in Yue dialects.
Final stops have disappeared entirely in most Mandarin dialects, including the Beijing-based standard, with the syllables distributed across the other tones.
For example, the characters , , , , , , , , , and are all pronounced in Mandarin, but they are all distinct in Yue: in Cantonese, , , , , , , , , , and , respectively.

Similarly, in Mandarin dialects the Middle Chinese final has merged with , but the distinction is maintained in southern varieties of Chinese such as Hakka, Min and Yue.
For example, Cantonese has and versus Mandarin , and versus Mandarin , and versus Mandarin , and and versus Mandarin .

Middle Chinese is described in contemporary dictionaries as having four tones, where the fourth category, the entering tone, consists of syllables with final stops.
Many modern Chinese varieties contain traces of a split of each of these four tones into two registers, an upper or register from voiceless initials and a lower or register from voiced initials.
Most Mandarin dialects retain the register distinction only in the level tone, yielding the first and second tones of the standard language (corresponding to the first and fourth tones in Cantonese), but have merged several of the other categories.
Most Yue dialects have retained all eight categories, with a further split of the upper entering tone conditioned by vowel length, as also found in neighbouring Tai dialects.
A few dialects spoken in Guangxi, such as the Bobai dialect, have also split the lower entering tone.

==Vocabulary==
While most Chinese varieties form compounds consisting of a qualifier followed by a qualified element, Yue dialects may use the reverse order. For example, the Standard Chinese, and widely used Cantonese word for &quot;guest&quot; is , but the same morphemes may be reversed in Cantonese versus Taishanese , and Tengxian . This has been hypothesized to be the influence of Tai languages, in which modifiers normally follow nouns. But it is notable that the Standard Chinese word for &#x27;married woman&#x27; () also follows the same structure. Gender markers for nouns are also suffixed, as in other southern varieties.

Some Yue dialects, including Cantonese, can use the same word , for both &#x27;who&#x27; and &#x27;which&#x27;. Other dialects, including Taishanese, use (cf. Mandarin ) for &#x27;who&#x27;, and words meaning &#x27;which one&#x27; for &#x27;which&#x27;.

<text>Wesermarsch is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. Neighboring are (from the east clockwise) the districts of Cuxhaven and Osterholz, the city of Bremen in the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, the urban district of Delmenhorst, the district of Oldenburg and the urban district of Oldenburg, and the districts of Ammerland and Friesland.

==Geography==
The district is located on the western banks of the River Weser between Bremen and the river&#x27;s mouth. Several rivers cross the district from west to east, the largest being the Hunte, which runs through Oldenburg before entering Wesermarsch. In the north, the Weser mouth and the Jade Bight (a bay off the North Sea) enclose the Butjadingen peninsula. The district&#x27;s largest town is located here: Nordenham, which lies opposite Bremerhaven at the Weser mouth.

==History==
The district was created in 1933 by merging the &quot;Ämter&quot; of Butjadingen, Brake and Elsfleth, and parts of the &quot;Ämter&quot; of Delmenhorst and Varel.

==Partnerships==
Since February 1991, the district has partnered with the German districts of Borken (North Rhine-Westphalia) and Ludwigslust (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). A partnership with the English Borough of Havant has existed for several decades already, and in 1989 a partnership with the Russian city of Voronezh was established.

<doc id="147536" wikidata="Q185006" url="?curid=147536" title="Calcium oxide">
<text>Calcium oxide (formula: CaO), commonly known as quicklime or burnt lime, is a widely used chemical compound. It is a white, caustic, alkaline, crystalline solid at room temperature. The broadly used term &quot;lime&quot; connotes calcium-containing inorganic compounds, in which carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, aluminium, and iron predominate. By contrast, &quot;quicklime&quot; specifically applies to the single compound calcium oxide. Calcium oxide that survives processing without reacting in building products, such as cement, is called free lime.

Quicklime is relatively inexpensive. Both it and the chemical derivative calcium hydroxide (of which quicklime is the base anhydride) are important commodity chemicals.

==Preparation==
Calcium oxide is usually made by the thermal decomposition of materials, such as limestone or seashells, that contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3; mineral calcite) in a lime kiln. This is accomplished by heating the material to above , a process called calcination or &quot;lime-burning&quot;, to liberate a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2), leaving quicklime behind. This is also one of the few chemical reactions known in prehistoric times.
: CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)

The quicklime is not stable and, when cooled, will spontaneously react with CO2 from the air until, after enough time, it will be completely converted back to calcium carbonate unless slaked with water to set as lime plaster or lime mortar.

Annual worldwide production of quicklime is around 283 million tonnes. China is by far the world&#x27;s largest producer, with a total of around 170 million tonnes per year. The United States is the next largest, with around 20 million tonnes per year.

Approximately 1.8t of limestone is required per 1.0t of quicklime. Quicklime has a high affinity for water and is a more efficient desiccant than silica gel. The reaction of quicklime with water is associated with an increase in volume by a factor of at least 2.5.

Hydroxyapatite&#x27;s free CaO content rises with increased calcination temperatures and longer times. It also pinpoints particular temperature cutoffs and durations that impact the production of CaO, offering information on how calcination parameters impact the composition of the material.

==Uses==
* The major use of quicklime is in the basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) process. Its usage varies from about per ton of steel. The quicklime neutralizes the acidic oxides, SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3, to produce a basic molten slag.
* Ground quicklime is used in the production of aerated concrete such as blocks with densities of ca. .
* Quicklime and hydrated lime can considerably increase the load carrying capacity of clay-containing soils. They do this by reacting with finely divided silica and alumina to produce calcium silicates and aluminates, which possess cementing properties.
* Small quantities of quicklime are used in other processes; e.g., the production of glass, calcium aluminate cement, and organic chemicals.
* Heat: Quicklime releases thermal energy by the formation of the hydrate, calcium hydroxide, by the following equation:
::CaO (s) + H2O (l) Ca(OH)2 (aq) (ΔHr = −63.7kJ/mol of CaO)
: As it hydrates, an exothermic reaction results and the solid puffs up. The hydrate can be reconverted to quicklime by removing the water by heating it to redness to reverse the hydration reaction. One litre of water combines with approximately of quicklime to give calcium hydroxide plus 3.54 MJ of energy. This process can be used to provide a convenient portable source of heat, as for on-the-spot food warming in a self-heating can, cooking, and heating water without open flames. Several companies sell cooking kits using this heating method.
* It is a food additive used as an acidity regulator, a flour treatment agent and a leavener. It has E number E529.
* Light: When quicklime is heated to , it emits an intense glow. This form of illumination is known as a limelight, and was used broadly in theatrical productions before the invention of electric lighting.
* Cement: Calcium oxide is a key ingredient for the process of making cement.
* As a cheap and widely available alkali. About 50% of the total quicklime production is converted to calcium hydroxide before use. Both quick- and hydrated lime are used in the treatment of drinking water.
* Petroleum industry: Water detection pastes contain a mix of calcium oxide and phenolphthalein. Should this paste come into contact with water in a fuel storage tank, the CaO reacts with the water to form calcium hydroxide. Calcium hydroxide has a high enough pH to turn the phenolphthalein a vivid purplish-pink color, thus indicating the presence of water.
* Chemical pulping: Calcium oxide is used to make calcium hydroxide, which is used to regenerate sodium hydroxide from sodium carbonate in the chemical recovery at kraft pulp mills.
* Plaster: There is archeological evidence that Pre-Pottery Neolithic B humans used limestone-based plaster for flooring and other uses. Such Lime-ash floor remained in use until the late nineteenth century.
* Chemical or power production: Solid sprays or slurries of calcium oxide can be used to remove sulfur dioxide from exhaust streams in a process called flue-gas desulfurization.
* Carbon capture and storage: Calcium oxide can be used to capture carbon dioxide from flue gases in a process called calcium looping.
* Mining: &quot;Compressed lime cartridges&quot; exploit the exothermic properties of quicklime to break rock. A shot hole is drilled into the rock in the usual way and a sealed cartridge of quicklime is placed within and tamped. A quantity of water is then injected into the cartridge and the resulting release of steam, together with the greater volume of the residual hydrated solid, breaks the rock apart. The method does not work if the rock is particularly hard.
* Disposal of corpses: Historically, it was mistakenly believed that quicklime was efficacious in accelerating the decomposition of corpses. The application of quicklime can, in fact, promote preservation. Quicklime can aid in eradicating the stench of decomposition, which may have led people to the erroneous conclusion.
* It has been determined that the durability of ancient Roman concrete is attributed in part to the use of quicklime as an ingredient. Combined with hot mixing, the quicklime creates macro-sized lime clasts with a characteristically brittle nano-particle architecture. As cracks form in the concrete, they preferentially pass through the structurally weaker lime clasts, fracturing them. When water enters these cracks it creates a calcium-saturated solution which can recrystallize as calcium carbonate, quickly filling the crack. 
* The thermochemical heat storage mechanism is greatly impacted by the sintering of CaO and CaCO3. It demonstrates that the storage materials become less reactive and denser at increasing temperatures. It also pinpoints particular sintering processes and variables influencing the efficiency of these materials in heat storage.

===Weapon===
In 80 BC, the Roman general Sertorius deployed choking clouds of caustic lime powder to defeat the Characitani of Hispania, who had taken refuge in inaccessible caves. A similar dust was used in China to quell an armed peasant revolt in 178 AD, when &quot;lime chariots&quot; equipped with bellows blew limestone powder into the crowds.

Quicklime is also thought to have been a component of Greek fire. Upon contact with water, quicklime would increase its temperature above and ignite the fuel.

David Hume, in his &quot;History of England&quot;, recounts that early in the reign of Henry III, the English Navy destroyed an invading French fleet by blinding the enemy fleet with quicklime. Quicklime may have been used in medieval naval warfare – up to the use of &quot;lime-mortars&quot; to throw it at the enemy ships.

===Substitutes===
Limestone is a substitute for lime in many applications, which include agriculture, fluxing, and sulfur removal. Limestone, which contains less reactive material, is slower to react and may have other disadvantages compared with lime, depending on the application; however, limestone is considerably less expensive than lime. Calcined gypsum is an alternative material in industrial plasters and mortars. Cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, and lime kiln dust are potential substitutes for some construction uses of lime. Magnesium hydroxide is a substitute for lime in pH control, and magnesium oxide is a substitute for dolomitic lime as a flux in steelmaking.

== Safety ==
Because of vigorous reaction of quicklime with water, quicklime causes severe irritation when inhaled or placed in contact with moist skin or eyes. Inhalation may cause coughing, sneezing, and labored breathing. It may then evolve into burns with perforation of the nasal septum, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Although quicklime is not considered a fire hazard, its reaction with water can release enough heat to ignite combustible materials.

==Mineral==
Calcium oxide is also a separate mineral species (with the unit formula CaO), named &#x27;Lime&#x27;. It has an isometric crystal system, and can form a solid solution series with monteponite. The crystal is brittle, pyrometamorphic, and is unstable in moist air, quickly turning into portlandite (Ca(OH)2).

<text>Sir Adrian Cedric Boult, CH (; 8 April 1889 – 22 February 1983) was a British conductor. Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family, he followed musical studies in England and at Leipzig, Germany, with early conducting work in London for the Royal Opera House and Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet company. His first prominent post was conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1924. When the British Broadcasting Corporation appointed him director of music in 1930, he established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became its chief conductor. The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), founded two years later.

Forced to leave the BBC in 1950 on reaching retirement age, Boult became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestra had declined from its peak of the 1930s, but under his guidance its fortunes were revived. He retired as its chief conductor in 1957, and later accepted the post of president. Although in the latter part of his career he worked with several other orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and his former orchestra, the BBC Symphony, it was the LPO with which he was primarily associated, conducting it in concerts and recordings until 1978, in what was widely called his &quot;Indian summer&quot;.

Boult was known for his championing of British music. He gave the first performance of his friend Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, and introduced new works by, among others, Elgar, Bliss, Britten, Delius, Rootham, Tippett, Vaughan Williams and Walton. In his BBC years, he introduced works by foreign composers, including Bartók, Berg, Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Webern. A modest man who disliked the limelight, Boult felt as comfortable in the recording studio as on the concert platform, making recordings throughout his career. From the mid-1960s until his retirement after his last sessions in 1978 he recorded extensively for EMI. As well as a series of recordings that have remained in the catalogue for three or four decades, Boult&#x27;s legacy includes his influence on prominent conductors of later generations, including Sir Colin Davis and Vernon Handley.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife, Katharine Florence ( Barman; d. 1927). 

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had &quot;a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs&quot; with a history of philanthropy. 

When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, &quot;Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.&quot; While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.

At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. 

In 1909, Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled &quot;Some Notes on Performance&quot;, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer&#x27;s wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Boult graduated in 1912, with a basic &quot;pass&quot; degree. He continued his musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1912–13. Musician Hans Sitt was in charge of the conducting class, but Boult&#x27;s main influence was Nikisch. He later recalled, &quot;I went to all his [Nikisch&#x27;s] rehearsals and concerts in the Gewandhaus. ... He had an astonishing baton technique and great command of the orchestra: everything was indicated with absolute precision. But there were others who were greater interpreters.&quot; 

Boult admired Nikisch &quot;not so much for his musicianship but his amazing power of saying what he wanted with a bit of wood. He spoke very little&quot;. This style was in accord with Boult&#x27;s opinion that &quot;all conductors should be clad in an invisible Tarnhelm which makes it possible to enjoy the music without seeing any of the antics that go on&quot;. He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913, where he watched Nikisch conduct. There he made the acquaintance of George Butterworth, and other British composers. Later that year Boult joined the musical staff of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where his most important work was to assist with the first British production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and do &quot;odd jobs with lighting cues&quot; while Nikisch conducted the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.

===First conducting work===
Boult made his début as a professional conductor on 27 February 1914 at West Kirby Public Hall, with members of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. His programme comprised orchestral works by Bach, Butterworth, Mozart, Schumann, Wagner and Hugo Wolf, interspersed with arias by Mozart and Verdi sung by Agnes Nicholls. 

Boult was declared medically unfit for active service during the First World War, and until 1916 he served as an orderly officer in a reserve unit. He was recruited by the War Office as a translator (he spoke good French, German and Italian). In his spare time he organised and conducted concerts, some of which were subsidised by his father, with the aims of giving work to orchestral players and bringing music to a wider audience.
In 1918, Boult conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a series of concerts that included important recent British works. Among them was the première of a revised version of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;A London Symphony&quot;, a performance which was &quot;rather spoilt by a Zeppelin raid&quot;. His best-known première of this period was Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;. Boult conducted the first performance on 29 September 1918 to an invited audience of about 250. Holst later wrote on his copy of the score, &quot;This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused &quot;The Planets&quot; to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.&quot;

Elgar was another composer who had cause to be grateful to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in March 1920 to &quot;great applause&quot; and &quot;frantic enthusiasm&quot;, the composer wrote to him: &quot;With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym. ... I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands.&quot; Elgar&#x27;s friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult&#x27;s performance of Elgar&#x27;s neglected work brought &quot;the grandeur and nobility of the work&quot; to wider public attention.

Boult took a wide variety of conducting jobs in the years following the war. In 1919, he succeeded Ernest Ansermet as musical director of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet company. Although Ansermet gave Boult all the help he could in his preparations, there were fourteen ballets in the company&#x27;s repertory – none of which Boult knew. In only a short period, Boult was required to master such scores as &quot;Petrushka&quot;, &quot;The Firebird&quot;, &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, &quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot; and &quot;The Good-Humoured Ladies&quot;. 

In 1921, Boult conducted the British Symphony Orchestra for Vladimir Rosing&#x27;s Opera Week at Aeolian Hall. He also took on an academic post. When Hugh Allen succeeded Sir Hubert Parry as principal of the Royal College of Music, he invited Boult to start a conducting class along the lines of Leipzig – the first such class in England. Boult ran the classes from 1919 to 1930. In 1921 he received a Doctorate of Music.

When Raymond Roze, the founder of the British Symphony Orchestra died in March 1920, Boult took over. He conducted the orchestra, made up of professional musicians who had served in the Army during the First World War, in a series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall.

===Birmingham===

In 1923 Boult conducted the first season of the Robert Mayer concerts for children, but his participation in the following season was prevented by his appointment in 1924 as conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society. This led to his becoming musical director of the City of Birmingham Orchestra, where he remained in charge for six years, attracting widespread attention with his adventurous programmes.

The advantage of the Birmingham post was that for the first time in his life Boult not only had his own orchestra, but sole control of programming as well; the only time in his life, he later said, when that was so. The disadvantages were that the orchestra was inadequately funded, the available venues (including the Town Hall) were unsatisfactory, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;&#x27;s music critic, A. J. Symons, was a constant thorn in Boult&#x27;s side, and the local concert-going public had conservative tastes. Despite this conservatism, Boult programmed as much innovative music as was practical, including works by Mahler, Stravinsky and Bruckner. Such departures from the repertoire expected by the regular concert-goers depressed the box-office takings, requiring subsidies from private benefactors, including Boult&#x27;s family.

While at Birmingham Boult had the opportunity to conduct a number of operas, chiefly with the British National Opera Company, for which he conducted &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot;. He also conducted a diverse range of operas from such composers as Purcell, Mozart and Vaughan Williams. In 1928 he succeeded Vaughan Williams as conductor of the Bach Choir in London, a position he held until 1931.

===BBC Symphony Orchestra===
Visits to London by the Hallé Orchestra and particularly the Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler in 1929, had highlighted the relatively poor standards of London orchestras. Sir Thomas Beecham and the director general of the BBC Sir John Reith were keen to establish a first-class symphony orchestra, and they agreed in principle to do so jointly. Only a small number of core players were recruited before negotiations foundered. Beecham withdrew, and with Malcolm Sargent soon established the rival London Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1930 Boult returned to London to succeed Percy Pitt as director of music at the BBC. On taking up the post, Boult and his department recruited enough musicians to bring the complement of the new BBC Symphony Orchestra to 114. A substantial number of these players performed at the 1930 Promenade Concerts under Sir Henry Wood, and the full BBC Symphony Orchestra gave its first concert on 22 October 1930, conducted by Boult at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The programme consisted of music by Wagner, Brahms, Saint-Saëns and Ravel. Of the 21 programmes in the orchestra&#x27;s first season, Boult conducted nine and Wood five.

The reviews of the new orchestra were enthusiastic. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of its &quot;virtuosity&quot; and of Boult&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; conducting. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; commented, &quot;The boast of the B.B.C. that it intended to get together a first-class orchestra was not an idle one&quot; and spoke of &quot;exhilaration&quot; at the playing. &quot;The Observer&quot; called the playing &quot;altogether magnificent&quot; and said that Boult &quot;deserves an instrument of this fine calibre to work on, and the orchestra deserves a conductor of his efficiency and insight.&quot; After the initial concerts Reith was told by his advisers that the orchestra had played better for Boult than anyone else. Reith asked him if he wished to take on the chief conductorship, and if so whether he would resign as director of music or occupy both posts simultaneously. Boult opted for the latter. He later said that this was a rash decision, and that he could not have sustained the two roles at once without the efforts of his staff in the music department, which included Edward Clark, Julian Herbage and Kenneth Wright.

During the 1930s the BBC Symphony Orchestra became renowned for its high standard of playing and for Boult&#x27;s capable performances of new and unfamiliar music. Like Henry Wood before him, Boult regarded it as his duty to give the best possible performances of a wide range of composers, including those whose works were not personally congenial to him. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes that there was a very short list of composers whose works Boult refused to conduct, &quot;but it would be difficult to deduce who they were.&quot; Boult&#x27;s pioneering work with the BBC included an early performance of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Variations,&quot; Op. 31, British premières, including Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Three Movements from the Lyric Suite&quot;, and world premières, including Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 in F minor and Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra. He introduced Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony to London in 1934, and Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra in 1946. Boult invited Anton Webern to conduct eight BBC concerts between 1931 and 1936.

The excellence of Boult&#x27;s orchestra attracted leading international conductors. In its second season guest conductors included Richard Strauss, Felix Weingartner and Bruno Walter, followed, in later seasons, by Serge Koussevitzky, Beecham and Willem Mengelberg. Arturo Toscanini, widely regarded at the time as the world&#x27;s leading conductor, conducted the BBC orchestra in 1935 and said that it was the finest he had ever directed. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1937, 1938 and 1939.

During this period, Boult accepted some international guest conductorships, appearing with the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic orchestras. In 1936 and 1937 he headed European tours with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, giving concerts in Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, where they were especially well received. During his BBC years, Boult did not entirely lose contact with the world of opera and his performances of &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at Covent Garden in 1931 and &quot;Fidelio&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1930 were considered outstanding.

For many years, Boult had been a close friend of the tenor Steuart Wilson and his wife Ann, &quot;née&quot; Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She divorced Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious shyness with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted for the rest of his life. The enmity it provoked in Wilson had repercussions in Boult&#x27;s later career. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson&#x27;s career but not Boult&#x27;s: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of George VI in 1937.

During the Second World War the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated first to Bristol, where it suffered from bombing, and later to Bedford. Boult strove to maintain standards and morale as he lost key players. Between 1939 and the end of the war, forty players left for active service or other activities. In 1942 Boult resigned as the BBC&#x27;s director of music, while remaining chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This move, made as a favour to the composer Arthur Bliss to provide a suitable war-time job for him, later came to be Boult&#x27;s undoing at the BBC. Meanwhile, he made recordings of Elgar&#x27;s Second Symphony, Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Job, A Masque for Dancing&quot;. At the end of the war Boult &quot;found a changed attitude to the orchestra in the upper echelons of the BBC&quot;. Reith was no longer director general, and without his backing Boult had to fight hard to restore the orchestra to its pre-war glory.

On 29 September 1946 Boult conducted Britten&#x27;s new &quot;Festival Overture&quot;, to inaugurate the BBC Third Programme. For this innovative cultural channel, Boult was concerned in pioneering ventures including the British premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony. &quot;The Times&quot; later said of this period, &quot;The Third Programme could not possibly have had the scope which made it world-famous musically without Boult.&quot; Nevertheless, Boult&#x27;s BBC days were numbered. When he was appointed in 1930, Reith had informally promised him that would be exempt from the BBC&#x27;s rule that staff must retire at age 60. However, Reith had left the BBC in 1938 and his promise carried no weight with his successors. In 1948 Steuart Wilson was appointed head of music at the BBC, the post previously occupied by Boult and Bliss. He made it clear from the start of his appointment that he intended that Boult should be replaced as chief conductor, and he used his authority to insist on Boult&#x27;s enforced retirement. The director general of the BBC at the time, Sir William Haley, was unaware of Wilson&#x27;s animus against Boult and later acknowledged, in a broadcast tribute to Boult, that he &quot;had listened to ill-judged advice in retiring him.&quot; By the time of his retirement in 1950, Boult had made 1,536 broadcasts.

===London Philharmonic===
After it became clear that Boult would have to leave the BBC, Thomas Russell, the managing director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), offered him the post of principal conductor of the LPO in succession to Eduard van Beinum. In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham&#x27;s departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic orchestras.
Although he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone. With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot; with the mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven&#x27;s First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, &quot;The Gramophone&quot; wrote, &quot;I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult&#x27;s] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably&quot;. In &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Neville Cardus wrote, &quot;Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work.&quot;

In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as &quot;gruelling&quot;, with 12 concerts on 12 successive days. The symphonies they played were Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;London&quot;, No 104, Brahms&#x27;s First, Schumann&#x27;s Fourth and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C major&quot;. The other works were Elgar&#x27;s Introduction and Allegro, Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot; ballet music, Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot;.

In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra&#x27;s funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the Cold War began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell&#x27;s private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult&#x27;s change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be &quot;seriously jeopardized financially&quot; if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO&#x27;s chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.

In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss&#x27;s &quot;Processional&quot; and Walton&#x27;s march &quot;Orb and Sceptre&quot;. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: &quot;The Times&quot; found a Brahms symphony &quot;rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring&quot;, but praised Boult and the orchestra&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Planets&quot;. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.

In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in Leningrad. Boult&#x27;s assistant conductors were Anatole Fistoulari and George Hurst. Boult&#x27;s four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, Walton&#x27;s Violin Concerto (with Alfredo Campoli as soloist), and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C major&quot; Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the Bolshoi Opera and were guests at the composer Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s 50th birthday party.

After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra&#x27;s main conductor until his successor William Steinberg took up the post in 1959. After the sudden resignation of Andrzej Panufnik from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959–60 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement.

===Later years===
After stepping down from the chief conductorship of the LPO, Boult was, for a few years, less in demand in the recording studio and the concert hall. Nevertheless, he was invited to conduct in Vienna, Amsterdam and Boston. In 1964 he made no recordings, but in 1965 he began an association with Lyrita records, an independent label specialising in British music. In the same year he resumed recording for EMI after a six-year break. Celebrations for his eightieth birthday in 1969 also raised his profile in the musical world. After the death of his colleague Sir John Barbirolli in 1970, Boult was seen as &quot;the sole survivor of a great generation&quot; and a living link with Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Holst. In the words of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;it was when he reached his late seventies that the final and most glorious period of his career developed.&quot; He ceased to accept overseas invitations, but conducted in the major British cities, as well as at the Festival and Albert Halls and began what is frequently called his &quot;Indian Summer&quot; in the concert hall and recording studio. He was featured in a 1971 film &quot;The Point of the Stick&quot;, in which he illustrated his conducting technique with musical examples.

At a spare recording session in August 1970 Boult recorded the Third Symphony of Brahms. This was well received and led to a series of recordings of Brahms, Wagner, Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven. His repertoire in general was much wider than his discography might suggest. It was a disappointment to him that he was rarely invited to conduct in the opera house, and he relished the opportunity to record extensive excerpts from the Wagner operas in the 1970s. Having conducted several ballets at Covent Garden during the 1970s, Boult gave his last public performance conducting Elgar&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Sanguine Fan&quot; for the London Festival Ballet at the London Coliseum on 24 June 1978. His final record, completed in December 1978, was of music by Hubert Parry. Boult formally retired from conducting in 1981. He died in London in 1983, aged 93, leaving his body to medical science.

==Musicianship==
A review in &quot;The Observer&quot; of Boult&#x27;s second London concert, in 1918, said, &quot;Having, apparently, a thorough knowledge of the work, he was content to let it speak for itself without having recourse to those aids to success which are a constant temptation to conductors.&quot; Sixty-five years later, in an obituary tribute, Peter Heyworth wrote in the same newspaper: &quot;From Nikisch he had early acquired an immaculate stick technique and was quietly scathing about conductors who used their anatomy to indicate their artistic requirements. ... In an occupation ridden with inflated egos and circus tricksters Boult brought a rare probity to everything he undertook.&quot;

Boult&#x27;s biographer, Kennedy, gave this summary: &quot;In the music he admired most, Boult was often a great conductor; in the rest, an extremely conscientious one. ... If from behind he seemed unexciting and unemotional, the players could see the animation in his face – and he was capable of frightening outbursts of temper at rehearsals. Tall and erect, with something of the military in his appearance ... he seemed the personification of the English gentleman. But recipients of his cutting wit and occasional sarcasm knew that this was not the whole picture.&quot; &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; similarly said of him:
Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor&#x27;s left and the seconds on the right. Of the modern layout with all violins on the left, he wrote, &quot;The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves &quot;sound&quot; far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.&quot;

This care for balance was an important feature of Boult&#x27;s music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, &quot;If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing &#x27;fit to burst&#x27; there is trouble for somebody.&quot; The trombonist Raymond Premru wrote forty years later, &quot;One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – &#x27;No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.&#x27; That is the old idea of balance.&quot;

As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult &quot;created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.&quot; In the 1930s Boult ran a series of &quot;conferences for conductors&quot; at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon Handley. The last was not only a pupil of Boult, but acted as his musical assistant on many occasions.

==Honours and memorials==

Boult was created a Knight Bachelor in 1937 and was created a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1969. He received the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1944 and the Harvard Glee Club medal (jointly with Vaughan Williams) in 1956. He received honorary degrees and fellowships from 13 universities and conservatoires. In 1951 he was invited to be the first president of the Elgar Society. In 1959 he was made president of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. In the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey is a small memorial stone to Boult which was unveiled on 8 April 1984. 

Boult&#x27;s old school, Westminster, has a music centre named in his honour, and the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire included in its home building the Adrian Boult Hall. The hall was used for classical concerts, other musical performances, and conferences. The hall was demolished in June 2016 as part of a redevelopment project.

In the June 2013 issue of &quot;Gramophone&quot; Boult was added to the magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame which recognises musicians who have made a lasting impact on the world of recorded classical music.

==Recordings==

Boult was a prolific recording artist. Unlike many musicians, he felt at home in the recording studio and actually preferred working without an audience. His recording career stretched from the days of acoustic recording until the beginning of the digital era. His last recording of &quot;The Planets&quot; made in May 1978 was taped in experimental digital sound, although technical problems led EMI to release an analogue version.

Boult&#x27;s recordings fall into three main periods. In the first, from 1920 to the end of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV/EMI. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.

Of the British composers, Boult extensively recorded and sometimes re-recorded major works by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. He recorded all eight then-existing symphonies by Vaughan Williams for Decca Records in the 1950s with the LPO, in the presence of the composer. The recording producer, John Culshaw, wrote that the composer &quot;said very little during the sessions because he was totally in favour of Sir Adrian&#x27;s approach to his music.&quot; Vaughan Williams was to have been present for the first recording of his Ninth symphony, for Everest Records in 1958, but he died the night before the session took place; Boult recorded a short introduction as a memorial tribute. All these recordings have been reissued on CD. In the 1960s Boult re-recorded the nine symphonies for EMI.

Other British composers who feature significantly in Boult&#x27;s discography include Holst, Ireland, Parry, and Walton. Despite his reputation as a pioneer in Britain of the works of the Second Viennese School and other avant-garde composers, the record companies, unlike the BBC, remained cautious about recording him in this repertory, and only a single recording of a Berg piece represents this side of Boult&#x27;s work. In the core continental orchestral repertoire, Boult&#x27;s recordings of the four symphonies of Brahms, and the Great C major Symphony of Schubert were celebrated in his lifetime and have remained in the catalogues during the three decades after his death. Late in his recording career he recorded four discs of excerpts from Wagner&#x27;s operas, which received great critical praise. The exceptional breadth of Boult&#x27;s repertoire has left some well-regarded recordings of works not immediately associated with him, among which are versions of Berlioz’s &quot;Ouvertures&quot; (recorded in 1956), Franck&#x27;s Symphony (recorded in 1959), Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich (1958), and a pioneering recording of Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony taped live in 1947.

<text>Glencoe or Glencoe Village (Gaelic: &quot;A’ Chàrnaich&quot;) is the main settlement in Glen Coe in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands. It lies at the north-west end of the glen, on the southern bank of the River Coe where it enters Loch Leven (a salt-water loch off Loch Linnhe).

The village falls within the Ross, Skye and Lochaber part of the Highland council area for local government purposes. It is part of the registration county of Argyll and the lieutenancy area of Inverness for ceremonial functions.

The use of the term &quot;Glencoe Village&quot; is a modern one, to differentiate the settlement from the glen itself.

==History==

The village is on the site of the Massacre of Glencoe in 1692, in which 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by forces acting on behalf of the government of King William III following the Glorious Revolution. Treachery was involved, since the Clan had fed the soldiers and given them shelter for nearly two weeks before they turned on their hosts. The glen is sometimes poetically referred to as &quot;The Weeping Glen&quot;, in reference to this incident, although the Glencoe name was already in place well before the time of the massacre, as the Gaelic &quot;Gleann Comhann&quot;, the &quot;Comhann&quot; element of which may predate the Gaelic language, its meaning being uncertain.

The village occupies an area of the glen known as Carnoch. Native Gaelic speakers who belong to the area always refer to the village itself as A&#x27; Chàrnaich, meaning &quot;the place of cairns&quot;. Even today there is Upper Carnoch and Lower Carnoch. There was formerly a small hospital at the southern end of the village just over an arched stone bridge. This has since been converted into an upmarket guest house, and the nearest hospital is now the Belford in Fort William, some away.

==Culture and community==
Within Carnoch there is a small village shop, a Scottish Episcopal Church, Glencoe Folk Museum, Post Office, Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team centre, an outdoor centre, a number of bed and breakfast establishments, and a small primary school. The small Museum was started after a resident discovered &quot;a cache of 200-year-old swords and pistols hidden there from the British Redcoats after the disastrous battle of Culloden&quot;.

Several eating establishments are around including the Glencoe Hotel, Glencoe Cafe and The Clachaig Inn. Glencoe is also a popular location for self-catering holidays; with many chalets, cottages and lodges available for weekly and short break rental. Also located in the village, but along the A82, is the Glencoe Visitor Centre, run by the National Trust for Scotland. This modern (constructed in 2002) visitor centre houses a coffee shop, store, and information centre. Nearby memorials sites are the Celtic cross at the Massacre of Glencoe Memorial, and plaque at Henderson Stone (&quot;Clach Eanruig&quot;).

The village is surrounded by spectacular mountain scenery and is popular with serious hill-walkers, rock and ice climbers. Travel writer Rick Steves describes the area as exhibiting &quot;the wild, powerful and stark beauty of the Highlands... dramatic valley, where the cliffsides seem to weep with running streams when it rains&quot;. The area has been seen in numerous films, including &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; as the home of Hagrid, and the 2012 James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;.

In Ian Fleming&#x27;s original novel &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; James Bond tells Sir Hilary Bray, a genealogist with the Royal College of Arms, his father was from the Highlands, near Glencoe and in Fleming&#x27;s other novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; M&#x27;s obituary for Bond also mentions his father, Andrew Bond, was from Glencoe.

Well-known residents include Hamish MacInnes, mountaineer and inventor of the MacInnes Stretcher.

<doc id="147546" wikidata="Q92616" url="?curid=147546" title="Sid Meier">
<text>Sidney K. Meier ( ; born February 24, 1954) is an American businessman and computer programmer. A programmer, designer, and producer of many strategy video games and simulation video games, including the &quot;Civilization&quot; series, Meier co-founded MicroProse in 1982 with Bill Stealey and is the Director of Creative Development of Firaxis Games, which he co-founded with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds in 1996. For his contributions to the video game industry, Meier was inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Meier was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, to parents of Dutch and Swiss descent, which conferred on him both Canadian and Swiss citizenship upon birth. When he was about three years old, his family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he was raised. At the University of Michigan, he studied history and computer science, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science in 1975.

==Career==
Following college, Meier worked in developing cash register systems for department stores. During this timeframe, Meier acquired an Atari 800 around 1981, an experience that led him to the realization of the potential for employing computer programming in the creation of video games. He found a co-worker, Bill Stealey, who had a similar interest in developing games, and shared the games that Meier had developed. The two decided to establish a new company for computer game development subsequent to the widespread advancement and growth of the software and personal computer industries, which were developing extensively during the initial years of the 1980s.

===MicroProse===
Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982. After a few initial 2D action games, such as Meier&#x27;s platformer &quot;Floyd of the Jungle&quot;, MicroProse settled into a run of flight simulation titles beginning with &quot;Hellcat Ace&quot; (1982) and continuing with &quot;Spitfire Ace&quot; (1982), &quot;Solo Flight&quot; (1983), and &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot; (1985), all designed and programmed by Meier.

The first appearance of Meier&#x27;s name on the retail box of a game was as the credited creator of &quot;Formula 1 Racing&quot; in 1982. In 1984 Stealey began marketing Meier himself, hoping to attract other developers by promoting him as an &quot;auteur&quot;; by 1986 MicroProse was using Meier&#x27;s name and face in advertisements for its games. In 1987, the company released &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot;, the first game with Meier&#x27;s name in the title. He later explained that the inclusion of his name was because &quot;Pirates!&quot; is very different from the company&#x27;s earlier titles. Stealey decided that Meier&#x27;s name would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: &quot;We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says &#x27;Bill, you should put Sid&#x27;s name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.&#x27; And that&#x27;s how Sid&#x27;s name got on &quot;Pirates&quot;, and &quot;Civilization&quot;.&quot;

The idea was successful; by 1992, an entry in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; poetry contest praised Meier&#x27;s name as &quot;a guarantee they got it right&quot;. While emphasizing that he did not encourage MicroProse promoting his name, Meier did insist on doing all of the work on games himself, including sound and art, until work by artist Michael Haire, whom Stealey had hired for &quot;Silent Service&quot; (1985), persuaded him. Meier is not always the main designer on titles that carry his name. For instance, Brian Reynolds has been credited as the primary designer behind &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization II&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;, and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot;, while Jeff Briggs designed &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization III&quot;, Soren Johnson led &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization IV&quot;, Jon Shafer led &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;, and Will Miller and David McDonough were the designers of &quot;&quot;.

After the release of &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot;, Meier focused on strategy games, later saying &quot;Everything I thought was cool about a flight simulator had gone into that game.&quot; Inspired by &quot;SimCity&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot;, he created &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon&quot; and later the game series for which he is most widely recognized, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot;, although he designed only the first installment. Around 1990, Stealey wanted to expand MicroProse to produce arcade games, which Meier felt was too risky. Unable to resolve the matter with Stealey, Meier sold Stealey his half of the company, but remained with the company in his same role.

===Firaxis Games===
MicroProse, after it had become a public company, merged with Spectrum HoloByte in 1993 under Spectrum&#x27;s name, with Spectrum as the operating company. As a cost-cutting measure, Spectrum cut many of the jobs at MicroProse in 1996 and consolidated much of their operations. Meier, along with MicroProse employees Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds, were dissastified with these decisions, and opted to leave the company to form Firaxis Games in 1997.

Firaxis continued to develop the same type of strategy games that Meier had developed at MicroProse, many of which are follow-ups to those titles, such as the new &quot;Civilization&quot; games and a remake of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; (2004). In 1996, he was granted a patent for a &quot;System for Real-Time Music Composition and Synthesis&quot; used in C.P.U. Bach. &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed him in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, calling him &quot;a prolific developer of some of the best games in [MicroProse]&#x27;s catalog&quot;.

According to Firaxis employees, Meier has been constantly developing a special game engine since around 1996 which he uses to prototype his game ideas and which he has not shared with anyone else. Dennis Shirk, a senior producer, said in 2016 that Meier would sometimes arrive at the office and announce he had a new game prototype for the company to try out and see if it could be developed further. The engine is believed by Firaxis employees to be based on his original &quot;Civilization&quot; source, but expanded over the years with updates that he or other engineers will write for him.

Meier worked with a team on a dinosaur-themed game starting in early 2000, but announced in an online development diary in 2001 that the game had been shelved. Despite trying various approaches, including turn-based and real-time gameplay, he said he found no way to make the concept fun enough. In 2005, he said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been nonstop busy making other games over the past several years, so the dinosaur game remains on the shelf. However, I do love the idea of a dinosaur game and would like to revisit it when I have some time.&quot;

An autobiography, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Memoir!: A Life in Computer Games&quot;, was published on September 8, 2020, by W. W. Norton &amp; Company.

===Development style===
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported in 1994 that &quot;Sid Meier has stated on numerous occasions that he emphasizes the &#x27;fun parts&#x27; of a simulation and throws out the rest&quot;. The magazine reported that year how &quot;Meier insisted that discovering the elusive quality of fun is the toughest part of design.&quot; According to &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, &quot;Though his games are frequently about violent times and places, there is never any blood or gore shown. He designs and creates his games by playing them, over and over, until they are fun.&quot;

==Personal life==
Meier lives in Hunt Valley, Maryland, with his second wife Susan. He is a devout Christian, and he and his wife attend Faith Evangelical Lutheran Church in Cockeysville, where he is the Director of Contemporary Music. Susan was one of the original 13 employees at Firaxis Games along with Sid. Meier has a son, Ryan Meier, who worked for Blizzard Entertainment, Firaxis Games, and Google.

==Awards==
In 1996, GameSpot put Meier at the top of their listing of the &quot;Most Influential People in Computer Gaming of All Time&quot;, calling him &quot;our Hitchcock, our Spielberg, our Ellington&quot;. That same year, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked him as eighth on the list of the &quot;Most Influential Industry Players of All Time&quot;, noting that no game designer has had as many &quot;CGW&quot; Hall of Fame games as Sid Meier. In 1997, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked him as number one on the list of the &quot;Most Influential People of All Time in Computer Gaming&quot;, for game design. In 1999, he became the second person to be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences&#x27; Hall of Fame.

In 2008, Meier received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 Game Developer&#x27;s Conference. In 2009, he came fifth in a &quot;Develop&quot; survey that asked some 9,000 game makers about their &quot;ultimate development hero&quot;. In 2009, he was ranked second in IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;Top Game Creators of All Time&quot;, and was called &quot;the ideal role model for any aspiring game designer&quot;. In 2017, he was awarded the Life Achievement by the Golden Joystick Awards.

==Games==
Meier has been the developer, co-developer, and producer of many games. A complete list of his works which includes early non-commercial titles is available in the appendix of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Memoir!&quot;

<text>Ernest Alexandre Ansermet (; 11 November 1883 – 20 February 1969) was a Swiss conductor.

== Biography ==
Ansermet was born in Vevey, Switzerland. Originally he was a mathematics professor, teaching at the University of Lausanne. He began conducting at the Casino in Montreux in 1912, and from 1915 to 1923 was the conductor for Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. Travelling in France for this, he met both Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and consulted them on the performance of their works. During World War I, he met Igor Stravinsky, who was exiled in Switzerland, and from this meeting began the conductor&#x27;s lifelong association with Russian music.

In 1918 Ansermet founded his own orchestra, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR). He toured widely in Europe and America and became famous for accurate performances of difficult modern music, making first recordings of works such as Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot; with the composer as soloist. Ansermet was one of the first in the field of classical music to take jazz seriously, and in 1919 he wrote an article praising Sidney Bechet.

After World War II, Ansermet and his orchestra rose to international prominence through a long-term contract with Decca Records. From that time until his death, he recorded most of his repertoire, often two or three times. His interpretations were widely regarded as admirably clear and authoritative, though the orchestral playing did not always reach the highest international standards, and they differed notably from those of other famous 20th-century specialists, notably Pierre Monteux and Stravinsky himself. Ansermet disapproved of Stravinsky&#x27;s practice of revising his works, and always played the original versions. Although famous for performing much modern music by other composers such as Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin, he avoided altogether the music of Arnold Schoenberg and his associates, even criticizing Stravinsky when he began to use twelve-tone techniques in his compositions. In Ansermet&#x27;s book, &quot;Les fondements de la musique dans la conscience humaine&quot; (1961), he sought to prove, using Husserlian phenomenology and partly his own mathematical studies, that Schoenberg&#x27;s idiom was false and irrational. He labeled it a &quot;Jewish idea&quot; and went on to say that &quot;the Jew is a &quot;me&quot; who speaks as though he were an &quot;I&quot;,&quot; that the Jew &quot;suffers from thoughts doubly misformed&quot;, thus making him &quot;suitable for the handling of money&quot;, and sums up with the statement that &quot;historic creation of Western music&quot; would have developed just as well &quot;without the Jew&quot;. 
Ansermet&#x27;s reputation suffered after the war because of his collaboration with the Nazis and he was boycotted in the new state of Israel.

In May 1954 Decca recorded Ansermet and the orchestra in Europe&#x27;s first commercial stereophonic recordings. They went on to record the first stereo performance of the complete &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by Tchaikovsky on LP (Artur Rodziński had already recorded a stereo performance on magnetic tape, but this had been released on LP only in mono). Ansermet also conducted early stereo recordings of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; and the &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;. Part of his recording of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, augmented by a rehearsal recording unobtainable elsewhere, was used by Decca on the company&#x27;s 1957 stereo demonstration LP, &quot;A Journey into Stereo Sound&quot;. The conductor&#x27;s clear and methodical counting of beats is a distinct feature of this rehearsal sequence. In his last years he and his ensemble recorded works by Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms. In 1962, Ansermet made the first complete recording of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Paris&quot; symphonies with the OSR on Decca.

His last recording, of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird,&quot; was made in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1968, which included a recording of the rehearsal sessions issued as a memorial to him. Another late recording for Decca, also issued as a memorial album, was with L&#x27;Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, and was devoted to Albéric Magnard&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot; and Édouard Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Scherzo for Orchestra&quot;.
Ansermet composed some piano pieces and compositions for orchestra, among them a symphonic poem entitled &quot;Feuilles de Printemps&quot; (Leaves of Spring). He also orchestrated Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Six épigraphes antiques&quot; in 1939.

He died on 20 February 1969 in Geneva at the age of 85.

<text>John Wilbur Stealey Sr., better known as Bill Stealey, is an American game developer and publisher, and a former military pilot. Stealey founded MicroProse with Sid Meier in 1982 and released many flight simulators with the company. He was known for his appearances in military uniform and aerial stunts aboard the company&#x27;s real plane while promoting the games. After a brief retirement in the early 1990s, he founded iEntertainment Network in 1995 and is the current CEO. In 2018 he also re-acquired MicroProse assets and revived the studio with David Lagettie. Stealey acts largely in a consultancy capacity at the revived studio.

==Career ==
===US Air Force and consultancy===
Stealey had the goal of becoming a fighter pilot and eventually a general. He attended Pennsylvania Military College in the 1960s; he wore glasses but &quot;fought his way into the program&quot; regardless, and was granted a waiver. This allowed him to attend the United States Air Force Academy in 1966, but unfortunately a &quot;minor slip-up in his final days dropped him to sixth in his class and out of the running for the fighter assignments.&quot; He was however asked to work as a flight instructor after his graduation in 1970, flying the T-37. Stealey has stated that he was advocating for computer based flight simulators in military training as early as 1971, but faced opposition due to fears of new pilots losing flight hours. He attained the rank of Captain before leaving active service and going back into education, while continuing to serve with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard over the following decade.

Initially considering a law school, he realised that he would be better served with an MBA and so attended Wharton School of Business. He became a consultant with Cresap, McCormick &amp; Paget, and later McKinsey &amp; Company. He has stated that he was not very good at consultancy, as he would want to solve problems for the clients immediately and not sit and wait for them to &quot;talk for years&quot;. He took job with General Instrument in corporate strategy. He built some novel software for the business for financial planning, and while purchasing computer hardware for the company he encountered early video games on the Atari and met Sid Meier, then also employed by General Instrument.

===MicroProse===
At a company function in Las Vegas in 1982, he was seated next to Meier, and discussed setting up a games business. The two spent time together in Vegas and competed against one another for high scores on a &quot;Red Baron&quot; arcade cabinet. Stealey was shocked that Meier beat his score, considering he had actual pilot experience, but Meier&#x27;s knowledge of video games was more important for the contest.

The two founded MicroProse Software, which published its first title &quot;Hellcat Ace&quot; later that year. At that time Stealey and Meier were the only employees, with Meier developing the titles and Stealey testing them and offering advice on military accuracy. The group were simply packaging floppy disks and printing labels in Stealey&#x27;s basement, but found economic success quickly. Meier and Stealey would later purchase the exact &quot;Red Baron&quot; cabinet they had competed on as a memento. The group primarily produced flight simulators through the 1980s, such as &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot; (1984). Stealey&#x27;s air force experience was used in their marketing for these titles, with Stealey appearing in military uniform at events. From the late 1980s Meier began to lose interest in flight simulators, and pushed to have his idea for a pirate game made by the company. In response to Meier&#x27;s insistence, Stealey declared that the game should be titled &quot;Sid Meier’s pirate-whatever&quot;, which led to the continued use of a &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s...&quot; prefix on video games from the designer. This was carried on into the &quot;Civilization&quot; franchise and beyond Meier&#x27;s work at MicroProse.

In 1988, the group purchased a North American T-28 Trojan, which Stealey named &quot;Miss MicroProse&quot;. He would fly games journalists in an effort to promote their games. He also ran a competition called &quot;I Cheated Death with Major Bill&quot; which selected three fans to fly with him on a &quot;stunt-filled flight lesson&quot;. That year he was also responsible for setting up the collaboration with Tom Clancy for the military simulator &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. Stealey purchased Meier&#x27;s half of the company in 1991, amid a disagreement over their direction. Stealey had believed in a resurgence of the arcade market, which ultimately failed and resulted in his sale of the company to Spectrum HoloByte in 1993. He resigned from the company following the merger and announced his retirement, with the intention to &quot;play golf for a living&quot;. He retired from the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

===Baltimore Spirit===
Stealey had been a fan of the Baltimore Blast soccer team since the 1980s, having previously sponsored trips for the group. In 1988 he had also included the Blast&#x27;s goalkeeper Keith Van Eron in &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot;. When the MISL collapsed in the summer of 1992, Stealey stepped in and bought the team which was renamed to Baltimore Spirit and shifted to the NPSL. It retained many of the same players, along with the original coach Kenny Cooper. Cooper and Stealey had a &quot;falling out&quot; in 1994; Cooper resigned after Stealey declined to sell, and was replaced by Dave MacWilliams. The team&#x27;s record over the following years was consistently poor, and Stealey lost $3 million in the venture before he sold it to Ed Hale in 1998.

===Interactive Magic / iEntertainment Network===
Stealey started the game software company Interactive Magic in 1995. &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed him in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot; for his roles as former head of MicroProse and then-current head of Interactive Magic. Stealey sold it in 1999, but re-purchased it in 2002 and renamed it to iEntertainment Network.

In 2018, Stealey worked together with David Lagettie to re-acquire MicroProse; the studio announced its first new titles in 2020. Stealey is considered the co-founder but has no specific role at the new MicroProse, providing consultancy and mentorship only due to his age.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s and 1990s Bill Stealey flew planes recreationally on a regular basis. In 1987, an engine failure occurred aboard his plane which forced an emergency landing in poor visibility conditions, but he survived the encounter.

Stealey is fond of golf, and has often mentioned his love for the sport. He took a six-month sabbatical from the games industry in 1992 to travel around the United States playing the sport.

He has 14 grandchildren as of 2020.

<text>A vertical blank interrupt (or VBI) is a hardware feature found in some legacy computer systems that generate a video signal. Cathode-ray tube based video display circuits generate vertical blanking and vertical sync pulses when the display picture has completed and the raster is being returned to the start of the display. With VBI, the vertical blank pulse is also used to generate an interrupt request for the computer&#x27;s microprocessor.

The interrupt service routine can then modify data in the video display memory while it is not being read to avoid screen tearing effects. This was particularly useful in simple home computers and video game consoles that relied upon a central microprocessor to generate text or graphic displays. More advanced home computers featuring hardware sprites often supported the more flexible horizontal blank interrupt instead in order to allow them to be multiplexed.

As the VBI will be generated at the start of every displayed frame (50 Hz for PAL, 60 Hz for NTSC), it is a useful timebase in systems lacking other timing sources. VBIs are used in some home computers to perform regular functions like scanning the keyboard and joystick ports. It can also be used to implement a basic form of multitasking as well as a buffered graphics screen via page flipping, if hardware permits.

Modern protected mode operating systems generally do not support VBIs as access to hardware interrupts for unprivileged user programs could compromise the system stability. Instead, various APIs like DirectX provide efficient and safe ways to present graphics free of tear and flicker.

For computers that support VBIs see the page about raster interrupts.

<text>Huntingdonshire (; abbreviated Hunts) is a local government district in Cambridgeshire, England, which was historically a county in its own right. It borders Peterborough to the north, Fenland to the north-east, East Cambridgeshire to the east, South Cambridgeshire to the south-east, Central Bedfordshire and Bedford to the south-west, and North Northamptonshire to the west. 

The district had a population of 180,800 at the 2021 census, and has an area of . After St Neots (33,410), the largest towns are Huntingdon (25,428), St Ives (16,815), and Yaxley (9,174 in 2011). The district council is based in Huntingdon.

Huntingdonshire&#x27;s boundaries were established in the Anglo-Saxon era. It was divided into four hundreds. The county did not have an independent sheriff, instead being combined with neighbouring Cambridgeshire. Huntingdonshire became an administrative county when they were established in 1889. In 1965 it was merged with the Soke of Peterborough to form Huntingdon and Peterborough, which was in turn merged with Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely in 1974 to form Cambridgeshire, of which Huntingdonshire is now a district.

==History==

The area corresponding to modern Huntingdonshire was first delimited in Anglo-Saxon times. Its boundaries have remained largely unchanged since the 10th century, although it lost its administrative function in 1974. On his accession in 1154 Henry II declared all Huntingdonshire a forest.
===Status===

In 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888 Huntingdonshire became an administrative county, with the newly-formed Huntingdonshire County Council taking over administrative functions from the Quarter Sessions. The area in the north of the county forming part of the municipal borough of Peterborough became instead part of the Soke of Peterborough, an administrative county in Northamptonshire.
In 1965, under a recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England, Huntingdonshire was merged with the Soke of Peterborough to form Huntingdon and Peterborough. The Lieutenancy county was also merged. At the same time, St Neots was expanded westwards over the river into Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon in Bedfordshire.

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Huntingdon and Peterborough merged with Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely to form the new non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire. A Huntingdon district was created based closely on the former administrative county borders, with the exclusion of the Old Fletton urban district, which became part of the Peterborough district, as did the part of Norman Cross Rural District in Peterborough New Town. The district was renamed Huntingdonshire on 1 October 1984 by a resolution of the district council.

Original historical documents relating to Huntingdonshire are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Huntingdon.

===Proposed revival of administrative county===
The Local Government Boundary Commission for England (1992) considered in the 1990s the case for making a Huntingdonshire unitary authority as part of a general structural review of English local government that led to unitary authorities in two other English counties that had been abolished: Rutland and Herefordshire.

The draft recommendations envisaged three possible scenarios for structural change in Cambridgeshire: the preferred option and the third option had a unitary Huntingdonshire, whilst the second option would have seen Huntingdonshire combine with Peterborough and Fenland to form a &quot;Peterborough and Huntingdonshire&quot; unitary authority. The Final recommendations of the commission for Cambridgeshire recommended no change in the status quo in Cambridgeshire. The districts of Peterborough and Huntingdonshire were referred back to the commission for reconsideration in 1995. The commission recommended the creation of a Peterborough unitary authority, but proposed that Huntingdonshire remain part of the shire county of Cambridgeshire, noting that &quot;there was no exceptional county allegiance to Huntingdonshire, as had been perceived in Rutland and Herefordshire.&quot;

David McKie writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 1994 noted that &quot;Writers-in demanded an independent Huntingdon; but MORI&#x27;s more broadly based poll showed that most Huntingdonians – that is, most of [Prime Minister] John Major&#x27;s electors – were content to stay part of Cambridgeshire.&quot;

===Awareness promotion===

After the failure to revive the unitary authority, a Huntingdonshire Society was set up to promote awareness of Huntingdonshire as a historic county and campaign for its reinstatement as an administrative and ceremonial entity. In 2002 it established an annual &quot;Huntingdonshire Day&quot; on 25 April, the birthday of Oliver Cromwell. After a campaign by the Huntingdonshire Society, the county flag of Huntingdonshire, a gold and beribboned hunting horn on a green field, was registered by the Flag Institute in June 2009.

==Governance==
Huntingdonshire District Council&#x27;s headquarters are located in Pathfinder House in Huntingdon. The council consists of 52 councillors. Until 2018, district council elections were held in three out of every four years, with a third of the 52 council seats coming up each time. Elections since have been held for all seats every four years. The Conservative party had a majority on the council from 1976 until 2022, after which a joint administration took control of the council.

==Sports==
Huntingdonshire is the birthplace of bandy, now an IOC accepted sport. According to documents from 1813, Bury Fen Bandy Club was undefeated for 100 years. A club member, Charles Tebbutt, wrote the first official rules in 1882 and helped to spread the sport to other countries.

Huntingdonshire County Cricket Club is taken to be one of the 20 minor counties of English and Welsh cricket, but it has never played in the Minor Counties Championship. It has its own Cricket Board and played in the English domestic one-day competition from 1999 to 2003.The county played seven List A matches during this period, with the final List A match it played coming against Cheshire.

==Media==
In terms of television, Huntingdonshire is served by BBC East and ITV Anglia broadcasting from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Star Radio and HCR FM, a community based station that broadcast from its studios in Huntingdon. 

&quot;The Hunts Post&quot; is the local weekly newspaper.

<doc id="147554" wikidata="Q339111" url="?curid=147554" title="Datamax UV-1">
<text>The Datamax UV-1 is a pioneering computer designed by a group of computer graphics artists working at the University of Illinois Chicago, known as the &quot;Circle Graphics Habitat&quot;. It was primarily the brainchild of Tom DeFanti, who was trying to build a machine capable of running his GRASS programming language at a personal computer price point, a project they referred to as the Z-Box. As time went on the project evolved into a machine intended to be used to make high-quality color graphics for output to videotape, and later as a titling system for use by cable television companies. It represents what seems to be the first dedicated graphics workstation.

DeFanti had been working at the Habitat for some time when, in 1977, he was introduced to Jeff Frederiksen, a chip designer working at Dave Nutting Associates. Nutting had been contracted by Midway, the video game division of Bally, to create a standardized graphics driver chip. They intended to use it in most of their future arcade games, as well as a console they were working on which would later turn into the Astrocade.

Midway was not immediately interested in the home computer market, but the Nutting people managed to convince management to get DeFanti to port GRASS3 to the platform under contract. The idea was to build an external box that would be used with the existing console to turn it into a &quot;real&quot; computer, a system known as the ZGRASS-100. A number of people at the Habitat, as well as some from Nutting, worked on the project, adding a keyboard, memory, and additional connectors. A separate display chip created text, which was then mixed with the output from the display chip for the screen. Also included would be a new version of GRASS3, known as Zgrass. 

At about the same time, another version of the same basic parts was built as the UV-1. In this case the machine was built as an all-in-one box, including the small amount of additional hardware needed to support the high-resolution mode of the Nutting chipset, which supplied 320 x 204 resolution with up to 8 colors per line. This mode required 16 KB for the display buffer alone, so the machine included 32 KB RAM and a larger 16 KB ROM with additional Zgrass commands in it. To this basic system the Habitat added high quality video output circuitry and a floppy disk interface.

Bally&#x27;s intents for the UV-1 are not entirely clear. The November 1980 &quot;Byte&quot; magazine contains an article by DeFanti (et al.) that seems to suggest that the ZGRASS-100 was already &quot;dead&quot;, and that the UV-1 was intended to be used for high-quality video output. Ad copy from the same era suggests that Bally intended to sell the UV-1 as a home computer, competing directly with the Apple II and similar machines. This makes the ZGRASS-100 somewhat unnecessary, so whether or not Bally intended to offer both remains a mystery. Either way, in 1980 Bally decided to exit the industry altogether, dropping both Z-Box projects, and the Astrocade too.

The final version of the Z-Box was the only one to be produced, as the UV-1R. This version was mounted in a rack mount case (thus the R) with considerably more RAM and a 32 KB ROM which contained the parts of CP/M that were needed to boot the machine, so a disk was no longer required. Much of the additional RAM, up to 256 KB of it, was dedicated as a RAM disk so the machines could be installed and left running for years – a floppy disk would burn out very quickly in this role. The additional RAM was not normally visible to the Z80 or the display hardware, but a new memory controller could switch in blocks of it so a number of screens could be cached if the disk needs were not that large.

Although Midway had already given up on the Astrocade, they later sold the rights to the design to a 3rd party, Astrovision. Some time in the mid-1980s Astrovision decided to release the original &quot;add-under&quot; version of the hardware, now known as the ZGRASS-32. It is unclear if any were sold.

<text>An immune response is a physiological reaction which occurs within an organism in the context of inflammation for the purpose of defending against exogenous factors. These include a wide variety of different toxins, viruses, intra- and extracellular bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi which could cause serious problems to the health of the host organism if not cleared from the body.

In addition, there are other forms of immune response. For example, harmless exogenous factors (such as pollen and food components) can trigger allergy; latex and metals are also known allergens.
A transplanted tissue (for example, blood) or organ can cause graft-versus-host disease. A type of immune reactivity known as Rh disease can be observed in pregnant women. These special forms of immune response are classified as hypersensitivity. Another special form of immune response is antitumor immunity.

In general, there are two branches of the immune response, the [[Immune response|innate]] and the [[Immune response|adaptive]], which work together to protect against pathogens. Both branches engage [[humoral]] and [[Immune response|cellular]] components.

The innate branch—the body&#x27;s first reaction to an invader—is known to be a non-specific and quick response to any sort of pathogen . Components of the innate immune response include physical barriers like the skin and mucous membranes, immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, and soluble factors including cytokines and complement. On the other hand, the adaptive branch is the body&#x27;s immune response which is catered against specific antigens and thus, it takes longer to activate the components involved. The adaptive branch include cells such as dendritic cells, T cell, and B cells as well as antibodies—also known as immunoglobulins—which directly interact with antigen and are a very important component for a strong response against an invader.

The first contact that an organism has with a particular antigen will result in the production of effector T and B cells which are activated cells that defend against the pathogen. The production of these effector cells as a result of the first-time exposure is called a primary immune response. Memory T and memory B cells are also produced in the case that the same pathogen enters the organism again. If the organism does happen to become re-exposed to the same pathogen, a secondary immune response will kick in and the immune system will be able to respond in both a fast and strong manner because of the memory cells from the first exposure. Vaccines introduce a weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganism in order to evoke a primary immune response. This is so that in the case that an exposure to the real pathogen occurs, the body can rely on the secondary immune response to quickly defend against it.

== Innate part ==
The innate immune response is an organism&#x27;s first response to foreign invaders. This immune response is evolutionarily conserved across many different species, with all multi-cellular organisms having some sort of variation of an innate response. The innate immune system consists of physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, various cell types like neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, and soluble factors including cytokines and complement. In contrast to the adaptive immune response, the innate response is not specific to any one foreign invader and as a result, works quickly to rid the body of pathogens.

Pathogens are recognized and detected via pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These receptors are structures on the surface of macrophages which are capable of binding foreign invaders and thus initiating cell signaling within the immune cell. Specifically, the PRRs identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which are integral structural components of pathogens. Examples of PAMPs include the peptidoglycan cell wall or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), both of which are essential components of bacteria and are therefore evolutionarily conserved across many different bacterial species.

When a foreign pathogen bypasses the physical barriers and enters an organism, the PRRs on macrophages will recognize and bind to specific PAMPs. This binding results in the activation of a signaling pathway which allows for the transcription factor NF-κB to enter the nucleus of the macrophage and initiate the transcription and eventual secretion of various cytokines such as IL-8, IL-1, and TNFα. Release of these cytokines is necessary for the entry of neutrophils from the blood vessels to the infected tissue. Once neutrophils enter the tissue, like macrophages, they are able to phagocytize and kill any pathogens or microbes.

Complement, another component of the innate immune system, consists of three pathways that are activated in distinct ways. The classical pathway is triggered when IgG or IgM is bound to its target antigen on either the pathogen cell membrane or an antigen-bound antibody. The alternative pathway is activated by foreign surfaces such as viruses, fungi, bacteria, parasites, etc., and is capable of autoactivation due to “tickover” of C3. The lectin pathway is triggered when mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin aka specific pattern recognition receptors bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the surface of invading microorganisms such as yeast, bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Each of the three pathways ensures that complement will still be functional if one pathway ceases to work or a foreign invader is able to evade one of these pathways (defense in depth principle). Though the pathways are activated differently, the overall role of the complement system is to opsonize pathogens and induce a series of inflammatory responses that help to combat infection.

== Adaptive part ==

The adaptive immune response is the body&#x27;s second line of defense. The cells of the adaptive immune system are extremely specific because during early developmental stages the B and T cells develop antigen receptors that are specific to only certain antigens. This is extremely important for B and T cell activation. B and T cells are extremely dangerous cells, and if they are able to attack without undergoing a rigorous process of activation, a faulty B or T cell can begin exterminating the host&#x27;s own healthy cells. Activation of naïve helper T cells occurs when antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present foreign antigen via MHC class II molecules on their cell surface. These APCs include dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages which are specially equipped not only with MHC class II but also with co-stimulatory ligands which are recognized by co-stimulatory receptors on helper T cells. Without the co-stimulatory molecules, the adaptive immune response would be inefficient and T cells would become anergic. Several T cell subgroups can be activated by specific APCs, and each T cell is specially equipped to deal with each unique microbial pathogen. The type of T cell activated and the type of response generated depends, in part, on the context in which the APC first encountered the antigen. Once helper T cells are activated, they are able to activate naïve B cells in the lymph node. However, B cell activation is a two-step process. Firstly, B cell receptors, which are just Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin D (IgD) antibodies specific to the particular B cell, must bind to the antigen which then results in internal processing so that it is presented on the MHC class II molecules of the B cell. Once this happens a T helper cell which is able to identify the antigen bound to the MHC interacts with its co-stimulatory molecule and activates the B cell. As a result, the B cell becomes a plasma cell which secretes antibodies that act as an opsonin against invaders.

Specificity in the adaptive branch is due to the fact that every B and T cell is different. Thus there is a diverse community of cells ready to recognize and attack a full range of invaders. The trade-off, however, is that the adaptive immune response is much slower than the body&#x27;s innate response because its cells are extremely specific and activation is required before it is able to actually act. In addition to specificity, the adaptive immune response is also known for immunological memory. After encountering an antigen, the immune system produces memory T and B cells which allow for a speedier, more robust immune response in the case that the organism ever encounters the same antigen again.

== Types of immune response ==
Depending on exogenous demands, several types of immune response (IR) are distinguished. In this paradigm, immune system (both innate and adaptive) and non-immune system cellular and molecular components are organized to optimally respond to distinct exposome challenges.

Currently, several types of IR are classified.

Type 1 IR is elicited by viruses, intracellular bacteria, parasites. The actors here are group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1), NK cells, Th1 cells, macrophages, opsonizing IgG isotypes.

Type 2 IR is caused by toxins and multicellular parasites. ILC2, epithelial cells, Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, IgE are key players here.

Type 3 IR targets extracellular bacteria and fungi by recruiting ILC3, Th17, neutrophils, opsonizing IgG isotypes.

Additional types of IR can be observed in noninfectious pathologies.

All types of IR have &quot;sensor&quot; (ILCs, NK cells), &quot;adaptive&quot; (T and B cells), and &quot;effector&quot; (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells) parts.

<doc id="147563" wikidata="Q1753786" url="?curid=147563" title="Sleeve valve">
<text>The sleeve valve is a type of valve mechanism for piston engines, distinct from the usual poppet valve. Sleeve valve engines saw use in a number of pre–World War II luxury cars and in the United States in the Willys-Knight car and light truck. They subsequently fell from use due to advances in poppet-valve technology, including sodium cooling, and the Knight system double sleeve engine&#x27;s tendency to burn a lot of lubricating oil or to seize due to lack of it. The Scottish Argyll company used its own, much simpler and more efficient, single sleeve system (Burt-McCollum) in its cars, a system which, after extensive development, saw substantial use in British aircraft engines of the 1940s, such as the Napier Sabre, Bristol Hercules, Centaurus, and the promising but never mass-produced Rolls-Royce Crecy, only to be supplanted by the jet engines.

==Description==
A sleeve valve takes the form of one (or in the case of double sleeve valves, two) machined cylinders which fit concentrically between the piston and the cylinder block bore of an internal combustion engine having cross-flow induction/exhaust. These sleeves have inlet and exhaust ports machined in the periphery, analogous to a two-stroke motor. Ports (apertures) in the periphery of the sleeves come into alignment with the cylinder&#x27;s inlet and exhaust ports at the appropriate stages in the engine&#x27;s cycle.

===Types of sleeve valve===

The first successful sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin reciprocating sleeves per cylinder. It was used in some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Stearns, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva. The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages and were prone to valve spring failure before the later advances in spring technology.

The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors who applied for similar patents within a few weeks of each other. The Burt system was an open sleeve type, driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: &#x27;Torque Meter&#x27; Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more &#x27;Burt&#x27; than &#x27;McCollum.&#x27; It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines and the Halford-designed Napier Sabre. It used a single sleeve driven by an eccentric from a timing axle set at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared with other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area established in the Knight system.

A small number of designs used a &quot;cuff&quot; sleeve in the cylinder head instead of the cylinder proper, providing a more &quot;classic&quot; layout compared with traditional poppet valve engines. This design also had the advantage of not having the piston within the sleeve, although in practice this appears to have had little practical value. On the downside, this arrangement limited the size of the ports to that of the cylinder head, whereas in-cylinder sleeves could have much larger ports.

==Advantages/disadvantages==

===Advantages===
The main advantages of the sleeve-valve engine are:
* High volumetric efficiency due to very large port openings. Harry Ricardo also demonstrated better mechanical and thermal efficiency. 
* The size of the ports can be readily controlled. This is important when an engine operates over a wide RPM range, since the speed at which gas can enter and exit the cylinder is defined by the size of the duct leading to the cylinder, and varies according to the cube of the RPM. In other words, at higher RPM the engine typically requires larger ports that remain open for a greater proportion of the cycle; this is fairly easy to achieve with sleeve valves, but difficult in a poppet valve system.
*Good exhaust scavenging and controllable swirl of the inlet air/fuel mixture in single-sleeve designs. When the intake ports open, the air/fuel mixture can be made to enter tangentially to the cylinder. This helps scavenging when exhaust/inlet timing overlap is used and a wide speed range required, whereas poor poppet valve exhaust scavenging can dilute the fresh air/fuel mixture intake to a greater degree, being more speed dependent (relying principally on exhaust/inlet system resonant tuning to separate the two streams). Greater freedom of combustion chamber design (few constraints other than the spark plug positioning) means that fuel/air mixture swirl at top dead centre (TDC) can also be more controlled, allowing improved ignition and flame travel which, as demonstrated by Ricardo, allows at least one extra unit of compression ratio before detonation, compared with the poppet valve engine.
*The combustion chamber formed with the sleeve at the top of its stroke is ideal for complete, detonation-free combustion of the charge, as it does not have to contend with compromised chamber shape and hot exhaust (poppet) valves.
*No springs are involved in the sleeve valve system, therefore the power needed to operate the valve remains largely constant with the engine&#x27;s RPM, meaning that the system can be used at very high speeds with no penalty for doing so. A problem with high-speed engines that use poppet valves is that as engine speed increases, the speed at which the valve moves also has to increase. This in turn increases the loads involved due to the inertia of the valve, which has to be opened quickly, brought to a stop, then reversed in direction and closed and brought to a stop again. Large poppet valves that allow good air-flow have considerable mass and require a strong spring to overcome their inertia when closing. At higher engine speeds, the valve spring may be unable to close the valve effectively for the required amount of crankshaft degree rotation before the next opening event, resulting in a failure to completely and/or remain closed. Harmonic frequency vibration produced at certain RPM can also cause a resonance with the poppet valve spring greatly reducing its spring strength and ability to quickly and maintain the valve closed and be correctly in time with the reciprocating mass (this phenomenon can be countered by the use of dual valve springs as the secondary spring can assist the primary through the very narrow rpm range where such harmonic failure can occur allowing the engine to continue building RPM). These effects, called valve float and/or valve bounce could result in the valve being struck by the top of the rising piston. In addition, camshafts, push-rods, and valve rockers can be eliminated in a sleeve valve design, as the sleeve valves are generally driven by a single gear powered from the crankshaft. In an aircraft engine, this provided desirable reductions in weight and complexity.
*Longevity, as demonstrated in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to &quot;improve with use&quot;, in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems, and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.
*The cylinder head is not required to host valves, allowing the spark plug to be placed in the best possible location for efficient ignition of the combustion mixture. For very big engines, where flame propagation speed limits both size and speed, the swirl induced by ports, as described by Ricardo, can be an additional advantage. In his research with two-stroke single sleeve valve compression ignition engines, Ricardo proved that an open sleeve was feasible, acting as a second annular piston with 10% of the central piston area, that transmitted 3% of the power to the output shaft through the sleeve driving mechanism in a Diesel engine. This highly simplifies construction, as the &#x27;junk head&#x27; is no longer needed.
*Lower operating temperatures of all power-connected engine parts, cylinder and pistons. Ricardo showed that as long as the clearance between sleeve and cylinder is adequately settled, and the lubricating oil film is thin enough, sleeves are &#x27;transparent to heat&#x27;.
*Continental in the United States conducted extensive research in single sleeve valve engines, pointing out that they were eventually cheaper and easier to produce. However, their aircraft engines soon equaled the performance of single-sleeve-valve engines by introducing improvements such as sodium-cooled poppet valves, and it seems also that the costs of this research, along with the October 1929 crisis, led to the Continental single-sleeve-valve engines not entering mass production. A book on Continental engines reports that General Motors had conducted tests with single sleeve valve engines, rejecting this kind of arrangement, and, according to M. Hewland (&quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot;, July 1974) also Ford around 1959..

Most of these advantages were evaluated and established during the 1920s by Roy Fedden, Niven, and Ricardo, possibly the sleeve valve engine&#x27;s greatest advocate. He conceded that some of these advantages were significantly eroded as fuels improved up to and during World War II and as sodium-cooled exhaust valves were introduced in high-output aircraft engines.

===Disadvantages===
A number of disadvantages plagued the single sleeve valve:

* Perfect, even very good, sealing is difficult to achieve. In a poppet valve engine, the piston possesses piston rings (at least three and sometimes as many as eight) which form a seal with the cylinder bore. During the &quot;breaking in&quot; period (known as &quot;running-in&quot; in the UK) any imperfections in one are scraped into the other, resulting in a good fit. This type of &quot;breaking in&quot; is not possible on a sleeve-valve engine, however, because the piston and sleeve move in different directions and in some systems even rotate in relation to one another. Unlike a traditional design, the imperfections in the piston do not always line up with the same point on the sleeve. In the 1940s this was not a major concern because the poppet valve stems of the time typically leaked appreciably more than they do today, so that oil consumption was significant in either case. To one of the 1922–1928 Argyll single sleeve valve engines, the 12, a four-cylinder 91 cu. in. (1,491 cc) unit, was attributed an oil consumption of one gallon for 1,945 miles, and 1,000 miles per gallon of oil in the 15/30 four-cylinder 159 cu. in. (2,610 cc). Some proposed adding a ring in the base of the sleeve, between sleeve and cylinder wall, or a Dykes ring on the &#x27;Junk Head&#x27;. Single-sleeve-valve engines had a reputation of being much less smoky than the Daimler with engines of Knight double-sleeve engines counterparts.
* The high oil consumption problem associated with the Knight double sleeve valve was fixed with the Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve, as perfectioned by Bristol. The models that had the complex &#x27;junk head&#x27; installed a non-return purging valve on it; as liquids cannot be compressed, the presence of oil in the head space would result in problems. At top dead centre (TDC), the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston. This prevents boundary lubrication problems, as piston ring ridge wear at TDC and bottom dead centre (BDC) does not occur. The Bristol Hercules time between overhauls (TBO) life was rated at 3,000 hours, very good for an aircraft engine, but not so for automotive engines. Sleeve wear was located primarily in the upper part, inside the &#x27;junk head&#x27;.
* An inherent disadvantage is that the piston in its course partially obscures the ports, thus making it difficult for gases to flow during the crucial overlap between the intake and exhaust valve timing usual in modern engines. The 1954 printing of the book by Harry Ricardo &quot;The High-Speed Internal Combustion Engine&quot;, and also some patents on sleeve valve production, point out that the available zone for ports in the sleeve depends on the type of sleeve drive and bore/stroke ratio; Ricardo tested successfully the &#x27;open sleeve&#x27; concept in some two-stroke, compression ignition engines. It not only eliminated the head rings, but also allowed a reduction in height of the engine and head, thus reducing frontal area in an aircraft engine, the whole circumference of the sleeve being available for exhaust port area, and the sleeve acting in phase with the piston forming an annular piston with an area around 10% of that of the piston, that contributed to some 3% of power output through the sleeve driving mechanism to the crankshaft. The German-born engineer Max Bentele, after studying a British sleeve valve aero engine (probably a Hercules), complained that the arrangement required more than 100 gearwheels for the engine, too many for his taste.
* A serious issue with large single-sleeve aero-engines is that their maximum reliable rotational speed is limited to about 3,000 RPM, but the M Hewland car engine was raced above 10,000 rpm without toil.
* Improved fuel octane, above about 87 RON, have assisted poppet-valve engines’ power output more than to the single-sleeve engines’.
* The increased difficulty with oil consumption and cylinder-assembly lubrication was reported as never having been solved in series-produced engines. Railroad and other large single sleeve-valve engines emit more smoke when starting; as the engine reaches operating temperature and tolerances enter the adequate range, smoke is greatly reduced. For two-stroke engines, a three-way catalyst with air injection in the middle was proposed as best solution in a SAE Journal article around the year 2000.
* Some (Wifredo Ricart, Alfa-Romeo) feared the build-up of heat inside the cylinder, however Ricardo proved that if only a thin oil film is retained and working clearance between the sleeve and the cylinder barrel was kept small, moving sleeves are almost transparent to heat, actually transporting heat from upper to lower parts of the system.
* If stored horizontally, sleeves tend to become oval, producing several types of mechanical problems. To avoid this, special cabinets were developed to store sleeves vertically.
* Equivalent implementations of modern variable valve timing and variable lift are impossible due to the fixed sizes of the port holes and essentially fixed rotational speed of the sleeves. It may be theoretically possible to alter the rotational speed through gearing that is not linearly related to the engine speed, however it seems this would be impractically complex even compared to the complexities of modern valve control systems.

==History==
===Charles Yale Knight===


In 1901 Knight bought an air-cooled, single-cylinder three-wheeler whose noisy valves annoyed him. He believed that he could design a better engine and did so, inventing his double sleeve principle in 1904. Backed by Chicago entrepreneur L.B. Kilbourne, a number of engines were constructed, followed by the &quot;Silent Knight&quot; touring car, which was shown at the 1906 Chicago Auto Show.

Knight&#x27;s design had two cast-iron sleeves per cylinder, one sliding inside the other with the piston inside the inner sleeve. The sleeves were operated by small connected rods actuated by an eccentric shaft. They had ports cut out at their upper ends. The design was remarkably quiet, and the sleeve valves needed little attention. It was, however, more expensive to manufacture due to the precision grinding required on the sleeves&#x27; surfaces. It also used more oil at high speeds and was harder to start in cold weather.

Although he was initially unable to sell his Knight Engine in the United States, a long sojourn in England, involving extensive further development and refinement by Daimler supervised by their consultant Dr Frederick Lanchester, eventually secured Daimler and several luxury car firms as customers willing to pay his expensive premiums. He first patented the design in England in 1908. The patent for the US was granted in 1910. As part of the licensing agreement, &quot;Knight&quot; was to be included in the car&#x27;s name.

Six-cylinder Daimler sleeve valve engines were used in the first British tanks in WW1, up to and including the Mark IV. As a result of the tendency of the engines to smoke and hence give away the tank positions, Harry Ricardo was brought in, and devised a new engine which replaced the sleeve valve starting with the Mark V tank.

Among the companies using Knight&#x27;s technology were Avions Voisin, Daimler (1909–1930s) including their V12 Double Six, Panhard (1911–39), Mercedes (1909–24), Willys (as the Willys-Knight, plus the associated Falcon-Knight), Stearns, Mors, Peugeot, and Belgium&#x27;s Minerva company that was forced to stop their sleeve-valve line of engines as a result of the limitations imposed on them by the winners of WWII, some thirty companies in all. Itala also experimented with rotary and sleeve valves in their &#x27;Avalve&#x27; cars.

Upon Knight&#x27;s return to America he was able to get some firms to use his design; here his brand name was &quot;Silent Knight&quot; (1905–1907)—the selling point was that his engines were quieter than those with standard poppet valves. The best known of these were the F.B. Stearns Company of Cleveland, which sold a car named the Stearns-Knight, and the Willys firm which offered a car called the Willys-Knight, which was produced in far greater numbers than any other sleeve-valve car.

===Burt-McCollum===
The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve, having its name from the surnames of the two engineers that patented the same concept with weeks of difference, Peter Burt and James Harry Keighly McCollum, patent applications are of August 6 and June 22, 1909, respectively, both engineers hired by the Scottish car maker Argyll, consisted of a single sleeve, which was given a combination of up-and-down and partial rotary motion. It was developed in about 1909 and was first used in the 1911 Argyll car. The initial 1900 investment in Argyll was £15,000 and building the magnificent Scotland plant cost £500,000 in 1920. It is reported that litigation by the owners of the Knight patents cost Argyll £50,000, perhaps one of the reasons for the temporary shutdown of their plant. Another car maker that used the Argyll SSV patents, and others of their own (patent GB118407), was Piccard-Pictet (Pic-Pic); Louis Chevrolet and others founded Frontenac Motors in 1923 with the aim of producing an 8-L SSV engined luxury car, but this never reached production for reasons connected to the time limits to the Argyll patents in the USA. The greatest success for single sleeve valves (SSV) was in Bristol&#x27;s large aircraft engines, it was also used in the Napier Sabre and Rolls-Royce Eagle engines. The SSV system also reduced the high oil consumption associated with the Knight double sleeve valve.

Barr and Stroud Ltd of Anniesland, Glasgow, also licensed the SSV design, and made small versions of the engines that they marketed to motorcycle companies. In an advertisement in Motor Cycle magazine in 1922 Barr &amp; Stroud promoted their 350cc sleeve valve engine and listed Beardmore-Precision, Diamond, Edmund, and Royal Scot as motorcycle manufacturers offering it. This engine had been described in the March edition as the &#x27;Burt&#x27; engine. Grindlay-Peerless started producing a SSV Barr &amp; Stroud engined 999cc V-twin in 1923. and later added a 499cc single SSV as well as the 350cc. Vard Wallace, known for his aftermarket forks for motorcycles, presented in 1947 drawings of a Single Cylinder, Air-Cooled, 250 cc SSV engine. Some small SSV auxiliary boat engines and electric generators were built in the UK, prepared for burning &#x27;paraffin&#x27; from start, or after a bit of heat-up with more complex fuels.

A number of sleeve valve aircraft engines were developed following a seminal 1927 research paper from the RAE by Ricardo. This paper outlined the advantages of the sleeve valve and suggested that poppet valve engines would not be able to offer power outputs much beyond 1500 hp (1,100 kW). Napier and Bristol began the development of sleeve-valve engines that would eventually result in limited production of two of the most powerful piston engines in the world: the Napier Sabre and Bristol Centaurus. The Continental Motors Company, around the years of the Great Depression, developed prototypes of single sleeve-valve engines for a range of applications, from cars to trains to airplanes, and thought that production would be easier, and costs would be lower, than its counterpart poppet valve engines. Due to the financial problems of Continental, this line of engines never entered production. (&#x27;Continental! Its motors and its people&#x27;, William Wagner, Armed Forces Journal International and Aero Publishers, 1983, )

Potentially the most powerful of all sleeve-valve engines (though it never reached production) was the Rolls-Royce Crecy V-12 (oddly, using a 90-degree V-angle), two-stroke, direct-injected, turbocharged (force-scavenged) aero-engine of 26.1 litres capacity. It achieved a very high specific output, and surprisingly good specific fuel consumption (SFC). In 1945 the single-cylinder test-engine (Ricardo E65) produced the equivalent of 5,000 HP (192 BHP/Litre) when water injected, although the full V12 would probably have been initially type rated at circa . Ricardo, who specified the layout and design goals, felt that a reliable 4,000 HP military rating would be possible. Ricardo was constantly frustrated during the war with Rolls-Royce&#x27;s (RR) efforts. Hives &amp; RR were very much focused on their Merlin, Griffon then Eagle and finally Whittle&#x27;s jets, which all had a clearly defined production purpose. Ricardo and Tizard eventually realized that the Crecy would never get the development attention it deserved unless it was specified for installation in a particular aircraft but by 1945, their &quot;Spitfire on steroids&quot; concept of a rapidly climbing interceptor powered by the lightweight Crecy engine had become an aircraft without a purpose.

Following World War II, the sleeve valve became utilised less, Roy Fedden, very early involved in the S-V research, built some flat-six single sleeve-valve engines intended for general aviation around 1947; after this, just the French SNECMA produced some SSV engines under Bristol license that were installed in the Noratlas transport airplane, also another transport aircraft, the Azor built by the Spanish CASA installed SSV Bristol engines post-WWII. Bristol sleeve valve engines were used however during the post-war air transport boom, in the Vickers Viking and related military Varsity and Valetta, Airspeed Ambassador, used on BEA&#x27;s European routes, and Handley Page Hermes (and related military Hastings), and Short Solent airliners and the Bristol Freighter and Superfreighter. The Centaurus was also used in the military Hawker Sea Fury, Blackburn Firebrand, Bristol Brigand, Blackburn Beverly and the Fairey Spearfish. The poppet valve&#x27;s previous problems with sealing and wear had been remedied by the use of better materials and the inertia problems with the use of large valves were reduced by using several smaller valves instead, giving increased flow area and reduced mass, and the exhaust valve hot spot by Sodium-cooled valves. Up to that point, the single sleeve valve had won every contest against the poppet valve in comparison of power to displacement. The difficulty of Nitride hardening, then finish-grinding the sleeve valve for truing the circularity, may have been a factor in its lack of more commercial applications.

===The Knight-Argyll Patent Case===
When the Argyll car was launched in 1911, the Knight and Kilbourne Company immediately brought a case against Argyll for infringement of their original 1905 patent. This patent described an engine with a single moving sleeve, whereas the Daimler engines being built at the time were based on the 1908 Knight patent which had engines with two moving sleeves. As part of the litigation an engine was built according to the 1905 specification and developed no more than a fraction of the rated RAC horsepower. This fact coupled with other legal and technical arguments led the judge to rule, at the end of July 1912, that the holders of the original Knight patent could not be supported in their claim that it gave them master rights encompassing the Argyll design. Costs of litigation against claims by Knight patent holders seem having substantially contributed to bankrupt of Argyll in Scotland.

== Modern usage ==
The sleeve valve has begun to make something of a comeback, thanks to modern materials, dramatically better engineering tolerances and modern construction techniques, which produce a sleeve valve that leaks very little oil. However, most advanced engine research is concentrated on improving other types of internal combustion engine designs, such as the Wankel.

Mike Hewland with his assistant John Logan, and also independently Keith Duckworth, experimented with a single-cylinder sleeve-valve test engine when looking at Cosworth DFV replacements. Hewland claimed to have obtained from a 500 cc single-cylinder engine, with a specific fuel consumption of 177–205 g/HP/hr (0.39–0.45 lb/HP/hr), the engine being able to work on creosote, and with no specific lubrication supply for the sleeve; they said having solved the oil consumption issue by adding a Dykes ring on &#x27;Junk Head&#x27;.

An unusual form of four-stroke model engine that uses what is essentially a sleeve-valve format, is the British RCV series of &quot;SP&quot; model engines, which use a rotating cylinder liner driven through a bevel gear at the cylinder liner&#x27;s &quot;bottom&quot;, which is actually at the aft end of the cylinder; and, even more unusually, have the propeller shaft—as an integrally machined part of the rotating cylinder liner—emerging from what would normally be the cylinder head, which in this design is placed at the extreme front of the engine, achieving a 2:1 gear reduction ratio compared to the vertically oriented crankshaft&#x27;s rotational speed. The same firm&#x27;s &quot;CD&quot; series of model engines use a conventional upright single cylinder with the crankshaft used to spin the propeller directly and also use the rotating cylinder valve. As a parallel with the earlier Charles Knight-designed sleeve-valved automotive powerplants, any RCV sleeve-valved model engine that is run on model glow engine fuel using castor oil (about 2% to 4% content) of the maximum 15%-content lubricant in the fuel allows the &quot;varnish&quot; created through engine operation to provide a better pneumatic seal between the rotating cylinder valve and the unitized engine cylinder/head castings, initially formed while the engine is being broken in.

Another concept, the Rotating Liner Engine, has been developed, where the wear and friction benefit of the sleeve valve is exploited in a conventional engine layout. A friction reduction of the order of 40% has been reported for a heavy duty diesel.

The same company can also supply somewhat larger engines for use in military drones, portable generators and equipment such as lawn mowers.

==Steam engine==
Sleeve valves have occasionally, but unsuccessfully, been used on steam engines, for example the SR Leader class.

<text>Schutzhund (/&#x27;ʃʊtshʊnt/, German for &quot;protection dog&quot;), currently known competitively as IGP and previously as IPO, is a dog sport that tests a dog&#x27;s tracking, obedience, and protection skills, and evaluates if a dog has the appropriate traits and characteristics of a good working dog. It was developed in Germany in the early 1900s as a suitability test for German Shepherds, but soon became the model for training and evaluating all five of the German protection breeds, which included Boxer, Dobermann, Giant Schnauzer, and Rottweiler. Though any breed of dog can participate, today the sport is dominated by German Shepherds and the Belgian Shepherd breed. Dog owners and handlers participate in Schutzhund clubs as a group activity for training the dogs, and clubs sponsor trials to test the dogs and award titles. The best dogs can qualify to participate in national and international level championships.

==Traits of Schutzhund dogs==

Schutzhund tests dogs for the traits necessary for police-type work. Dogs trained in Schutzhund are suitable for a wide variety of working tasks: police work, specific odor detection, search and rescue, and many others. The purpose of Schutzhund is to identify dogs that have, or do not have, the character traits required for these demanding jobs such as a strong desire to work, courage, intelligence, trainability, strong bond to the handler, perseverance, protective instinct, and a good sense of smell. Schutzhund also tests for physical traits such as strength, endurance, agility, and scenting ability. The goal of Schutzhund is to illuminate the character and ability of a dog through training. Breeders can use this insight to determine how and whether to use the dog in producing the next generation of working dogs.

The German Shepherd was developed from working herding dogs around 1900 as an all-around working dog. Within a few years it was clear that the dogs were losing their working ability. Schutzhund was developed at this time as a test of working ability for German Shepherds. Only German Shepherds that had passed a Schutzhund test or a herding test were allowed to breed and thus have their progeny registered as German Shepherd Dogs (GSD). This is true in Germany to this day. It is only by testing the working ability of every generation that the strong working characteristics of the GSD have been maintained.

Today, any breed can participate in the sport, though some breed clubs run trials for just their single-breed members. The intermediate and advanced levels of the sport and the top titles are dominated by German Shepherds and Belgian Malinois, with Dobermans, Rottweilers, and Bouvier des Flandres also quite successful. At the beginning levels such as BH level (Companion Dog test) and OB (Obedience), a wide variety of breeds and sizes participate.

==Trials and titles==
Trials are events—competitive examinations of a dog—at which titles are awarded to dogs that pass standards. In Germany, German Shepherd Dogs are not permitted to be bred unless they have passed at least the level one trials and obtained a title.

There are three levels of titles, numbered 1 through 3, with level 1 being the first and level 3 being the most advanced. Previously they were called Schutzhund 1 through Schutzhund 3 (abbreviated SchH1–SchH3), in 2012 they became IPO1–IPO3, and in 2019 they became IGP1–IGP3.

Trials have changed over the years. Modern trials consist of three phases: tracking, obedience, and protection. A dog must pass all three phases in one trial to be awarded a title, must have passed the prior level before allowed to compete, and may only acquire one title within an event. Each phase is judged on a point scale with a minimum score required to obtain a title. At any time the judge may dismiss a dog for showing poor temperament, fear or aggression, or failing one of several tests within each phase.

As a prerequisite, before a dog can compete for IGP1, it must pass a temperament test called a BH-VT (usually called just &quot;BH&quot;). The BH-VT tests basic obedience and confidence around strange people, strange dogs, traffic, bicyclists, joggers, loud noises, and briefly tethered alone (such as tethering the dog to a post while its owner goes out of sight into a shop). A dog that exhibits excessive fear, distracted behaviors, or aggression will not pass the BH-VT and so cannot go on to IGP level 1. BH-VT is the exception to the rule of earning only one title at an event; a dog may be awarded a BH-VT along with one other level 1 title.

* Tracking phase: This tests not only the dog&#x27;s scenting ability, but its mental soundness, and physical endurance. A &quot;track layer&quot; walks across a field dropping several small articles along the way. After a period of time, the dog is directed to follow the track while being followed by its handler on a leash. When the dog finds each article, he indicates it, usually by lying down with the article between his front paws. The dog is scored on how intently and carefully it follows the track and indicates the articles. The length, complexity, number of articles, and age of the track varies for each title.
* Obedience phase: This takes place in a large field, with two dogs on the field at a time. One dog is placed in a down position on the side of the field and its handler leaves it while the other dog works in the field. Then the dogs switch places. In the field, there are several heeling exercises, including heeling through a group of people. There are two or three gunshots during the heeling to test the dog&#x27;s reaction to loud noises. There are one or two recalls, three retrieves (flat, jump and A-frame), and a &quot;send out&quot;, in which the dog is directed to run away from the handler straight and fast and then lie down on command during its run. Obedience is judged on the dog&#x27;s accuracy and attitude. The dog must show enthusiasm. A dog that is uninterested or cowering scores poorly.
* Protection phase: The judge has an assistant, called the &quot;helper&quot;, who helps test the dog&#x27;s courage to protect itself and its handler, and its ability to be controlled while doing so. The helper wears a heavily padded sleeve on one arm. There are several &quot;blinds&quot; on the field, and the helper hides in a random blind. The dog is directed to search all the blinds for the helper. When it finds the helper, it indicates by barking. The dog must guard the helper to prevent them from moving until recalled by the handler. There follows a series of exercises similar to police work where the handler searches the helper and transports them to the judge. At specified points, the helper either attacks the dog or the handler, or attempts to escape. The dog must stop the attack or the escape by biting the padded sleeve. When the attack or escape stops, the dog is commanded to &quot;out&quot;, or release the sleeve. The dog must out or it is dismissed. At all times the dog must show courage to engage the helper and the temperament to obey the handler while in this high state of emotional arousal. The dog must show enthusiasm. A dog that shows fear, lack of control, or inappropriate aggression is dismissed.

==Training==

Schutzhund training, like the sport itself, has evolved over the years. Schutzhund is very much a hands-on sport. Though there are theory and techniques about training dogs, most of the training is done in clubs among other people and dogs. In a club environment, handlers and their dogs gather to practice techniques with the club equipment and experienced handlers in bite suits, called &quot;decoys&quot;. Decoys have their own training and certification processes, and a good decoy is important in training your dog.

A reliable source for training information is a good Schutzhund club. The overwhelming majority of Schutzhund training is done by owner/handlers at local clubs. There are very few clubs in the US, making books and videos a vital source of information in that country. In the US, most clubs are affiliated with the American Working Dog Federation (AWDF), United States Boxer Association (USBA), American Working Malinois Association (AWMA), United Schutzhund Clubs of America (USCA), Deutscher Verband der Gebrauchshundsportvereine (DVG), or German Shepherd Dog Club of America-Working Dog Association (GSDCA-WDA). Schutzhund clubs tend to be small, 20 or fewer members, because there is a limit to the number of dogs that can be trained in one session. Clubs often provide only limited formal assistance with tracking and obedience. To a certain extent, the clubs exist to provide the specialized resources needed to train the protection phase. However, a legitimate club will not permit a member to train only protection. Usually the more experienced members are willing to help the novice with tracking and obedience, though this is typically somewhat informal in the US.

Another function of Schutzhund clubs is to identify dogs that should not be trained in Schutzhund. Schutzhund is a challenging test of a dog&#x27;s character, and not every dog, or even every GSD, is up to the challenge. The training director of the club has a responsibility to the dog, handler, club, and society to constantly evaluate every dog and to decline to train any dog with questionable character or working ability. Training a dog that does not really want to work is stressful and frustrating for all parties involved.

Schutzhund clubs regularly hold public trials, providing the opportunity for dogs to earn titles and for handlers to assess their training progress. A tiny number of dedicated handlers have trained their dogs to title readiness strictly from books and videos. This is unlikely to succeed in most cases, because it is almost impossible to train the protection phase without a helper. A good club should be considered a necessity for Schutzhund training.

===Books and materials ===

The definitive description of Schutzhund training in the first 50 years of the sport is Col. Konrad Most&#x27;s &quot;Dog Training: A Manual&quot;, 1910. By modern standards, Most&#x27;s training is very harsh and possibly abusive. Despite this, it is also structured, consistent, and in many ways conforms to more recent ideas on learning theory. Over time, the more brutal techniques fell out of use and few trainers still follow Most&#x27;s program. In 1981, Helmut Raiser published &quot;Der Schutzhund&quot;, which radically changed Schutzhund protection training. In the US, the next great change in Schutzhund training is marked by the 1991 publication of &quot;Schutzhund Theory &amp; Training Methods&quot; by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard. Dr. Dietmar Schellenberg presents a remarkably comprehensive guide with detailed, step-by-step instructions on Schutzhund training and theory in his 1981 book &quot;Top Working Dogs, A Schutzhund Training Manual&quot;.

A number of other English-language books have been published on Schutzhund training. Some of the more influential books include &quot;Training the Competitive Working Dog&quot; by Tom Rose and Gary Patterson in 1985, &quot;Training the Behavior: Tips, Techniques and Theory for the Working Dog Trainer&quot; by Gary Patterson in 2006, and &quot;Schutzhund Obedience: Training in Drive with Gottfried Dildei&quot;, by Sheila Booth, 1992.

A recent innovation in providing information on Schutzhund training is the development of videos and DVDs. As with books, all videos and DVDs are not created equal. Viewers must exercise discretion when considering the techniques shown in videos. Just because a technique appears in a video (or book) does not mean that it is a good idea or that many Schutzhund trainers use it. There is a diversity of opinion on how to train Schutzhund dogs. This is reflected in the many conflicting opinions presented in the various videos.

==Organizations==

Many of the senior organizations for the sport have German names and are usually referred to by their initials in English-speaking countries. This list shows some of the organizations involved with the sport and their relationships to each other.


In response to political forces in Germany, in 2004 the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (SV) and the Deutscher Hundesportverein (DHV) made substantial changes to Schutzhund. The DHV adopted the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) rules that govern IPO titles, so that at least on paper the SV and DHV gave up control of the sport to the FCI. The DHV changed the name of the titles from &quot;SchH&quot; (Schutzhund) to &quot;VPG&quot; (, which roughly translates &quot;Versatility examination for working dogs&quot;). The SV has retained the &quot;SchH&quot; title names, but otherwise conforms to the DHV/FCI rules.

<doc id="147566" wikidata="Q201762" url="?curid=147566" title="Otto cycle">
<text>An Otto cycle is an idealized thermodynamic cycle that describes the functioning of a typical spark ignition piston engine. It is the thermodynamic cycle most commonly found in automobile engines.

The Otto cycle is a description of what happens to a gas as it is subjected to changes of pressure, temperature, volume, addition of heat, and removal of heat. The gas that is subjected to those changes is called the system. The system, in this case, is defined to be the fluid (gas) within the cylinder. Conversely, by describing the changes that take place within the system it also describes the system&#x27;s effect on the environment. The purpose of the Otto cycle is to study the production of net work from the system that can propel a vehicle and its occupants in the environment.

The Otto cycle is constructed from:
:Top and bottom of the loop: a pair of quasi-parallel and isentropic processes (frictionless, adiabatic reversible).
:Left and right sides of the loop: a pair of parallel isochoric processes (constant volume).

The isentropic process of compression or expansion implies that there will be no inefficiency (loss of mechanical energy), and there be no transfer of heat into or out of the system during that process. The cylinder and piston are assumed to be impermeable to heat during that time. Work is performed on the system during the lower isentropic compression process. Heat flows into the Otto cycle through the left pressurizing process and some of it flows back out through the right depressurizing process. The summation of the work added to the system plus the heat added minus the heat removed yields the net mechanical work generated by the system.

==Processes==
The processes are described by:
*Process 0–1 a mass of air is drawn into piston/cylinder arrangement at constant pressure.
*Process 1–2 is an adiabatic (isentropic) compression of the charge as the piston moves from bottom dead center (&quot;BDC&quot;) to top dead center (&quot;TDC&quot;).
*Process 2–3 is a constant-volume heat transfer to the working gas from an external source while the piston is at top dead center. This process is intended to represent the ignition of the fuel-air mixture and the subsequent rapid burning.
*Process 3–4 is an adiabatic (isentropic) expansion (power stroke).
*Process 4–1 completes the cycle by a constant-volume process in which heat is rejected from the air while the piston is at bottom dead center.
*Process 1–0 the mass of air is released to the atmosphere in a constant pressure process.

The Otto cycle consists of isentropic compression, heat addition at constant volume, isentropic expansion, and rejection of heat at constant volume. In the case of a four-stroke Otto cycle, technically there are two additional processes: one for the exhaust of waste heat and combustion products at constant pressure (isobaric), and one for the intake of cool oxygen-rich air also at constant pressure; however, these are often omitted in a simplified analysis. Even though those two processes are critical to the functioning of a real engine, wherein the details of heat transfer and combustion chemistry are relevant, for the simplified analysis of the thermodynamic cycle, it is more convenient to assume that all of the waste-heat is removed during a single volume change.

==History==
The four-stroke engine was first patented by Alphonse Beau de Rochas in 1861. Before, in about 1854–57, two Italians (Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci) invented an engine that was rumored to be very similar, but the patent was lost.

The first person to build a working four-stroke engine, a stationary engine using a coal gas-air mixture for fuel (a gas engine), was German engineer Nicolaus Otto. This is why the four-stroke principle today is commonly known as the Otto cycle and four-stroke engines using spark plugs often are called Otto engines.

==Processes==
The cycle has four parts: a mass containing a mixture of fuel and oxygen is drawn into the cylinder by the descending piston, it is compressed by the piston rising, the mass is ignited by a spark releasing energy in the form of heat, the resulting gas is allowed to expand as it pushes the piston down, and finally the mass is exhausted as the piston rises a second time. As the piston is capable of moving along the cylinder, the volume of the gas changes with its position in the cylinder. The compression and expansion processes induced on the gas by the movement of the piston are idealized as reversible, i.e., no useful work is lost through turbulence or friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas during those two processes. After the expansion is completed in the cylinder, the remaining heat is extracted and finally the gas is exhausted to the environment. Mechanical work is produced during the expansion process and some of that used to compress the air mass of the next cycle. The mechanical work produced minus that used for the compression process is the net work gained and that can be used for propulsion or for driving other machines. Alternatively the net work gained is the difference between the heat produced and the heat removed.
===Process 0–1 intake stroke (blue shade)===
A mass of air (working fluid) is drawn into the cylinder, from 0 to 1, at atmospheric pressure (constant pressure) through the open intake valve, while the exhaust valve is closed during this process. The intake valve closes at point 1.

===Process 1–2 compression stroke (&quot;B&quot; on diagrams)===
Piston moves from crank end (BDC, bottom dead centre and maximum volume) to cylinder head end (&quot;TDC&quot;, top dead centre and minimum volume) as the working gas with initial state 1 is compressed isentropically to state point 2, through compression ratio . Mechanically this is the isentropic compression of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder, also known as the compression stroke. This isentropic process assumes that no mechanical energy is lost due to friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas, hence the process is reversible. The compression process requires that mechanical work be added to the working gas. Generally the compression ratio is around 9–10:1 for a typical engine.

===Process 2–3 ignition phase (&quot;C&quot; on diagrams)===
The piston is momentarily at rest at &quot;TDC&quot;. During this instant, which is known as the ignition phase, the air/fuel mixture remains in a small volume at the top of the compression stroke. Heat is added to the working fluid by the combustion of the injected fuel, with the volume essentially being held constant. The pressure rises and the ratio formula_1 is called the &quot;explosion ratio&quot;.

===Process 3–4 expansion stroke (&quot;D&quot; on diagrams)===
The increased high pressure exerts a force on the piston and pushes it towards the &quot;BDC&quot;. Expansion of working fluid takes place isentropically and work is done by the system on the piston. The volume ratio formula_2 is called the &quot;isentropic expansion ratio&quot;. (For the Otto cycle is the same as the compression ratio formula_3). Mechanically this is the expansion of the hot gaseous mixture in the cylinder known as expansion (power) stroke.

===Process 4–1 idealized heat rejection (&quot;A&quot; on diagrams)===
The piston is momentarily at rest at &quot;BDC&quot;. The working gas pressure drops instantaneously from point 4 to point 1 during a constant volume process as heat is removed to an idealized external sink that is brought into contact with the cylinder head. In modern internal combustion engines, the heat-sink may be surrounding air (for low powered engines), or a circulating fluid, such as coolant. The gas has returned to state 1.

===Process 1–0 exhaust stroke===
The exhaust valve opens at point 1. As the piston moves from &quot;BDC&quot; (point 1) to &quot;TDC&quot; (point 0) with the exhaust valve opened, the gaseous mixture is vented to the atmosphere and the process starts anew.

==Cycle analysis==
In this process 1–2 the piston does work on the gas and in process 3–4 the gas does work on the piston during those isentropic compression and expansion processes, respectively. Processes 2–3 and 4–1 are isochoric processes; heat is transferred into the system from 2—3 and out of the system from 4–1 but no work is done on the system or extracted from the system during those processes. No work is done during an isochoric (constant volume) process because addition or removal of work from a system requires the movement of the boundaries of the system; hence, as the cylinder volume does not change, no shaft work is added to or removed from the system.

Four different equations are used to describe those four processes. A simplification is made by assuming changes of the kinetic and potential energy that take place in the system (mass of gas) can be neglected and then applying the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation) to the mass of gas as it changes state as characterized by the gas&#x27;s temperature, pressure, and volume.

During a complete cycle, the gas returns to its original state of temperature, pressure and volume, hence the net internal energy change of the system (gas) is zero. As a result, the energy (heat or work) added to the system must be offset by energy (heat or work) that leaves the system. In the analysis of thermodynamic systems, the convention is to account energy that enters the system as positive and energy that leaves the system is accounted as negative.
Equation 1a.

During a complete cycle, the net change of energy of the system is zero:

:formula_4

The above states that the system (the mass of gas) returns to the original thermodynamic state it was in at the start of the cycle.

Where formula_5 is energy added to the system from 1–2–3 and formula_6 is energy removed from the system from 3–4–1. In terms of work and heat added to the system
Equation 1b:

:formula_7

Each term of the equation can be expressed in terms of the internal energy of the gas at each point in the process:

:formula_8

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

The energy balance Equation 1b becomes

:formula_12

To illustrate the example we choose some values to the points in the illustration:
:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16
These values are arbitrarily but rationally selected. The work and heat terms can then be calculated.

The energy added to the system as work during the compression from 1 to 2 is

:formula_17

The energy added to the system as heat from point 2 to 3 is

:formula_18

The energy removed from the system as work during the expansion from 3 to 4 is

:formula_19

The energy removed from the system as heat from point 4 to 1 is

:formula_20

The energy balance is

:formula_21

Note that energy added to the system is counted as positive and energy leaving the system is counted as negative and the summation is zero as expected for a complete cycle that returns the system to its original state.

From the energy balance the work out of the system is:

:formula_22

The net energy out of the system as work is -1, meaning the system has produced one net unit of energy that leaves the system in the form of work.

The net heat out of the system is:

:formula_23

As energy added to the system as heat is positive. From the above it appears as if the system gained one unit of heat. This matches the energy produced by the system as work out of the system.
Thermal efficiency is the quotient of the net work from the system, to the heat added to system.
Equation 2:

:formula_24

:formula_25

Alternatively, thermal efficiency can be derived by strictly heat added and heat rejected.

:formula_26

Supplying the fictitious values

formula_27

In the Otto cycle, there is no heat transfer during the process 1–2 and 3–4 as they are isentropic processes. Heat is supplied only during the constant volume processes 2–3 and heat is rejected only during the constant volume processes 4–1.
The above values are absolute values that might, for instance , have units of joules (assuming the MKS system of units are to be used) and would be of use for a particular engine with particular dimensions. In the study of thermodynamic systems the extensive quantities such as energy, volume, or entropy (versus intensive quantities of temperature and pressure) are placed on a unit mass basis, and so too are the calculations, making those more general and therefore of more general use. Hence, each term involving an extensive quantity could be divided by the mass, giving the terms units of joules/kg (specific energy), meters3/kg (specific volume), or joules/(kelvin·kg) (specific entropy, heat capacity) etc. and would be represented using lower case letters, u, v, s, etc.
Equation 1 can now be related to the specific heat equation for constant volume. The specific heats are particularly useful for thermodynamic calculations involving the ideal gas model.

:formula_28

Rearranging yields:

:formula_29

Inserting the specific heat equation into the thermal efficiency equation (Equation 2) yields.

:formula_30

Upon rearrangement:

:formula_31

Next, noting from the diagrams formula_32 (see isentropic relations for an ideal gas), thus both of these can be omitted. The equation then reduces to:
Equation 2:
:formula_33

Since the Otto cycle uses isentropic processes during the compression (process 1 to 2) and expansion (process 3 to 4) the isentropic equations of ideal gases and the constant pressure/volume relations can be used to yield Equations 3 &amp; 4.
Equation 3:
:formula_34
Equation 4:
:formula_35

::where

::formula_36

::formula_37 is the specific heat ratio

::::The derivation of the previous equations are found by solving these four equations respectively (where formula_38 is the specific gas constant):

::::formula_39

::::formula_40

::::formula_41

::::formula_42

Further simplifying Equation 4, where formula_43 is the compression ratio formula_44:
Equation 5:
:formula_45

From inverting Equation 4 and inserting it into Equation 2 the final thermal efficiency can be expressed as:
Equation 6:
:formula_46

From analyzing equation 6 it is evident that the Otto cycle efficiency depends directly upon the compression ratio formula_43. Since the formula_48 for air is 1.4, an increase in formula_43 will produce an increase in formula_50. However, the formula_51 for combustion products of the fuel/air mixture is often taken at approximately 1.3.
The foregoing discussion implies that it is more efficient to have a high compression ratio. The standard ratio is approximately 10:1 for typical automobiles. Usually this does not increase much because of the possibility of autoignition, or &quot;knock&quot;, which places an upper limit on the compression ratio. During the compression process 1–2 the temperature rises, therefore an increase in the compression ratio causes an increase in temperature. Autoignition occurs when the temperature of the fuel/air mixture becomes too high before it is ignited by the flame front. The compression stroke is intended to compress the products before the flame ignites the mixture. If the compression ratio is increased, the mixture may auto-ignite before the compression stroke is complete, leading to &quot;engine knocking&quot;. This can damage engine components and will decrease the brake horsepower of the engine.

== Power ==
The power produced by the Otto cycle is an energy developed per unit of time. The Otto engines are called four-stroke engines. 
The intake stroke and compression stroke require one rotation of the engine crankshaft. The power stroke and exhaust stroke require another rotation. For two rotations there is one work generating stroke..

From the above cycle analysis the net work produced by the system :

:formula_52

(again, using the sign convention, the minus sign implies energy is leaving the system as work)

If the units used were MKS the cycle would have produced one joule of energy in the form of work. For an engine of a particular displacement, such as one liter, the mass of gas of the system can be calculated assuming the engine is operating at standard temperature (20 °C) and pressure (1 atm). Using the Universal Gas Law the mass of one liter of gas is at room temperature and sea level pressure:

:formula_53

:&quot;V&quot;=0.001 m3, &quot;R&quot;=0.286 kJ/(kg·K), &quot;T&quot;=293 K, &quot;P&quot;=101.3 kN/m2

:&quot;M&quot;=0.00121 kg

At an engine speed of 3000 RPM there are 1500 work-strokes/minute or 25 work-strokes/second.

:formula_54

Power is 25 times that since there are 25 work-strokes/second

:formula_55

If the engine uses multiple cylinders with the same displacement, the result would be multiplied by the number of cylinders. These results are the product of the values of the internal energy that were assumed for the four states of the system at the end each of the four strokes (two rotations). They were selected only for the sake of illustration, and are obviously of low value. Substitution of actual values from an actual engine would produce results closer to that of the engine. Whose results would be higher than the actual engine as there are many simplifying assumptions made in the analysis that overlook inefficiencies. Such results would overestimate the power output.

== Increasing power and efficiency ==

The difference between the exhaust and intake pressures and temperatures means that some increase in efficiency can be gained by use of a turbocharger, removing from the exhaust flow some part of the remaining energy and transferring that to the intake flow to increase the intake pressure. A gas turbine can extract useful work energy from the exhaust stream and that can then be used to pressurize the intake air. The pressure and temperature of the exhausting gases would be reduced as they expand through the gas turbine and that work is then applied to the intake gas stream, increasing its pressure and temperature. The transfer of energy amounts to an efficiency improvement and the resulting power density of the engine is also improved. The intake air is typically cooled so as to reduce its volume as the work produced per stroke is a direct function of the amount of mass taken into the cylinder; denser air will produce more work per cycle. Practically speaking the intake air mass temperature must also be reduced to prevent premature ignition in a petrol fueled engine; hence, an intercooler is used to remove some energy as heat and so reduce the intake temperature. Such a scheme both increases the engine&#x27;s efficiency and power.

The application of a supercharger driven by the crankshaft does increase the power output (power density) but does not increase efficiency as it uses some of the net work produced by the engine to pressurize the intake air and fails to extract otherwise wasted energy associated with the flow of exhaust at high temperature and a pressure to the ambient.

<doc id="147569" wikidata="Q3224368" url="?curid=147569" title="Poppet valve">
<text>A poppet valve (also sometimes called mushroom valve) is a valve typically used to control the timing and quantity of petrol (gas) or vapour flow into or out of an engine, but with many other applications.

It consists of a hole or open-ended chamber, usually round or oval in cross-section, and a plug, usually a disk shape on the end of a shaft known as a valve stem. The working end of this plug, the valve face, is typically ground at a 45° bevel to seal against a corresponding valve seat ground into the rim of the chamber being sealed. The shaft travels through a valve guide to maintain its alignment.

A pressure differential on either side of the valve can assist or impair its performance. In exhaust applications higher pressure against the valve helps to seal it, and in intake applications lower pressure helps open it.

==Etymology==
The word poppet shares etymology with &quot;puppet&quot;: it is from the Middle English &quot;popet&quot; (&quot;youth&quot; or &quot;doll&quot;), from Middle French &quot;poupette&quot;, which is a diminutive of &quot;poupée&quot;. The use of the word &quot;poppet&quot; to describe a valve comes from the same word applied to marionettes, which, like the poppet valve, move bodily in response to remote motion transmitted linearly. In the past, &quot;puppet valve&quot; was a synonym for &quot;poppet valve&quot;; however, this usage of &quot;puppet&quot; is now obsolete.

== Design ==
The poppet valve is different from both slide and oscillating valves. Instead of &quot;sliding&quot; or &quot;rocking&quot; over a seat to uncover a port, the poppet valve lifts from the seat with a movement perpendicular to the plane of the port. The main advantage of the poppet valve is that it has no movement on the seat, thus requiring no lubrication.

In most cases it is beneficial to have a &quot;balanced poppet&quot; in a direct-acting valve. Less force is needed to move the poppet because all forces on the poppet are nullified by equal and opposite forces. The solenoid coil has to counteract only the spring force.

Poppet valves are best known for their use in internal combustion and steam engines, but are used in general pneumatic and hydraulic circuits where a pulsed flow control is wanted. The pulse can be controlled by a combination of differential pressure and spring load as required.

Presta and Schrader valves used on pneumatic tyres are examples of poppet valves. The Presta valve has no spring and relies on a pressure differential for opening and closing while being inflated.

Poppet valves are employed extensively in the launching of torpedoes from submarines. Many systems use compressed air to expel the torpedo from the tube, and the poppet valve recovers a large quantity of this air (along with a significant amount of seawater) in order to reduce the tell-tale cloud of bubbles that might otherwise betray the boat&#x27;s submerged position.

== Usage in internal combustion engines ==

Poppet valves are used in most piston engines to control the flow of intake and exhaust gasses through the cylinder head and into the combustion chamber. The side of the poppet valve which sits inside the combustion chamber is a flat disk, while the other side tapers from the disk shape to a thin cylindrical rod called a &quot;valve stem&quot;.

=== Materials and durability ===
In a typical modern mass-production engines, the valves are solid and made from steel alloys. However some engines use hollow valves filled with sodium, to improve heat transfer.

Many modern engines use an aluminium cylinder head. Although this provides better heat transfer, it requires steel valve seat inserts to be used; in older cast iron cylinder heads, the valve seats are often part of the cylinder head. A gap of is present around the valve stem, therefore a valve stem oil seal is used to prevent oil being drawn into the intake manifold and combustion chamber. Typically, a rubber lip-type seal is used. A common symptom of worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals is a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe at times of increased intake manifold vacuum, such as when the throttle is abruptly closed.

Historically, valves had two major issues, both of which have been solved by improvements in modern metallurgy. The first was that in early internal combustion engines, high wear rates of valves meant that a valve job to regrind the valves was required at regular intervals. Secondly, lead additives had been used in petrol (gasoline) since the 1920s, to prevent engine knocking and provide lubrication for the valves. Modern materials for the valves (such as stainless steel) and valve seats (such as stellite) allowed for leaded petrol to be phased out in many industrialised countries by the mid-1990s.

===Sodium Cooled Exhaust Valves===
Exhaust valves are subject to very high temperatures and in extreme high performance applications may be sodium cooled. The valve is hollow and filled with sodium, which melts at a relatively low temperature and, in its liquid state, convects heat away from the hot valve head to the stem where it may be conducted to the cylinder head. Common in second world war piston engines, now only found in high performance engines.

=== Actuation method ===

Early engines in the 1890s and 1900s used an &quot;automatic&quot; intake valve, which was opened by the vacuum in the combustion chamber and closed by a light spring. The exhaust valve had to be mechanically driven to open it against the pressure in the cylinder. Use of automatic valves simplified the mechanism, but valve float limited the speed at which the engine could run, and by about 1905 mechanically operated inlet valves were increasingly adopted for vehicle engines.

Mechanical operation is usually by pressing on the end of the valve stem, with a spring generally being used to return the valve to the closed position. At high engine speeds (RPM), the weight of the valvetrain means the valve spring cannot close the valve as quickly enough, leading to valve float or &quot;valve bounce&quot;. Desmodromic valves use a second rocker arm to mechanically close the valves (instead of using valve springs) and are sometimes used to avoid valve float in engines that operate at high RPM.

In most mass-produced engines, the camshaft(s) control the opening of the valves, via several intermediate mechanisms (such as pushrods, roller rockers and valve lifters). The shape of the cams on the camshaft influence the valve lift and determine the timing of when the valves open.

=== Number and location of valves ===

Early flathead engines (also called &quot;L-head engines&quot;) saw the valves located beside to the cylinder(s), in an &quot;upside down&quot; orientation parallel to the cylinder. Although this design made for simplified and cheap construction, the twisting path of the intake and exhaust gasses had major drawbacks for the airflow, which limited engine RPM and could cause the engine block to overheat under sustained heavy load. The flathead design evolved into intake over exhaust (IOE) engine, used in many early motorcycles and several cars. In an IOE engine, the intake valves were located directly above the cylinder (like the later &quot;overhead valve engines&quot;), however the exhaust valve remains beside the cylinder in an upside down orientation.

These designs were largely replaced by the overhead valve (OHV) engine between 1904 until late-1960s/early-to-mid 1970s, whereby the intake and exhaust valves are both located directly above the cylinder (with the camshaft located at the bottom of the engine). In turn, OHV engines were largely replaced by the overhead camshaft (OHC) engines between 1950s until 1980s. The location of the valves is broadly the same between OHV and OHC engines, however OHC engines saw the camshaft located to the top of the engine with the valves and OHC engines often have more valves per cylinder. Most OHC engines have an extra intake and an extra exhaust valve per cylinder (four-valve cylinder head), compared with the design of two valves per cylinder used by most OHV engines. However some OHC engines have used three or five valves per cylinder.
== Usage in steam engines ==
James Watt was using poppet valves to control the flow of steam into the cylinders of his beam engines in the 1770s. A sectional illustration of Watt&#x27;s beam engine of 1774 using the device is found in Thurston 1878:98, and Lardner (1840) provides an illustrated description of Watt&#x27;s use of the poppet valve.

When used in high-pressure applications, for example, as admission valves on steam engines, the same pressure that helps seal poppet valves also contributes significantly to the force required to open them. This has led to the development of the balanced poppet or double beat valve, in which two valve plugs ride on a common stem, with the pressure on one plug largely balancing the pressure on the other. In these valves, the force needed to open the valve is determined by the pressure and the difference between the areas of the two valve openings. Sickels patented a valve gear for double-beat poppet valves in 1842. Criticism was reported in the journal Science in 1889 of equilibrium poppet valves (called by the article the &quot;double or balanced or American puppet valve&quot;) in use for paddle steamer engines, that by its nature it must leak 15 percent.
Poppet valves have been used on steam locomotives, often in conjunction with Lentz or Caprotti valve gear. British examples include:
* LNER Class B12
* LNER Class D49
* LNER Class P2
* LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0
* BR standard class 5
* BR standard class 8 71000 Duke of Gloucester.

Sentinel Waggon Works used poppet valves in their steam wagons and steam locomotives. Reversing was achieved by a simple sliding camshaft system.

Many locomotives in France, particularly those rebuilt to the designs of Andre Chapelon, such as the SNCF 240P, used Lentz oscillating-cam poppet valves, which were operated by the Walschaert valve gear the locomotives were already equipped with.

The poppet valve was also used on the American Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s T1 duplex locomotives, although the valves commonly failed because the locomotives were commonly operated in excess of , and the valves were not meant for the stresses of such speeds. The poppet valves also gave the locomotive a distinctive &quot;chuffing&quot; sound.

One poppet valve design was invented in 1833 by American E.A.G. Young of the Newcastle and Frenchtown Railroad. Young had patented his idea, but the U.S. Patent Office fire of 1836 destroyed all records of it.

<doc id="147570" wikidata="Q253167" url="?curid=147570" title="Margaux Hemingway">
<text>Margaux Louise Hemingway (born Margot Louise Hemingway; February 16, 1954 – July 1, 1996) was an American fashion model and actress. The granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway, she gained independent fame as a supermodel in the 1970s, appearing on the covers of magazines including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. 

She signed a million-dollar contract with Fabergé Inc. as the spokesmodel for Babe perfume. Her later years were marred by highly publicized episodes of addiction and depression, before her suicide from a drug overdose around July 1, 1996, at the age of 42.

== Early life ==
Margot Louise Hemingway was born February 16, 1954, in Portland, Oregon, the second of three daughters born to Byra Louise (née Whittlesey) and Jack Hemingway (eldest child of writer Ernest Hemingway). When she learned that she was named after the wine Château Margaux, which her parents drank on the night she was conceived, she changed the spelling from &quot;Margot&quot; to &quot;Margaux&quot; to match. She had two sisters, actress Mariel Hemingway and Joan (nicknamed Muffet).

During her childhood, the family relocated from Oregon to Cuba, where her grandfather had lived, then to San Francisco, and later to Idaho, where they lived on her grandfather&#x27;s farm in Ketchum, adjacent to The family took trips each summer back to Oregon with the daughters&#x27; godmother, who owned a farm in Salem. She attended the Catlin Gabel School in Portland for her junior year.

Margaux struggled with several disorders beginning in her teenage years, including alcoholism, depression, bulimia, and epilepsy. With her permission, a video recording was made of her therapy session related to her bulimia, and it was broadcast on television. She also had dyslexia. In the 1990s, Margaux reported that she had been sexually abused by her father as a child. In 2013, her younger sister Mariel said in the documentary &quot;Running from Crazy&quot; that both Margaux and their older sister Muffet had been sexually abused by their father.

== Career ==
===1972–1975: modeling===
Hemingway was tall and had success as a model, including her million-dollar contract with Fabergé as the spokesmodel for Babe perfume in the 1970s. This was the first million-dollar contract ever awarded to a fashion model. She also appeared on the covers of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and &quot;Vogue&quot;, as well as on the June 16, 1975, cover of &quot;TIME&quot;, which dubbed her one of the &quot;new beauties&quot;. The September 1, 1975, cover issue of &quot;Vogue&quot; called Hemingway &quot;New York&#x27;s New Supermodel&quot;.

During the height of her modeling career in the mid- to late 1970s, Hemingway was a regular attendee of New York City&#x27;s exclusive discothèque Studio 54, often in the company of such celebrities as Halston, Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Grace Jones, and Andy Warhol. At such social mixers, she began to use alcohol and drugs.

===1976–1996: film career===
Hemingway made her film debut in the Lamont Johnson-directed rape and revenge film &quot;Lipstick&quot; (1976), alongside her 14-year-old sister Mariel, and Anne Bancroft. In it, she plays a fashion model who is terrorized by a rapist. The film&#x27;s violent depiction of rape led it to be labeled an exploitation film, though in later years it had success as a cult film.

She followed this with a supporting role in the Italian horror film &quot;Killer Fish&quot; (1979), opposite Lee Majors and Karen Black. Her following project was the comedy &quot;They Call Me Bruce?&quot; in 1982. In 1984, Hemingway had a supporting part in &quot;Over the Brooklyn Bridge&quot;, opposite Elliott Gould and Shelley Winters. After a skiing accident in 1984, Hemingway gained , ending up at nearly , and became increasingly depressed. In 1987, she checked into the Betty Ford Center.

Attempting to make a comeback, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; in May 1990, and asked the magazine to hire Zachary Selig as the creative director for her cover story. It was shot in Belize. Despite her attempts, Hemingway&#x27;s budding film career began to falter, and she took roles in several B-movies, including &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (1984) and &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; (1991).

Hemingway continued to support herself by appearing in a small number of direct-to-video films into the 1990s, autographing her nude photos from &quot;Playboy&quot;, and endorsing a psychic telephone hotline owned by her cousin, Adiel Hemingway. Shortly before her death, she was set to host the outdoor adventure series &quot;Wild Guide&quot; on the Discovery Channel.

==Personal life==

Hemingway&#x27;s first marriage, to Errol Wetson (Wetanson), ended in divorce. They met when, at age 19, she accompanied her father to the Plaza Hotel in New York City on a business trip. Four months later she moved from Idaho to New York City to live with Wetson at 12 East 72nd Street, which was owned by heiress Gloria Vanderbilt.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979, Hemingway married French filmmaker Bernard Faucher in and they lived in Paris for a year. She divorced him in 1985 after 

Hemingway had strained relationships with members of her family. She had a tense relationship with her mother, though they reconciled prior to Byra&#x27;s death from cancer in 1988. She also competed with her younger sister Mariel, who received greater accolades for her acting. In the 1990s, Hemingway alleged that her father, Jack, had molested her as a child. Her father and stepmother, Angela, resented the allegations and stopped speaking to her. Angela told &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Jack and I did not talk to her for two years. She constantly lies. The whole family won&#x27;t have anything to do with her. She&#x27;s nothing but an angry woman.&quot;

A 2013 television documentary film &quot;Running from Crazy&quot;, in which Margaux&#x27;s sister Mariel speaks of the Hemingway family history of alcoholism, drug addiction, molestation, and suicide, contains clips filmed by Margaux.

==Death==

On July 1, 1996, Hemingway was found dead in her studio apartment in Santa Monica. Her body was badly decomposed, and the precise date of death could not be determined. The autopsy report and California death records therefore list July 1 as her date of death. She had taken an overdose of phenobarbital, according to the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s toxicology report one month later, although her family had difficulty accepting the fact of her suicide.

Hemingway was interred at the Hemingway family plot at Ketchum Cemetery in Ketchum, Idaho.

Mariel Hemingway&#x27;s husband told &quot;People&quot; in 1996 that, &quot;This [year] was the best I&#x27;d seen [Margaux] in years. She had gotten herself back together&quot;, but in a December 2005 episode of &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Mariel said she now accepted her sister&#x27;s death as a suicide.

<text>A camshaft is a shaft that contains a row of pointed cams in order to convert rotational motion to reciprocating motion. Camshafts are used in piston engines (to operate the intake and exhaust valves), mechanically controlled ignition systems and early electric motor speed controllers.

Camshafts in piston engines are usually made from steel or cast iron, and the shape of the cams greatly affects the engine&#x27;s characteristics.

==History==
Trip hammers are one of the early uses of a form of cam to convert rotating motion, e.g. from a waterwheel, into the reciprocating motion of a hammer used in forging or to pound grain. Evidence for these exists back to the Han dynasty in China, and they were widespread by the medieval period.

Camshafts were first described by Ismail al-Jazari in 1206. Once the rotative version of the steam engine was developed in the late 18th century, the operation of the valve gear was usually by an eccentric, which turned the rotation of the crankshaft into reciprocating motion of the valve gear, normally a slide valve. Camshafts more like those seen later in internal combustion engines were used in some steam engines, most commonly where high pressure steam (such as that generated from a flash steam boiler), required the use of poppet valves, or piston valves. For examples see the Uniflow steam engine, and the Gardner-Serpollet steam cars, which also included axially sliding the camshaft to achieve variable valve timing.

Among the first cars to utilize engines with single overhead camshafts were the Maudslay, designed by Alexander Craig and introduced in 1902 and the Marr Auto Car designed by Michigan native Walter Lorenzo Marr in 1903.

== Piston engines ==
In piston engines, the camshaft is used to operate the intake and exhaust valves. The camshaft consists of a cylindrical rod running the length of the cylinder bank with a number of cams (discs with protruding &quot;cam lobes&quot;) along its length, one for each valve. As the cam rotates, the lobe presses on the valve (or an intermediate mechanism), thus pushing it open. Typically, a &quot;valve spring&quot; is used to push the valve in the opposite direction, thus closing the valve once the cam rotates past the highest point of its lobe.

=== Construction ===
Camshafts are made from metal and are usually solid, although hollow camshafts are sometimes used. The materials used for a camshaft are usually either: 
* Cast iron: Commonly used in high volume production, chilled iron camshafts have good wear resistance since the chilling process hardens them. 
* Billet steel: For high-performance engines or camshafts produced in small quantities, steel billet is sometimes used. This is a much more time-consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. The method of construction is usually either forging, machining, casting or hydroforming.

=== Location in engine ===
Many early internal combustion engines used a &quot;cam-in-block&quot; layout (such flathead, IOE or T-head layouts), whereby the camshaft is located within the engine block near the bottom of the engine. Early flathead engines locate the valves in the block and the cam acts directly on those valves. In an overhead valve engine, which came later, the cam follower presses on a pushrod which transfers the motion to the top of the engine, where a rocker opens the intake/exhaust valve. Although largely replaced by SOHC and DOHC layouts in modern automobile engines, the older overhead valve layout is still used in many industrial engines, due to its smaller size and lower cost.

As engine speeds increased through the 20th century, single overhead camshaft (SOHC) engines— where the camshaft is located within the cylinder head near the top of the engine— became increasingly common, followed by double overhead camshaft (DOHC) engines in more recent years. For OHC and DOHC engines, the camshaft operates the valve directly or via a short rocker arm.

The valvetrain layout is defined according to the number of camshafts per cylinder bank. Therefore, a V6 engine with a total of four camshafts - two camshafts per cylinder bank - is usually referred to as a &quot;double overhead camshaft&quot; engine (although colloquially they are sometimes referred to as &quot;quad-cam&quot; engines).

=== Drive systems ===
Accurate control of the position and speed of the camshaft is critically important in allowing the engine to operate correctly. The camshaft is usually driven either directly, via a toothed rubber &quot;timing belt&quot;&#x27; or via a steel roller &quot;timing chain&quot;. Gears have also occasionally been used to drive the camshaft. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor, oil pump, fuel pump and occasionally the power steering pump.

Alternative drive systems used in the past include a vertical shaft with bevel gears at each end (e.g. pre-World War I Peugeot and Mercedes Grand Prix Cars and the Kawasaki W800 motorcycle) or a triple eccentric with connecting rods (e.g. the Leyland Eight car).

In a two-stroke engine that uses a camshaft, each valve is opened once for every rotation of the crankshaft; in these engines, the camshaft rotates at the same speed as the crankshaft. In a four-stroke engine, the valves are opened only half as often, therefore the camshaft is geared to rotate at half the speed of the crankshaft.

=== Performance characteristics ===
==== Duration ====
The camshaft&#x27;s duration determines how long the intake/exhaust valve is open for, therefore it is a key factor in the amount of power that an engine produces. A longer duration can increase power at high engine speeds (RPM), however this can come with the trade-off of less torque being produced at low RPM.

The duration measurement for a camshaft is affected by the amount of lift that is chosen as the start and finish point of the measurement. A lift value of is often used as a standard measurement procedure, since this is considered most representative of the lift range that defines the RPM range in which the engine produces peak power. The power and idle characteristics of a camshaft with the same duration rating that has been determined using different lift points (for example 0.006 or 0.002 inches) could be much different to a camshaft with a duration rated using lift points of 0.05 inches.

A secondary effect of increased duration can be increased &quot;overlap&quot;, which determines the length of time that both the intake and exhaust valves are open. It is overlap which most affects idle quality, in as much as the &quot;blow-through&quot; of the intake charge immediately back out through the exhaust valve which occurs during overlap reduces engine efficiency, and is greatest during low RPM operation. In general, increasing a camshaft&#x27;s duration typically increases the overlap, unless the Lobe Separation Angle is increased to compensate.

A lay person can readily spot a long duration camshaft by observing the broad surface of the lobe where the cam pushes the valve open for a large number of degrees of crankshaft rotation. This will be visibly greater than the more pointed camshaft lobe bump that is observed on lower duration camshafts.

==== Lift ====
The camshaft&#x27;s lift determines the distance between the valve and the valve seat (i.e. how far open the valve is). The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, thus increasing the power produced. Higher valve lift can have the same effect of increasing peak power as increased duration, without the downsides caused by increased valve overlap. Most overhead valve engines have a rocker ratio of greater than one, therefore the distance that the valve opens (the &quot;valve lift&quot;) is greater than the distance from the peak of the camshaft&#x27;s lobe to the base circle (the &quot;camshaft lift&quot;).

There are several factors which limit the maximum amount of lift possible for a given engine. Firstly, increasing lift brings the valves closer to the piston, so excessive lift could cause the valves to get struck and damaged by the piston. Secondly, increased lift means a steeper camshaft profile is required, which increases the forces needed to open the valve. A related issue is &quot;valve float&quot; at high RPM, where the spring tension does not provide sufficient force to either keep the valve following the cam at its apex or prevent the valve from bouncing when it returns to the valve seat. This could be a result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the cam follower separates from the cam lobe (due to the valvetrain inertia being greater than the closing force of the valve spring), leaving the valve open for longer than intended. Valve float causes a loss of power at high RPM and in extreme situations can result in a bent valve if it gets struck by the piston.

==== Timing ====
The timing (phase angle) of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft can be adjusted to shift an engine&#x27;s power band to a different RPM range. Advancing the camshaft (shifting it to ahead of the crankshaft timing) increases low RPM torque, while retarding the camshaft (shifting it to after the crankshaft) increases high RPM power. The required changes are relatively small, often in the order of 5 degrees.

Modern engines which have variable valve timing are often able to adjust the timing of the camshaft to suit the RPM of the engine at any given time. This avoids the above compromise required when choosing a fixed cam timing for use at both high and low RPM.

==== Lobe separation angle ====
The &quot;lobe separation angle&quot; (LSA, also called &quot;lobe centreline angle&quot;) is the angle between the centreline of the intake lobes and the centreline of the exhaust lobes. A higher LSA reduces overlap, which improves idle quality and intake vacuum, however using a wider LSA to compensate for excessive duration can reduce power and torque outputs. In general, the optimal LSA for a given engine is related to the ratio of the cylinder volume to intake valve area.

==== Functionality ====
Camshafts are integral components of internal combustion engines, responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the engine&#x27;s intake and exhaust valves. As the camshaft rotates, its lobes push against the valves, allowing the intake of air and fuel and the expulsion of exhaust gases. This synchronized process is crucial for optimizing engine performance, fuel efficiency, and emissions control. Without precisely engineered camshafts, the smooth and efficient operation of an engine would be compromised.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelfordcams.com/vehicle-camshafts &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternatives ===
The most common methods of valve actuation involve camshafts and valve springs, however alternate systems have occasionally been used on internal combustion engines:
* Desmodromic valves, where the valves are positively closed by a cam and leverage system rather than springs. This system has been used on various Ducati racing and road motorcycles since it was introduced on the 1956 Ducati 125 Desmo racing bike.
* Camless piston engine, which use electromagnetic, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators. First used in turbocharged Renault Formula 1 engines in the mid-1980s and slated for road car use in the Koenigsegg Gemera.
* Wankel engine, a rotary engine which uses neither pistons nor valves. Most notably used by Mazda from the 1967 Mazda Cosmo until the Mazda RX-8 was discontinued in 2012.

== Electric motor speed controllers ==
Before the advent of solid state electronics, &quot;camshaft controllers&quot; were used to control the speed of electric motors. A camshaft, driven by an electric motor or a pneumatic motor, was used to operate contactors in sequence. By this means, resistors or tap changers were switched in or out of the circuit to vary the speed of the main motor. This system was mainly used in electric train motors (i.e. EMUs and locomotives).

<text>Ireland (, ; ; Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in Northwestern Europe. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George&#x27;s Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world. Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.

The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, with most of it being non-native conifer plantations. The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.

Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards. During this period Ireland was divided into many petty kingships under provincial kingships (Cúige &quot;fifth&quot; of the traditional provinces) vying for dominance and the title of High King of Ireland. In the late 8th to early 11th century AD, Viking raids and settlement took place culminating in the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014 which resulted in the ending of Viking power in Ireland. Following the 12th-century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades until it declared a republic in 1948 (Republic of Ireland Act, 1948) and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In 1973, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland as part of it, joined the European Economic Community. Following a referendum vote in 2016, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, left the European Union (EU) in 2020. Northern Ireland was granted a limited special status and allowed to operate within the EU single market for goods without being in the European Union.

Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance. The island&#x27;s culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.

==Name==
The names &quot;Ireland&quot; and derive from Old Irish &quot;Ériu&quot;, a goddess in Irish mythology first recorded in the ninth century. The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;&quot;, referring to flowing water.

==History==
===Prehistoric Ireland===

During the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge (but not a land bridge) forming between Ireland and Great Britain. By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by 12,000 BC Ireland was completely separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6,100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe. Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare. Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago.

By about 8,000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island.

Some time before 4,000 BC, Neolithic settlers introduced cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, built large timber buildings, and stone monuments. The earliest evidence for farming in Ireland or Great Britain is from Ferriter&#x27;s Cove, County Kerry, where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep&#x27;s tooth were carbon-dated to . Field systems were developed in different parts of Ireland, including at the , that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3,500 BC and 3,000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.

The Bronze Age began around 2,500 BC, with technology changing people&#x27;s everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing oxen, weaving textiles, brewing alcohol and metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs.

====Emergence of Celtic Ireland====
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture, with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.
The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni were said to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.

The theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is &#x27;an especially hazardous exercise&#x27;. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European &quot;Atlantic Celts&quot; showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.
In 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2,500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA. This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist David Reich, who says: &quot;British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands.&quot; He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).

===Late antiquity and early medieval times===
The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his &quot;Almagest&quot; refers to Ireland as &quot;Mikra Brettania&quot; (&quot;Little Britain&quot;), in contrast to the larger island, which he called &quot;Megale Brettania&quot; (&quot;Great Britain&quot;). In his map of Ireland in his later work, &quot;Geography&quot;, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as &quot;Iouernia&quot; and to Great Britain as &quot;Albion&quot;. These &#x27;new&#x27; names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.

The Romans referred to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, &quot;Hibernia&quot;, or Scotia. Ptolemy records 16 nations inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but some modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.

All of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept did not become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the &quot;brehons&quot;.

&quot;The Chronicle of Ireland&quot; records that in 431, Bishop Palladius arrived in Ireland on a mission from Pope Celestine I to minister to the Irish &quot;already believing in Christ&quot;. The same chronicle records that Saint Patrick, Ireland&#x27;s best known patron saint, arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick, but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion. Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and Greek learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland, Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the Early Middle Ages in contrast to elsewhere in Western Europe, where the Dark Ages followed the Fall of the Western Roman Empire.
The arts of manuscript illumination, metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the &quot;Book of Kells&quot;, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on continental Europe after the fall of Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.

From the 9th century, waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns. These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep-seated in Ireland. The Vikings were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, as well as other smaller settlements.

===Norman and English invasions===

On 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. It was led by Richard de Clare, known as &#x27;Strongbow&#x27; owing to his prowess as an archer. The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster.

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France, following a war involving Tighearnán Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin King Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.

The invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged Papal Bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, issued by an Englishman, Adrian IV, in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery. Further, it had no standing in the Irish legal system.
In 1172, Pope Alexander III further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called Peter&#x27;s Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in Ireland as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry&#x27;s successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland. Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting &quot;Dublin&quot; for &quot;London&quot; and the &quot;Irish Church&quot; for, the English church at the time, the &quot;Catholic Church&quot;, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.

=== Gaelicisation ===
From the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.

By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings&#x27; Law of 1494, Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Privy Council.

===The Kingdom of Ireland===

The title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years&#x27; War and the Flight of the Earls.

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war. A further 50,000 were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Physician-general William Petty estimated that 504,000 Catholic Irish and 112,000 Protestant settlers died, and 100,000 people were transported, as a result of the war. If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of the Test Act 1672, and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.
The &quot;Great Frost&quot; struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests. This resulted in the famine of 1740. An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease. The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more. Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings&#x27; Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

===1798 Rebellion===


In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived Irish Republic (1798) in the province of Connacht. It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 people dead.

===Union with Great Britain===
As a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet&#x27;s failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.

Aside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the Industrial Revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.
The Great Famine of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as in those years Ireland&#x27;s population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the United States and Canada. In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating. By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961; County Leitrim was the final Irish county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism, primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O&#x27;Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O&#x27;Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George&#x27;s father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701.

Daniel O&#x27;Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or &quot;Home Rule&quot;. Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests. After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Edward Carson.

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers, whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed. The Act was passed but with the &quot;temporary&quot; exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the First World War. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under John Redmond, took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers&#x27; name and opposed Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war.
The Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing 15 leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.

The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament () and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).

===Partition===
In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British government and representatives of the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the Free State Parliament were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State and make a statement of faithfulness to the king. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.

====Independence====
During its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.

The state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite their country&#x27;s neutrality, approximately 50,000 volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses.

The German intelligence was also active in Ireland. Its operations ended in September 1941 when police made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger. The Republic&#x27;s real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Historian R. F. Foster argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the Industrial Development Authority. In addition European Union membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First, Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.

The financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.

====Northern Ireland====

Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the Republic of Ireland.

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter-protests. The government&#x27;s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased. The Northern Ireland government requested the British Army to aid the police and protect the Irish Nationalist population. In 1969, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the &quot;British occupation of the six counties&quot;.

Other groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as &quot;the Troubles&quot; began. More than 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, and in 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland&#x27;s deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.

==Politics==

The island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent state, and Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area and as a consequence, there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border.

The Republic of Ireland is a member state of the European Union while the United Kingdom is a former member state, having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community (EEC), in 1973 but the UK left the European Union in 2020 after a referendum on EU membership was held in 2016 which resulted in 51.9% of UK voters choosing to leave the bloc.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president whose role is mostly ceremonial. The Oireachtas is a bicameral parliament, composed of (the Dáil), a house of representatives, and (the Seanad), an upper house. The government is headed by a prime minister, the , who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the . Its capital is Dublin.

The Republic of Ireland today ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations&#x27; Human Development Index. A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the Celtic Tiger period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in 2009. According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, Ireland is the second most peaceful country in the world.

===Northern Ireland===
Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party&#x27;s representation in the assembly. Its capital is Belfast.

Ultimately political power is held by the UK government, from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK House of Commons&#x27; 650 MPs. The Northern Ireland Secretary is a cabinet-level post in the British government.

Along with England and Wales and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as their court of final appeal.

===All-island institutions===
As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island &quot;implementation body&quot;, and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.

The British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic&#x27;s particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, &quot;regular and frequent&quot; meetings co-chaired by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved all-Ireland issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.

The North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.

==Geography==

Ireland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of , of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent. Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term &quot;British Isles&quot; can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term &quot;Britain and Ireland&quot; is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands.

A ring of coastal mountains surrounds low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil () in County Kerry, which rises to above sea level. The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster. Western areas are mainly mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island&#x27;s longest river at long, rises in County Cavan in the north-west and flows through Limerick in the midwest.

=== Geology ===
The island consists of varied geological provinces. In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium- to high-grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.

In the southwest, around Bantry Bay and the mountains of MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, is an area of substantially deformed, lightly metamorphosed Devonian-aged rocks. This partial ring of &quot;hard rock&quot; geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape. The west-coast district of the Burren around Lisdoonvarna has well-developed karst features. Significant stratiform lead-zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around Silvermines and Tynagh.

Hydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the Kinsale Head gas field off Cork in the mid-1970s. In 1999, economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the Corrib Gas Field off the County Mayo coast. This has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the &quot;West of Shetland&quot; step-out development from the North Sea hydrocarbon province. In 2000, the Helvick oil field was discovered, which was estimated to contain over of oil.

===Climate===
The island&#x27;s lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet &quot;the Emerald Isle&quot;. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes. This is a result of the moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.

Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.

Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2018. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2010–11. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2 °C (1 °F) in County Mayo on 20 December and up to a metre (3 ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.

==Flora and fauna==
Unlike Great Britain which had a land bridge with mainland Europe, Ireland only had an ice bridge ending around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age and as a result, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland, and of them, only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.
Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.

There are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk, brown bear and the wolf. Some previously extinct birds, such as the golden eagle, have been reintroduced after decades of extirpation.

Ireland is now one of the least forested countries in Europe. Until the end of the Middle Ages, Ireland was heavily forested. Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew, holly and strawberry trees. Only about 10% of Ireland today is woodland; most of this is non-native conifer plantations, and only 2% is native woodland. The average woodland cover of European countries is over 33%. In the Republic, about is owned by the state, mainly by the forestry service Coillte. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park.
Much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been &quot;invaded&quot; by some grasses, such as &quot;Spartina anglica&quot;.

The algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574 The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established.

Because of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===

The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland. A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements. 32% of Ireland&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.

==Demographics==


The population of Ireland is just over 7 million, of which approximately 5.1 million reside in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million reside in Northern Ireland.

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the , , , , , , , , . Later major groups included the , , . Smaller groups included the (see ), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. Over the past 1,200 years, Vikings, Normans, Welsh, Flemings, Scots, English, Africans and Eastern Europeans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.

The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740–41, which killed roughly two-fifths of the island&#x27;s population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the Great Famine of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

Ireland&#x27;s largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, representing over 73% of the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic&#x27;s population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once per week.

===Divisions and settlements===
Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, &quot;Ulster&quot; is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous. In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.

City status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over one million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, the seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===
The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over eight million in 1841 was reduced to slightly over four million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took roughly one million lives. The remaining decline of around three million was due to the entrenched culture of emigration caused by the dire economic state of the country, lasting until the late 20th century.

Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large Irish diaspora lives. , 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, were of Irish descent, while around one-third of the Australian population had an element of Irish descent. , there were 40 million Irish-Americans and 33 million Americans who claimed Irish ancestry.

With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have comprised the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia.

The Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population. Nearly a quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside of Ireland. Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.

===Languages===
The two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages, respectively.

The Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.

The Gaelic Revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with most students showing little evidence of fluency even after 14 years of instruction.

There is now a growing population of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast, with the children of such Irish speakers sometimes attending Irish-medium schools (). It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar.

Traditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the , are in linguistic decline. The main areas are in the west, south-west and north-west, in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, western Cork and Kerry with smaller areas near Dungarvan in Waterford and in Meath.

English in Ireland was first introduced during the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language during the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.

Fewer than 2% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish on a daily basis, and under 10% regularly, outside of the education system and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as &quot;Irish speakers&quot;. In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to Ulster Scots dialects, which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland. Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.

Also native to Ireland are Shelta, the language of the nomadic Irish Travellers, Irish Sign Language, and Northern Ireland Sign Language.

==Culture==
Ireland&#x27;s culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed &quot;Irish interlace&quot; or &quot;Celtic knotwork.&quot; These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art, as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern &quot;Celtic&quot; culture in general.

Religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland&#x27;s pre-Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the fifth century. The Hiberno-Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, &quot;the island of saints and scholars&quot;.

Since the 20th century Irish pubs worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.

====Literature====

Ireland has made a substantial contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.
Irish remained the dominant literary language down to the 19th century, despite the spread of English from the 17th century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include (14th century), (17th century) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (18th century). () was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the Gaelic revival, which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including , and others. Irish-language publishers such as and continue to produce scores of titles every year.

In English, Jonathan Swift, often called the foremost satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the 19th century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.

In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Although not a Nobel Prize winner, James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as &quot;Bloomsday&quot;. A comparable writer in Irish is Máirtín Ó Cadhain, whose 1949 novel is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.

Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage through English-language writers such as John McGahern and Seamus Heaney and Irish-language writers such as and others from the .

====Music and dance====

Music has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times. Although in the early Middle Ages the church was &quot;quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe&quot;, there was a considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (&quot;goltraige&quot;), laughing music (&quot;geantraige&quot;) and sleeping music (&quot;suantraige&quot;). Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland&#x27;s national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.

Irish traditional music and dance have seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas. However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as the Dubliners, the Chieftains, the Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney&#x27;s Men and individuals like and Christy Moore. Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, the Saw Doctors, the Corrs, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Clannad, the Cranberries and the Pogues among others.

====Art====
The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.

==== Drama and theatre ====

The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is , which was established in 1928 in Galway. Playwrights such as Seán O&#x27;Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned.

===Science===

The Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle&#x27;s law.

19th-century physicist, John Tyndall, discovered the Tyndall effect. Father Nicholas Joseph Callan, professor of natural philosophy in Maynooth College, is best known for his invention of the induction coil, transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century.

Other notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton, winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.

George Johnstone Stoney introduced the term &quot;electron&quot; in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell&#x27;s Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize. The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell, from Lurgan, County Armagh, discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth&#x27;s contribution, the Edgeworth Box. remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith, among others. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students. Kathleen Lonsdale, born in Ireland and most known for her work with crystallography, became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including Trinity College Dublin and the University College Dublin, as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the Open University in Ireland. Ireland was ranked 19th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

===Sports===

Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%. The All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar. Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland.

Other sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation include swimming, golf, aerobics, cycling, and billiards/snooker. Many other sports are also played and followed, including boxing, cricket, fishing, greyhound racing, handball, hockey, horse racing, motor sport, show jumping and tennis.

The island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name &quot;Ireland&quot; until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.

====Field sports====
Gaelic football, hurling and Gaelic handball are the best-known Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of women&#x27;s Gaelic football and camogie (women&#x27;s variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at Croke Park in north Dublin and has a capacity of 82,500. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there. All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.

The Irish Football Association (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland&#x27;s oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast, Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations&#x27; associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as &quot;Ireland&quot;.
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI&#x27;s team be known only as &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; and that the IFA&#x27;s team be known as &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1982 and 1986 and the European Championship in 2016. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1994, 2002 and the European Championship in 1988, 2012 and 2016. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues.

Ireland fields a single national rugby team and a single association, the Irish Rugby Football Union, governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every Rugby World Cup, making the quarter-finals in eight of them. Ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 Rugby World Cups (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the Pro14 and at least three compete for the Heineken Cup. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, Ulster (1999), Munster (2006 and 2008) and Leinster (2009, 2011 and 2012) have won the Heineken Cup. In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the Six Nations Championship against the other European elite sides. This success, including Triple Crowns in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a Grand Slam, in 2009 and 2018.

====Boxing====

Amateur boxing on the island of Ireland is governed by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association. Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport. Michael Carruth won a gold medal and Wayne McCullough won a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympic Games. In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games. Paddy Barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and 2010 Commonwealth Games. Katie Taylor has won gold in every European and World championship since 2005. In August 2012 at the Olympic Games in London, Taylor created history by becoming the first Irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60 kg lightweight. More recently, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

====Other sports====
Horse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs. The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.

Irish athletics is an all-Ireland sport governed by Athletics Ireland. Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan won two medals at 5,000 metres on the track; gold at the 1995 World Championships and silver at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Gillian O&#x27;Sullivan won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler Derval O&#x27;Rourke won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in Moscow. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.

Golf is very popular, and golf tourism is a major industry attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually. The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare. Pádraig Harrington became the first Irishman since Fred Daly in 1947 to win the British Open at Carnoustie in July 2007. He successfully defended his title in July 2008 before going on to win the PGA Championship in August. Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years and was the first winner from Ireland. Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, Graeme McDowell became the first Irish golfer to win the U.S. Open, and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. Rory McIlroy, at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while Darren Clarke&#x27;s latest victory was the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St. George&#x27;s. In August 2012, McIlroy won his 2nd major championship by winning the USPGA Championship by a record margin of 8 shots.

====Recreation====
The west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.

With thousands of lakes, over of fish-bearing rivers and over of coastline, Ireland is a popular angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing, in particular, received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted, and the range of sea angling species is around 80.

===Food and drink===
Food and cuisine in Ireland take their influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island&#x27;s temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.

For this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages. The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the Maasai) was common and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the &quot;breakfast roll&quot;.

The introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food, and by the mid-19th century, the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk. A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat of potatoes per week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental simplicity to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.

Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a &quot;New Irish Cuisine&quot; based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is &quot;Dublin Lawyer&quot;: lobster cooked in whiskey and cream. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.

Ireland once dominated the world&#x27;s market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world&#x27;s whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50% of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.

Irish whiskey, as researched in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades. Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the &quot;Irish coffee&quot; (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.

Stout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly &quot;Magners&quot; (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as &quot;Bulmers&quot;), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.

==Economy==
The GDP of the Republic of Ireland was €423.5 billion (nominal), and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was £52 billion (GVA Balanced). The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was €84,049.9 (nominal) , and in Northern Ireland 2021 was £27,154 (GVA Balanced). The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.

Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions&#x27; former shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an &quot;all-Ireland economy&quot; to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness.

=== Economic history ===

Prior to partition in 1921, Ireland had a long history as an economic colony – first, partially, of the Norse, via their cities (9th to 10th centuries CE), and later, to varying extents, of polities related to England. Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture, trade barriers frequently hobbled its development. Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.

Salient events in the economic history of Ireland include:

* 16th and 17th centuries: confiscation and redistribution of land in the Plantations of Ireland
* 1845–1849: The Great Famine occasioned depopulation and mass emigration
* 1846: Westminster&#x27;s repeal of the Corn Laws disrupted Irish agriculture

===Major industries===
====Tourism====

There are two World Heritage Sites on the island: the complex and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields and Mount Stewart.

Some of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle. Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.

The Dublin region receives the most tourists and is home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells. The west and south west, which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway, are also popular tourist destinations.

Stately homes, built during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in Palladian, Neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles, such as Castle Ward, Castletown House, Bantry House, Strokestown Park and Glenveagh Castle are also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle, Castle Leslie and Dromoland Castle.

====Energy====

Although for most of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate, the island has operated for some time as a single market for electricity. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition but they are now connected with three interlinks and are also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid has started building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland&#x27;s peak demand.

As with electricity, the natural gas distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim. Most of Ireland&#x27;s gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. Supplies come from the Corrib Gas Field, off the coast of County Mayo, with a supply previously also coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast. The County Mayo field faces some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.
Ireland has an ancient industry based on peat (known locally as &quot;turf&quot;) as a source of energy for home fires. A form of biomass energy, this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas. However, because of the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland for digging up peat. In cities, heat is generally supplied by natural gas or heating oil, although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as &quot;smokeless fuel&quot; for domestic use.

The Republic has a strong commitment to renewable energy and ranks as one of the top 10 markets for clean-technology investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in renewable energy (such as wind power) has increased since 2004. Large wind farms have been constructed in Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom regard the wind turbines as unsightly. The Republic is hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB&#x27;s Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.

<text>Alastair George Bell Sim (9 October 1900 – 19 August 1976) was a Scottish actor, who began his theatrical career at the age of thirty. He quickly became established as a popular West End performer, remaining so until his death in 1976. Starting in 1935, he also appeared in more than fifty British films, including an iconic adaptation of Charles Dickens’ novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, released in 1951 as &quot;Scrooge&quot; in Great Britain and as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in the United States. Though an accomplished dramatic actor, he is often remembered for his comically sinister performances.

After a series of false starts, including a spell as a jobbing labourer and another as a clerk in a local government office, Sim&#x27;s love of and talent for poetry reading won him several prizes and led to his appointment as a lecturer in elocution at the University of Edinburgh in 1925. He also ran his own private elocution and drama school, from which, with the help of the playwright John Drinkwater, he made the transition to the professional stage in 1930.

Despite his late start, Sim soon became well known on the London stage. A period of more than a year as a member of the Old Vic company brought him wide experience of playing Shakespeare and other classics, to which he returned throughout his career. In the modern repertoire, he formed a close professional association with the author James Bridie, which lasted from 1939 until the dramatist&#x27;s death in 1951. Sim not only acted in Bridie&#x27;s works but also directed them.

In the later 1940s and for most of the 1950s, Sim was a leading star of British cinema. His films included &quot;Green for Danger&quot; (1946), &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947), &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950), &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951), &quot;The Belles of St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954) and &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; (1954). Later, he made fewer films and generally concentrated on stage work, including successful productions at the Chichester Festival and regular appearances in new and old works in the West End.

==Early life==

Sim was born in Edinburgh, the youngest child and second son of Alexander Sim, a ladies&#x27; tailor and clothier who served on several Edinburgh committees and was a school governor and Justice of the Peace, and Isabella (née McIntyre). His mother moved to Edinburgh as a teenager from Eigg, one of the Small Isles in the Hebrides, and was a native Gaelic speaker. The family lived above his father&#x27;s shop at 96-98, Lothian Road; later, improved finances allowed for a move to 73, Viewforth, in the wealthier Bruntsfield area of the city. Sim was educated at Bruntsfield Primary school, and received his secondary education at James Gillespie&#x27;s High School and George Heriot&#x27;s School. He worked—probably part time—in his father&#x27;s shop and then for the men&#x27;s outfitters Gieve&#x27;s, displaying no talent for the retail trade. In 1918 he was admitted to the University of Edinburgh to study analytical chemistry, but was called up for army training.

After the end of the First World War in November 1918, Sim was released from military service. On his return home, he told his family that he did not intend to resume his studies at the university but instead would become an actor. His announcement was so badly received that he left the parental home and spent about a year in the Scottish Highlands with a group of itinerant jobbing workers. Returning to Edinburgh, he took a post in the burgh assessor&#x27;s office. In his spare time, he joined poetry reading classes, winning the gold medal for verse speaking at the Edinburgh Music Festival. This led to his engagement to teach elocution at a further education college in Dalry, Edinburgh. He held this post from 1922 to 1924. After taking an advanced training course in his subject, in 1925 he successfully applied to the University of Edinburgh for the post of Fulton Lecturer in Elocution, which he held for five years.

While maintaining his university position, Sim also taught private pupils and later founded and ran his own drama school for children in Edinburgh. This developed his skills as a director and occasional actor. One of his pupils, Naomi Merlith Plaskitt, aged 12 when they met, became his wife six years later. The dramatist John Drinkwater saw one of Sim&#x27;s productions for the school and encouraged him to become a professional actor. Through Drinkwater&#x27;s influence, Sim was cast in his first professional production, &quot;Othello&quot; at the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1930; he understudied the three principal male roles (played by Paul Robeson, Maurice Browne and Ralph Richardson) and played the small role of the messenger.

==Early stage and screen career==

Sim followed &quot;Othello&quot; with productions ranging from a musical revue to a medieval costume drama by Clifford Bax, in whose &quot;The Venetian&quot; he made his Broadway debut in October 1931. In 1932–33 he was engaged for sixteen months as a member of the Old Vic company, headed by Peggy Ashcroft. He performed in ten plays by Shakespeare, two each by Shaw and Drinkwater, and one by Sheridan. He began to attract the attention of reviewers. &quot;The Times&quot; said that in &quot;As You Like It&quot; Sim as Duke Senior and George Devine as Duke Frederick &quot;endowed the dukes with the properly fabulous touch of fairyland&quot;. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Ivor Brown wrote that Sim&#x27;s Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; had &quot;a sly roguishness that was immensely alive.&quot; During the Old Vic season, Sim married his former pupil, Naomi Plaskitt, on 2 August 1932. They had one daughter, Merlith Naomi.

For several months in 1934, Sim was incapacitated by a slipped disc, which was successfully treated by osteopathy. When he recovered, he made a strong impression on West End audiences as Ponsonby, a sycophantic bank director in the comedy &quot;Youth at the Helm&quot;. Ivor Brown called his performance &quot;a joy … a marvellous mixture of soap and vinegar&quot;. On the strength of this success Sim was cast in his first film, &quot;The Riverside Murder&quot; (1935), in the role of the earnest but dim Sergeant McKay. There followed a sequence of films, a mixture of comedies and detective stories, including &quot;Wedding Group&quot; (1936), in which Sim and his wife both appeared, he as a Scottish minister, she as the maid; Edgar Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Squeaker&quot; (1937), after a stage production of the same piece; &quot;Alf&#x27;s Button Afloat&quot; (1938) with the Crazy Gang; also in 1938 he played a revengeful ex-con Soapy Marks in the Associated British Picture film &quot;The Terror&quot;, and the &quot;Inspector Hornleigh&quot; series (1939–41), as the bumbling assistant of Gordon Harker.

==Starring roles==

Sim returned to substantial stage roles at the last Malvern Festival; in James Bridie&#x27;s comedy &quot;What Say They?&quot; he played Professor Hayman, making him, as &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; put it, &quot;baleful as a shaven John Knox and lean as a buzzard… a grand performance&quot;. This was the start of an association between Sim and Bridie that lasted until the latter&#x27;s death in 1951, with Sim starring in, and directing, &quot;Mr Bolfry&quot; (1943), &quot;The Forrigan Reel&quot; (1945), &quot;Dr Angelus&quot; (1947) and &quot;Mr Gillie&quot; (1950).

By the mid-1940s, Sim was being cast in starring roles in films. His earliest successes as a leading man included the police detective in the thriller &quot;Green for Danger&quot; (1946); the headmaster of Nutbourne College, co-starring with Margaret Rutherford, in the farcical comedy &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950); and a writer of lurid crime fiction in the comedy &quot;Laughter in Paradise&quot; (1951). His other films included &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (1944), &quot;London Belongs to Me&quot; (1948), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), &quot;Scrooge (A Christmas Carol)&quot; (1951), &quot;Folly to Be Wise&quot; (1953) and &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; (1954).

Sim turned down the role of Joseph Macroon in &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (1949), saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t bear professional Scotsmen&quot;. An even more central role for which he was intended was the mad criminal mastermind Professor Marcus in &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). The role was written with him in mind but was finally taken by Alec Guinness, who, in the words of Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute, played it &quot;with more than a hint of Sim about him&quot;, to the extent that according to Simpson many people thought then and still think that Sim played the part.

Sim&#x27;s performance in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951) is considered by many to be the best portrayal of the title character on screen, and it is among his best-known film roles, particularly in the U.S. In the farcical &quot;The Belles of St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954) he played the dual roles of Millicent and Clarence Fritton, the headmistress of St Trinian&#x27;s and her shady brother. Having originally accepted the part of Clarence, Sim agreed to play in drag as Miss Fritton when Margaret Rutherford proved unavailable, and the director and co-producer, Frank Launder could find no suitable actress as an alternative. His &quot;Burke and Hare&quot; film &quot;The Anatomist&quot; debuted on British television (on &quot;International Theatre&quot;) on 6 February 1956, and was later released theatrically in the U.S. in 1961, leading some reference sources to list it as a 1961 movie.

Sim was among the top British film stars of the early and mid 1950s, but his films of the late 1950s are considered by the critic Michael Brooke to be of lesser quality, because of poor scripts or lack of innovative direction. Sim made no films in the decade between 1961 and 1971; it is not clear whether this was, as Brooke suggests, because he found the scripts offered to him unacceptable or, as Simpson proposes, because film makers in the 1960s thought him unsuited to the kitchen sink dramas then fashionable.

After Bridie&#x27;s death in 1951, Sim appeared in only two stage productions during the rest of the decade. The first was a revival of Bridie&#x27;s &quot;Mr  Bolfry&quot; in 1956, in which Sim moved from the role of the puritanical clergyman to that of the Devil. The second was William Golding&#x27;s &quot;The Brass Butterfly&quot;, a 1958 comedy described by &quot;The Times&quot; as portraying the relations between an urbane Roman emperor (Sim) and a Greek inventor with wildly anachronistic scientific ideas (George Cole).

In 1959, Sim sued the food company H J Heinz over a television advertisement for its baked beans; the advertisement had a voiceover sounding remarkably like him, and he insisted that he would not &quot;prostitute his art&quot; by advertising anything. He lost the case and attracted some ridicule for his action, but he was conscious of the importance of his highly recognisable voice to his professional success. Brooke comments on Sim&#x27;s &quot;crowning glory: that extraordinary voice. Only Gielgud rivalled his tonal control and sensitivity to the musicality of the English language.&quot;

==1960s and last years==

After doing little stage work in the 1950s, Sim resumed his theatre career in earnest in the 1960s. His range was wide, from Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1962) and Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1964), to the villainous Captain Hook in Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1963, 1964 and 1968) and the hapless Mr Posket in Pinero&#x27;s farce &quot;The Magistrate&quot; (1969). The new plays in which Sim appeared were Michael Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Windfall&quot; (1963), William Trevor&#x27;s &quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Foot&quot; (1965) and Ronald Millar&#x27;s &quot;Number Ten&quot; (1967); he directed all three productions. The first was dismissed by &quot;The Times&quot; as a tepid comedy about a progressive young headmaster thwarted by a reactionary member of his staff; the second, billed as a pre-London tour, started and finished in the provinces; the last was castigated by Philip Hope-Wallace in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;maladroit playmaking&quot; with a tedious plot about political machinations. Sim&#x27;s performances provided some consolation: in the first, &quot;The Times&quot; said, his &quot;treacherously sweet smiles, triple takes and unheralded spasms of apoplectic fury almost make the evening worth while&quot;.

Much more successful among Sim&#x27;s 1960s appearances were two productions at the Chichester Festival: Colman and Garrick&#x27;s 1766 comedy &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Magistrate&quot;. In the former he co-starred once more with Rutherford, whom J. C. Trewin in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; praised for her &quot;irresistible comic effect&quot;; he thought Sim &quot;enchantingly right&quot;. In the Pinero farce three years later, Trewin was equally approving of Sim and his co-star Patricia Routledge.

On television, Sim portrayed Mr Justice Swallow in the comedy series &quot;Misleading Cases&quot; (1967–71), written by A. P. Herbert, with Roy Dotrice as the litigious Mr Haddock over whose court cases Swallow presided with benign shrewdness. Sim returned to the cinema in 1971 as the voice of Scrooge in an animated adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The following year he appeared as the Bishop in Peter Medak&#x27;s &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972) with Peter O&#x27;Toole, and in 1975 he played a cameo in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975) with Malcolm McDowell. After playing Lord Harrogate in the 1976 Disney film &quot;Escape from the Dark&quot;, his last role was as the Earl in the 1976 remake of &quot;Rogue Male&quot; opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole, a role for which he literally climbed out of his sick bed, saying, &quot;Peter needs me.&quot;

On stage Sim returned to Pinero farce, playing Augustin Jedd in &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; at Chichester and then in the West End. Once again he co-starred with Patricia Routledge. His last stage appearance was in a return to the role of Lord Ogleby in a new production of &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot; at the Savoy in April 1975.

==Personal life and honours==
Sim and his family guarded their privacy carefully. He seldom gave press interviews and refused to sign autographs. In his view, the public&#x27;s interest in him should be solely confined to his stage or screen performances. In a rare interview with the magazine &quot;Focus on Film&quot; he said, &quot;I stand or fall in my profession by the public&#x27;s judgement of my performances. No amount of publicity can dampen a good one or gloss over a bad one.&quot;

Sim and his wife Naomi promoted and encouraged young acting talent. Among their &quot;protégés&quot; was George Cole, who lived with them on and off from 1940, when he was 15 years old, until 1952, when he married and bought a house nearby. Cole appeared with Sim in eight films from &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; (1941), to &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1957). An obituary of Naomi Sim noted in 1999: &quot;Cole wasn&#x27;t the only youngster to benefit from the Sims&#x27; generosity and love of youthful spirits. At least half a dozen others – &#x27;our boys&#x27; as Naomi called them – mostly unhappy at home, have cherished memories of life at Forrigan, the welcoming woodland retreat built by the couple near Henley-on-Thames in 1947&quot;. They had a daughter, Merlith, who lives at Forrigan with her family. The actor George Cole lived next door to the family, remaining close to Naomi Sim to the end.
In 1948, Sim was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh. He held the post until 1951; when he stood down he was made an honorary Doctor of Law. He was appointed CBE in 1953, and refused a knighthood in the early 1970s. An English Heritage blue plaque was unveiled in July 2008 at his former home at 8 Frognal Gardens, Hampstead, by his daughter Merlith McKendrick at a ceremony attended by George Cole. There is a plaque commemorating Sim&#x27;s birth outside the Filmhouse Cinema in Lothian Road, Edinburgh.

Sim died in 1976, aged 75, in London, from complications of lung cancer. His widow Naomi published a memoir, &quot;Dance and Skylark: Fifty Years with Alastair Sim&quot; in 1987. She died on 3 August 1999.

<doc id="147577" wikidata="Q6137344" url="?curid=147577" title="Romsey Abbey">
<text>Romsey Abbey is the name currently given to a parish church of the Church of England in Romsey, a market town in Hampshire, England. Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was the church of a Benedictine nunnery. The surviving Norman-era church is the town&#x27;s outstanding feature and is now the largest parish church in the county of Hampshire since changes in county boundaries led to the larger Christchurch Priory being now included in Dorset. The current vicar is the Reverend Thomas Wharton, who took up the post in September 2018.

==Monastic history==
The church was originally built during the 10th century, as part of a monastic foundation of Benedictine women. In 968, the abbey was gifted land by Edgar, King of England and rededicated. 

The religious community continued to grow and a village grew around it. Both suffered already in the 10th century, when Viking raiders sacked the village and burnt down the original church in 993. However, the abbey was rebuilt in stone in around 1000 and the village quickly recovered. The abbey and its community of nuns flourished and was renowned as a seat of learning – especially for the children of the nobility.

In Norman times a substantial, new stone abbey was built on the old Anglo-Saxon foundation ( to 1140 AD) by Henry Blois, Bishop of Winchester and Abbot of Glastonbury, younger brother of King Stephen. In this general period, the community prospered and by 1240 the nuns numbered more than 100.

It was in this period that the dramatic case arose of Princess Marie (1136–1182), youngest daughter of Stephen of England. Marie had become a novice at the Priory of Lillechurch in Kent, but transferred to Romsey in the years 1148–1155, being elected Abbess in 1155, the year following her father&#x27;s death. In 1159, the death of her brother William left her as the &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Boulogne and the following year prompted Matthew of Alsace to abduct her from her abbey and force her to marry him despite her religious vows, so that he became &quot;jure uxoris&quot; Count of Boulogne and co-ruler. Though couple had two daughters, the marriage was annulled in 1170 and Marie returned to life as a Benedictine nun at the Abbey of Sainte-Austreberthe at Montreuil, where she died in 1182, aged about 46.
Despite the faithful service in prayer of many of the nuns over many centuries, there are scattered traces of irregularities in the conduct of the house, of which the evidence would merit impartial investigation with modern historiographical methods, rather than stale prejudice. Some sources accuse the abbess Elizabeth Broke (1472–1502) of ruling over a period of scandal, including allowing poor dress standards for nuns, allowing nuns to go to the towns taverns, poor account keeping and an unhealthy relationships with the Chaplain.

The abbey continued to grow and prosper until the Black Death struck the town in 1348–9. While it is thought that as much as half of the population of the town – which was then about 1,000 – died as a result, the number of nuns fell by over 80% to 19. 72 nuns died including Abbess Johanna. After the plague there were never more than 26 nuns in the Abbey.

This so affected the area that the overall prosperity of the abbey dwindled, though it remained an important local institution and continued its traditional functions of prayer and charity towards the local people.

==Post-Reformation parish==
Although the community of nuns itself was forcibly dispersed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbey buildings escaped the general fate of other religious and charitable establishments at this time and were not demolished. This was because the abbey church had a substantial section dedicated to St Lawrence which served as a place of worship for the townspeople. This arrangement, found also elsewhere in various forms, was designed to preserve the particular life of the nuns, with its heavy schedule of church services, from encroachment by the needs of the people. The latter were catered for, however, by celebrations of the liturgy ensured by the nuns&#x27; chaplains.

Subsequently, the town purchased the abbey buildings from the Crown for £100 in 1544. The operation presumably aimed, under the cloak of public service, at furthering private interests, since the town&#x27;s magnates then soon set about demolishing that very section, set aside as the church of St Lawrence, that had ensured the survival of buildings in the first place. All over the country, the demolition of religious buildings brought for private enterprise a rich harvest of lead and building materials.

During the English Civil War the building suffered further material damage at the hands of Parliamentarian troops in 1643, including destruction of the organ.

What survives of the abbey buildings today, though limited to a remodelled and restored form of the former abbey church, is arguably due especially to the efforts of a 19th-century incumbent, the Reverend Edward Lyon Berthon. It now forms the largest Church of England parish church in the county of Hampshire.

==Bells==
The church&#x27;s bells were once housed in a detached campanile. After its demolition in 1625, the set of six bells was transferred to a wooden belfry on top of the central tower. They were replaced by a new set of eight in 1791; the heaviest, the tenor, weighing 26 cwt. Three of the bells were recast in 1932. The bells and their eighteenth century bell frame were restored in 2007, when removing the crown reduced the weight of the tenor to 22 cwt. The bells are now known across the region for being one of the finest rings of 8 bells.

==Music==

===Choir===
Romsey Abbey has a traditional choir of boy choristers and a back row of adult altos, tenors and basses drawn from the local area. They also have a choir of girls, a senior girls choir, a training choir of youngsters and a consort of voluntary singers and members of the congregation who sing when the choirs are on holiday. Over the years the choirs have recorded multiple CDs, sung for royalty, enjoyed choir tours to numerous UK Cathedrals, Belgium, Italy and France and have a twinning relationship with a German choir from Mülheim an der Ruhr. They have appeared numerous times on BBC &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; as well as featuring in a BBC Documentary in 2018. The current director of music is Martin Seymour. 

===Organs===
Romsey Abbey has two organs. The main instrument was built by J W Walker &amp; Sons in 1858 and replaced an earlier instrument by Henry Coster. The Walker Organ was rebuilt in its present position and enlarged in 1888. Major restoration work was carried out by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd in 1995/96 under the supervision of the abbey&#x27;s organist, Jeffrey Williams, restoring the mechanical actions and overhauling all of the pipe work. In 1999 a completely new nave organ by Walkers was constructed with its pipe work located on the south triforium. This can be played either from a mobile console in the nave or from the main console.

==Notable burials==

Among the tombs housed in the present church are:

Reportedly, that of Prince Edmund Atheling (c. 966 – c. 970), the eldest son of Edgar the Peaceful, King of Northumbria and Mercia, by his third wife, Ælfthryth, the elder brother of King Æthelred the Unready (c. 968–1016) who died in infancy and was buried in the old Romsey Abbey.

John and Grissell St Barbe, both died in 1658. The family acquired the abbey estate shortly after the dissolution and held it until 1723.

William Petty (1623-1687), in his day a noted English economist, scientist, philosopher, Fellow of the Royal Society and politician. He first came to prominence serving Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth in Ireland and, like many others, later served under King Charles II and King James II. Knighted in 1661, he became the great-grandfather of Prime Minister William Petty Fitzmaurice, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and 1st Marquess of Lansdowne.

John Latham (1740-1837), English physician, naturalist and ornithologist, one of the first to examine scientifically birds discovered in Australia. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1775, took part in the creation of the Linnean Society, and in 1812, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900–1979). On being given his Earldom in 1947, Mountbatten had been granted the lesser title of Baron Romsey and he lived locally at Broadlands House. On 27 August 1979, Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, and two others were assassinated by a bomb, set by members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, hidden aboard his fishing boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland. He was buried here following a Ceremonial Funeral in Westminster Abbey. By request, his grave is aligned north–south, rather than the conventional east–west, so that he faces the sea where his wife, Edwina&#x27;s, ashes were scattered.

Buried in the churchyard is Major General Sir Richard Harman Luce (1867-1952), an English surgeon, British Army officer and politician, who served for a time as MP for Derby in 1924 and later as Mayor of Romsey.

==&quot;Titanic&quot; connection==

One of the &#x27;s engineering officers, Arthur (Bob) Ward, who died in the sinking, is commemorated in the Abbey with a plaque in one of the chapels.
==St Swithun&#x27;s, Crampmoor==
The village of Crampmoor, to the east of Romsey, is within the ecclesiastical parish of Romsey. St Swithun&#x27;s, Crampmoor, is Romsey Abbey&#x27;s daughter church. It was built in the nineteenth century to serve a rural community as both a church and a school. There were originally two other such combined use buildings in the parish; the school moved out from St Swithun&#x27;s in 1927.

<doc id="147581" wikidata="Q753604" url="?curid=147581" title="Atari BASIC">
<text>Atari BASIC is an interpreter for the BASIC programming language that shipped with Atari 8-bit computers. Unlike most American BASICs of the home computer era, Atari BASIC is not a derivative of Microsoft BASIC and differs in significant ways. It includes keywords for Atari-specific features and lacks support for string arrays.

The language was distributed as an 8 KB ROM cartridge for use with the 1979 Atari 400 and 800 computers and included the &quot;Atari BASIC Reference Manual&quot; written by Carol Shaw and Keith Brewster. Starting with the 600XL and 800XL in 1983, BASIC is built into the system. There are three primary versions of the software: the original cartridge-based &quot;A&quot;, the built-in &quot;B&quot; for the 600XL/800XL, and the final &quot;C&quot; version in late-model XLs and the XE series.

Despite the Atari 8-bit computers running at a higher speed than most of its contemporaries, several technical decisions placed Atari BASIC near the bottom in performance benchmarks. The original authors addressed most of these issues in a series of improved versions: BASIC A+ (1981), BASIC XL (1983), and BASIC XE (1985).

The complete, annotated source code and design specifications of Atari BASIC were published as &quot;The Atari BASIC Source Book&quot; in 1983.

==Development==
The machines that would become the Atari 8-bit computers were originally developed as second-generation video game consoles intended to replace the Atari VCS. Ray Kassar, the new president of Atari, decided to challenge Apple Computer by building a home computer instead.

This meant the designs needed to include the BASIC programming language, the standard for home computers. In early 1978, Atari licensed the source code to the MOS 6502 version of Microsoft BASIC. It was offered in two versions: one using a 32-bit floating point format that was about 7800 bytes when compiled, and another using an extended 40-bit format that was close to 9 KB.

Even the 32-bit version barely fit into the 8 KB size of the machine&#x27;s ROM cartridge format. Atari also felt that they needed to expand the language to support the hardware features of their computers, similar to what Apple had done with Applesoft BASIC. This increased the size of Atari&#x27;s version to around 11 KB; Applesoft BASIC on the Apple II+ was 10,240 bytes long. After six months the code was pared down to almost fit in an 8 KB ROM, but Atari was facing a January 1979 deadline for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where the machines would be demonstrated. They decided to ask for help to get a version of BASIC ready in time for the show.

===Shepardson Microsystems===
In September 1978, Shepardson Microsystems won the bid on completing BASIC. At the time they were finishing Cromemco 16K Structured BASIC for the Z80-based Cromemco S-100 bus machines. Developers Kathleen O&#x27;Brien and Paul Laughton used Data General Business Basic, an integer-only implementation, as the inspiration for their BASIC, given Laughton&#x27;s experience with Data General on a time-sharing system.

Cromemco BASIC includes an extended floating point implementation using a 14-digit binary-coded decimal (BCD) format made possible using all 16 registers of the Zilog Z80 processor. As it converts all data to the internal format at edit time, small constants like &quot;1&quot; use ~8 bytes of memory, and this could be a particular issue when storing arrays of numbers. To address this, the language also supports a smaller 6-digit BCD format.

Even the smallest BASICs on the 6502 used about 10K. For instance, Commodore BASIC used 9K but also relies on support from the KERNAL, while Applesoft BASIC is 10,780 bytes. To meet the goal of fitting in an 8K ROM, the new BASIC would be in two parts: the language itself on the cartridge and a 2K floating point library in the system&#x27;s 10K ROM supporting only the 6-digit format.

Atari accepted the proposal, and when the specifications were finalized in October 1978, Laughton and O&#x27;Brien began work on the new language. The contract specified the delivery date on or before 6 April 1979 and this also included a File Manager System (later known as DOS 1.0). Atari&#x27;s plans were to take an early 8K version of Microsoft BASIC to the 1979 CES, then switch to Atari BASIC for production. Development proceeded quickly, helped by a bonus clause in the contract, which led to the initial version being delivered in October. Atari took an 8K cartridge version to CES instead of Microsoft&#x27;s. Atari Microsoft BASIC was later a separate product.

===Releases===
The version Shepardson gave to Atari for the CES demo was not intended to be final, and Shepardson continued to fix bugs. Unknown to Shepardson, Atari had already sent the CES version to manufacturing.

This version was later known as Revision A. It contains a major bug in a routine that copies memory: deleting lines of code that are exactly 256 bytes long causes a lockup after the next command is entered. The key does not fix it.

Revision B attempted to fix the major bugs in Revision A and was released in 1983 as a built-in ROM in the 600XL and 800XL models. While fixing the memory copying bug, the programmer noticed the same pattern of code in the section for inserting lines, and applied the same fix. This instead introduced the original bug into this code. Inserting new lines is much more common than deleting old ones, so the change dramatically increased the number of crashes. Revision B also adds 16 bytes to a program every time it is codice_1d and codice_2ed, eventually causing the machine to run out of memory for even the smallest programs. &quot;Mapping the Atari&quot; described these as &quot;awesome bugs&quot; and advised Revision B owners &quot;Don&#x27;t fool around; get the new ROM, which is available on cartridge&quot; from Atari. The book provides a type-in program to patch Revision B to Revision C for those without the cartridge.

Revision C eliminates the memory leaks in Revision B. It is built-in on later versions of the 800XL and all XE models including the XEGS. Revision C was also available as a cartridge.

The version can be determined by typing codice_3 at the READY prompt. The result is codice_4 for Revision A, codice_5 for Revision B, and codice_6 for Revision C.

==Description==

===Program editing===
Atari BASIC is anchored around its line editor. Program lines can be up to three physical screen lines of 40 characters, 120 characters total. The cursor can be moved freely, with the editor automatically tracking which BASIC program line the current screen line is part of. For instance, if the cursor is currently positioned in line 30 and the user uses cursor-up into line 20, any editing from that point will be carried out on line 20.

Atari BASIC&#x27;s editor catches many errors are ignored in Microsoft-derived versions. If an error is found, the editor re-displays the line, highlighting the text near the error in inverse video. Errors are displayed as numeric codes, with the descriptions printed in the manual. Because of the way the line editor works, the user can immediately fix the error. In the example pictured above (with codice_7), the error can be fixed by moving the cursor over the codice_8, typing (the editor only has an overwrite mode), and hitting .

A line entered with a leading number, from 0 to 32767, is inserted in the current program or replaces an existing line. If there&#x27;s no line number, the interpreter assigns it the number -1 (800016) and the commands are executed immediately, in &quot;immediate mode&quot;. The codice_9 command executes the stored program from the lowest line number. Atari BASIC allows all commands to be executed in both modes. For example, codice_10 can be used inside a program, whereas in many interpreters this would be available in immediate mode only.

During entry, keywords can be abbreviated using the pattern set by Palo Alto Tiny BASIC, by typing a period at any point in the word. So codice_11 is expanded to codice_10, as is codice_13. Only enough letters have to be typed to make the abbreviation unique, so codice_14 requires codice_15 because the single letter P is not unique. To expand an abbreviation, the tokenizer searches through its list of reserved words to find the first that matches the portion supplied. More commonly used commands occur first in the list of reserved words, with codice_16 at the beginning (it can be typed as codice_17). When the program is later codice_10ed it will always write out the full words with three exceptions: codice_19 has a synonym, codice_20; codice_21 has a synonym, codice_22; and codice_23 has a synonym which is the empty string (so 10 LET A = 10 and 10 A = 10 mean the same thing). These are separate tokens, and so will remain as such in the program listing. MS BASICs also allowed codice_20 as a short-form for codice_19, but this used the same token so it expanded back to when ed, treating it as an abbreviation, not a synonym.

===Tokenizer===
When the user presses while editing, the current line is copied into the BASIC Input Line Buffer in memory between 580 and 5FF16. Atari BASIC&#x27;s tokenizer scans the text, converting each keyword to a single-byte token (for example, is 2016), each number to a six-byte floating point value, each variable name to an index into a table, and so on, until the line is fully turned into an easy to interpret format. The result is stored in an output buffer located at the first 256 bytes of the lowest available free memory, pointed to by the LOMEM pointer stored at 80, 8116. The output from the tokenizer is then relocated. The program is stored as a parse tree.

Shepardson referred to this complete-tokenizing concept as a &quot;pre-compiling interpreter&quot;. The resulting tokenized code eliminates any parsing during runtime, making it run faster. It has the disadvantage that small constants, like 0 or 1, are six bytes each, longer than the original text.

A set of pointers (addresses) indicates various data: variable names are stored in the &quot;variable name table&quot; (VNTP – 82, 8316) and their values are stored in the &quot;variable value table&quot; (pointed to at VVTP – 86, 8716). By indirecting the variable names in this way, a reference to a variable needs only one byte to address its entry into the appropriate table. String variables have their own area (pointed to at STARP – 8C, 8D16) as does the runtime stack (pointed to at RUNSTK – 8E, 8F16) used to store the line numbers of looping statements (codice_26) and subroutines (codice_27). Finally, the end of BASIC memory usage is indicated by an address stored at MEMTOP – 90, 9116) pointer.

===Math functions===
Atari BASIC includes three trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and arc tangent. codice_28 and codice_29 set whether these functions use radians or degrees, defaulting to radians. Eight additional functions include rounding, logarithms, and square root. The random function, codice_30, generates a number between 0 and 1; the parameter not being used.

===String handling===
Atari BASIC copied the string-handling system of Hewlett-Packard BASIC, where the basic data type is a single character, and strings are arrays of characters. Internally, a string is represented by a pointer to the first character in the string and its length. To initialize a string, it must be DIMensioned with its maximum length. For example:
10 DIM A$(20)
20 PRINT &quot;ENTER MESSAGE: &quot;;
30 INPUT A$
40 PRINT A$
In this program, a 20 character string is reserved, and any characters in excess of the string length will be truncated. The maximum length of a string is 32,768 characters. There is no support for arrays of strings.

A string is accessed using array indexing functions, or slicing. codice_31 returns a string of the first 10 characters of codice_32. The arrays are 1-indexed, so a string of length 10 starts at 1 and ends at 10. Slicing functions simply set pointers to the start and end points within the existing allocated memory.

Arrays are not initialized, so a numeric array or string contains whatever data was in memory when it was allocated. The following trick allows fast string initialization, and it is also useful for clearing large areas of memory of unwanted garbage. Numeric arrays can only be cleared with a FOR...NEXT loop:
10 REM Initialize A$ with 1000 characters of X
20 DIM A$(1000)
30 A$=&quot;X&quot;:A$(1000)=A$:A$(2)=A$
String concatenation works as in the following example. The target string must be large enough to hold the combined string or an error will result:
10 DIM A$(12),B$(6)
20 A$=&quot;Hello &quot;:B$=&quot;there!&quot;
30 A$(LEN(A$)+1)=B$
40 PRINT A$
Values in DATA statements are comma-delimited and untyped. Consequently, strings in DATA statements are not typically enclosed by quote marks. As a result, it is not possible for data items to contain a comma but they can incorporate double-quotes. Numeric values in DATA statements are read as strings or as numbers according to the type of the variable they are read into. The READ statement cannot be used with array variables.

===Input/output===
The Atari OS includes a subsystem for peripheral device input/output (I/O) known as CIO (Central Input/Output). Most programs can be written independently of what device they might use, as they all conform to a common interface; this was rare on home computers at the time. New device drivers could be written fairly easily that would automatically be available to Atari BASIC and any other program using the Atari OS, and existing drivers could be supplanted or augmented by new ones. A replacement , for example could displace the one in ROM to provide an 80-column display, or to piggyback on it to generate a checksum whenever a line is returned (such as used to verify a type-in program listing).

Atari BASIC supports CIO access with reserved words and . There are routines in the OS for simple graphics drawing functions but not all are available as specific BASIC keywords. and for line drawing are supported while a command providing area fill for primitive linear geometric shapes is not. The fill feature can be used through the general CIO entry point, which is called using the BASIC command .

The BASIC statement prepares a device for I/O access:

10 REM Opens the cassette device on channel 1 for reading in BASIC
20 OPEN #1,4,0,&quot;C:MYPROG.DAT&quot;
Here, means &quot;ensure channel 1 is free,&quot; call the driver to prepare the device (this will set the cassette tape spools onto tension and advance the heads keeping the cassette tape player &quot;paused&quot;). The means &quot;read&quot; (other codes are for write and for &quot;read-and-write&quot;). The third number is auxiliary information, set to 0 when not needed. The is the name of the device and the filename; the filename is ignored for the cassette driver. Physical devices can have numbers (mainly disks, printers and serial devices), so &quot; might be the plotter and &quot; the daisy-wheel printer, or &quot; may be one disk drive and &quot; and so on. If not present, 1 is assumed.

The LPRINT statement sends a string to the printer.

A is read by ing memory locations maintained by the keyboard driver or by opening it as a file (e.g. ). The latter waits for a keypress.

Typing from BASIC exits to the Atari DOS command menu. Any unsaved programs are lost unless a memory-swapping file feature has been enabled on the current disk. There is no command to display a disk directory from within BASIC; this must be done by exiting to DOS.

===Graphics and sound===
Atari BASIC supports sound, (via the statement), graphics (), and controllers (). The statement sets one of hardware&#x27;s 4 square-wave channels with parameters for volume, pitch and distortion.

Advanced capabilities of the hardware such as higher pitch resolution, high-pass filters, digitised sound and waveforms, player/missile graphics (sprites), redefined character sets, scrolling, and custom graphics modes are not supported by BASIC; these will require machine language routines or PEEK/POKE statements. A few of the 17 basic character/graphics modes supported by the hardware cannot be simply accessed from BASIC on the Atari 400/800 as the OS ROMs do not support them. These include some multicolour character modes (ANTIC modes 4 &amp; 5), descender character mode (ANTIC mode 3) and the highest resolution 2 and 4-color modes (ANTIC modes C &amp; E, 160x192 pixels). The only way to access them is via or machine language, setting the ANTIC registers and Display List manually. The OS ROMs on the XL/XE added support for these modes except for ANTIC mode 3, which requires a character set redefined in RAM to operate correctly.

Bitmap modes in BASIC are normally set to have a text window occupying the last four rows at the bottom of the screen so the user may display prompts and enter data in a program. If a 16 is added to the mode number invoked via the GRAPHICS statement, the entire screen will be in bitmap mode (e.g. GRAPHICS 8+16). If bitmap mode in full screen is invoked Atari BASIC will gracefully switch back into text mode when program execution is terminated, avoiding leaving the user with an unresponsive screen that must be escaped by typing a blind command or resetting the computer.

Bitmap coordinates are in the range of 0 to maximum row/column minus one, thus in Mode 6 (160x192), the maximum coordinates for a pixel can be 159 and 191. If Atari BASIC attempts to plot beyond the allowed coordinates for the mode a runtime error occurs.

==Advanced techniques==
===Strings as a way to manipulate memory===
The base addresses of a string is stored in a variable table. String addresses can be redirected to point to arbitrary areas of RAM. This allows the rapid memory-shifting routines underlying string and substring assignment can be applied from BASIC to the memory used for the screen or player/missile graphics. This is particularly useful for achieving rapid vertical movement of player/missile images directly from Atari BASIC.

===Random access via DATA/RESTORE===
Numeric variables and expressions can be used as the parameter for the codice_33 statement, allowing codice_34 statements to be randomly accessed through code such as . This can also be used to emulate static string arrays: .

===Error handling with TRAP===
The codice_35 statement jumps to a line number when an error occurs, and this reduces the need for manual error-checking. For example, when drawing graphics on the screen it is not necessary to check whether lines go beyond screen boundaries of the current graphics mode. This error state can be trapped, and the error handled if necessary.

===Includes===
The codice_36 command reads source code from a device and merges it into the current program, as if the user had typed it in. This allows programs to be saved out in sections via codice_10, reading them in using codice_36 to merge or replace existing code. By using blocks of line numbers that do not overlap, programmers can build libraries of subroutines and merge them into new programs as needed.

===Self-modifying code===
The editor can be set-up to repeatedly read input from the screen until an EOF is reached. This allows a program to write new program code followed by a codice_39 statement to the screen then, positioning the screen cursor at the start of the new code, codice_40 the running program, causing the new code to be read in then execution be continued by the codice_39 statement.

===Embedded machine language===
Atari BASIC can call machine code subroutines stored in strings or codice_42ed into memory. The 256 byte area starting at address 153610 (60016) is often used for this purpose.

Machine code is invoked with the codice_43 function. The first parameter is the address of the subroutine and the following values are parameters. If the code is stored in a string named codice_44 it can be called with two parameters as .

Parameters are pushed onto the hardware stack as 16-bit integers in the order specified in the codice_43 call in low byte, high byte order. A final byte is pushed indicating the number of arguments. The machine language code must remove these values before returning via the codice_46 instruction. A 16-bit value can be returned to BASIC by placing it in addresses 21210 and 21310 (D416 and D516).

==Performance==
In theory, Atari BASIC should run faster than contemporary BASICs based on the MS pattern. Because the source code is fully tokenized when it is entered, the entire tokenization and parsing steps are already complete. Even complex mathematical operations are ready-to-run, with any numerical constants already converted to the internal 40-bit format, and variables values are looked up by address rather than having to be searched for. In practice, Atari BASIC is slower than most other home computer BASICs, often by a large amount.

On two widely used benchmarks of the era, &quot;Byte&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Creative Computing benchmark test written by David H. Ahl, the Atari finished near the end of the list in terms of performance, and was much slower than the contemporary Apple II and PET, in spite of having the same CPU running at roughly twice the speed. It finished behind slower machines like the ZX81 and even some programmable calculators.

Most of the language&#x27;s slowness stems from three problems.

The first is that the floating-point math routines are poorly optimized. In the Ahl benchmark, a single exponent operation was responsible for much of the machine&#x27;s poor showing. The conversion between floating-point and 16-bit integers is also particularly slow. Internally, these integers are used for line numbers and array indexing, along with a few other tasks, but numbers in the tokenized program are stored in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format. Whenever one of these is encountered, such as the line number in , the BCD value is converted to an integer, which can take up to 3500 microseconds.

Another issue is how Atari BASIC implements branches. To perform a branch in a codice_21 or codice_48, the interpreter searches through the entire program for the matching line number. In contrast, contemporary versions of MS-derived BASICs would search forward from the current line if the line number of the branch target was greater, thereby improving branch performance about two times on average.

A related and more serious problem is the implementation of codice_49...codice_50 loops. When a codice_49 statement is executed, Atari BASIC records its line number. Every time the codice_50 is reached, it searches through the program for that line, despite it being in the same place as the last time. All other BASICs instead record the memory location of the codice_49 statement and can immediately return to it without having to search.

The reason for this poor performance is best illustrated by a quote from one of its primary authors, Bill Wilkinson; in 1982 he stated:

One may contrast this philosophy with that of Steve Wozniak&#x27;s Apple BASIC for the original Apple I which was designed specifically to have the performance required to write games:

Several third-party BASICs emerged on the platform that addressed some or all of these issues. This included Wilkinson&#x27;s own BASIC XL, which reduced the time for the &quot;Byte&quot; benchmark from 194 to 58 seconds, over three times as fast. On the Ahl benchmark, Atari BASIC required 405 seconds, while exactly the same code in Turbo-BASIC XL took 41.6 seconds, an order of magnitude improvement.

==Differences from Microsoft BASIC==
*Syntax is checked and errors highlighted immediately on line entry.
*Variable names can be of arbitrary length, and all characters are significant.
*The following keywords are not in Atari BASIC: codice_54, codice_55,codice_56, codice_57, codice_58, codice_59.
*All arrays must be dimensioned prior to use while Microsoft BASIC defaults an array to 10 elements if not dimensioned.
*String variables are treated as character arrays and must be dimensioned before use. MS BASIC stores strings on the heap and sometimes pauses for garbage collection.
*The functions codice_60, codice_61, and codice_62 are replaced by string indexing.
*There is not an operator for string concatenation.
*There are no arrays of strings.
*There is no support for integer variables.
*There are no bitwise operators.
*codice_63 does not allow a prompt.
*codice_19 may be abbreviated as codice_20 as in Microsoft BASIC, but Atari BASIC does not tokenize it into codice_19. It remains a question mark.
*The target of codice_21 and codice_48 can be a variable or expression.
*codice_33 may take a numeric constant, variable, or expression as a parameter, causing the next codice_70 to begin from the specified line number
*codice_71 loops in Atari BASIC must have a variable name referenced by the codice_50 statement while Microsoft BASIC does not require it.
*Multiple variables are not permitted with codice_50 statements as they are in Microsoft BASIC (e.g., codice_74).
*codice_10 uses a comma to separate a range instead of a minus sign.

<doc id="147585" wikidata="Q1057802" url="?curid=147585" title="ABC (programming language)">
<text>ABC is an imperative general-purpose programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) developed at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI), in Amsterdam, Netherlands by Leo Geurts, Lambert Meertens, and Steven Pemberton. It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be used instead of BASIC, Pascal, or AWK. It is intended for teaching or prototyping, but not as a systems-programming language.

ABC had a major influence on the design of the language Python, developed by Guido van Rossum, who formerly worked for several years on the ABC system in the mid-1980s.

==Features==
Its designers claim that ABC programs are typically around a quarter the size of the equivalent Pascal or C programs, and more readable. Key features include:

*Only five basic data types
*No required variable declarations
*Explicit support for top-down programming
*Statement nesting is indicated by indentation, via the off-side rule
*Infinite precision arithmetic, unlimited-sized lists and strings, and other features supporting orthogonality and ease of use by novices
* Polymorphic commands and functions
* Interactive environment with command completion, persistent workspaces, and no separate file handling

ABC was originally a monolithic implementation, leading to an inability to adapt to new requirements, such as creating a graphical user interface (GUI). ABC could not directly access the underlying file system and operating system.

The full ABC system includes a programming environment with a structure editor (syntax-directed editor), suggestions, static variables (persistent), and multiple workspaces, and is available as an interpreter–compiler. , the latest version is 1.05.02, and it is ported to Unix, DOS, Atari, and Apple MacOS.

==Example==
An example function to collect the set of all codice_1 in a document:

 HOW TO RETURN words document:
 PUT {} IN collection
 FOR line IN document:
 FOR word IN split line:
 IF word not.in collection:
 INSERT word IN collection
 RETURN collection

== Implementations ==
ABC has been through multiple iterations, with the current version being the 4th major release. Implementations exist for Unix-like systems, MS-DOS/Windows, Macintosh, and other platforms. The source code was made available via Usenet in the late 1980s/early 1990s.

== Further reading ==
More details on ABC can be found in the book &quot;The ABC Programmer&#x27;s Handbook&quot; by Leo Geurts, Lambert Meertens and Steven Pemberton (ISBN 0-13-000027-2). A newsletter and mailing list were available from CWI.

<text>Amersham ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, in the Chiltern Hills, northwest of central London, south-east of Aylesbury and north-east of High Wycombe. Amersham is part of the London commuter belt.

There are two distinct areas:
* Old Amersham, set in the valley of the River Misbourne, containing the 13th-century parish church of St. Mary&#x27;s and several old pubs and coaching inns
* Amersham-on-the-Hill, which grew in the early 20th century around Amersham station, which was served by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line) and the Great Central Railway.

== Geography ==

Old Amersham occupies the valley floor of the River Misbourne. This is a chalk stream which dries up periodically. The river occupies a valley much larger than it is possible for a river the size of the present River Misbourne to cut, which makes it a misfit stream. The valley floor is at around OD, and the valley top is at around OD. It is likely that the valley was formed under conditions akin to those required to form a dry valley. Amersham-on-the-Hill is built on the north side of the Misbourne valley on a small plateau that forms the watershed between the Misbourne and the neighbouring River Chess.

== History ==

The name &quot;Amersham&quot; is derived from the Old English for &#x27;Ealhmund&#x27;s village (&quot;hām&quot;)&#x27;.

Records date back to Anglo-Saxon times when it was known as &quot;Agmodesham&quot;, and by the time that the Domesday Book was written in 1086, it had become known as &quot;Elmodesham&quot;. Further spelling variations are seen in 1460 as &quot; Agmondysham&quot; and &quot; Amytysham&quot; 

The Domesday entry reads:
:Geoffrey de Mandeville holds Amersham. It answers for hides. Land for 16 ploughs; in lordship 2 hides; 3 ploughs there. 14 villagers with 4 smallholders have 9 ploughs; a further 4 possible. 7 slaves; meadow for 16 ploughs; woodland 400 pigs. The total value is and was £9; before 1066 £16. Queen Edith held this manor.

Queen Edith was the wife of Edward the Confessor and sister of King Harold, and after her death in 1075, the land passed to William the Conqueror, who granted it to Geoffrey de Mandeville (died ).

In 1200, his descendant Geoffrey de Mandeville (who became the Earl of Essex in 1213) obtained a charter for Amersham allowing him to hold a Friday market and a fair on 7 and 8 September. In 1613, another charter was granted to Edward, Earl of Bedford, changing the market day to Tuesday, and establishing a statute fair on 19 September.

In 1521, seven Lollard dissenters (William Tylsworth, John Scrivener, Thomas Barnard, James Morden, Robert Rave, Thomas Holmes and Joan Norman) were burned at the stake in Amersham. A memorial to them was built in 1931 and is inscribed as follows: &quot;In the shallow of depression at a spot 100 yards left of this monument seven Protestants, six men and one woman were burned to death at the stake. They died for the principles of religious liberty, for the right to read and interpret the Holy Scriptures and to worship God according to their consciences as revealed through God&#x27;s Holy Word&quot;. The &quot;Universal Magazine&quot; for September 1749 (p. 139) quotes that &#x27;William Tylesworth&#x27; was in fact burnt in 1506, and that Thomas Bernard and James Morden (a labourer), were burnt about two years later.

The population in 1841 was 3,098.

==Architecture==
In 1931, the architect Amyas Connell completed the Grade II-listed art deco house &quot;High &amp; Over&quot; in Amersham. It has been used as a filming location.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary constituency===
Amersham sent two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the unreformed House of Commons from 1625, and was considered a rotten borough until the Reform Act 1832 stripped it of its representation. The town was then part of the county constituency of Buckinghamshire. From 1885 it was in the Aylesbury constituency, in 1950 it formed part of the South Buckinghamshire seat and in 1974 the current Chesham and Amersham constituency was created. Since then Ian Gilmour (1974–1992) and then Cheryl Gillan (1992–2021) have represented the constituency on behalf of the Conservative party. In the 2019 General Election Ms Gillan was returned with 55.4% of the vote. After her death on 4 April 2021, the seat went to the Liberal Democrats for the first time since its creation when Sarah Green won the ensuing by-election on 17 June 2021.

===Local government===

There are two tiers of local government in Amersham, at parish (town) and county level: Amersham Town Council and Buckinghamshire Council. The town council is based at Flint Barn Court on Church Street in the old town.

From 1894 until local government reorganisation in 1974 the area was administered by Amersham Rural District Council, which was based at the Amersham Union Workhouse on Whielden Road until 1931 and at Elmodesham House at 42 High Street from 1931 to 1974. Amersham Parish Council was also established in 1894 and initially met at Amersham Market Hall, a prominent neoclassical style structure in the High Street. In 1974 Amersham Rural District Council merged with Chesham Urban District Council to form Chiltern District Council, whilst Amersham Parish Council became Amersham Town Council. Chiltern District Council was abolished in 2020, merging with Buckinghamshire County Council and the other Buckinghamshire district councils to form a new unitary authority called Buckinghamshire Council.

== Transport ==
===Roads===
The town is located at the junction of the A355 from Slough and Beaconsfield, the A404 linking Maidenhead, High Wycombe and Rickmansworth, the A416 from Chesham and Berkhamsted and the A413.

===Railway===

The area of the town now known as Amersham-on-the-Hill was referred to as Amersham Common until after the arrival of the railway in 1892. After this date the growth of the new area of the town gradually accelerated, with much work being done by the architect John Kennard. It is now known as &quot;Amersham-on-the-Hill&quot;, &quot;Amersham Town&quot; or the &quot;New Town&quot;.
 station is a terminus of the Metropolitan line. Much of this route is shared with the mainline railway from to . Before electrification, the Metropolitan line ran via Aylesbury to Verney Junction and . London Transport abandoned plans to electrify beyond Amersham and the stations and line were sold to British Railways on 11 September 1961. To this day, these Chiltern Railways stations display a characteristic Metropolitan line architecture.

The town features in the 1973 John Betjeman documentary &quot;Metro-land&quot; about the growth of suburban London in the 20th century. The construction of the railway line was controversial and objections from local landowners prevented its construction until 1892. The station was built a mile to the north of the old market town and has provided the focus of Amersham-on-the-Hill ever since. Chiltern Railways share the railway track with London Underground and run services from Marylebone to Aylesbury Vale Parkway.

===HS2===
In March 2010, the Government announced the route of HS2, the proposed high-speed railway from London to Birmingham. The line will cross the Colne Valley and the M25 motorway on a viaduct, and then through a tunnel under the Chiltern Hills to emerge near South Heath, northwest of Amersham. The route runs roughly parallel to the A413 and the London to Aylesbury Line. A campaign of opposition is co-ordinated by a protest group, Amersham Action Group, which with other protest groups is part of the HS2 Action Alliance.

== Economy ==

Early trade at Amersham Market was in local grain, much of which was sold to London merchants. During the 17th century and 18th century a key industry in the town was brewing. Giles Watkins (died 1636) built a brewery near St Mary&#x27;s church in 1634. His brother Henry Watkins was a royal servant, a page of the robes to Anne of Denmark. William Weller of High Wycombe purchased a brewery in 1775. He, and his heirs, expanded the business by buying a number of local public houses during the next 150 years. In 1929 Gerrard Weller sold the brewery and 133 tied public houses to Benskins of Watford for £360,000, a move that led to the end of brewing in Amersham.

In addition to brewing, tanning, lace manufacture and brickmaking all had a prominent place in the manufacturing past of the town. During the Second World War, the Radiochemical Centre, a scientific research establishment, arrived in the town. This became Amersham International, then Amersham plc, and now, after a number of changes of ownership and name, is part of GE Healthcare. Halma, specialists in hazard and life protection products and headquartered in Old Amersham, is now a member of the FTSE 100 index.

== Places of worship ==

Amersham-on-the-Hill has a free church which is United Reformed and Baptist, the Methodist church St. John&#x27;s and the Church of England St Michael &amp; All Angels.

In Old Amersham stands the Grade I listed Church of England St Mary&#x27;s Church, a 13th-century building that has been altered over the years. The present exterior is largely Victorian but the building contains a 14th-century font, 17th-century glass from Lamer Manor in Hertfordshire, and monuments in the chancel and in the Drake Chapel to 17th- and 18th-century notables.

Also in the town there is the Grade II* listed Amersham Meeting House (a Quaker meeting house), two Methodist churches, St John&#x27;s in Woodside Road and another in the High Street, and King&#x27;s Church Amersham, a free church.

== Education ==
There are two secondary schools located in Amersham: Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School for boys, and Amersham School, a non selective co-educational academy. Additionally, Amersham is included in the catchment areas of both Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School, a girls&#x27; grammar school in Little Chalfont, and Chesham Grammar School, a co-educational grammar school in Chesham.
The Dr Challoner&#x27;s schools share a common foundation dating back to 1624 when the grammar school (then for boys only) started in Old Amersham. Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School moved to its present site in Amersham-on-the-Hill in 1905 when it became co-educational. In 1937 the school was incorporated into the state system. After rapid growth it was decided to establish Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School for Girls in nearby Little Chalfont in 1962 and Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School reverted to being for boys only. In 2015 Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School once again welcomed girls into its Sixth Form.

Amersham School opened on its current site in 1964 as the Brudenell County Secondary School (for girls). Following the closure of the Raans County Secondary School (for boys) in 1988, Brudenell became co-educational and was renamed Amersham School.

Amersham is served by several primary schools, including Our Lady&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary, Chestnut Lane School, Elangeni School, Chesham Bois Church of England School, St. Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, St. George&#x27;s Church of England Infant School and Woodside Junior School.

There are two private preparatory schools: The Beacon School (boys) and Heatherton House (girls).

The Henry Allen Nursery School is Amersham&#x27;s only state maintained nursery school.

Amersham is also served by Amersham &amp; Wycombe College for further education.

==Sport and recreation==
Amersham Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1897. The club continued until the onset of the First World War.

Amersham has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V. Near the playing field is the Chiltern Lifestyle Centre, which contains an indoor climbing wall, two swimming pools, a gym, four badminton courts, two squash courts, a library, a cafe, a children&#x27;s nursery, two spas and a community centre.

Amersham Town F.C. play football at Spratley&#x27;s Meadow in Old Amersham, while various football teams use council facilities at Hervines Park in Amersham-on-the-Hill and Barn Meadow in Old Amersham. Also at the Barn Meadow site is the 61 Judo Club.

Hervines Park and Barn Meadow host some cricket in the summer, but the main cricket club in the town is Amersham Cricket Club, which plays in the grounds of Shardeloes. Amersham and Chiltern Rugby Football Club play rugby union at Weedon Lane in Amersham-on-the-Hill. The Chiltern Harriers Athletics Club is the local athletics club. Amersham and Chalfont Hockey Club is the local hockey club with its own playing facility on the Amersham Campus of the Buckinghamshire College Group (formerly Amersham &amp; Wycombe College).

==Media and communications==

===Local newspapers===
The local newspaper covering Amersham and the surrounding area was the &quot;Buckinghamshire Examiner&quot;, founded in 1889, until its closure in 2019. Another Buckinghamshire newspaper with a circulation area covering Amerham is the &quot;Bucks Free Press&quot;.

===Local radio===

The Ofcom-licensed community radio station for the Chilterns is &quot;Chiltern Voice&quot;, which broadcasts on 107.4 FM.

===TV and mobile phone signals===
Due to its position in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Amersham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast (at Chesham Bois). In the 1970s, Amersham was one of the last towns in the south-east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham Bois transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials – they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 &amp; Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.

== In popular culture ==

The town has been used in a number of films, including:
* &quot;The Duke Wore Jeans&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; (1960)
* &quot;Murder at the Gallop&quot; (1963)
* &quot;The Jigsaw Man&quot; (1983)
* &quot;The Shooting Party&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) – Featured one of the suites in the Crown Hotel
* &quot;Metroland&quot; (1997)
