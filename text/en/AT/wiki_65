<text>Samsø (Anglicized: &quot;Samso&quot; or &quot;Samsoe&quot;) is a Danish island in the Kattegat off the Jutland Peninsula. Samsø is located in Samsø municipality. The community has 3,724 inhabitants (2017) (January 2010:4,010) called &quot;Samsings&quot; and is 114 km² in area. Due to its central location, the island was used during the Viking Age as a meeting place. The etymology of the island&#x27;s name is unknown.

In 1997, Samsø won a government competition to become a model renewable energy community. Now 100% of its electricity comes from wind power and biomass.

== Etymology ==
The name Samsø is of unknown origin. The name is known from 1075 as &quot;Samse&quot;. This word is a simplex and the addition of -, Danish for &#x27;island&#x27;, is thus a later compounding, known in toponymy as &quot;epexegesis&quot;.

==Geography==
The beach and village of are popular with visitors. The island is served by a bus service which runs around the island, including the two ferry terminals in and Ballen. The peninsula of Helgenæs to the north is visible in clear weather.
Geographically, the island divides into three areas:
*the North Island
*the Stavns Fjord
*the South Island

The soil and geology of the northern part of the island is made up of sand and gravel deposited during the deglaciation, while the southern part is made of both areas of boulder clay () and outwash plains (). 
The North Island is divided from the South Island by the artificial Kanhave canal. Here a larger part of the countryside is uncultivated and it presents a wavy landscape of meadows and small patches of woodland and heath. Like the rest of Samsø, the coastline is characterized by steep cliffs and stony beaches, with some sandy beaches in between suited for bathing. Issehoved is Samsø&#x27;s northernmost point and presents what have been described as a miniature of Skagens &quot;Grenen&quot;. The small towns of Nordby, Mårup and Langør are situated on the North Island. Just north of Nordby is the world&#x27;s biggest permanent labyrinth named &#x27;Labyrinten&#x27;, founded in the year 2000. It comprise a patch of conifer woodland, grown on a previous christmas tree plantation. Northwest of Nordby, is the hill of Ballebjerg, Samsøs highest point, reaching 64 m. Near the village of Mårup is the harbour of Mårup Havn. In the summer months (17 June to 22 August) the old wooden freight-ship M/S Tunø, ferry passengers back and forth from here to the island of Tunø just west of Samsø, two days a week. Other two days of the week, the same boat is offering seal-safaris from Langør at Stavns Fjord.

=== Stavns Fjord ===
The shallow lagoon houses most of the smaller islands of Samsø municipality. The largest of them is and most of the rest are small islets, and have been named individually. The lagoon is separated from the sea of Kattegat by the 7 km long sandbar of Besser Rev. It is possible to walk on the reef all the way to the tip at low tide (ebb), except when the birds are breeding. A group of small islands (, Lindholm, Rumpen, Vejrø) are located east of Stavns Fjord, in Kattegat.

=== South Island ===
The South Island is home to the seat of the mayor and Samsø&#x27;s largest town Tranebjerg, but there are many other hamlets and villages (18 in all) spread across the countryside. The village of Ballen, lies on the east coast and is also home to the Samsø Energiakademi. Most of the land on the South Island is cultivated, but there are spots of nature like the forest and the cliffs, shrubs and beach meadows on the southcoast. Just south of the Kanhave canal is Samsø Airport.

== History ==
People have lived and hunted on Samsø since the ice receded at the end of the last Ice Age. Samsø first became an island approximately 9,000 years ago and there are several traces like dolmens, burial mounds, passage graves, kitchen middens, etc. from the Stone Age and Bronze Age cultures across the landscape. Excavations at Tønnesminde and Endebjerg, for example, show evidence of human habitation from the Stone Age through the Viking Age.

===Norse mythology===

On this island, Saxo Grammaticus relates that there was a legendary battle, when the Swedish champion Hjalmar and his friend Orvar-Odd fought against the twelve sons of the Swedish berserker Arngrim. This battle was once famous, since it also figures in Faroese ballads, in Orvar-Odd&#x27;s saga and in Hervarar saga.

According to the Hervarar saga and the Waking of Angantyr, the mounds of the slain berserkers were haunted. This did not stop Arngrim&#x27;s granddaughter Hervor from approaching the mounds and demanding the enchanted sword Tyrfing from her father Angantyr.

&quot;Samsey&quot; (-&quot;&quot; being an earlier Norse form of -ø) is the island upon which Odin, under the name Jalk, learned Seid magic.

===Kanhave canal===
A canal was dug across the island at its narrowest place. The canal was about 500 m long and 11 m wide and could in its time be navigated by vessels with a draught of up to 1 m. It was dug and clad with wooden linings in the years 726-729 AD; the last part of the Scandinavian Iron Age. Kanhave canal is one of the largest known engineering projects of the Vikings and it is a sign of the centralized power of the time. Kanhave canal is thought of as instrumental to dominating the sea of Kattegat. There are plans to dig out the canal again.

===Medieval fortresses===
All known sources suggest that the island was the property of the Monarchy throughout medieval times, but it was an age of conflict and insecurity nevertheless, as a total of five fortresses were built on Samsø in the Middle Ages; Vesborg where the lighthouse is nowadays, Gammel Brattingsborg where the town of Tranebjerg is now, Hjortholm on the islet of the same name in the Stavns Fjord lagoon, Bisgård at the bishop&#x27;s palace (official residence) in the parish of Onsbjerg and the small fortification of Blafferholm in the garden of Brattingsborg manor. None of them are left standing today. Only the castle hills and the archaeological excavations of the foundations remains. The National Museum of Denmark initiated thorough archaeological investigations of the fortification sites a few years ago and the field work terminated in 2012.

===The quarantine of Kyholm ===

From 1831-1857 there was a plague- and cholera-quarantine on the tiny island of Kyholm just east of Samsø. Here, ships returning from long voyages had to dock, if they had disease on board. There is an abandoned cemetery of around 100 graves on the island. Kyholm is accessible year round, but it is advised not to be around when the birds are breeding.

===German occupation===
The strategic location of Samsø led it to become a Wehrmacht outpost during the German invasion of Denmark (1940). During this time, an American B-17 Flying Fortress safely crash-landed in Alstrup after being forced down by a German fighter. Navigator Carl Groesbeck was almost immediately captured by Germans but other members of the plane, including Co-Pilot Miles McCormack, were hidden by locals for some time until they too were eventually captured. All the crew members survived the ordeal and the war, except tail-gunner Douglas Farris who was killed in action while in the air.

==Agriculture and sustainable production==

Agriculture has been the primary occupation on Samsø for millennia and nearly all of the island comprise cultured landscapes. Nowadays, farming is still an important business and the biggest contributor to the islands economy, but compared to the rest of Denmark, it has developed in its own direction. Free range farming is very prominent, and the agricultural produce comprise mostly potatoes, various other vegetables and berries as well as some animal husbandry. In the 2000s, especially the vegetable and berry production has increased, as the Samsø brand has become more widely known and popular. At the same time, packaging and industrial processing is increasingly taken care of on the island before shipping, again increasing the local revenue of the farming trade overall. Close to 16% of the islanders work in the fishing and farming sector, not including derived labour, compared to 3.5% countrywide.

In Denmark, Samsø is well known for its early harvest of new potatoes. The first few pounds of these potatoes usually fetch prices around £100, and are considered a great delicacy. Samsø is popular among French, Welsh and Irish people for strawberry picking during the months of June and July every year.
Ecological agriculture and production is significant on Samsø, with a broad network of cooperating associations. It comprise farming of a large variety of vegetables, grains and fruits, livestock meat and products (lambs, sheep, yarn, cows, pigs, horses, donkeys, goats, chickens, eggs), a dairy, a brewery, restaurants and cafés, candy production, permaculture and forest garden experiments. There are several plans for extending the overall ecological production and broaden the industry (a slaughterhouse, orangery, forest gardens and education), with a wish for creating more jobs and opportunity for inhabitants of the island.

==Renewable energy==

In 1997, Samsø won a government competition to become a model renewable energy community. At the time, Samsø was entirely dependent on oil and coal, both imported from the mainland. Therefore, Samso became the worlds first renewable energy island. 

Many different projects were started to realize the plan. An onshore wind farm comprising 11 turbines were built. The first turbine was erected and on-line in 2000. In addition to that, 10 offshore turbines (making a total of 21 altogether including land-based windmills), were completed in 2007, funded by the islanders. The people of Samsø heat their homes straw burned in a central heating system and they power some vehicles on biofuel which they also grow. The island has four district heating plants in total. Now 100% of the island&#x27;s electricity comes from wind power, with surplus electricity exported to the mainland grid, and 75% of its heat comes from local solar power and biomass energy. An Energy Academy, the Samsø Energiakademi, has opened in the town of Ballen. It is a community hall for energy concerns and a meeting place for energy and local development. The academy is currently working towards making Samsø 100% fossil fuel free by 2030, which is 20 years earlier than the national goal.

<text>Silkeborg () is a Danish town with a population of 51,805 (1 January 2024). 
Silkeborg is the seat of Silkeborg Municipality, with a population of 100,747 as of 2024.

Silkeborg is located in the middle of the Jutlandic peninsula, slightly west of the geographical centre of Denmark. The city is situated on the Gudenå River in the hilly and lush landscape of Søhøjlandet, surrounded by Denmark&#x27;s largest forest district and a great number of lakes. Silkeborg is also known as Denmark&#x27;s outdoor capital. The lakes between Silkeborg and Ry that are linked by the Gudenå, are known collectively as &quot;Silkeborgsøerne&quot; (the Silkeborg lakes).
The city is divided along an east–west axis by the lake of Silkeborg Langsø, which at the eastern side of the city, flows into the Gudenå River. 

==History==
Silkeborg was the site of a castle, a monastery and a farming estate, established in the 15th century, some 6 km from Alling Abbey. 
The modern town grew around the Drewsen og Sønner paper mill, established in 1844. Silkeborg Papirfabrik (Silkeborg Paper mill) was located near the Gudenå River where Silkeborg castle once stood, in order to exploit the river as a source of energy for the mill, as a resource for paper production and as a means of transport. Michael Drewsen, regarded as the founder of the city, was responsible for the daily management of the mill. A statue of Michael Drewsen now stands in front of the old city hall in the town square.
A commission to establish Silkeborg as a trading centre was set up in 1845, and the site grew into a small settlement, from a population of 30 in 1844 to 556 in 1850 and to 1,204 in 1855. The City Council and the Parish were both established in 1855. The railway was built in 1871.
Silkeborg was given the status of market town (&quot;købstad&quot;) in 1900. The population was recorded as being 7,228 in 1901, and 8,792 in 1911. 
During the German occupation of Denmark, the Gestapo turned the Silkeborg Bad (Silkeborg Baths), which had until then served as the municipal sanatorium, into its Danish headquarters. The remnants of German bunkers can still be seen today, and one of these bunkers is now a public museum.

==Geography==
Silkeborg is located in the region known as Søhøjlandet (lit.: the lake-highland) in mid-eastern Jutland. The landscape consists mostly of lakes, extensive woodlands (such as the Silkeborg Forests) and some of the highest points in Denmark, including Himmelbjerget. It is also one of the most expensive areas in Denmark in which to live, and the neighbouring village of Sejs is known for its particularly large mansions and lakeside villas at Brassø.

==Economy==
For many years the paper mill (Silkeborg Papirfabrik) was the most prominent business in the city, but during the 1990s it suffered financial difficulties. In 1993, the German corporation, Drewsen Spezialpapiere, bought the mill, but in 2000 decided to close it. An urban renewal project turned the industrial area closest to the city centre partly into a new commercial district with a hotel, a cinema, a concert hall, restaurants and cafés; and partly into a new residential neighbourhood with modern apartment buildings.

The city has a large number of car dealerships, and is also the headquarters of Jyske Bank, Denmark&#x27;s third-largest bank.

==Main sights==
* Silkeborg Museum: The oldest preserved building in the city is Silkeborg Manor, constructed in 1767. This building is now Silkeborg Museum where the naturally mummified corpse of the Tollund man, who lived during the 4th century BC, is on display.
* City square: The old city square (Torvet) is the centre of Silkeborg and is together with the surrounding streets a pedestrian area. The city square is surrounded by the Hotel Dania (Silkeborg&#x27;s oldest hotel, founded in 1848), the Old Town Hall, and the city church (Silkeborg Kirke). On the city square, there are two fountains and the bronze statue of Michael Drewsen, the founder of Silkeborg. On Saturdays, the square hosts the city&#x27;s weekly market.
* Hjejlen: The world&#x27;s oldest steamboat Hjejlen is one of the tour boats that take off from Silkeborg harbor.
* Aqua: The freshwater aquarium Aqua is one of the region&#x27;s best-visited sights. In the indoor aquarium and outdoor animal park, fish and animals characteristic of Danish wildlife are on show to locals and visitors alike; the main attractions being fish, birds, otters, beavers and racoons.
* Museum Jorn: Silkeborg was the home city of COBRA painter Asger Jorn, and many of his most famous paintings can be seen at the museum named for him.
* Silkeborg Bad: The former sanatorium, Silkeborg Bad served as headquarters for the Nazi German Gestapo during World War II. A Bunker Museum is now located in the park and in the old sanatorium buildings houses an art museum. Many of the museum&#x27;s sculptures can also be seen in the park for free. The natural spring, Arnakkekilden, is located in the park next to Lake Ørnsø. Danish brewery Carlsberg has used the water for bottled spring water for many years. 
* Himmelbjerget: The third highest point in Denmark is called Himmelbjerget and is not exactly located in the city, in fact not even in Silkeborg County. However, it remains a sight closely linked to the city as tour boats all summer depart from Silkeborg Harbour.
* Lake fountains: The fountains in Silkeborg Langsø are among the largest in northern Europe and are a landmark of the city. Constructed in 1970 the fountains are actually built into the lake in front of City Hall. The fountains have a magnificent light show and after dark the water cascades change colour. The colour change is programmed to last 30–40 minutes.
* Indelukket: The marina and recreation area Indelukket is located close to Museum Jorn, and is a popular spot for social gatherings over the summer months. There is a park, a restaurant and Denmark&#x27;s oldest miniature golf course.

==Yearly events==
* The SCC country music festival has been an annual event since 1986. The festival takes place in Indelukket during the second weekend of August.
* The Riverboat Jazz Festival takes place the last weekend of June every year. The festival is not connected with a single location, but instead various stages can be found around the city, most prominently at the harbour and the city square.
* Hede Rytmer (English: Hot rhythms) is an annual rock and pop festival held in Indelukket at the beginning of the summer. In 2011 Boney M., 10CC and The Orchestra, the former Electric Light Orchestra played at the 3-day festival.
* Silkeborg Reggae Festival, also known as Raggapak, was a reggae festival.

==Regatta==
Since 1899 Silkeborg has hosted an event called &quot;Ildfestregatta&quot;, which means &quot;fire party regatta&quot;. The event is held once every three years. During the regatta the city streets are closed to traffic in the evening, becoming temporary venues where live music is performed, merchandise is sold from stalls, and an amusement park operates. The houses next to the Gudenå River are decorated with colourful lamps, as are the many boats that enter the port at this time.

On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 0:00 p.m., there is an unofficial Danish fireworks championship. Each day, a different company puts on a fireworks display and the winner is announced on Saturday. On Saturday evening, the winner from three years before puts on a major firework show sponsored by the City Council. Nowadays the fireworks are fired from a huge raft on Silkeborg Lake just next to City Hall, however, in years gone by, the show was done from the roof of the old paper mill.

==Sports==
The two most popular sports in Silkeborg are football and handball. The city&#x27;s professional football team, Silkeborg IF, play in Danish football&#x27;s highest league, the Danish Superliga. The team has won the League Trophy once, in 1994; the Danish Cup in 2001; and the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1997. Silkeborg IF plays its home matches at Silkeborg Stadion, renamed Mascot Park after the company Mascot, a textiles manufacturer, which bought the rights to the stadium name. It is located close to the city centre and has a capacity of 10,000 people.

Silkeborg&#x27;s professional handball team is BSV (named after the three towns of Bjerringbro, Silkeborg, and Voel). The team is a part of the Danish Handball League, and plays its home matches at Jysk Arena, previously known Silkeborg Hallerne, a sports centre northeast of the city centre. The ladies handball team Silkeborg-Voel usually plays its home matches at Voel Hallerne about 10 km from Silkeborg.

The motor racing circuit Jyllands-Ringen is located about 5 km east of the city centre, in Resenbro. The circuit is 2.3 km long and was a part of the DTC, (Danish Touringcar Championship) and currently a part of the TCR Scandinavia Touring Car Championship and the TCR Denmark Touring Car Series.

Silkeborg IF Cykling is a cycling club based in Silkeborg. In 2004, the club created an élite amateur team, called Team Designa Køkken. Its biggest accomplishment came in 2008 when rider Jakob Fuglsang won Danmark Rundt (i.e. The Tour of Denmark).

Silkeborg has a ski resort, with natural snow in winter, and also a nylon track that allows for year-round skiing. The ski resort is located in Gjern about 15 km from the city centre. In March 2019, Silkeborg hosted the World Women&#x27;s Curling Championships.

==Media==
Silkeborg is served by two media outlets; a newspaper and a radio station. The oldest of the two is the daily newspaper &quot;Midtjyllands Avis&quot; founded in 1857 as &quot;Silkeborg Avis&quot;. It is the sixth oldest newspaper in Denmark and was founded when the town of Silkeborg had only existed for 11 years. For many years the paper had its own paper press, but now it is printed at Jyllands-Posten&#x27;s facilities.

&quot;Midtjyllands Avis&quot; is now owned by the Silkeborg Avis group. This group is also the joint owner of the radio station Radio 1 (formerly known as Radio Silkeborg), a commercial radio station broadcasting online and on FM across central Jutland. The radio station tends to air a mix of pop music and local news. The sister station, Silkeborg Guld, tailors its programming for audiences interested in older Danish and English music, only interrupted by adverts. The newspaper and the radio station are both headquartered at Papirfabrikken.

On the 16th of August 2013 it was announced that Radio Silkeborg was to be handed over to the Radio ABC Group. As a consequence, five employees were made redundant, but programmes would continue to be broadcast on the same FM frequency.

==Transportation==
* Road: Silkeborg is connected by motorways to Aarhus, Herning, Horsens, Randers and Viborg. A new motorway was completed in September 2016 connecting Silkeborg to Aarhus and Herning. Regional buses to the surrounding cities depart from the train station. Local public transport includes 12 local bus routes serving the city centre and suburbs.
* Rail: The main station, Silkeborg railway station, is on the railway line between Aarhus and Herning, with services currently operated by GoCollective. The former railway connections to , and were closed in the 1960s, meaning the city has been left with eastward and westward trains only.
* Water: The Gudenå River was for many years an important transport link for passengers and cargo, but passenger transport along the river is now only available for tourists during the summer.
* Airport: Midtjyllands Lufthavn (Karup Airport) is the closest airport, located 40 km North West of the city. The airport offers several daily flights to the Danish capital, Copenhagen.

<text>Skanderborg is a town in Skanderborg Municipality, Denmark. It is situated on the north and north eastern brinks of Skanderborg Lake and there are several smaller ponds and bodies of water within the city itself, like Lillesø, Sortesø, Døj Sø and the swampy boglands of Eskebæk Mose. Just north of the town on the other side of Expressway E45, is the archaeologically important Illerup Ådal. Over time, the town has grown into a suburb of Aarhus to the north east, connected by the urban areas of Stilling, Hørning and Hasselager.

Skanderborg is home to a population of 20,116 (1 January 2024), out of Skanderborg Municipality&#x27;s total population of 65,205 (2024).

==History==
Skanderborg is an old town and the area have revealed traces of human settlements, dating from the earliest Nordic Stone Age. A seasonal camp from the Ertebølle culture, was found here in the 1930s for example, near the former Ringkloster (English: &quot;Ring Abbey&quot;) on the southern brinks of Skanderborg Lake.

The town sprawled around the former Skanderborg Castle, founded at some point during the early Middle Ages and in 1583 Skanderborg was granted a municipal charter.

===Religious orders===
The town of Skanderborg has attracted several religious communities over the years, especially in the early Middle Ages. The long gone Ring Abbey founded by Benedictine nuns in the 12th century, was once situated on the southeastern brinks of Skanderborg Lake. The last buildings burned down in 1715 and now there is a mansion at the site. There also used to be a Dominican monastery on the small islet of Kalvø in the middle of the lake. The monastery was founded by the Black Friar Order in the first half of the 12th century, along with a small harbour, but in 1168 there were only two monks left and the Cistercian Order took over. The Cistercians came here after they had failed in founding a proper monastery at several nearby locations since 1165. In that year, they embarked on a mission from Vitskøl Abbey in Himmerland, to found a daughter community in the diocese of Aarhus and tried at Sabro, at Sminge near Silkeborg (Sminge Abbey), and then near the village of Veng (Veng Abbey). The Cistercians eventually felt too isolated on the small isle of Kalvø, often cut off from the mainland for days and weeks even when the weather was harsh, and after just four years, they gave up here, too, and moved to Rye between Mossø and Gudensø, a few kilometres west of Skanderborg. Here they founded Øm Abbey in 1172.

==Buildings and structures==
===Skanderborg Castle===

The royal residence of Skanderborg Castle was arguably the most important and influential building in the history of Skanderborg, but it was demolished stone by stone during the 18th century. Founded at some point in the early Middle Ages around 1200, King Frederik II had the old medieval castle radically rebuilt and expanded around 1570. His project was grandiose in scale. An entirely new large Renaissance palace was erected and the deer park of Skanderbrog Dyrehave was constructed nearby, amongst other undertakings. Stones from the demolished Øm Abbey west of Skanderborg were used as construction materials. Many of the original structures survived the project and were incorporated into the new buildings, amongst these the old castle chapel. In the 12th-16th centuries, Skanderborg Castle functioned as the traditional hunting retreat of the Danish kings.

====Demolition====
In the years of 1717–22, King Frederik IV began demolishing the old original medieval structures and replaced the former fortifications with terraced gardens. Only the bell tower of the still existing castle church remained. In turn however, Skanderborg Castle saw a decline in popularity and attention by the royal family, and in 1767, the castle with associated gardens was sold at auction. Commoner Hans Lauritzen bought the royal property for the sum of 3004 Rigsdaler, while the castle church with furnishings and bells was granted to the town of Skanderborg. In April 1768, the demolishing of Skanderborg Castle began and nothing remains of it today, except the old castle church.

===Present buildings and structures===

The town of Skanderborg has a total of three churches, and Skanderborg Castle Church used to be part of the former Skanderborg Castle.

The cultural centre of Kulturhuset, located in Byparken (the city park) in the center of Skanderborg, was designed by native architectural firm Kjær &amp; Richter and built in 1998. It houses the former library of the town, theatre and concert halls, a cinema, a three-story foyer with changing exhibitions and a café. Surrounding the buildings, are a Greek theatre with 500 seats, a playground and a beach volley field, amongst other facilities, as the city park itself is perceived as part of the cultural centre.

The square of Højvangens Torv, in the northeastern parts of the town, is the center of the educational campus known as Campus Højvangen. The campus is the site of educational institutions such as a public school, a business college (an HHX institution), technical college (an HTX institution under Aarhus Tech), an adult educational centre, Skanderborg Gymnasium etc., situated in a sculpture park. The gymnasium was designed by architectural firm Friis &amp; Moltke and built in 1973.

The Village of Sølund is an accommodation facility and home for people with extensive physical and mental handicaps. It is located within the park of Skanderborg Dyrehave near the pond of Lillesø, close to town. The main buildings were erected in 1935 and designed by architectural firm C. F. Møller Architects.

Skanderborg Museum has their headquarters at Adelgade 5, a former bailiff (Danish: &quot;foged&quot;) house from the mid 18th century. The buildings are located in the oldest parts of the town, next to the pond of Lillesø. The Museum functions as an umbrella organisation for several museums in and around the town of Skanderborg, including Museet på Adelgade, Øm Kloster Museum, Museet på Gammel Rye Mølle, Ferskvandsmuseet and Skanderborg Bunkerne. Skanderborg Bunkerne is a World War II museum, fitted out in the abandoned German bunkers in Skanderborg Dyrehave. The German Luftwaffe built their Danish headquarters here and one of the bunkers later found use as the command centre for the civil defence agency during the Cold War era. Øm Kloster Museum is located outside the town, at the old ruins of Øm Abbey on the northern brink of lake Mossø. Skanderborg Museum is the responsible organisation for archaeology and archiving of the cultural history within the municipality.

==Nature==
===The deer park===
In the southern part of the town is the deer park of Skanderborg Dyrehave, located within Skanderborg Forest. The deer park was established around 1580 by King Frederik II to facilitate his interest in hunting. The park area was fenced and roe deer, red deer, wild boars and rabbits were released. Pheasants, gray partridge and turkeys were raised and pools and fishing ponds were dug.

===The lake===
Skanderborg Sø (English: &quot;Skanderborg Lake&quot;) was created during the last ice age and formed from a melting block of ice left behind; a so-called kettle hole. The lake has an irregular shape divided into two larger lake-areas known as Hylke and Store Sø respectively, with a total surface area of 8.6 square kilometers. The lake has an average depth of 8 meters and up to 18.8 meters at the deepest spot. It holds approximately 49.3 million cubic meters of freshwater 23.5 meters above sea level and empties into Mossø, by the short stream of Tåning Å in the west. There are a number of small isles in the lake; Kalvø, Æbelø, Sct. Thomas and Sct. Helene.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
Skanderborg is served by Skanderborg railway station. It is located on the Fredericia–Aarhus and Skanderborg–Skjern railway lines and offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Frederikshavn and regional train services to Aarhus, Fredericia, Herning, Silkeborg and Skjern.

==Events==
Since 1980, the Skanderborg Festival, an annual music festival, has been held in August in Skanderborg Dyrehave.

Every summer in June, Skanderborg also hosts a musical festival targeted specifically for people suffering from arrested development. Organised by the institution of Sølund, it claims to be the largest festival in the world of its kind.

<text>Until 1 January 2007 Sønderhald municipality was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Aarhus County in the eastern part of the Jutland peninsula (Djurs) in central Denmark. It covered an area of 138 km2, and had a total population of 8.503 (2005). Its last mayor was Kirsten Wyrtz, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party. The site of its municipal council was Auning. Other towns in the municipality were Assentoft, Uggelhuse, and Øster Alling.

The municipality was created in 1970 due to a (&quot;Municipality Reform&quot;) that combined a number of existing parishes:
* Auning Parish
* Essenbæk Parish
* Fausing Parish
* Hørning Parish
* Vester Alling Parish
* Virring Parish
* Årslev Parish
* Øster Alling Parish

Sønderhald municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). The eastern part of the municipality was combined with Nørre Djurs, Rougsø and Grenaa municipalities to form the new Norddjurs municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 661 km2 and a total population of 34,382 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Midtjylland (&quot;Mid-Jutland Region&quot;). The remainder was incorporated into an enlarged Randers municipality along with Randers, Nørhald, and Purhus municipalities, as well as parts of Mariager and Langå.

<doc id="144283" wikidata="Q502678" url="?curid=144283" title="Ertholmene">
<text>Ertholmene (formerly spelled &quot;Ærtholmene)&quot; is a small archipelago in Denmark. The largest island is Christiansø, whose name is often used with reference to the entire archipelago. Ertholmene are situated northeast of Gudhjem, Bornholm, and include Denmark&#x27;s easternmost point. Two of the islands, Christiansø and Frederiksø, are inhabited, with a combined permanent population () of 91. The archipelago has a total area of . Its name is derived from the Danish for &quot;pea islands&quot;.

Historically an important navy location, the fortress closed in 1855. Since then there has been no operable military infrastructure on the archipelago, but it remains under the formal administration of the Ministry of Defence, which employs 25 to 30 people for maintaining the islands&#x27; civilian infrastructure, museum and historical buildings. Today the economy of Ertholmene is almost entirely based on tourism, with tens of thousands of visitors each year, the majority on day-trips from Bornholm during the summer months. The archipelago&#x27;s buildings and nature are protected by law, and access to the uninhabited islands is restricted.

== Islands ==
Ertholmene consists of three main islands, Christiansø, Frederiksø and Græsholm, plus a number of rocks and skerries. The inhabited islands of Christiansø and Frederiksø are accessible to visitors, but the remaining are only accessible to people with special permission.

* Christiansø, named after King Christian V, has an area of ; it is the largest island in the archipelago. It is home to Christiansø Church and Christiansø Lighthouse. The highest point of Ertholmene is Møllebakken on Christiansø, above sea level.
* Frederiksø, named after King Frederick IV, has an area of . It is the only other inhabited island besides Christiansø. It is located just west of Christiansø, and connected to it via a swing bridge for pedestrians. The sound between Christiansø and Frederiksø is a well-sheltered natural harbour. Frederiksø is home to Christiansø Museum, which is situated inside Lille Tårn (&quot;Little Tower&quot;).
* Græsholm has an area of and is located northwest of Frederiksø. It is uninhabited and serves as a bird reserve, with large breeding colonies of common eider, red-breasted merganser, gulls, common murre and razorbill. These murre and razorbill colonies used to be the only in Denmark, but in recent decades smaller numbers began breeding at Hammeren on Bornholm (very large numbers winter in Danish seas).
* Østerskær is a skerry located east of Christiansø. It is the easternmost point of Denmark, at 15° 11&#x27; 55&quot; E longitude.
* Tat is a skerry located northwest of Christiansø and Frederiksø. It is long and wide, and surrounded by a number of smaller skerries. It contains a lighthouse, and serves as a bird reserve. Ertholmene is home to a large population of grey seals and it is not unusual for hundreds to rest on Tat.

==History==

Fishermen from Bornholm have used Ertholmene for temporary shelter since the Middle Ages. The first permanent settlement was the result of the Danish-Swedish conflicts in the late 17th century. As Denmark needed a naval base in the central Baltic Sea, a fortress was built on Christiansø and Frederiksø in 1684 which served as an outpost for the Danish Navy until 1855. Christiansø Church originally served the garrison. The population peaked at the census in 1810 which showed 829 inhabitants. They were soldiers and were there because of the Gunboat War. 

Many of the historical buildings now serve as living quarters for the local population, and some are rented, year after year, to regular summer residents. The islands&#x27; external appearance has changed very little in over 300 years. Girdled by thick granite walls with old cannons pointed seaward, Christiansø is a picturesque tourist spot seemingly frozen in time. A former part of the fortress, &quot;Store Tårn&quot; has housed the Christiansø Lighthouse for the past 200 years, and a small round tower on Frederiksø, &quot;Lille Tårn,&quot; serves as a museum.

== Notable people ==
* Ernst Wilhelm Stibolt (born 1741 in Christiansø – 1796) a Danish naval officer and ship builder; his father, (naval) Commander Caspar Henrik Stibolt, was Commandant of Christiansø for many years. 

==Demography and administrative status==

Together with Bornholm, Ertholmene is part of Landsdel Bornholm. Ertholmene makes up the Parish of Christiansø in the Church of Denmark and is served by Christiansø Church. On 1 January 2017 out of 78 inhabitants in total there were 69 members of the Church of Denmark (88.46% of the population). Ertholmene has never been part of a municipality, county, or region.

The islands form an unincorporated area that does not belong to either a municipality or a region. Instead they are state property governed by an administrator, appointed by the Danish Ministry of Defence, with the responsibility being the tasks normally performed by municipalities and other public sector civil services.

== Economy ==
The major sources of income in Ertholmene is tourism. There are about 45,000 visitors per year, mostly day visitors arriving via Bornholm during the summer months. Ertholmene is also a popular destination for yachting. Fishing used to be the main source of income, but today there are no commercial fishers on the islands.

=== Taxation ===
The islanders, who do not pay municipal taxes of any kind and were never part of a municipality, were exempt from the central government &quot;Health Contribution&quot; tax (&quot;Sundhedsbidrag&quot;) which stood at 8% when it was introduced on 1 January 2007 with &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), because it was thought that the relatively isolated islets would otherwise be abandoned. This tax replaced the county tax, which the islanders were also exempt from paying, not being part of a county. From 1 January 2019 this tax has been abolished, while income taxes in the lowest bracket have been raised simultaneously instead with this tax being phased out. From 2012, the tax was lowered by one percentage point per year.

<doc id="144284" wikidata="Q926571" url="?curid=144284" title="Hasle, Bornholm">
<text>Hasle is a town and a former municipality on the west coast of the Baltic island of Bornholm, Denmark. Its population is 1,637 () The former municipality covered an area of , and had a total population of 6,382. It is now included in the municipality of Bornholm. With its pleasant setting, smokehouses, galleries and harbour, the town attracts many tourists.

==History==

The name &quot;Hasle&quot; appears to have originated from Old Danish &quot;hasli&quot;, meaning &quot;hazel&quot;, and was used in 1335 as the name of the northernmost of Bornholm&#x27;s four counties (&quot;herreder&quot;) before being applied to the town in 1546. In the middle of the 16th century, Hasle was granted rights as a market town (which it maintains today as Bornholm&#x27;s second smallest market town) authorizing it to have a local administration headed by a mayor and to practice manufacturing and trading. The town&#x27;s location on fertile land next to the sea provided fine opportunities for cultivating vegetables (carrots) and fishing (herring, cod and salmon). By 1658, when the population reached 300, Hasle began to be noticed. The town is remembered for the role it played in the 17th century when under the leadership of Jens Pedersen Kofoed, a merchant, and Povl Hansen Ancher, the local priest, its citizens helped to free Bornholm from Swedish rule.

During the 17th and 18th centuries various attempts were made to exploit the natural resources in the area, especially coal from around Sorthat and Muleby. There was, however, little market for coal on Bornholm except during emergencies such as the English Wars (1807–1814). From the end of the 19th century, coal quarrying therefore gave way to tile production from the local clay, resulting in a market for Hasle tiles in Denmark and beyond. The industrial area south of the town testifies to its coal, glass and tile factories, all of which have now closed, while tiles abound in Hasle itself, even gracing its pavements.

The town&#x27;s more recent prosperity is the result of the harbour, built in the late 19th century. As there was no natural harbour like those along Bornholm&#x27;s north coast, the harbour had to be built from scratch. But it was above all the harbour which drove the local economy, as can be seen from the town&#x27;s many smokehouses. Hasle also became a port of call on the steamship route to Copenhagen operated by the Østbornholmske Dampskipsselskab.

==Hasle today==
The town has maintained its character with its half-timbered houses and its more recent funkis additions. Its nine old farmhouses enhance the local heritage. Tourists are attracted by the whitewashed smokehouses, one of which is now a museum, and by the arts and crafts galleries. Part of the harbour is still used by fishing boats while a large area accommodates pleasure craft. There are hotels, restaurants, summer houses and camping facilities in the area.

==Churches==
Ruth&#x27;s Church to the east of Hasle stands on a hilltop 130 m above sea level. The belltower is said to be the oldest on the island. Hasle Church itself, built in the 15th century in a Late Gothic style, has a carved, early 16th century triptych.

<text>Nexø, sometimes spelled Neksø (), is a town on the east coast of the Baltic island of Bornholm, Denmark. With a population of 3,655 (as of 1 January 2024), it is the second largest town, as well as the largest fishing port on the island. Fishing was previously the mainstay of the town&#x27;s economy. Nexø is also the site of a distillery (Bornholmske Spiritfabrik ApS) and a mustard factory (Bornholmersennep ApS). The town is also a port of call for the passenger ferries linking Bornholm with Kołobrzeg in Poland. Dueodde, the largest beach on Bornholm, is located south of Nexø, in the southeastern corner of the island.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nexø&quot; is possibly a combination of the Old Norse elements &quot;nøkke&quot;, meaning Nix or water spirit, and &quot;sæ&quot; (sea). It was first documented in 1346 as &quot;Nexe&quot;.

==History==
Nexø originated as a fishing village for the parish of Bodilsker with a chapel attached to St Bodil&#x27;s Church. In 1346, it was granted rights as a market town, dealing in both the herring trade and in agricultural products. Over the centuries the town has suffered a number of disasters. The Lübeckers burned the town in 1510, in 1563 most of the inhabitants died from the plague and in 1645 it was plundered by 500 Swedish soldiers. In 1756 there was another serious fire and in 1872 a storm damaged the harbour.

Around 1800, the town became Bornholm&#x27;s administrative centre. In 1806, 21 ships and 47 boats were registered with Nexø as their home port. In 1879, a new harbour basin was completed and, in 1892, Denmark&#x27;s first communal drydock was opened. There were a number of subsequent extensions to the harbour facilities. 
The 19th century also saw the development of ship building, the foundation of an iron foundry (1864) and of the Østbornholmske Dampskibsselskab (East Bornholm Steamship Company) which operated a regular service to Copenhagen from 1877.
At the end of World War II, on 7 and 8 May 1945, Nexø (like Rønne) was bombed by Soviet aircraft when Gerhard von Kamptz, the commander of the German forces occupying Bornholm, refused to surrender, causing total destruction of the town centre on the harbour and the main square. To ease the ensuing housing problem, the Swedish State donated 175 wooden houses to the town. The Soviets had alerted the civilian population in advance, therefore the air raid only resulted in ten fatalities. Although the rest of Denmark had been liberated on 4 May, the Red Army occupied Bornholm from 9 May 1945 to 5 April 1946, when an agreement was reached with the Danish authorities and the island finally came under Danish rule once more.

Between 1900 and 1968, a railway connected Nexø with Rønne, the island&#x27;s largest town. The old station building at Rønne is still preserved, whilst Nexø is now host to a railway museum. The former Nexø Municipality (1970–2002) covered an area of with a population of 8,558, but is now included in Bornholm Municipality. The Hyundai Nexo is named after the city.

==Landmarks==

Nexø Church, dating back to the late Middle Ages, stands out with its half-timbered tower and copper spire. In the 18th century, it was enlarged as a result of Nexø&#x27;s prosperity from exporting fish and sandstone to Copenhagen. It has recently been renovated and redecorated.

Nexø Museum in the harbour area is housed in a historic sandstone building from 1796 which was the town hall until 1856 when it was replaced with a new building in Købmagergade. Around 1890, an extra storey was added. The museum opened in 1970. Exhibitions include coverage of the German occupation, the Soviet bombing and occupation after the war. There are documents and artefacts from Nexø&#x27;s earlier businesses, including its sandstone quarry and the old brewery. The Bornholm Railway Museum recreates the atmosphere of an old station with exhibits from Bornholm&#x27;s railways which operated from 1900 to 1968. Of particular interest is a renovated mail car.

Nexø is home to Bornholm Butterfly Park where over a thousand brightly coloured butterflies fly around in a former hothouse.

==The town today==
The town is centred on the harbour and the shopping area. Activity in the harbour area has increasingly moved away from fish processing to be replaced by new businesses, stores, and restaurants. Retail businesses in Nexø have benefitted from a growing number of tourists from the summer house developments to the south as well as from a reduction in facilities in the surrounding villages. There is a pleasant shopping area between the central square and the harbour. Nexø&#x27;s services include a large school, library, an old people&#x27;s home and various sports facilities.

==Surrounding area==
To the south of Nexø there are the beach resorts of Balka, Snogebæk and Dueodde, all famous for their fine white sand. Snogebæk has an attractive little harbour area while Dueodde is home to the island&#x27;s tallest lighthouse.

<text>Rønne () is the largest town on the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. It has a population of 13,759 (1 January 2024). It was a municipality in its own right from 1970 until 2002, when Bornholm was a county (Danish: &quot;Bornholms Amt&quot;). It has an area of 29.11 square kilometres (11.24 square miles) and is the administrative centre of the Bornholm municipality. 11,539 inhabitants live in Rønne Parish (number 16 on the map of parishes), which is a narrow piece of land on the westernmost of the island and stretching north and southward comprising around a third of the area of the former municipality. Knudsker Parish (number 11 on the map) made up the rest of the former municipality. Not all inhabitants of either Rønne (statistikbanken.dk/(table) KM1: number 400-7552) or Knudsker (400-7553) parishes live in the city (contiguous built-up area) of Rønne.

Owing to its natural harbour and its strategic position in the Baltic Sea, Rønne has an interesting history coming under German and Swedish influence during its development as a herring fishing port. Today, with its cobbled streets, half-timbered houses and interesting museums, it attracts visitors mainly from Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Poland.

==History==

Rønne probably originated around the year 1000 when a small fishing community grew up around the natural harbour. Around 1275, a small chapel dedicated to St Nicolas was built on the site where Rønne&#x27;s church now stands. The community was soon granted the status of a market town with its own mayor and council and its own law court. However, by the beginning of the 14th century, the King of Denmark, the Archbishop of Lund and even various north German princes were all competing for control of the town. The Germans took a special interest in Bornholm because of its strategic position in the Baltic Sea between the German coast and Visby in Gotland, off the coast of southern Sweden, at times establishing their own interests in the town. After the church&#x27;s expansion in 1360, the parish of Rønne was established.

As its trade prospered, by the beginning of the 15th century Rønne was repeatedly plundered and burnt by men from Lübeck. In 1525, they took control of Bornholm as compensation for the large debts that Denmark was unable to repay. They even allowed their own merchants to establish businesses in Rønne. Though the Lübeckers contributed to the success of the fishing trade, they demanded ever-higher taxes from the local population. The citizens took revenge, chasing the Lübeckers off while allowing other German communities to remain. The result was that in 1576, control of Rønne returned to the Danish Crown. However, the Baltic Sea had by this time lost much of its strategic importance. The fishing industry declined and after the town was twice struck by the plague in 1619 and 1655, it took decades for it to recover.

A further setback occurred in April 1658 when, in the midst of the Dano-Swedish war, Denmark ceded Bornholm to Sweden under the Treaty of Roskilde. The occupation was however short-lived as the Swedes were overcome by the local population in December of the same year.

In 1834, Rønne Town Hall was built on the &quot;Store Torv&quot;, the town&#x27;s main square. This important building was the centre of administration in Rønne and Bornholm for many years, and the island&#x27;s courthouse and jail were there.
At the end of World War II, on 7 and 8 May 1945, the town was bombed by Soviet aircraft when the commandant of the German occupying forces refused to surrender. The air raid destroyed 212 houses, but only ten civilians were killed, the population having been alerted in advance. Although the rest of Denmark had been liberated on 4 May, the Soviets occupied Bornholm on 9 May, sending the Germans back to Germany. The Soviet Union did not leave until 5 April 1946 when an agreement was reached with the Danish authorities, and the island finally came under Danish rule once more.

Most of the houses in Rønne were destroyed or damaged by the bombs and it took several years to rebuild the town, retaining its traditional architecture, quaint streets and half-timbered houses. The Swedes contributed 300 timber houses to the town while the rest of Denmark including Greenland and the Faroes raised the considerable sum of 8 million Danish kroner to help rebuild the town.
== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Rønne&#x27;s climate is a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb) with balanced temperatures year round. The island&#x27;s climate allows local variety of common fig trees, &quot;Bornholm&#x27;s Diamond&quot;, to thrive in the locality, lying far out of its normal habitats.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
The economic status of Rønne grew dramatically during the Middle Ages with the development of the herring industry. However, by the late 16th century, the fishing industry had begun to decline and for the next 300 years there was practically no further growth. The ceramic industry in the town surpassed that of the fishing industry and has continued into modern times, with as many as 50 ceramics shops in Rønne today. However tourism is now the most important contributor to the local economy: There are several notable sandy beaches in the area used by tourists.

===Local heat and electricity production===
The local utility company Bornholms Energi og Forsyning is located at the harbour of Rønne and produces electricity and heat.

===Grandfather clocks===

Rønne also became famous for its longcase clocks or &quot;Bornholmerure&quot; which were manufactured from the middle of the 18th century until around 1900. Interest in clock-making started when a Dutch ship sailing from England ran aground off Rønne in 1744 carrying five grandfather clocks which were damaged in the accident. In view of the clocks&#x27; value, the sailors called on Poul Ottesen Arboe, a local turner, who was able to repair them. As a result of the experience he gained in the repair work, he was able to manufacture clocks himself, giving birth to a new local industry.

Several workshops soon began to produce Bornholm clocks which became popular as they were cheaper than the more authentic models produced elsewhere. There were probably about 30 different clockmakers in the town at the beginning of the 19th century. By the 1840s, some 2,000 clocks were made each year. Over the years, they were produced in various styles with both wooden and metal casings. The smaller pendulum clocks which were also produced became popular too. Around the end of the 19th century, production came to a halt as industrially produced clocks became far cheaper than Bornholm&#x27;s handcrafted artefacts.

==Demographics==

==Landmarks==
The town has some quaint cobbled streets and low-timbered houses. Two streets of particular interest are the Laksegade and the Storegade, which contain many historic houses which were once the homes and trade buildings of merchants and noblemen. Notable landmarks include the Bornholm Museum, the Defence Museum (&quot;Forsvarsmuseet&quot;), St Nicolas&#x27; Church, the Smedegårds riding school in the southern part of town, and the lighthouse.

The Bornholm Museum offers an insight into the history of Rønne and the island of Bornholm, from the Paleolithic era to the modern age, including the occupation during World War II. The museum houses a number of Nordic Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts relating to the island and has a Mjolnir, discovered in Bornholm but now housed in the National Museum of Denmark, as its logo. It also has a notable collection of Roman coins, pottery and paintings.

The Rønne Lighthouse, a slender white-painted octagonal tower in cast iron, stands on the waterfront not far from the church. Constructed in 1880, it was decommissioned in 1989.

St Nicolas&#x27;s Church, with its distinctive tower, is part of the Diocese of Copenhagen and in its present form was enlarged and fully refurbished in 1918. It stands on the site of an earlier church or chapel from the 13th century of which some sections can still be seen.
&quot;Forsvarsmuseet&quot;, or the Rønne Defence Museum, is housed in a round tower with walls 3.5 m (11 feet) thick known as &quot;Kastellet&quot; or the citadel. Built in 1744 for the town&#x27;s defence, there was never any occasion for it to be used. The museum has numerous artefacts relating to military history such as guns, blades, bombs and uniforms. Store Torv, the central square, was formerly used for military parades. Several notable buildings lie in the heart of the town, including the Rønne Public Library, the Nordeabank and old merchant/noble warehouses and residences. Buildings of note include &quot;Erichsens Gård&quot;, built in 1806 and now a museum, the neo-classical &quot;Kommandantgården&quot;, built in 1846 and now a ceramics museum, and the &quot;Amtmandsgården&quot;, located at Storegade 36. The &quot;Toldboden&quot; is a merchant warehouse, built in 1624, and is one of Rønne&#x27;s oldest half-timbered buildings. The &quot;Torhus&quot; building, at the side of the square, was built in 1834 and is the former town hall, courthouse and jail. Rønne Theatre built in 1823 is Denmark&#x27;s oldest provincial theatre still in active use. &quot;Hovedvagten&quot; at Søndergade 12 was built as a guard house in 1744 with bricks from Hammershus which was being demolished at the time. It is the oldest brick house in the town. The Methodist Church with another distinctive tower was built 1917-1918 and consecrated 6 January 1918. Another sightworthy building in the centre of Rønne is the Baptist Church which was built in 1888.

==Transportation==

Rønne is connected to the rest of Denmark and to the outside world by ferry lines. Bornholmslinjen operates the lines to Køge, Ystad and Sassnitz, while Polferries operates the line to Świnoujście.

There is a high speed catamaran link to Ystad which connects with a direct train link between Ystad and Copenhagen.

Outside Rønne, Bornholm Airport offers flights to Copenhagen and to some summer destinations.

<text>Birkerød () is a town in Rudersdal Municipality in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is surrounded by several lakes and small woodlands. Birkerød station is located on the Hillerød radial of the S-train suburban network.

== History==
The parish of Birkerød contained the villages Birkerød, Kajerød, Bistrup, Ravnsnæs, Isterød, Høsterkøb, Sandbjerg and Ubberød.

Birkerød became a railway town in 1868, when the Nordbanen railway opened a station here between Lyngby and Helsingør. This led to new growth and several brickyards opened in the area in the second half of the 19th century. The rail line between Copenhagen and Hillerød was later converted to an S-train suburban line and construction of new residential neighbourhoods accelerated in the 1940s which, in time, made Birkerød merge with Bistrup to the south, Kajerød to the west and Ravnsnæs to the east.

==Geography==
Birkerød is bordered by 941-hectare Lake Furesø to the south and Lake Sjælsø to the north. The smaller Birkerød Lake is located just south of the railway station in the town centre. The approximately 86 hectares wetland Vaserne (in Danish) along the northeastern shores of Lake Furesø and the western part of Frederikslund Forest separate Birkerød (Bistrup) from Holte to the southeast. Bistrup Hegn is situated between Bistrup to the south and Birkerød to the north. Rude Forest is located to the east of Birkerød. Eskemose Forest at Lake Sjælsø, north of Kajerød, is the site of several natural springs.

== Townscape ==
Birkerød consists mainly of single family detached homes.

Tegnestuen Vandkunsten has designed a number of housing estates. Trudeslund (1980-81) is a co-housing community. The concept was later developed further with Jystrup Savværk in Jystrup. The Langkjærgård development is from 1985 and Blikfanget was built in 1988-1989. Søhuse (1995), a development of terraced housing, is located on a gently sloping site on the banks of Birkerød Lake.

==Culture and sports==
Mantziusgården, the former state school, is now used as a local cultural centre. Activities include art exhibitions, concerts, theatre and stand-up comedy. The premises also comprise four open workshops with facilities for making graphic art, glass art, ceramics and weaving. Other cultural Institutions includes Birkerød Library and the Local Historic Archives.

Birkerød Sports and Leisure Centre was built in 2007 and is located next to the indoor swimming hall and football pitches, both of which was renovated simultaneously. The new centre was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen and is used for a wide variety of activities, including team handball fitness and yoga as well as concerts and other cultural events. 

The local football club of IF Skjold Birkerød was founded in 1917, and currently plays the Danish 2nd Division East. Furesø Golf Club is based at Hestkøbgård in the western part of Birkerød. The club was established in 1974.

==Education==
Birkerød Gymnasium was founded as a private boys&#x27; school in 1868. In 2007 it changed name to Birkerød Gymnasium, HF, IB og Kostskole (Birkerød Gymnasium, HF, IB &amp; Boarding School). The name change is due to the additional education types added since the foundation of the school. The school has over 1000 students, 300 of those being International Baccalaureate (IB) candidates. It is currently the biggest public IB school in Denmark. There is also a boarding school with about 70 students living on campus. Most of these students have been expats earlier in their life and might still have family members living as expats around the world.

Since 2011, a Model UN at has been taking place annually at Birkerød Gymnasium. It is called BIGMUN (Birkerød Gymnasium Model United Nations) and it has attracted several hundreds of high-school students from around the world to debate as in the . At BIGMUN 2019, approximately 370 students from 33 different schools around the world participated. These countries include: United States, Israel, Germany, Spain and more.

==Buildings of worship==

Birkerød Church is a traditional Danish parish church whose oldest parts date from the late 12th and early 13th century. The tower was built in the late 15th century, the current chancel in about 1500 and the porch in 1525. The Parish of Bistrup was disjoined from that of Birkerød in 1963 and its church was inaugurated in 1967.

The property Nordvanggård housed a congregation of Sisters of the Precious Blood from the late 1950s until 2015. The Sisters belong to the German Province, the provincial house is in Neuenbeken near Paderborn. They also have a convent in Rønne on the island of Bornholm. The building is now owned by Rudersdal Municipality and is temporarily used to house refugees.

<doc id="144291" wikidata="Q1397223" url="?curid=144291" title="Farum Municipality">
<text>Farum municipality was a municipality (Danish &quot;kommune&quot;) in the northeast of the island of Zealand in eastern Denmark. On 1 January 2007 it merged with Værløse municipality to form the new Furesø municipality as a consequence of Denmark&#x27;s Municipal Reform.

== Geography ==
The municipality had a population of 18,662 (2005), covered an area of 23 km², and was, according to size, the smallest municipality of Frederiksborg County.

The main town and the site of its municipal council was Farum. Other villages were Bregnerød and Stavnsholt.

Neighboring municipalities were Birkerød to the east, Allerød to the north, Stenløse to the southwest and Værløse to the south. The municipality Søllerød to the southeast was separated from Farum by the lake Furesø. Most of Farum&#x27;s border to Værløse was made up by the lake Farum Sø, except for a short isthmus at Fiskebæk.

Between the two lakes of Farum Sø and Furesø, along the isthmus, runs a north–south traffic corridor with motorway, road and railway. This corridor effectively divides the former municipality in two sections, called Farum East and Farum West, which are only connected by bridges across the motorway.

==History==
In 1901 Farum had 1,200 inhabitants. In the early 1950s the population was ca. 4000. Through the 1960s and 1970s the community turned into a commuter town due to its proximity to Copenhagen and the population expanded past 10,000. By 1980 the population was over 16,000.

in 1952 Farum and other municipalities close to Copenhagen were granted a city-like status. Although the municipality consisted of only one parish, it was not affected by the municipal reform of 1970.

=== Farum scandal ===
The longtime mayor Peter Brixtofte was involved in a financial scandal that became the focus of national scrutiny in 2002. He was forced to resign after being implicated in a variety of corruption. He had been mayor since 1985 and had presided over what first appeared as a successful revitalization of the community with extended public services, including the establishment of a large sports arena, under-cover grants to the local football association, and &quot;well-being trips&quot;, free holiday trips to the Mediterranean for senior citizens. Brixtofte&#x27;s policy of forcing the unemployed to work in return for benefits was first controversial but has since become a nationwide rule. Another way of creating funds was to sell off public services and lease them back. In June 2006 Brixtofte was sentenced to two years prison.

After Brixtofte&#x27;s economic schemes went bust, Farum had to raise its municipal tax drastically. The neighbouring municipality of Værløse protested against being merged with Farum, as the government had proposed. Eventually the merger took place but a unique arrangement was granted, allowing the two parts of the new municipality to maintain separate tax rates, and a special government subsidy of 2,000 million DKK (350 million USD), paid over the next 15 years. Other municipalities with greater economic difficulties protested against this. Also, a newly closed air force air base (Flyvestation Værløse) was given to Furesø municipality to own and perhaps turn into a recreational area.

Farum&#x27;s last mayor was Lars Carpens who had replaced Brixtofte in 2002. Both were members of Venstre (Liberal Party).

<text>Until January 1, 2007, Fredensborg-Humlebæk Kommune was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) on the east coast of the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 72 km², and had a total population of 20,024 (2005). Its last mayor was John Hemming, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti) political party. The site of its municipal council was in Fredensborg. The municipality was a conglomerate of several small towns, the two major ones being Fredensborg and Humlebæk.

Fredensborg-Humlebæk municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Karlebo Kommune municipality to form the new Fredensborg Kommune. This created a municipality with an area of 112 km² and a total population of 39,187 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Hovedstaden (&quot;Capital Region&quot;).

==The towns of Fredensborg and Humlebæk==

The town of Fredensborg is the site of Fredensborg Palace. The palace by Lake Esrum (&quot;Esrum Sø&quot;) has special status among Danish palaces as the royal couple&#x27;s most used residence. The palace was built in the 18th century, and is in the baroque style. It is often used for official purposes, as well as privately by the royal family.

The town of Humlebæk has railroad connection to Elsinore (&quot;Helsingør&quot;) and Copenhagen. It is situated on the shores of the Øresund, and is surrounded by small patches of forest and fields on its three remaining sides. Once a residence for fishermen, today the town is a part of suburban Copenhagen, and is mainly composed of residential areas. There are several small but pleasant beaches along the coast; some of these are public beaches. 
==Attractions==
The best known attraction in the former municipality is the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.

<doc id="144294" wikidata="Q1796191" url="?curid=144294" title="Frederiksværk">
<text>Frederiksværk is a town with a population of 12,864 (1 January 2024) in Halsnæs Municipality on Zealand in Region Hovedstaden in Denmark.

==History==
A French cannon founder, Peyrembert, received permission to build a cannon factory here. Having gotten into difficulties, King Frederik V requested that his chancellery advisor, Johan Frederik Classen, take over the operation of the foundry. Under Classen&#x27;s management the town blossomed, and there came a gunpowder mill, as well as light industry and handicrafts to the town. This resulted in Classen&#x27;s being appointed major general. On 25 August 1756 the king issued a document permitting Classen to call the town &quot;Friederichswerk&quot;.

Classen was allowed to build a new foundry, Gjethuset, and it was constructed between 1761 and 1767. It has been used as a cannon foundry until 1928, and has been used for heavy industry until 1976. The building has been restored and reopened on 12 June 1996. It is now used as an art and culture center with theatre, music and art exhibitions. The original architect was either Lauritz de Thurah or Nicolai Eigtved. The word &quot;Gjethus&quot; comes from Low German &quot;Gethus&quot; and means &quot;foundry house&quot;.

Classen&#x27;s home in the neoclassical style, Arresødal, is still standing. It is in private ownership, but can be viewed from the outside.
==Attractions==
There are a number of churches from the Middle Ages in the villages near Frederiksværk. Vinderød Church, in the town of Frederiksværk, houses the sarcophagus of General Classen and has a view towards the Arresø.


===Town Museum===
The Town Museum is established in the old Arsenal, which was used as a storehouse for the cannons cast in Gjethuset. Displays in the museum concern weapon fabrication, gunpowder production and copper rolling during the years 1750 to 1900. There is also a restored grocery store from 1900.

===The Gunpowder Mill Museum===
The small open-air museum, part of the Industrial Museum Frederiks Værk, contains one of the world&#x27;s best-preserved powder mills with buildings and working machines from 1800. There is also a working watermill on the premises.

===Castle ruins===
The ruins of Dronningholm Castle lie near the Arresø. It was started by Valdemar the Great, and continued by his son Valdemar the Victorious. The castle was one of the largest in the country. but burned down in 1525. According to legend the castle was given as a gift to Queen Dagmar.

The ruins of Asserbo Castle are also open to the public for viewing and touring. Asserbo Castle, which lies in the woods of Tisvilde Hegn, was founded by Bishop Absalon in the 12th century and was used as a monastery for monks of the Cistercian Order, originally invited from France. The King took claim of the castle , and then by drifting sands. The castle was reclaimed from the sands, first by King Frederik VII in 1849, and then by the National Museum of Denmark excavations in 1972.

===GeoArt: art gallery &amp; crystalmuseum===
GeoArt is located at the northern tip of Lake Arre, between Frederiksværk and Helsinge. It has an art gallery with changing exhibitions and a permanent exhibition of gems and minerals including 225 million year old petrified wood from Arizona, amethyst from Brazil and fluorite from China.

==Frederiksværk municipality==
Until 1 January 2007 Frederiksværk was also a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Frederiksborg County on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark, located between Lake Arre (&quot;Arresø&quot;) and Roskilde Fjord. The municipality covered an area of 90 km², and had a total population of 20,340 (2005). Its last mayor was Helge Friis, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.

Frederiksværk municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with existing Hundested municipality to form the new Frederiksværk-Hundested municipality. The name was changed to Halsnæs Municipality on 1 January 2008.

<doc id="144298" wikidata="Q512540" url="?curid=144298" title="Hørsholm Municipality">
<text>Hørsholm Municipality () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the Capital Region in the northern part of the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 31 km2, and has a total population of 24,811 (1. January 2024). Its mayor as of 2010 is Morten Slotved, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Det Konservative Folkeparti&quot;).

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Hørsholm.

Neighboring municipalities, in line with the &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), are Fredensborg municipality (formerly Fredensborg-Humlebæk and Karlebo) to the north, Allerød municipality to the west, and Rudersdal municipality (formerly Birkerød and Søllerød) to the south. To the east is the Øresund, the strait that separates Denmark from Sweden. The distance to Sweden from the coast at Hørsholm is ca. 17 km to Landskrona or ca. 9 km to the Swedish island of Ven.

Hørsholm and the neighbouring town Rungsted (which is part of Hørsholm Municipality) has an average income per household among the highest in the country - a fact also strongly reflected in the price of housing in the area. Wealthy households are attracted to Hørsholm by its comparatively low income tax rate, proximity to forests and the sea. Moreover, the commuting distance to central Copenhagen remains reasonably short.

The Hørsholm Midtpunkt shopping mall with its 65 stores opened in the early 1970s and is the second largest shopping mall in Northern Zealand and among the ten largest shopping malls in the Copenhagen Capital Region.

Hørsholm municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 under the nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007). 

==History==
Hørsholm was the site of the infamous Hirschholm Palace, which served as the summer retreat for King Christian VII and his court in 1771, when his consort, Queen Caroline Matilda, gave birth to her child by Johann Friedrich Struensee, Princess Louise Augusta. The castle, referred to as the &quot;Versailles of the North&quot;, was neglected after that fateful year and torn down by Frederick VI, the King&#x27;s son, in order to provide building materials for Christiansborg Palace, which had burned down in 1794.

Hørsholm Church, built in 1832 and designed by Christian Frederik Hansen, is now found on the spot where the castle once stood.

Local museum &quot;Hørsholm Egns Museum&quot; (&quot;Hørsholm Local Museum&quot;) has a display dedicated to the palace and its fate. 

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Hørsholm&#x27;s municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

<text>Hundested is a town with a population of 8,538 (1 January 2024) and a former municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Region Hovedstaden in the northern part of the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark.

The former municipality is surrounded by water on three side: to the north is the Kattegat, to the west is the channel leading into the Isefjord, and to the south is Roskilde Fjord and the channel leading into it from the Isefjord.

The area is characterized by sand and dunes, especially on its northern side facing the Kattegat, but also found in the central areas and in the south. Kikhavn on the northern side of the peninsula, not far to the east of the town of Hundested, is the oldest fishing village in the area.

==Geography==

Hundested is situated at the tip of the Halsnæs peninsula which projects west from the northwestern corner of North Zealand, forming the west side of the entrance to Isefjord. The south coast of the peninsula is fronted by two cliffs which at Store Karlsminde Klint rises to 33 metres. It is located opposite the northern tip of Hornsherred, defining Kulhuse Rende, the one kilometer long entrance to Roskilde Fjord. To the west of Store Karlsminde Klint is the lower Skuldslev Klint which continues for about 1 kilometer to Lynæs Harbour. in the southern part of Hundested. The cliffs have formerly been subject to continuous erosion but is now sheltered by the harbor. The erosion has resulted in a shallow-watered area with water depths of only about one metre. To the east of Store Karlsminde Klint is a low area with coastal meadows, Sølager, which further inland gives way to forested slopes.

==History==
The name Hundested is first mentioned as a field &quot;Hundersted&quot; in 1682. As a village only in a parish register from 1844.

The Halsnæs peninsula was formerly the site of several villages. Kikhavn was a fishing village from at 16th century. In 1776, Frederiksværk&#x27;s founder, Johan Frederik Classen, established Grønnessegård manor on the peninsula in 1776, shutting down the villages of Gryndese, Rorup and Fornerup.

It is believed that the first building in present-day Hundested was a house for the local pilots built in the 1835.
A breakwater (&quot;Læmolen&quot;) was built at Hundested in 1862 and Lynæs Harbour was built in 1872. It soon developed into the most important fishing port on Zealand and was expanded several times before most of the fishing vessels moved to Hundested Harbour in about 1910. Most of the fish was sold to traders from Frederikssund before the railway which opened in 1916 provided easy access to Copenhagen by way of Hillerød. The ferries to Rørvig began operating in 1927 and they were joined by the ferries to Grenå in 1934. The harbor attracted many new companies, including the fish auctions, an importer of coal, a canned food factory, dockwayd and Hundested Motor Factory which for generations produced reliable engines for Danish fishing vessels. A new industrial district was established in the eastern outskirts of town, attracting several companies from the plastic and metal industries in the 1960s and 1970s. The harbor was expanded with a new ferry terminal in 1967, a new freight terminal in 1987 and a new container terminal in 1995.

A downturn in the fishing industry in the 1980s hit Hundested hard and the freight and passenger lines to Grenå ceased operations in 1996.

On 1 January 2007 Hundested municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with Frederiksværk municipality to form the new Frederiksværk-Hundested municipality. The name was changed to Halsnæs municipality on 1 January 2008. This created a municipality with an area of and a total population of 30,253.

==Economy==

Tourism plays an increasing role in the town&#x27;s economy. The harbor is being promoted as a hub for arts and crafts with galleries and workshops. Glassmedjens was completed in 2008 and house a large glass workshop where glass blowers can be seen at work. An annual handicrafts market, Beddingen, takes place in June, attracting some 50 professional artists and craftsmen. Hundested is also home to an annual sand sculpture festival.
Accommodation is available at the traditional inn Hundested Kro as well as Skansegården. Halsnæs Bryghus is a local micro brewery and brew pub.

Port of Hundested is a member of Cruise Copenhagen Network and three international cruise ships from Saga Cruise og Fred Olsen Line are scheduled to berth at Hundested in 2016.

===Ferries===

One ferry connects Hundested to the town of Rørvig in Odsherred municipality, another to Kulhuse in Frederikssund municipality from the town of Sølager. For many years the town had a ferry connection to Grenå in Grenå municipality on the Jutland peninsula from the town of Hundested which began service 14 July 1934. This has, however, in recent years been discontinued. One of the former ferries on the route now operates as an expedition cruise ship under the name MS Expedition.

Ferry service in the area has a long history. When Lynæs Inn, south of the town of Hundested, was established in 1804, it was licensed as an inn catering to ferry passengers, although in those days the service was highly irregular.

<text>Jægerspris is a town, with a population of 4,155 (1 January 2024), in eastern Denmark. It is situated in Region Hovedstaden, 6 km northwest of Frederikssund, on the northern part of the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;).

The town was established ca. 1870 around Jægerspris Castle, which is surrounded by kilometres of hiking and biking trails in the Jægerspris forest.

It was the municipal seat of the former Jægerspris Municipality (Danish, &quot;Kommune&quot;), until 1 January 2007.

==Attractions==

The &quot;Høegh-Guldbergs nationalhistoriske anlæg&quot; (&quot;Høegh-Guldbergs National Historical Garden&quot;) on the grounds of the castle commemorate the lives of exceptional Danish citizens with monuments designed in the 1770s by Johannes Wiedewelt, one of Denmark&#x27;s most important sculptors. The area also has ancient, archeological burial sites.

Another attraction is a windmill which was first constructed ca. 1615, in the times of King Christian IV. The current windmill is from 1854. The area boasts churches with typical Danish frescos. 

The local museum (&quot;Egnsmuseum&quot;) in Færgegården includes Crown Prince Frederik VIII&#x27;s bridge, which was erected in 1868.

There are also a couple of beaches within walking distance of the town.

== Jægerspris Municipality ==
The former Jægerspris Municipality covered an area of 96 km2, and had a total population of 9,480 (2005). Its last mayor was Ole Find, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.

A significant portion of the north end of Jægerspris is covered by forest. There are also stretches of sand and dunes along the municipality&#x27;s western side.

In addition to roadways leading southward into Skibby, there is a road across Roskilde Fjord to the town of Frederikssund. A ferry to Hundested from Kulhuse to Sølager was disbanded in recent years. As of 2006, the ferry has been reinserted and sails in the summer months.

On 1 January 2007 Jægerspris Municipality ceased to exist due to &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was combined with existing Frederikssund, Slangerup, and Skibby municipalities to form the new Frederikssund Municipality.

<text>Skævinge is a town with a population of 2,947 (1 January 2024) and a former municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Hillerød municipality in Capital Region of Denmark in the northern part of the island of Sealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The former Skævinge municipality covered an area of 68 km², and had a total population of 6,046 (2005).

On 1 January 2007 Skævinge municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged into existing Hillerød municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 191 km² and a total population of ca. 43,337.


==Geography==
Strø Bjerge, North Zealand&#x27;s largest esker, is located a few kilometres to the west of Skævinge. The area includes Vibjerg and Lundebakke. Arresø, Denmark&#x27;s largest lake, is located 4.5 kilometres to the north.

==History==

The name is first documented in 1211-14 as &quot;Skeping&quot;. The first part of the name may be derived from Old Danish &quot;skap &quot;, meaning &quot;something excavated&#x27;. The suffix -inge is frequently seen in Danish toponyms.

Skævinge was a village of considerable size in the Middle Ages but later shrunk and the parishes of Skævinge and Gørløse were therefore merged. The civil parish of Skævinge-Gørlse was formed in the 1840s. The opening of the Hillerød-Frederiksværk Railway in 1897 brought new development to the town and by the 1940s Skævinge was by far the largest village in the area between Hillerød, Frederiksværk and Frederikssund.

The 1970 Danish Municipal Reform merged Skævinge-Gørløse with the civil parishes of Strø and Store Lyngby under the new Skævinge Municipality. It was incorporated in Gillerød Municipality in 2007.

==Landmarks==

Sjævinge Church dates from the 12th century. It is known for its large 16th-century mural of Ogier the Dane. Skævinge Rectory is from 1846–52. It consists of four detached wings with timber framing and thatched roofs and was listed in 1971. Another old village church, Strø Church, is situated about 1 kilometer to the south of Skævinge. Øllingegaard, an organic farm dairy, is located on the southeast side of town.

Kornmarkskolen is a public primary school with 709 pupils (2015). Retail stores include a SuperBrugsen and a Netto.

==Transport==
Skævinge railway station is located on the Frederiksværk railway line between and .

==Health Care for Older People ==
The Skaevinge Municipality set up an Integrated Home Care project in 1984. It was evaluated by the Danish Institute of Health Care in 1997. The project had two main features: 
* Health care was made available to all citizens in institutions and in their own homes. 
*Prevention and support to maintain and strengthen the citizens&#x27; own health and quality of life were prioritised. 
Citizens were jointly involved in decision-making with staff who were given more autonomy working in small teams.

In 1997 40.8% of older people in the town assessed their own health as good in comparison with 28.9% people of the same age in 1985. The number of days people over 67 spent in hospital fell by 30%. The nursing home was closed and became a hub for community support services which included a senior center, day care, rehabilitation, 24-hour home care, and assisted living organised in three geographical teams. Nursing home staff were guaranteed jobs in the new set up. This integrated approach, pioneered in Skævinge, was widely adopted in Denmark. Nursing homes and home care organizations were no longer staffed separately. Between 1985 and 1997 the number of nursing home beds in Denmark was reduced by 30%.

== Notable people ==
* Ogier the Dane (13th C.) legendary knight of Charlemagne, he appears on a 16th C. mural in Skævinge church
* Jens Peter Berthelsen (1854 in Skævinge – 1934) a Danish fencer, competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics
* Tina Lund (born 1981) a Danish professional equestrian show jumper and TV celebrity, lives in Skævinge

<doc id="144314" wikidata="Q847014" url="?curid=144314" title="Funen County">
<text>Funen County () is a former county (Danish: &quot;amt&quot;) in central Denmark, comprising the islands of Funen, Langeland, Tåsinge, Ærø, and approximately 90 other islands, of which only 25 are inhabited. The county was formed on 1 April 1970, comprising the former counties of Odense and Svendborg. The county was abolished from 1 January 2007, when it merged into Region of Southern Denmark (&quot;Region Syddanmark&quot;).

The county employed around 20,000 people working in more than 160 institutions located all over Funen.

==Insignia==
Funen County&#x27;s coat of arms showed three connected gold hop leaves on a field of red, representing three former counties of Odense, Svendborg and Assens. The choice of hop leaves comes from Funen native Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s song &quot;I Danmark er jeg født&quot; (&quot;In Denmark I was born&quot;), where he refers to Funen as &quot;Æblegård og humlehave&quot; (Apple farm and hop garden).

For common daily usage, a more modern and IT-friendly version was used. In this version, the background was green and the hop leaves white and much less detailed. Alternate versions had a red or, on occasion, a black background.

The coat of arms was registered in 1976.

<text>Ærøskøbing () is a town on the island of Ærø, Denmark. The suffix -købing means a trade town in the languages that derive from Old Norse.

Ærøskøbing&#x27;s houses and streets are delicately restored to retain the character of the olden days. Most of them are one story tall, and the oldest ones date back to 1645.

In the old part of the town are many fine examples of the work of skilled bricklayers, carpenters, and blacksmiths. Behind the idyllic façade of the town is a live and active town that has solved successive generations&#x27; housing needs for centuries.

Ærøskøbing was awarded the Europa Nostra prize in 2002. The prize is awarded by the EU as a special appreciation of looking after cultural heritage.

== History ==
From about 1250 Ærøskøbing was the centre for the island&#x27;s commercial and maritime trade. A fire in 1629 destroyed a large number of houses, but afterward, the town experienced a renaissance. Old houses were rebuilt, but also new, larger houses were erected in styles owing much to traditions from Funen, northern Germany and the duchy of Schleswig, under which Ærø was incorporated until 1864, when it was transferred to Denmark (de jure in 1867). The town as it is today illustrates a continuous building culture that has developed over several centuries.

== Tourism ==
Ærøskøbing Church at the market square is the third church on that location and on the square are the two old town pumps that supplied the town with water right up until 1952.
The Prior&#x27;s house from 1690 is one of the town&#x27;s oldest dated buildings. It was purchased and restored in 1917 by Alexis Prior.

The old harbour has been enlarged by a new marina and the beach at Vesterstrand with its colourful little beach huts is only a few minutes&#x27; walk from the town and the harbour.

The cook house: Until the middle of the nineteenth century it was forbidden to cook over an open fire on a ship moored in the harbour. The danger of fire on wooden ships was simply too great and the town cook house was built to serve as the harbour cooking facility. The small, whitewashed building is from 1810. The Ærøskøbing Association helped with its restoration in 2001, and now again it serves its original purpose as a place where yachtsmen can prepare food.

The town windmill (of Dutch origin from 1848) has become a landmark for the town, and is approached from the south by the main road.

<text>Assens () is a town with a population of 6,001 (1 January 2024) on the west coast of the island of Funen on the eastern side of the Little Belt in central Denmark. By road, Assens is located southwest of Odense, northwest of Faaborg, and southeast of Middelfart. Assens is the municipal seat of Assens Municipality in Region of Southern Denmark. It was the birthplace of sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau who married the well-known portraitist Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann; both artists&#x27; works are exhibited at the local art museum, Vestfyns Kunstmuseum.

==Etymology==
In the Danish Census Book from the 13th century, Assens is listed with the name &quot;Asnæs&quot;, which means a promontory overgrown with ash trees.

==History==
Assens is located on the site of an old ferry landing linking Funen and the south of Jutland. A bay provided a natural harbour while the Little Belt encouraged trade and transport. It probably became a market town in the 13th century. The ferry, which probably originated in the Middle Ages, became particularly significant in the 16th century with sizeable cattle exports. The town was hard hit by the Swedish Wars in the 17th century, causing a reduction in trade. It nevertheless continued to be the main ferry link between Jutland and Funen.

Prosperity returned at the end of the 18th century, increasing in the 19th century after a new harbour was completed in 1822. However the railway to Middelfart in 1865 provided considerable competition but the town suffered above all from the discontinuation of the ferry service after Southern Jutland was lost to the Germans in 1864.

At the end of the 19th century, there were few industries in Assens, the main source of income still being trade and crafts. In 1884, however, the railway to Tommerup linked Assens to Odense and in 1885, the harbour was extended with a new dock. A sugar factory was established, providing over 300 jobs by the end of the century. There was also a marked increase in population.

With reunification after the First World War, the ferry to Southern Jutland was reopened and ran until 1972. The sugar factory remained the main source of employment but a number of smaller metal foundries and food companies were established. Like most of Funen&#x27;s other towns, Assens remained in the shadow of Odense, recording only modest growth. Its population grew only slightly, from around 4,600 in 1901 to 5,800 in 2004.

==Economy==
Today the town still has a small shipyard, a few metallurgical and chemical factories and the Vestfyen brewery. The sugar factory was closed in 2006. In 2007, the public sector benefited from Assens position as the seat of the new Assens Municipality. Companies headquartered in Assens Municipality include the Carl Hansen &amp; Søn furniture manufacturer in Aarup.

==Landmarks==

Assens Church (&quot;Vor Frue Kirke&quot;) is the second largest church building on the island of Funen. Built in the 15th century on the site of a former Romanesque church, the red-brick building was comprehensively restored in the 19th century. It bears the influence of north German Gothic architecture. The tower with its octagonal base and spire is in height. The altarpiece and pulpit are from the 17th century.

Willemoesgården, one of the oldest houses in the town, was the birthplace of Peter Willemoes (1783–1808) who became a celebrity after heroic action in the Battle of Copenhagen. The building is now a museum with exhibits on the history of the town and its seafaring heritage.

Assens Marina with 600 berths including a quay for visitors is located next to the local camping facility and sports centre with shops and a restaurant. It is open from May until the end of August.

<text>Bogense () is a town in central Denmark, located on Funen in Nordfyn municipality, Region of Southern Denmark. The town has a population of 4,060 (1 January 2024). With its half-timbered houses, narrow streets and large marina, it is a popular tourist spot in the summer. The town is connected to Odense and Middelfart via buses operated by Fynbus.

The town was the seat of Bogense Municipality until the 2007 Municipal Reform, when Bogense merged into the new Nordfyn Municipality. Though it is not the largest town, Bogense became the seat of the new municipality.

==History==
Bogense was first mentioned in 1288, when king Erik Menved made it into a borough (&quot;købstad&quot; in Danish). The town was probably established as a trading post at the end of the 12th century. Its layout with a central main street and a number of cross streets is typical of medieval development. The town is thought to have grown up as a result of the ferry which provided a connection to Klakring in Jutland in the Middle Ages. It was probably granted privileges as a market town with a municipal charter during the second half of the 13th century.

For most of the 16th century, Bogense prospered from its flourishing trade but in 1575 it was almost completely destroyed by fire. Despite reduced taxes and other incentives from the Crown, the town never really recovered. Furthermore, like most Danish communities, in the 17th century it suffered from a reduction in trade, becoming Funen&#x27;s smallest market town with only 438 inhabitants in 1672. The situation improved somewhat in the 19th century after a new harbour was established in 1844. The Bogense ferry, which had begun to lose its significance at the end of the 17th century, was discontinued in 1854. In 1882, the town was connected to Odense by rail while the harbour was enlarged in 1874 and 1894 attracting a shipyard and various smaller industries.

For most of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s principal occupation remained trade but it faced increasing competition from nearby Odense. A few small industries were established resulting in a modest increase in population from 2,747 in 1911 to 3,414 in 2004. Development has recently moved increasingly into the service sector, especially after the seat of Nordfyn Municipality&#x27;s was established in Bogense in 2007.

On 2 and 3 February 2019 the 2019 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships took place in Bogense.

==Landmarks==

The marina which was opened in 1976 has been extended on several occasions and is now the largest on Funen. Classified more than once as Denmark&#x27;s best marina, it is within walking distance of the town. The yachting competition, Palby Fyn Cup, starts and ends at the marina.

Saint Nicholas Church (&quot;Sankt Nikolaj kirke&quot;) was built in 1406 on the remains of a 12th-century Romanesque church. In the mid-15th century, various additions were completed including the tower which unusually is at the east end of the church. The tall spire used to serve as a landmark for shipping. Comprehensive restoration work was completed in 2010. Artefacts include a 16th-century altar (1588), a 13th-century baptismal font, and a carved pulpit from 1604.

<text>Faaborg or Fåborg () is an old port town located on Faaborg Fjord in Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality on the island of Funen in Denmark. By road, Faaborg is located southwest of Odense, west-northwest of Svendborg, and roughly southeast of Middelfart, depending upon the route. It has a population of 6,867 (1 January 2024). With its busy port, narrow streets and attractive old houses, the town is popular with tourists, particularly in the summer months. Faaborg was formerly the seat of Faaborg municipality. The seat of the new municipality is Ringe. Both municipalities use(d) Faaborg&#x27;s medieval coat of arms.

==History==

Faaborg is first mentioned as &quot;Foburgh&quot; in a document located in the French National Archives in Paris dated 25 June 1229. It is a deed of gift that gives Faaborg and the south of Funen as a morning present to Eleanor of Portugal, from Valdemar II to his daughter-in-law. It is mentioned as a castle (Foburgh meaning Fox Castle), so it must have existed before this date. However, this date has been used as the birth date of Faaborg and thus the town celebrated its 775th anniversary in 2004.

Although it is not known when the settlement was established, it appears Faaborg had already received privileges as a market town in the 13th century. Located on a promontory surrounded by water on three sides, the site was further protected by a moat and a town wall. Around 1477, a monastery was established which over the years acquired most of the property in the town and its surroundings. After the Reformation it was used for a time as a hospital until it was finally demolished. The monastery chapel became the parish church.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Faaborg had to compete with a considerable amount of illegal trading from other settlements along the coast. In the mid-17th century, it suffered even more from the effects of the Swedish Wars but it began to prosper as an important port in the 18th century. Corn was exported to Norway and trade increased with the Grand Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. By the 1890s, ships from Faaborg sailed as far as the Mediterranean. In the 19th century, the United Kingdom replaced Norway as the main trading partner and, in the second half of the century, trade extended to China and Australia. By the end of the century, there had been a huge increase in population (from 1,000 to 4,000) and a number of light industries had been established. Many of the new inhabitants came from Schleswig and Holstein after these had been lost to Germany. They included many Jews who made Faaborg Funen&#x27;s most Jewish community with its own synagogue. With 50 employees, Dansk Vin- og Konservesfabrik (wine and canning) was the main business but traditional crafts and trading continued while the harbour was also enlarged. Steamship links with Copenhagen and Southern Jutland were established and in the 1880s railway connections were ensured with the other towns on the island.

Growth was more modest in the 20th century in the face of competition from Odense and Svendborg. A few new industries emerged in food processing and metal working but tourism and services became the leading areas of growth. By 2007, Faaborg had 7,318 inhabitants.

==Landmarks==
The harbour, old streets, historic mansions and town houses all make Faaborg a pleasant city for visitors. Its many restaurants serve a wide variety of Danish and foreign dishes. Plougs Gård on Vestergade, built around 1790, is one of the finest buildings in the town with its Neoclassical facade. Jesper Ploug made his fortune in shipping during the American Wars of Independence (1776—1783).

Faaborg Church (&quot;Helligåndskirken&quot;) is an old monastery church dating from 1477. It formed the south wing of the now demolished Helligåndskloster belonging to the Order of the Holy Ghost from which it gets its name. Its considerable size makes it a local landmark: long by wide. The chancel and three-sided east gable were completed in 1490, the nave and southern aisle followed around 1510 and a northern aisle was added shortly thereafter. After its vaulting in 1681, it resembled a basilica. Restoration work was carried out in 1858 and 1902. The church has no tower but the tower of the now demolished Saint Nicholas Church (1450) serves as its belfry.

Faaborg Museum holds one of Denmark&#x27;s most important art collections with works by the Funen Painters including Jens Birkholm, Peter Hansen, Johannes Larsen, and Anna and Fritz Syberg. It also displays some of the finest works of sculptor Kai Nielsen. &quot;Den gamle Gård&quot; on Holkegade provides insights into the town&#x27;s cultural history, with exhibits depicting life in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Faaborg Harbour, with its centrally placed marina, attracts about 13,000 pleasure boats each year thanks to its attractive location for the South Funen Archipelago. It is frequently visited by vintage schooners and yachts of all sizes. The port is also used by fishing boats and commercial vessels.

A new waterpark, Faaborg Harbor Bath, was completed in 2014.

Nearby attractions include Egeskov Castle, Hvedholm Castle and Horne Church.

==Transport==
Faaborg Rutebilstation, a former railway station built in 1882, now serves as a bus station for FynBus. There are regular ferry links from Faaborg to the islands of Bjørnø, Lyø, Avernakø and Ærø.

==History==
Gudme was an important site during the Iron Age.

<doc id="144330" wikidata="Q3413939" url="?curid=144330" title="Marstal">
<text>Marstal () is a town in southern Denmark, located in Ærø Municipality on the island of Ærø. Marstal has a population of 2,077 (1 January 2024) and is the largest town on Ærø. It was the municipal seat of the now abolished Marstal Municipality.

Marstal has a long maritime history. For centuries Marstal vessels have sailed the seven seas, and even today the town is the home port for a considerable number of coasters. Shipping is still the nerve of the town with its dockyards, its shipping companies and its maritime school which for more than a century has trained navigators for the Danish merchant fleet.

Marstal is the economic center of Ærø and the main industries are tourism, small industry and service. The town has an international reputation for shipbuilding.

Marstal is home to one of Northern Europe&#x27;s largest solar power complexes, using solar power to heat water for the local District heating.

==Marstal Church==
Built in 1738, - once in 1772 by adding an extension and later in 1920 with a tower to commemorate the reunification of southern Jutland with Denmark. Seven votive ships indicate the growth of shipping in the town from the 18th to the 20th century. The font dates from the Middle Ages, and the blue color of the benches symbolizes the sea and eternity, whereas the red colors of the altar and pulpit evoke the blood shed by Christ. Red is also the color of love. Carl Rasmussen, a maritime artist who usually specialized in the motifs of Greenland, painted the 1881 altarpiece, depicting Christ stilling a storm. In the old churchyard are memorials and tombstones honoring the sailors of Marstal who died at sea during two world wars.

==History==
Marstal is a shipping town founded in the 16th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries its living depended predominantly on the building and sailing of wooden ships. In the harbour is a small island Frederiksøen, which today is called the Lime Kiln (Kalkovnen). The impressive fieldstone pier at the island was built in 1825 by local seamen on a voluntary basis. The island was in use as a repair yard for ships, until in 1863 it was rented out for lime burning.

The town did not grow around a square or a church, its houses were simply erected along the paths leading upwards from the jetties. As the town grew transverse ring-roads were added, and the narrowness of the settlement often meant that the houses were placed somewhat coincidentally.

The First World War put an end to optimism and changed the glorious maritime traditions of Marstal. 42 ships from Marstal were sunk at the loss of 53 seamen. The Second World War deprived the small naval community of 80 of its young boys and seamen.

==Tourism==

A traveler can arrive at Marstal via the ferry from Svendborg to Ærøskøbing and then driving from there. A ferry also exists from Fåborg to Søby on Northern Ærø.

The camping site, the youth hostel, and hotels provide accommodation for the many visitors.

Eriks Hale, a strip that jots into the sea south of the town, is home to a beach often used for swimming and bathing.

<text>Middelfart is a town in central Denmark, with a population of 16,528 . The town is the municipal seat of Middelfart Municipality on the island of Funen ().

==Etymology==
The name Middelfart, first recorded as &quot;Mæthælfar&quot; in Valdemar&#x27;s Census Book in 1231, consists of the old Danish word &quot;mæthal&quot; meaning &#x27;middle&#x27; and &quot;far&quot; meaning &#x27;way&#x27;. This name originally referred to the strait &quot;Snævringen&quot; (&#x27;the narrowing&#x27;), which is the narrowest part of the Little Belt, and was subsequently applied to the settlement as well.

==History==
It is not known when the town was established but it certainly owes its existence to its location at the narrowest point across the Little Belt. The town was granted its first privileges at the end of the 13th century at a time when fishing played an important role in addition to its ferry link to Snoghøj in Jutland. From the Middle Ages the town appears to have specialized in catching harbour porpoises. In the 16th century cattle export was also significant.
After the Swedish Wars in the 17th century the town suffered from losing its foreign export privileges and from competition from Fredericia on the other side of the belt, which not only had a ferry link to Strib but levied customs duties on traffic through the Little Belt. In the 18th century income from porpoise catches diminished but in the 19th century, with the establishment of its own harbour in 1836, conditions improved thanks in particular to the growing trade in agricultural products from the surrounding areas. From the mid-19th century small industries started to develop, especially the iron foundry. The rail link between Middelfart and Nyborg opened in 1865, bringing added prosperity despite the fact that it connected with the ferry from Strib rather than the one from Middelfart.

By the beginning of the 20th century the iron foundry, with about a hundred workers, was the town&#x27;s main industry. After the first Little Belt Bridge was completed in 1935 Middelfart became an important hub for traffic between Jutland and Funen. The population grew from 2,345 in 1880 to 11,056 in 1950 but in the second half of the 20th century the rate of growth declined. In 1970 a motorway bridge to Jutland was opened and in 2007 Middelfart became the seat of an expanded municipality, which included the former communes of Ejby and Nørre Aaby.

==Economy==

Middelfart Municipality had a population of 37,685 in January 2014.

From the Middle Ages until the end of the 19th century the local fishermen were also whale hunters in winter. The only whale common in Danish waters is the harbour porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocaena&quot;). The whale hunters linked their boats across the rather narrow Little Belt and by beating the sea with sticks and branches they directed the migrating porpoises to low water areas where they could be slaughtered. As the whale blubber was used for lamps, indoors and outdoors, the arrival of electricity made whale hunting uneconomical. In the winter of 1854–55, 1742 whales were caught, but a normal winter&#x27;s catch would be half that or even less. In the 20th century the hunt was resumed during the two world wars. Two memorial stones now stand where the hunters landed the whales and where blubber was prepared.

==Transportation==

Middelfart is served by Middelfart railway station which is served by the passenger rail service between Copenhagen and Jutland. It is located on the Copenhagen–Fredericia/Taulov Line which connects the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and the Jutland peninsula by way of the islands of Zealand and Funen. It offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen, Odense, Aalborg, Aarhus and Esbjerg as well as regional train services to Fredericia and Odense.

&quot;Gammel Havn&quot; (Old Harbour) dates from the 1830s. At the beginning of the 20th century it was extended and deepened to the east.

==Landmarks==
Middelfart Church, dedicated to St Nicholas, is located close to the harbour at the end of Algade. Built in several stages, it has a Late Romanesque chancel, a tower first constructed in the 14th century and a nave with aisles from the late 15th century. The richly carved altarpiece is from 1650.

Henner Friiser Hus, a half-timbered house on Brogade dating from around 1575, is now part of Middelfart Museum and contains exhibitions related to the history of the town. Restoration work on the building was completed in March 2014.

The &quot;Kulturøen&quot; (literally, &quot;Culture Island&quot;) Cultural Centre contains the public library, a cinema, a restaurant, a café and the tourist office.

<text>Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 17,902 (2024). It is the easternmost settlement on Funen. By road, it is located 34 km east of Odense, 35 km north of Svendborg and 21 km south of Kerteminde. It also connects to Korsør through the Great Belt Bridge. Nyborg is the seat of Nyborg Municipality, and until 1793 it was also the seat of Nyborg County.

The city was founded in the 1200s, built up around Nyborg Castle. The castle holds a central place in Nyborg geographically, historically and culturally.

== Etymology ==
Nyborg was first mentioned in 1193 as &#x27;Nyburg&#x27;, which translates to &#x27;new castle&#x27; in Danish.

== History ==
Before Nyborg was founded, a fortification existed in the area under the name of Gammelborg. It was established in the 500s, and used throughout the Viking age until Nyborg was founded and took over its role.

Nyborg was first mentioned in 1193 in the history of Denmark as Nyborg Castle, which still exists today, but the town itself was not mentioned before the year 1202. From its foundation and until 1413, Nyborg Castle was used by numerous kings as seat of the &quot;Danehof&quot; and other meetings, including a meeting between Queen Margaret I and the Counts of Holstein in 1386. The first Constitution of Denmark was written on Nyborg Castle by Eric V in 1282. Being the seat of these meetings, Nyborg enjoyed a number of unique and special privileges, granted by the king. The first was granted by king Valdemar II, who granted the town the status of a market town (Danish: &quot;Købstad&quot;) shortly after the town was founded. Merchants from neighboring hundreds had to come to Nyborg to sell their wares, boosting the economy and traffic in the town. In 1446, a large number of additional privileges were added, including the outlawing of harbours between the market towns on eastern Funen. Nyborg was also given permission to host a yearly market, and artisans from Vindinge Hundred were told to move to the market towns, boosting the population and economy of Nyborg once more. With the king visiting regularly, due to Nyborg&#x27;s central location and the castle being the seat of the Danehof, Nyborg was given many additional privileges over the years.

In 1525 Frederick I declared Nyborg as the king&#x27;s residency, and until the 1560s it acted as the capital of Denmark. During this time, Christian III expanded Nyborg Castle and city. Much of the castle was rebuilt and a tournament ground was built in front of the castle.

The city was captured by Swedish troops during the Dano-Swedish War, following the Battle of Nyborg. The Swedish troops sent all valuables home to Sweden and ruined much of Nyborg Castle. The city was retaken by an allied force of Danes, Brandenburgers, Polish mercenary cavalry and Dutchmen after a bombardment by a large Dutch naval fleet led by the famous Dutch Admiral Michiel DeRuyter, who was key in the negotiations and Swedes capitulation. The city was then looted by the allied forces with DeRuyter giving strict orders prohibiting Dutch forces (who made up a third of the allied army) not to participate. DuRuyter noted in his log that the Poles were allowed to take the captured Danish wives and daughters of Nyborg as part of the plundered booty, to his utter disgust – but there was nothing he could do to prevent it. Following the war, the king was no longer interested in living in the castle, and it was handed over to the military. Nyborg became an army garrison, with the castle then being used strictly for military purposes.

After the wars and several fires and livestock plagues, the 1700s were a low period in Nyborg&#x27;s history, with the population growing poorer. Things turned around in the 1800s where Nyborg became and important link across the Great Belt, with steamboat ferries starting to sail between Nyborg and Korsør in 1828. Several large markets were also held yearly, and the trade and economy of the town began to grow again.

In the Second World War, Nyborg&#x27;s garrison still existed. Denmark was allowed to keep their military after the Nazi occupation. Nyborg Vandrehjem and Hotel Nyborg Strand housed Danish soldiers. On 29 August 1943 Operation Safari was carried out, with the intention of disarming the Danish military. Battles occurred between the Danish and German soldiers on both Nyborg Vandrehjem and Hotel Nyborg Strand. Two Danish soldiers were killed at Hotel Nyborg Strand: Cornet K.B. Madsen and Captain C.L. Wesenberg. The captain was killed by a German soldier, who also killed himself at the same time by accidentally blowing up them both with a grenade. That German soldier was most likely the only German casualty of the battle. There was a single Danish casualty during the battle at Nyborg Vandrehjem: Recruit Ivan Jacobsen.

In 1977 market towns were dissolved, and Nyborg lost its title. Nyborg Municipality was established, with Nyborg being the seat of the new municipality. It was formed of the city and parish of Nyborg, as well as the two parish municipalities of Avnslev-Bovense and Vindinge. In the 2007 municipal reform, the three municipalities of Nyborg, Ørbæk and Ullerslev were merged to form the present Nyborg Municipality.

=== Historical populations ===
=== Mayors ===

From 1850–1919 the mayors of Nyborg were chosen by the king. Since 1919 the mayor has been elected. Below are all Nyborg&#x27;s mayors since 1850.

== Nyborg Castle ==

Nyborg Castle is located near the center of Nyborg city, and is surrounded by fortifications, the &#x27;castle lake&#x27; and a moat that run along the center of the city. The castle if first mentioned in 1193, when Canute VI held a meeting in it. Before then, the king were housed in Hjulby, outside Nyborg, and the castle was established in that period. A curtain wall was built, and there has likely been several wooden buildings within the walls. In the first half of the 1200s, a building was constructed in two floors, much of which still remain today. The king likely held his meetings in the upper floor of this construction. During the 1300s and 1400s, the castle was improve upon, with a new floor and several new buildings. In 1282, Eric V completed the constitution of Denmark in Nyborg Castle. In 1287, Eric V&#x27;s alleged murderers were sentenced on the castle. In the 1520s, Frederick I planned to make Nyborg his official residence, but that never happened. Signs of his plans were obvious, however, with major projects on the castle planned.

After the Dano-Swedish War, where the castle was captured and later turned into an armory, the importance of the castle fell. The garrison was disestablished in 1913. The castle was turned into a museum, which it has been since then. In 2017, a large project to renovate and expand the museum was begun, with plans to finish in 2023.

The fortifications, ramparts and moats surrounding Nyborg Castle stretch out along the center of the city. The moats appear as they did in the Middle Ages, with the same water regulation systems still in use. Three of the original bulwarks still exist, with the remaining having been torn down during city expansions. Two of those bulwarks are located around Nyborg Castle, and are known as &quot;the Queen&#x27;s Bulwark (Danish: Dronningens Bastion)&quot; and &quot;the Crown Prince&#x27;s Bulwark (Danish: Kronprinsens Bastion)&quot;. Those are surrounded by the original ramparts, which today act as park areas. On the Queen&#x27;s Bulwark is a water tower from 1899, built by Emil Swanenflügel. The water tower was protected in 1997. The third bulwark is called &quot;Prince Carl&#x27;s Bulwark (Danish: Prins Carls Bastion)&quot;, and is slightly smaller. It also acts as a park area.

== Nyborg Church ==
Nyborg Church (also known as Church of Our Lady. Danish: &quot;Vor Frue Kirke&quot;) is located in the center of Nyborg, and was built in 1375–1428. It was renovated in the 1970s and again in 2005.

The church has two organs, from 1973 by Poul-Gerhard Andersen and 1830 by P.U.F. Demant. The crucifix is the only piece of inventory from the church&#x27;s opening in 1428. It is decorated with biblical depictions. Maja Lisa Engelhardt created the altar crucifix, of gilded bronze, in 2011. Maja Lisa Engelhardt also created a mosaic for the church in 2015. The largest of the church&#x27;s chandeliers was donated in 1640 by the mayor&#x27;s widow, Sidsel Knudsdatter. The other chandelier was donated by mayor Mads Lerke in 1589. The renaissance baptismal font was donated to the church in 1585 by mayor Peder Jensen Skriver. The other baptismal font is Romanesque style in granite, from 1100. Inside the church is a gate from 1649, built by Christian IV&#x27;s smith, Caspar Fincke. The pulpit is from 1653, made by Anders Mortensen in Odense. The pulpit&#x27;s staircase is even older. The church has a set of wooden figures of John the Apostle and Jeremiah. Like the pulpit, they were also carved by Anders Mortensen. A candle globe, made by local artisan Flemming Knudsen, was added to the church in 2008.

The church&#x27;s turret clock, nicknamed &quot;the Syrian tank&quot; (Danish: &quot;Den syriske kampvogn&quot;) was replaced by an electric movement in 1972. The original mechanical movement was built by Henrik Kyhl from Copenhagen, and initially created for Viborg Cathedral, who couldn&#x27;t afford it. It was instead bought by Nyborg Church. In 2002 it was donated to &quot;Post- og Telemuseet&quot; in Copenhagen.

<text>Ørbæk is a town in central Denmark, located in Nyborg municipality on the island of Funen. Ørbæk was until 2007 the seat of Ørbæk Municipality.

==History==
Ørbæk was first mentioned in 1231 as &#x27;Ørbæc&#x27;, which was the name of the brook that runs through the town. The town was formerly known as Ør, and the town later adopted the name of the brook. The name was likely changed in the late 1800s.

In the 1800s, Ørbæk was an important village, located centrally with roads directly to Odense, Nyborg, Svendborg, Faaborg and Assens. This central position made it possible for Ørbæk to acquire facilities that other villages of the time didn&#x27;t have, such as a postal office. With the construction of the Faaborg-Ringe-Nyborg railroad, Ørbæk was a station between Nyborg and Ringe. Ørbæk&#x27;s history as a railroad station town lasted between 1897 and 1962. After 1962 the railway no longer transported passengers, and in 1969-70 a town hall was built in Ørbæk&#x27;s old station building.

A smithy was built by the town&#x27;s priest in 1847. It was acquired by Frilandsmuseet in 1934.

A brewery was built in 1906, where it was a beer brewery until the 1970s. In 1996 the brewery was bought by Niels and Nicolai Rømer and Ørbæk Bryggeri was founded.

==Ørbæk Church==
Ørbæk Church was built around 1200. The granite baptismal font is as old as the church, with a Dutch baptismal basin from 1625. There are three chandeliers in the church. The oldest of the three is from 1709, donated by priest Christian Michael Luja at his wedding. Another chandelier was donated in 1737 and the last in 1927. A model ship was donated to the church in 1932, but depicts no particular ship. The church has two bells, one from 1778 and one from 1692.

The church was renovated in 1870 and again in the 1950s and from 2016 to 2018.

==Ørbæk Market==
The yearly Ørbæk Market (Danish: &quot;Ørbæk Marked&quot;) began around year 1900, where it was mentioned as a market for livestock. The market was helt the 2nd Saturday in July every year until 1957, where the industrialization meant that horses were no longer necessary. The yearly tradition stopped in 1957, but was brought back in 1980. The market was no longer solely for livestock, but now mainly a kræmmermarked - a type of flea market. The market has been held annually since 1980, and is the largest market on Funen.

==Notable residents==
*Kenneth Muhs (born 1972), politician and mayor of Nyborg Municipality

<text>Rudkøbing is a town in Denmark, on the western coast of the island of Langeland. It is the seat of Langeland Municipality, in the Southern Denmark Region. The town is located southeast of Svendborg and is connected to Siø through the Siøsund Bridge.

==History==
The first mention of Rudkøbing was in 1287, when it was given market town privileges by Duke Valdemar IV of Schleswig, who held the title of &quot;rigsforstander&quot; (da) under King Eric VI Menved. The original Rudkøbing Church was most likely built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. During the Count&#x27;s Feud (1534–1536) and again during the Dano-Swedish War (1658–1660), Rudkøbing was under siege by Swedish troops. Both times, the town&#x27;s fortifications prevented Rudkøbing from immediately falling, but the town eventually had to give in to the Swedes. The town was hit by the Black Plague during the 16th and 17th centuries, and experienced fires in 1590 and 1610.

The Ørsted family, which most notably includes the brothers Hans Christian and Anders Sandøe Ørsted, has its origins in Rudkøbing. Their father was a pharmacist, and the brothers were born in the old pharmacy on Gåsetorvet. Across from their birth house is a statue of Hans Christian, and a statue of Anders is located at nearby Ørstedsparken, which is named in their honor. The old pharmacy remained in use until 2017.
Rudkøbing got its first proper harbor in 1826 (it had previously only had a pier). In 1898, in a town of about 3,500 people, there were 152 ships based in Rudkøbing. Every year, over 2,500 ships (carrying over 18,000 metric tons of cargo) came in and over 2,800 ships (carrying over 11,500 metric tons of cargo) went out, mostly to and from elsewhere in Denmark. The town was connected by steam ferry routes to Copenhagen, Korsør, Marstal, and Svendborg.

The town&#x27;s population was stable during the interwar period, hovering above 4,000, with the census in 1930 recording a population of 4,129. The population peaked at 4,541 in 1950, and by 1965, it had fallen to 4,204. Around this time a suburb developed in , which eventually grew together with Rudkøbing.

Each year between 1991 and 2022, the town hosted Langelandsfestivalen, a music festival which targeted families. Usually lasting 8 days, the festival had performances from both Danish and foreign musicians. The 2023 edition was canceled because of economic problems, and the company behind the festival filed for bankruptcy at the Maritime and Commercial Court on 13 June 2023, after owner Allan K. Pedersen had unsuccessfully tried to find a new owner.

Rudkøbing was the seat of the former Rudkøbing Municipality in Funen County, and is the seat of the current Langeland Municipality in the Southern Denmark Region. When Rudkøbing was its own municipality, there were often negotiations with the two other Langelandic municipalities of Sydlangeland and Tranekær to merge. These plans were repeatedly abandoned due to a lack of public support. In the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform, the three were forced together, and Rudkøbing has since been the municipal seat.

==Transport==
Bridges connecting Rudkøbing and Svendborg were built throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, finishing in 1966. The old ferry route between the two towns gradually lost popularity due to the bridges, and the route was eventually ended. The ferry route to Marstal, which had been active since 1866, was closed in 2013, so that the only ferry on this route could be moved to the busy route between Marstal and Svendborg. The ferry route between Rudkøbing and Marstal opened again in December 2019.

The Langeland Bridge was built between 1960 and 1962. It connects Rudkøbing and the rest of Langeland to the island of Siø. Siø is further linked by the Siøsund Bridge to Tåsinge, and Tåsinge is linked by the Svendborgsund Bridge to Svendborg on the mainland of Funen, making Rudkøbing accessible by road.

From 1911 to 1962, Rudkøbing was the main station of the Langeland rail network (). The network was connected to Svendborg in 1926, when a railway ferry route made it possible to move train wagons between Rudkøbing and the mainland of Funen.

<text>Svendborg () is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality. With a population of 27,521 (1 January 2024), Svendborg is Funen&#x27;s second largest city. In 2000 Svendborg was declared &quot;Town of the year&quot; in Denmark, and in 2003 it celebrated its 750th anniversary as a market town. By road, Svendborg is located southwest of Copenhagen, south of Aarhus, south of Odense, and east of Faaborg.

Svendborg is home to &quot;Danmarks Forsorgsmuseum&quot; social history museum and &quot;Naturama&quot; natural history museum. The latter holds a wide variety of taxidermy from whales and bears to birds and Foxes.

The largest container ship company in the world, A.P. Møller-Mærsk has its origins in Svendborg, in the &quot;Villa Anna&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
In the light of archaeological discoveries, Svendborg appears to have been established in the first half of the 12th century or even earlier. Located at the head of a bay, the natural harbour encouraged seafaring and trade.

The first recorded mention of Svendborg occurred in 1229 in a deed of gift by Valdemar the Victorious, where he refers to the fortification as Swinæburgh. The name is thought to consist of the elements &quot;svin&quot; meaning &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;borg&quot; meaning &quot;fortification&quot;. In 1236, the Greyfriars monastery in Svendborg was established. The Greyfriars would be part of the city for the next 300 years, until the Protestant reformation in 1536. The ruins of the monastery were partly excavated beside the railway in 2007.

===Middle Ages===

In 1253, the city was granted market town privileges by King Christopher I. In the Middle Ages, the city was fortified with walls and moats. The defense system also included a few of forts. Most historical facts about the medieval defense system, including the locations of fortifications, are disputed, as little archaeological evidence has been generated. In spite of this, it is a popular theory that the three towers in the coat of arms are the three fortifications (&quot;Skattertårnet&quot;, &quot;Kyseborg&quot; and a third one unnamed). Thanks to its seafarers, in the late Middle Ages Svendborg became one of the most important trading centres in Scandinavia.

===16th and 17th centuries===

During the time of the Protestant reformation and the Count&#x27;s Feud in the 1530s, the citizens of Svendborg joined forces with the King. Ørkild Castle, located just east of Svendborg, was property of the bishop of Odense, who was less than popular among the citizens of the city. The tension resulted in the castle being seized and burned down by an angry mob in collaboration with the King&#x27;s forces. The King&#x27;s forces would later, after ending their north-going campaign on Funen, return to pillage and plunder Svendborg.

After 1536, Svendborg went through a brief period of progress becoming the islands main port. But it would not last for long. In the following 250 years, the city faced various setbacks in its development, such as plague, a major fire, and the effects of the Swedish wars when Svendborg&#x27;s ships were destroyed.

===Industrial development===
It was not until the end of the war with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century that the city returned to a period of increasing prosperity. The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with Odense, Faaborg and Nyborg, improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported there. In the middle of the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.

In the late 19th century, with industry well established, it was necessary to accommodate the growing population. This led to numerous new schools being founded. Furthermore, a hospital was established in 1871 and expanded in 1891.

===20th century to present===

The rapid increase in population continued at the beginning of the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skibsværft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by Vestas. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, especially for those arriving in pleasure boats.

The German writer Bertolt Brecht spent the first years of his exile from Nazi Germany in Svendborg. The town provided the title of a collection of Brecht&#x27;s poems &quot;Svendborger Gedichte&quot; (Svendborg Poems).

==Geography==

Svendborg lies on the south coast of Funen. By road, Svendborg is located southwest of Copenhagen, south of Odense, southeast of Middelfart, and south-southeast of Faaborg. The Port of Svendborg is accessed by several channels, feeding through the islands of Tåsinge and Thurø. Svendborg Sund approaches the town from the southwest, along which ferries coming from Ærøskøbing pass the smaller islands of Drejø, Hjortø, and Skarø. Between Tåsinge and Thurø is Thurø Sund, which passes Bregninge forest (Bregninge Skov) on the northeast coast of Tåsinge, approaching the port of Svendborg from the south. From the east, between mainland Funen and the island of Thurø, is the narrow Skårupøre Sund.

To the west of Svendborg are several lakes, including Sørup Lake (Sørup Sø), northwest of the centre, and Hvidkilde Lake (Hvidkilde Sø), northwest of the centre of Svendborg. Several forested areas lie to the north-northwest of Svendborg, including Græsholmene, Løvehave, and Ravnebjerg Skov.

==Economy==
The largest container ship company in the world, A.P. Møller-Mærsk has its origins in Svendborg, in the &quot;Villa Anna&quot;. The company remained in the hands of Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller until his death in 2012 at the age of 98.

The Mac Baren tobacco factory was established in Svendborg in 1887, under the name &quot;Harald Halberg Tobaks and Cigarfabrik.&quot; The company was renamed the &quot;Mac Baren Tobacco Company&quot; in 1995. The company employs 140 people, and exports tobacco products to 70 countries.

==Landmarks==

Vor Frue Kirke (Church of Our Lady) located on a hill north of the market square was established in the 13th century but was enlarged in the late Middle Ages with a Gothic chancel, transepts and tower. A spire was added in 1768. The oldest section is the red-brick, Romanesque nave. Today the church reflects the comprehensive restoration work undertaken by Ove Petersen in 1884. The altar, pulpit and other artefacts date from the 17th century.
Anne Hvide&#x27;s House (&quot;Anne Hvides Gård&quot;), a two-storey, half-timbered building, is one of Svendborg&#x27;s oldest houses. Anne Hvide, a widow of noble descent, had it built in 1560. It was used as an inn from 1837 to 1867. After being restored, it became the town museum in 1916. It still belongs to Svenborg Museum who use it for exhibitions on the history of Svendborg during the summer months.

Naturama, established in April 2005, is a natural history museum enhanced by means of various technological support features including light and sound, film, and expedition scenarios. It has a large collection of stuffed animals and birds in natural surroundings. A recent addition has been an exhibition depicting the world of spiders.

Svendborg contains a branch of the Odense University Hospital, Odense Universitetshospital - Svendborg Sygehus. It also contains the Svendborg Museum.

Attractions close to Svendborg include Egeskov, the best preserved Renaissance water castle in Europe, Valdemar&#x27;s Castle on the nearby island of Tåsinge, and Hesselagergård, a historic manor to the north of Svendborg.

==Education==
A branch of UCL University College () can be found in Svendborg. Svendborg is also the home of Svendborg Gymnasium which is one of the larger upper secondary schools in Denmark with more than 1,000 students and around 100 teachers. Furthermore, it also has Svendborg Erhvervsskole, which is the largest educational institute in Southern Funen.

<doc id="144342" wikidata="Q1495845" url="?curid=144342" title="Sydlangeland Municipality">
<text>Until 1 January 2007 Sydlangeland Municipality was a municipality (Danish: &quot;kommune&quot;) in the former Funen County, on the southern parts of the island of Langeland. It also included the inhabited islands of Lindø and Langø, as well as a number of smaller uninhabited islands. The municipality covered an area of 120.82 km2, and had a total population of 4,034 (2006). Its last mayor was Knud Gether, a member of a local political party.

Sydlangeland Municipality bordered Rudkøbing Municipality to the north. Across a small strait to the west was Marstal Municipality, later Ærø Municipality.

The municipality ceased to exist as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen 2007&quot; (the Municipality Reform of 2007). It was merged with the Tranekær and Rudkøbing municipalities to form the new Langeland municipality. The new municipality belongs to the Region of Southern Denmark.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, when Denmark was divided into hundreds, Langeland was divided into two hundreds. These were Langeland&#x27;s Northern Hundred (Danish: &quot;Langelands Nørre Herred&quot;) and Langeland&#x27;s Southern Hundred (Danish: &quot;Langelands Sønder Herred&quot;), the latter also including the island of Siø. The two hundreds on Langeland were part of the fief (Danish: &quot;len&quot;) of Tranekær Fief, which became Tranekær County in 1662. In 1793 the two counties of Tranekær and Nyborg were merged to form Svendborg County, which was merged with Odense County in 1970 to form Funen County (Danish: &quot;Fyns Amt&quot;). This county was dissolved in 2007, and the entirety of Funen County became a part of the Region of Southern Denmark.

In 1842 Denmark was divided into smaller administrative divisions, namely parish municipalities (Danish: &quot;sognekommunner&quot;). The borders of these municipalities were largely based on the country&#x27;s parishes. In the 1970 municipal reform these parish municipalities were dissolved. Four parish municipalities had merged already in 1966 to form Sydlangeland Parish Municipality, which then became Sydlangeland Municipality in 1970. This municipality lasted until 2007 when it was merged with the municipalities of Tranekær and Rudkøbing.

===Historical divisions===
==Towns==

Approximately 55% of the municipality&#x27;s population lived in rural areas or smaller villages. The municipalities two largest towns, Humble and Bagenkop, were each home to around 15% of the municipality&#x27;s population. The remaining population lived in Lindelse and Tryggelev.

Humble was the seat of the municipality. The town was located centrally in the municipality.

Below is the populations from 2006 of the four larger settlements of the municipality.

==Politics==
===Municipal council===
Below are the municipal council elected since the municipality&#x27;s creation in 1970 and until 2001, which was the last election before the municipality was dissolved.
===Mayors===
Since the creation of the municipality in 1970 and until it was dissolved in 2007, the mayors of Sydlangeland Municipality were:
==Parishes==

The municipality consisted of five parishes and seven churches.

* Fodslette Parish (Fodslette Church)
* Humble Parish (Humble Church, Kædeby Church, Ristinge Church)
* Lindelse Parish (Lindelse Church)
* Magleby Parish (Magleby Church)
* Tryggelev Parish (Tryggelev Church)

==Symbols==
Sydlangeland Municipality&#x27;s coat of arms was three white fish and three yellow leaves of hops on a blue background.

<doc id="144355" wikidata="Q21659" url="?curid=144355" title="Galliformes">
<text>Galliformes is an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkeys, chickens, quail, and other landfowl. Gallinaceous birds, as they are called, are important in their ecosystems as seed dispersers and predators, and are often reared by humans for their meat and eggs, or hunted as game birds.

The order contains about 290 species, inhabiting every continent except Antarctica, and divided into five families: Phasianidae (including chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl (peacocks) and grouse), Odontophoridae (New World quail), Numididae (guinea fowl), Cracidae (including chachalacas and curassows), and Megapodiidae (incubator birds like malleefowl and brush-turkeys). They adapt to most environments except for innermost deserts and perpetual ice.

Many gallinaceous species are skilled runners and escape predators by running rather than flying. Males of most species are more colorful than the females, with often elaborate courtship behaviors that include strutting, fluffing of tail or head feathers, and vocal sounds. They are mainly nonmigratory. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans.

The name &quot;galliformes&quot; derives from &quot;gallus&quot;, Latin for &quot;rooster&quot;. Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. Galliforms and waterfowl (order Anseriformes) are collectively called &quot;fowl&quot;.

== Systematics and evolution ==

The living Galliformes were once divided into seven or more families. Despite their distinctive appearance, grouse and turkeys probably do not warrant separation as families due to their recent origin from partridge- or pheasant-like birds. The turkeys became larger after their ancestors colonized temperate and subtropical North America, where pheasant-sized competitors were absent. The ancestors of grouse, though, adapted to harsh climates and could thereby colonize subarctic regions. Consequently, the Phasianidae are expanded in current taxonomy to include the former Tetraonidae and Meleagrididae as subfamilies.

The Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes together make up the Galloanserae. They are basal among the living neognathous birds, and normally follow the Paleognathae (ratites and tinamous) in modern bird classification systems. This was first proposed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy and has been the one major change of that proposed scheme that was almost universally adopted. However, the Galliformes as they were traditionally delimited are called Gallomorphae in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, which splits the Cracidae and Megapodiidae as an order &quot;Craciformes&quot;. This is not a natural group, however, but rather an erroneous result of the now-obsolete phenetic methodology employed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. Phenetic studies do not distinguish between plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters, which leads to basal lineages appearing as monophyletic groups.

Historically, the buttonquails (Turnicidae), mesites (Mesitornithidae) and the hoatzin (&quot;Opisthocomus hoazin&quot;) were placed in the Galliformes, too. The former are now known to be shorebirds adapted to an inland lifestyle, whereas the mesites are probably closely related to pigeons and doves. The relationships of the hoatzin are entirely obscure, and it is usually treated as a monotypic order Opisthocomiformes to signify this.

The fossil record for the Galliformes is incomplete.

=== Evolution ===
Galloanserae-like birds were one of the main survivors of the K-T Event, that killed off the rest of the dinosaurs. The dominant birds of the dinosaur era were the enantiornithes, toothed birds that dominated the trees and skies. Unlike those enantiornithes, the ancestors of the galliformes were a niche group that were toothless and ground-dwelling. When the asteroid impact killed off all non-avian dinosaurs, and the dominant birds, it destroyed all creatures that lived in trees and on open ground. The enantiornithes were wiped out, but the ancestors of galliformes were small and lived in the ground (unlike water for Anseriformes) which protected them from the blast and destruction.

Fossils of these galliform-like birds originate in the Late Cretaceous, most notably those of &quot;Austinornis lentus&quot;. Its partial left tarsometatarsus was found in the Austin Chalk near Fort McKinney, Texas, dating to about 85 million years ago (Mya). This bird was quite certainly closely related to Galliformes, but whether it was a part of these or belongs elsewhere in the little-known galliform branch of Galloanserae is not clear. However, in 2004, Clarke classified it as a member of the larger group Pangalliformes, more closely related to chickens than to ducks, but not a member of the crown group that includes all modern galliformes. Another specimen, PVPH 237, from the Late Cretaceous Portezuelo Formation (Turonian-Coniacian, about 90 Mya) in the Sierra de Portezuelo (Argentina) has also been suggested to be an early galliform relative. This is a partial coracoid of a neornithine bird, which in its general shape and particularly the wide and deep attachment for the muscle joining the coracoid and the humerus bone resembles the more basal lineages of galliforms.

Additional galliform-like pangalliformes are represented by extinct families from the Paleogene, namely the Gallinuloididae, Paraortygidae and Quercymegapodiidae. In the early Cenozoic, some additional birds may or may not be early Galliformes, though even if they are, they are unlikely to belong to extant families:
* †&quot;Argillipes&quot; (London Clay Early Eocene of England)
* †&quot;Coturnipes&quot; (Early Eocene of England, and Virginia, USA?)
* †&quot;Palaeophasianus&quot; (Willwood Early Eocene of Bighorn County, USA)
* †&quot;Percolinus&quot; (London Clay Early Eocene of England)
* †&quot;Amitabha&quot; (Bridger middle Eocene of Forbidden City, USA) – phasianid?
* †&quot;&quot;Palaeorallus&quot; alienus&quot; (middle Oligocene of Tatal-Gol, Mongolia)
* †&quot;Anisolornis&quot; (Santa Cruz Middle Miocene of Karaihen, Argentina)

From the mid-Eocene onwards – about 45 Mya or so, true galliforms are known, and these completely replace their older relatives in the early Neogene. Since the earliest representatives of living galliform families apparently belong to the Phasianidae – the youngest family of galliforms, the other families of Galliformes must be at least of Early Eocene origin but might even be as old as the Late Cretaceous. The ichnotaxon &quot;Tristraguloolithus cracioides&quot; is based on fossil eggshell fragments from the Late Cretaceous Oldman Formation of southern Alberta, Canada, which are similar to chachalaca eggs, but in the absence of bone material, their relationships cannot be determined except that they are apparently avian in origin.

Modern genera of phasianids start appearing around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, roughly 25–20 Mya. It is not well known whether the living genera of the other, older, galliform families originated around the same time or earlier, though at least in the New World quail, pre-Neogene forms seem to belong to genera that became entirely extinct later on.

A number of Paleogene to mid-Neogene fossils are quite certainly Galliformes, but their exact relationships in the order cannot be determined:

* †Galliformes gen. et sp. indet. (Oligocene) – formerly in &quot;Gallinuloides&quot;; phasianid?
* †&quot;Palaealectoris&quot; (Agate Fossil Beds Early Miocene of Sioux County, USA) – tetraonine?

=== List of major taxa ===

For a long time, the pheasants, partridges, and relatives were indiscriminately lumped in the Phasianidae, variously including or excluding turkeys, grouse, New World quail, and guineafowl, and divided into two subfamilies – the Phasianinae (pheasant-like forms) and the Perdicinae (partridge-like forms). This crude arrangement was long considered to be in serious need of revision, but even with modern DNA sequence analyses and cladistic methods, the phylogeny of the Phasianidae has resisted complete resolution.
A tentative list of the higher-level galliform taxa, listed in evolutionary sequence, is:

The relationships of many pheasants and partridges were formerly very badly resolved and much confounded by adaptive radiation (in the former) and convergent evolution (in the latter). Thus, the bulk of the Phasianidae was alternatively treated as a single subfamily Phasianinae. The grouse, turkeys, true pheasants, etc., would then become tribes of this subfamily, similar to how the Coturnicinae are commonly split into a quail and a spurfowl tribe. In 2021, Kimball &quot;et al&quot;. found the family to comprise three distinct subfamilies, with two containing multiple genera; these results were followed by the International Ornithological Congress.

The partridge of Europe is not closely related to other partridge-like Galliformes, as already indicated by its sexually dimorphic coloration and possession of more than 14 rectrices, traits it shares with the other advanced phasianids. However, among these its relationships are obscure; it is unclear whether it is closer to the turkeys or to certain short-tailed pheasants like &quot;Ithaginis&quot;, &quot;Lophophorus&quot;, &quot;Pucrasia&quot;, and &quot;Tragopan&quot;. In 2021, Kimball &quot;et al&quot;. found it to belong to the subfamily Phasianini, alongside the true pheasants.

==Phylogeny==
Living Galliformes based on the work by John Boyd.

== Description ==

As their name suggests they are chicken-like in appearance, with rounded bodies and blunt wings, and range in size from small at 15 cm (6 inches) to large at 120 cm (4 feet). They are mainly terrestrial birds and their wings are short and rounded for short-distance flight. Galliforms are anisodactyl like passerines, but some of the adult males grow spurs that point backwards.

Gallinaceous birds are arboreal or terrestrial animals; many prefer not to fly, but instead walk and run for locomotion. They live 5–8 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. They can be found worldwide and in a variety of habitats, including forests, deserts, and grasslands. They use visual displays and vocalizations for communication, courtship, fighting, territoriality, and brooding.

They have diverse mating strategies: some are monogamous, while others are polygamous or polygynandrous. Male courtship behavior includes elaborate visual displays of plumage. They breed seasonally in accordance with the climate and lay three to 16 eggs per year in nests built on the ground or in trees.

Gallinaceous birds feed on a variety of plant and animal material, which may include fruits, seeds, leaves, shoots, flowers, tubers, roots, insects, snails, worms, lizards, snakes, small rodents, and eggs.

These birds vary in size from the diminutive king quail (&quot;Coturnix chinensis&quot;) (5 in) long and weighing 28–40 g (1–1.4 oz) to the largest extant galliform species, the North American wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), which may weigh as much as 14 kg (30.5 lb) and may exceed 120 cm (47 in).

The galliform bird species with the largest wingspan and largest overall length (including a train of over 6 feet) is most likely the green peafowl (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;). Most galliform genera are plump-bodied with thick necks and moderately long legs, with rounded and rather short wings. Grouse, pheasants, francolins, and partridges are typical in their outwardly corpulent silhouettes.

Adult males of many galliform birds have one to several sharp horny spurs on the back of each leg, which they use for fighting. In several lineages, pronounced sexual dimorphism occurs, and among each galliform clade, the more apomorphic (&quot;advanced&quot;) lineages tend to be more sexually dimorphic.

== Flightlessness ==

While most Galliformes are rather reluctant flyers, truly flightless forms are unknown among the extant members of the order. Though they are often mischaracterised as weak-flying, Galliformes are actually highly specialised for their particular flight style, bearing extremely powerful flight muscles, and some species are even migratory. Adult snowcocks are, however, flightless, requiring gravity to launch, although juveniles can still fly relatively well.

Nonetheless, a few birds outside the Galliformes crown-group did produce flightlessness.

The genus &quot;Sylviornis&quot;, a huge prehistorically extinct species of New Caledonia, was flightless, but as opposed to most other flightless birds like ratites or island rails which become flightless due to arrested development of their flight apparatus and subsequently evolve to larger size, &quot;Sylviornis&quot; seems to have become flightless simply due to its bulk, with the wing reduction following consequently, not being the reason for its flightlessness.

The gigantic Australian mihirungs, which may be closer to Galliformes than to Anseriformes as traditionally expected, achieved flightlessness more traditionally, strongly reducing their wings and keel. They were massive herbivorous birds, among the largest avian dinosaurs of all time.

By contrast, the stem-galliform &quot;Scopelortyx&quot; appears to have been more aerial than modern fowl, with a flight style more suited for gliding and soaring.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Most of the galliform birds are more or less resident, but some of the smaller temperate species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (&quot;Centrocercus&quot;), crested partridge, green peafowl, crested argus, mountain peacock-pheasant (&quot;Polyplectron inopinatum&quot;), koklass pheasant (&quot;Pucrasia macrolopha&quot;), Reeves&#x27;s pheasant, and (&quot;Syrmaticus reevesii&quot;). Other species — most of the New World quail (also known as the ‘toothed quail’), the enigmatic stone partridge (&quot;Ptilopachus petrosus&quot;) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (&quot;Crossoptilon&quot;) — are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.

Some Galliformes are adapted to grassland habitat, and these genera are remarkable for their long, thin necks, long legs, and large, wide wings. Fairly unrelated species like the crested fireback (&quot;Lophura ignita&quot;), vulturine guineafowl (&quot;Acryllium vulturinum&quot;), and malleefowl (&quot;Leipoa ocellata&quot;) are outwardly similar in their body types (see also convergent evolution).

Most species that show only limited sexual dimorphism are notable for the great amount of locomotion required to find food throughout the majority of the year. Those species that are highly sedentary but with marked ecological transformations over seasons exhibit marked distinct differences between the sexes in size and/or appearance. Eared-pheasants, guineafowl, toothed quail, and the snow partridge (&quot;Lerwa lerwa&quot;) are examples of limited sexual differences and requirements for traveling over wide terrain to forage.

=== Winter ecology ===
Gallinaceous birds are well adapted to regions with cold winters. Their larger size, increased plumage, and lower activity levels help them to withstand the cold and conserve energy. Under such conditions, they are able to change their feeding strategy to that of a ruminant. This allows them to feed on and extract energy and nutrients from coarse, fibrous plant material, such as buds, twigs, and conifer needles. This provides a virtually unlimited source of accessible food and requires little energy to harvest.

=== Food and feeding ===

Herbivorous to slightly omnivorous galliforms, forming the majority of the group, are typically stoutly built and have short, thick bills primarily adapted for foraging on the ground for rootlets or the consumption of other plant material such as heather shoots. The young birds will also take insects.

Peafowl, junglefowl and most of the subtropical pheasant genera have very different nutritional requirements from typical Palearctic genera. The Himalayan monal (&quot;Lophophorus impejanus&quot;) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (&quot;Catreus wallichi&quot;), crested argus (&quot;Rheinardia ocellata&quot;), the crested partridge (&quot;Rollulus roulroul&quot;) and the crested guineafowl (&quot;Guttera pucherani&quot;) are similar ecologically to the Himalayan monal in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.

Typical peafowl (&quot;Pavo&quot;), most of the peacock-pheasants (&quot;Polyplectron&quot;), the Bulwer&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Lophura bulweri&quot;), the ruffed pheasants (&quot;Chrysolophus&quot;) and the hill partridges (&quot;Arborophila&quot;) have narrow, relatively delicate bills, poorly suited for digging. These galliform genera prefer instead to capture live invertebrates in leaf litter, in sand, or shallow pools or along stream banks. These genera are also outwardly similar in that they each have exceptionally long, delicate legs and toes and the tendency to frequent seasonally wet habitats to forage, especially during chick-rearing. The blue peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;) is famed in its native India for its appetite for snakes – even poisonous cobras – which it dispatches with its strong feet and sharp bill. The Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Chrysolophus amherstiae&quot;), green peafowl (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;), Bulwer&#x27;s pheasant and the crestless fireback (&quot;Lophura erythrophthalma&quot;) are notable for their aptitude to forage for crustaceans such as crayfish and other aquatic small animals in shallow streams and amongst rushes in much the same manner as some members of the rail family (Rallidae). Similarly, although wild turkeys (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) have a diet primarily of vegetation, they will eat insects, mice, lizards, and amphibians, wading in water to hunt for the latter. Domestic hens (&quot;Gallus domesticus&quot;) share this opportunistic behaviour and will eat insects, mice, worms, and amphibians.
The tragopans (&quot;Tragopan&quot;), mikado pheasant (&quot;Syrmaticus mikado&quot;), and several species of grouse and ptarmigan are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable for being able to feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones—such as sagebrush or conifers—which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes—for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus &quot;Syrmaticus&quot;—also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus &quot;Syrmaticus&quot; are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the great argus (&quot;Argusianus argus&quot;) and crested argus may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well. There they are known to forage on slugs, snails, ants, and amphibians to the exclusion of plant material. How they forage in the forest canopy during the rainy months is unknown.

=== Reproduction ===
Most galliforms are very prolific, with clutches regularly exceeding 10 eggs in many species. In contrast to most birds which are – at least for a particular breeding season – monogamous, galliforms are often polygynous or polygamous. Such species can be recognized by their pronounced sexual dimorphism.

Galliform young are very and roam with their mothers – or both parents in monogamous species – mere hours after hatching. The most extreme case are the Megapodiidae, where the adults do not brood, but leave incubation to mounds of rotting vegetation, volcanic ash, or hot sand. The young must dig out of the nest mounds after hatching, but they emerge from the eggs fully feathered, and upon leaving the mound, they are able to fly considerable distances.

== Common species ==
Grouse and ptarmigans - Family Tetraonidae

Grouse, ptarmigans, and prairie chickens are all chicken-like birds with short, curved, strong bills, part of the family Tetraonidae. This group includes 25 species residing mostly in North America. They are mainly ground-dwellers and have short, rounded wings for brief flights. They are well adapted to winter by growing feather &quot;snowshoes&quot; on their feet and roosting beneath the snow. They range in size from the white-tailed ptarmigan to the sage grouse. Their plumage is dense and soft and is most commonly found in shades of red, brown, and gray to camouflage to the ground. They are polygamous and male courtship behavior includes strutting and dancing and aggressive fighting for possession of females. The typical clutch size is between seven and 12 eggs.

Turkeys - Family Meleagrididae

Turkeys are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to in height and weigh up to in the wild. They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14–19 blunt feathers. They have a naked, wrinkled head and feathered body. The North American wild turkey – &quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot; – has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida [Osceola], Merriam&#x27;s, and Gould&#x27;s). Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap. All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere. Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females. The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight. Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales. Males have a &quot;beard&quot; of coarse black bristles hanging from the center of their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs. The ocellated turkey (&quot;Meleagris ocellata&quot;), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucatán peninsula. After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss. However, populations now flourish again due to hunting management and transplanting. The ocellated turkey, not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.

Pheasants, quail, and partridges - Family Phasianidae

The family is divided into four groups: 30 species of new world quail, residing between Paraguay and Canada, 11 species of Old World quail in Africa, Australia, and Asia, 94 species of partridges, and 48 species of pheasants. This family includes a wide range of bird sizes from a quail to pheasants up to almost . Pheasants and quail have heavy, round bodies and rounded wings. Though they have short legs, they are very fast runners when escaping predators.

Chachalacas - Family Cracidae

Chachalacas are found in the chaparral ecosystems from southern Texas through Mexico and Costa Rica. They are mainly arboreal and make their nests in trees above the ground. They are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to long. They have long tails and are chicken-like in appearance. Their frail-looking yet sturdy nests are made of sticks and leaves. Their clutch size is three or four eggs. The males make a unique, loud, mating call that give them their name. Chachalacas feed mainly on berries, but also eat insects. They are a popular game bird, as their flesh is good to eat. They are also commonly domesticated as pets.

<text>The province of Benevento () is a province in the Campania region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Benevento.

==Geography==
The province has an area of 2,071 km2, and, as of 2017, a population of 279,127. There are 78 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province. The biggest municipalities, the only ones over 10,000 inhabitants, are Benevento, Montesarchio, Sant&#x27;Agata de&#x27; Goti and San Giorgio del Sannio.

The territory of the province of Benevento closely approximates that of the Principality of Benevento in the mid and late 11th century. It borders Molise (province of Campobasso) on the North, Apulia (province of Foggia) on the East, the province of Avellino and the metropolitan City of Naples on the South, and the province of Caserta on the West.

The lowest point is in the comune of Limatola (44 meters above sea level), while the highest point is Monte Mutria (1822 meters), one of the mountains of the Matese range, which separates the province of Benevento from Molise.

==Main sights==
===Benevento===
The importance of Benevento in classical times is vouched for by the many remains of antiquity which it possesses, of which the most famous is the triumphal arch erected in honour of Trajan by the senate and people of Rome in 114, with important reliefs relating to its history. Enclosed in the walls, this construction marked the entrance in Benevento of the Via Traiana, the road built by the Spanish emperor to shorten the path from Rome to Brindisi. The reliefs show the civil and military deeds of Trajan. A great part of the arch is decorated with scenes in bas relief: particularly the pillars directed to the town represent scenes of peace and military scenes. The two faces of the Arch are identical in the arrangement of the reliefs. That the reliefs are for the most part not merely fanciful, nor chiefly conventional and decorative in theme and treatment, is also clear at first sight. They plainly refer to actual events and actions in the life of Trajan, whose effigy, sometimes decapitated, appears in all but two of them, one of which is the only one on all the Arch that is substantially defective. The height of the monument is of 15,60 meter, with an arch of 8 meter, a structure composed of limestone rocks and a marble covering. The arch was put during the Middle Age in the fenced area of the town, in order to represent the &quot;Porta Aurea,&quot; on account of its fair proportions and the wealth and excellence of its sculptural adornments.
The church of Santa Sofia is a circular Lombard edifice dating to c. 760, now modernized, of small proportions, and is one of the main examples of religious Lombard architecture. The plan consists of a central hexagon with, at each vertex, columns taken from the temple of Isis; these are connected by arches which support the cupola. The inner hexagon is in turn enclosed in a decagonal ring with eight white limestone pillars and two columns next to the entrance. The church has a fine cloister of the 12th century, constructed in part of fragments of earlier buildings. This cloister today is the location of the Museo del Sannio. The church interior was once totally frescoed by Byzantine artists: fragments of these paintings, portraying the &quot;Histories of Christ&quot;, can be still seen in the two side apses. Santa Sofia was almost destroyed by the earthquake of 1688, and rebuilt in Baroque forms by commission of the then cardinal Orsini of Benevento (later Pope Benedict XIII). The original forms were hidden, and were recovered only after the discussed restoration of 1951. In 2011, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.).
The Benevento Cathedral, with its arcaded façade and incomplete square campanile (begun in 1279 by the archbishop Romano Capodiferro) dates from the 9th century. It was rebuilt in 1114, the façade inspired by the Pisan Gothic style. Its bronze doors, adorned with bas-reliefs, are notable example of Romanesque art which may belong to the beginning of the 13th century. The interior is in the form of a basilica, the double aisles carried on ancient columns. There are ambones resting on columns supported by lions, and decorated with reliefs and coloured marble mosaic, and a candelabrum of 1311. A marble statue of the apostle San Bartolomeo, by Nicola da Monteforte, is also from the 14th century. The cathedral also contains a statue of St. Giuseppe Moscati, a native of the area. The cathedral was completely destroyed in 1943 because of bombardments: what remained of the cathedral were just the bell tower, the façade and the crypt. Another testimony of the cathedral is the 12th-century bronze door, the Janua Major, composed of 72 tiles with bas relief, whose fragments were rebuilt after the Second World War.
The current monument, with its modern aspect, was completed in 1965 and restored between 2005 and 2012.

<doc id="144359" wikidata="Q371774" url="?curid=144359" title="Nero Wolfe">
<text>Nero Wolfe is a brilliant, obese and eccentric fictional armchair detective created in 1934 by American mystery writer Rex Stout. Wolfe was born in Montenegro and keeps his past murky. He lives in a luxurious brownstone on West 35th Street in New York City, and he is loath to leave his home for business or anything that would keep him from reading his books, tending his orchids, or eating the gourmet meals prepared by his chef, Fritz Brenner. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe&#x27;s sharp-witted, dapper young confidential assistant with an eye for attractive women, narrates the cases and does the legwork for the detective genius.

Stout published 33 novels and 41 novellas and short stories featuring Wolfe from 1934 to 1975, with most of them set in New York City. The stories have been adapted for film, radio, television and the stage. The Nero Wolfe corpus was nominated for Best Mystery Series of the Century in 2000 at Bouchercon XXXI, the world&#x27;s largest mystery convention, and Rex Stout was a nominee for Best Mystery Writer of the Century.
==Title character==
Although the Nero Wolfe stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society, the principal characters in the corpus (the term used by Wolfe fandom for the collection of books and stories, as the Baker Street Irregulars refer to the Sherlock Holmes tales as &quot;the Canon&quot;) do not age. According to a memo prepared by Rex Stout in 1949, Nero Wolfe&#x27;s age is 56, although this is not explicitly stated in the stories.

&quot;Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years,&quot; Stout told his authorized biographer, John McAleer. &quot;Any reader who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t do the same should skip them. I didn&#x27;t age the characters because I didn&#x27;t want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories.&quot;

According to the same memo, Wolfe&#x27;s height is and his weight is . Archie Goodwin, the narrator of the stories, frequently describes Wolfe as weighing &quot;a seventh of a ton&quot; (equivalent to about 286 pounds). This was intended to indicate unusual obesity at the time of the first book (1934), especially through the use of the word &quot;ton&quot; as the unit of measure. In a single short story written in 1947, Archie writes, &quot;He weighs between 310 and 390, and he limits his physical movements to what he regards as the irreducible essentials.&quot;

&quot;Wolfe&#x27;s most extravagant distinction is his extreme antipathy to literal extravagance. He will not move,&quot; wrote J. Kenneth Van Dover in &quot;At Wolfe&#x27;s Door: The Nero Wolfe Novels of Rex Stout&quot;:

Wolfe&#x27;s most remarkable departure from the brownstone is for personal reasons, not for business, and thus does not violate the rule regarding the conduct of business away from the office. That event occurs in &quot;The Black Mountain&quot;, when he leaves not only the brownstone but the United States to avenge the murder of his oldest friend. He abandons his cherished daily habits for a time and, despite his physical bulk, engages in strenuous outdoor activity in mountain terrain.

===Origins===

The corpus implies or states that Nero Wolfe was born in Montenegro, with one exception: In the first chapter of &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; (1939), Wolfe tells an FBI agent that he was born in the United States – a declaration at odds with all other references. Stout revealed the reason for the discrepancy in a 1940 letter cited by his authorized biographer, John McAleer: &quot;In the original draft of &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; Nero was a Montenegrin by birth, and it all fitted previous hints as to his background; but violent protests from &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, supported by Farrar &amp; Rinehart, caused his cradle to be transported five thousand miles.&quot;

&quot;I got the idea of making Wolfe a Montenegrin from Louis Adamic,&quot; Stout said, noting that everything he knew about Montenegrins he learned from Adamic&#x27;s book, &quot;The Native&#x27;s Return&quot; (1934), or from Adamic himself.

:&quot;Adamic describes the Montenegrin male as tall, commanding, dignified, courteous, hospitable,&quot; McAleer wrote. &quot;He is reluctant to work, accustomed to isolation from women. He places women in a subordinate role. He is a romantic idealist, apt to go in for dashing effects to express his spirited nature. He is strong in family loyalties, has great pride, is impatient of restraint. Love of freedom is his outstanding trait. He is stubborn, fearless, unsubduable, capable of great self-denial to uphold his ideals. He is fatalistic toward death. In short, Rex had found for Wolfe a nationality that fitted him to perfection.&quot;

Wolfe is reticent about his youth, but apparently he was athletic, fit, and adventurous. In the earliest novels, Wolfe had been living in the brownstone on West Thirty-Fifth Street since about 1914, but in later novels this chronology is retconned away and Wolfe did not arrive in the US until 1930. Before World War I, he spied for the Austrian government&#x27;s Evidenzbureau, but had a change of heart when the war began. He then joined the Serbian-Montenegrin army and fought against the Austrians and Germans. That means that he was likely to have been involved in the harrowing 1915 withdrawal of the defeated Serbian army, when thousands of soldiers died from disease, starvation, and sheer exhaustion
– which might help to explain the comfort-loving habits that are such a conspicuous part of Wolfe&#x27;s character. He joined the American Expeditionary Forces, and after a time in Europe and North Africa, he came to the United States.

====Influences====
According to John J. McAleer, Rex Stout&#x27;s official biographer, during his stint in the Navy, Stout came into contact with Alvey A. Adee, who was a major influence on Stout&#x27;s creation of Nero Wolfe. Adee was a scholar, sleuth, gourmet, bachelor, a model of efficiency, a master of the English language, and is said to have inspired the characterization of Wolfe. Other than Adee, Rex Stout&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Emily Todhunter, who was obese requiring a special chair and was addicted to atlases, dictionaries &amp; flowers and also an omnivorous reader, served as a model.

For Archie, Chief A.G Goodwin, an officer who recovered Rex Stout&#x27;s stolen record collection, served as a model.

====Suppositions====
In 1956, J. D. Clark theorized in an article in &quot;The Baker Street Journal&quot; that Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler (a character from &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;) had an affair in Montenegro in 1892, and that Nero Wolfe was the result. The idea was later co-opted by W. S. Baring-Gould and implied in the novels of Nicholas Meyer and John Lescroart, but there is no evidence that Rex Stout had any such connection in mind. Certainly there is no mention of it in any of the stories, although a painting of Sherlock Holmes does hang over Archie Goodwin&#x27;s desk in Nero Wolfe&#x27;s office. Some commentators note both physical and psychological resemblances and suggest Sherlock&#x27;s brother Mycroft Holmes as a more likely father for Wolfe. Commentators have noted a coincidence in the names &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;: The same vowels appear in the same order. In 1957, Ellery Queen called this &quot;The great O-E theory&quot; and suggested that it was derived from the father of mysteries, Edgar Allan Poe. The only mention of Wolfe&#x27;s mother in Stout&#x27;s stories is in the first novel, &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; (1935), in which it is stated that she lives in Budapest and Wolfe sends her a monthly check.

Some Wold Newton theorists have suggested the French thief Arsène Lupin as the father of Nero Wolfe. They note that in one story Lupin has an affair with the queen of a Balkan principality, which may be Montenegro by another name. Further, they note that the name Lupin resembles the French word for wolf, &quot;loup&quot;.

===Brownstone===


Wolfe has expensive tastes, living in a comfortable and luxurious New York City brownstone on the south side of West 35th Street. The brownstone has three floors plus a large basement with living quarters, a rooftop greenhouse also with living quarters, and a small elevator, used almost exclusively by Wolfe. Other unique features include a timer-activated window-opening device that regulates the temperature in Wolfe&#x27;s bedroom, an alarm system that sounds a gong in Archie&#x27;s room if someone approaches Wolfe&#x27;s bedroom door or windows, and climate-controlled plant rooms on the top floor. Wolfe is a well-known amateur orchid grower and has 10,000 plants in the brownstone&#x27;s greenhouse. He employs three live-in staff to see to his needs: Archie Goodwin (assistant), Fritz Brenner (chef), and Theodore Horstmann (orchidist).

The front door is equipped with a chain bolt, a bell that can be shut off as needed, and a pane of one-way glass, which enables Archie to see who is on the stoop before deciding whether to open the door. The front room is used as a waiting area for visitors while Archie informs Wolfe of their arrival, and also as a place for Archie to hide one visitor from another.

Wolfe&#x27;s bedroom is on the second floor of the brownstone, and Archie&#x27;s is on the third. Each of these floors also includes one spare bedroom, used on occasion to house a variety of clients, witnesses, and sometimes even culprits. Wolfe takes pride in being able to offer such assistance and once remarked, &quot;The guest is a jewel resting on the cushion of hospitality&quot;.

Wolfe&#x27;s office becomes nearly soundproof when the doors connecting it to the front room and the hallway are closed. There is a small hole in the office wall covered by what Archie calls a &quot;trick picture of a waterfall&quot;. A person in an alcove at the end of the hallway can open a sliding panel covering the hole, so as to see and hear conversations and other events in the office without being noticed. The chair behind Wolfe&#x27;s desk is custom-built, with special springs to hold his weight; according to Archie, it is the only chair that Wolfe really enjoys sitting in. Near the desk is a large chair upholstered in red leather, which is usually reserved for Inspector Cramer, a current or prospective client, or the person whom Wolfe and Archie want to question. In the short story &quot;The Squirt and the Monkey&quot;, Wolfe and Archie have a hidden tape recorder and microphone installed in the office, with controls in the kitchen. In the story &quot;Eeny Meeny Murder Mo&quot;, the system is modified to transmit sound to a speaker in the front room.

The brownstone has a back entrance leading to a private garden, as noted in &quot;Champagne for One&quot; (chapter 10) and elsewhere, from which a passage leads to 34th Street—used to enter or leave Wolfe&#x27;s home when it is necessary to evade surveillance. Archie says that Fritz tries to grow herbs such as chives in the garden.

&quot;That readers have proved endlessly fascinated with the topography of Wolfe&#x27;s brownstone temple should not be surprising&quot;, wrote J. Kenneth Van Dover in &quot;At Wolfe&#x27;s Door&quot;:

It is the center from which moral order emanates, and the details of its layout and its operations are signs of its stability. For forty years, Wolfe prepares menus with Fritz and pots orchids with Theodore. For forty years, Archie takes notes at his desk, the client sits in the red chair and the other principals distribute themselves in the yellow chairs, and Wolfe presides from his custom-made throne. For forty years, Inspector Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins ring the doorbell, enter the office, and explode with indignation at Wolfe&#x27;s intractability. The front room, the elevator, the three-foot globe—all persist in place through forty years of American history. ... Like Holmes&#x27;s 221B Baker Street, Wolfe&#x27;s West Thirty-Fifth Street remains a fixed point in a turning world.

In the course of the books, ten different street addresses are given on West 35th Street:
* 506 in &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot;, chapter 12
* 618 in &quot;Too Many Clients&quot;, chapter 4
* 902 in &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;, chapter 7
* 909 in &quot;Before I Die&quot;, chapter 10
* 914 in &quot;Too Many Women&quot;, chapter 24
* 918 in &quot;The Red Box&quot;, chapter 3
* 919 in &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;, chapter 12
* 922 in &quot;The Silent Speaker,&quot; chapter 2
* 924 in &quot;Man Alive&quot;, chapter 9
* 938 in &quot;Death of a Doxy&quot;, chapter 4

&quot;Curiously, the 900 block of West 35th Street would be in the Hudson River&quot;, wrote American writer Randy Cohen, who created a map of the literary stars&#x27; homes for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2005. &quot;It&#x27;s a non-address, the real estate equivalent of those 555 telephone numbers used in movies.&quot; Cohen settled on 922 West 35th Street—the address printed on Archie&#x27;s business card in &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;—as Nero Wolfe&#x27;s address. On the &quot;Literary Map of Manhattan&quot;, the brownstone is numbered 58 and is placed in the middle of the Hudson River.

It is described in the opening chapter of &quot;The Second Confession&quot; as being on West Thirty-Fifth Street &quot;nearly to 11th Avenue&quot;, which would put it in the 500 block.

Writing as Archie Goodwin, Ken Darby suggests that &quot;the actual location was on East 22nd Street in the Gramercy Park District. ... Wolfe merely moved us, fictionally, from one place to the other in order to preserve his particular brand of privacy. As far as &quot;I&quot; can discover, there never &quot;were&quot; brownstone houses on West 35th Street.&quot;

The absence of brownstones in Wolfe&#x27;s neighborhood sent television producers to the Upper West Side of Manhattan for an appropriate home and setting for select exterior shots, used in the A&amp;E TV series &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;. This Manhattan brownstone lacked some peculiarities of Wolfe&#x27;s home, unlike the model specially constructed on the Toronto set where most of the series was filmed—for example, the correct number of steps leading up to the stoop. It was, therefore, shown from angles that would camouflage any slight discrepancies. The series settled on &quot;914&quot; for the brownstone&#x27;s address. This number can be seen on the studio set representing the front door exterior in several episodes and on a closeup of Archie&#x27;s paycheck in &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Base&quot;.

===Food===


Good food is a keystone (along with reading) of Wolfe&#x27;s mostly leisured existence. He is both a gourmand and a gourmet, enjoying generous helpings of Fritz&#x27;s cuisine three times a day. Shad roe is a particular favorite, prepared in a number of different ways. Archie enjoys his food but lacks Wolfe&#x27;s discerning palate, lamenting in &quot;The Final Deduction&quot; (chapter 9) that &quot;Every spring I get so fed up with shad roe that I wish to heaven fish would figure out some other way. Whales have.&quot; Shad roe is frequently the first course, followed by roasted or braised duck, another Wolfe favorite.

Archie also complains that there is never corned beef or rye bread on Wolfe&#x27;s table, and he sometimes ducks out to eat a corned beef sandwich at a nearby diner. Yet a young woman gives Wolfe a lesson in preparing corned beef hash in &quot;Cordially Invited to Meet Death&quot;. Another contradiction is found in &quot;Plot It Yourself&quot; when Archie goes to a diner to eat &quot;fried chicken like my Aunt Margie used to make it back in Ohio&quot;, since Fritz does not fry chicken. But in &quot;The Golden Spiders&quot;, Fritz prepares fried chicken for Wolfe, Archie, Saul, Orrie, and Fred.

Wolfe displays an oenophile&#x27;s knowledge of wine and brandy, but it is only implied that he drinks either. In &quot;And Be a Villain&quot; (chapter 17), he issues a dinner invitation and regrets doing so on short notice: &quot;There will not be time to chambrer a claret properly, but we can have the chill off.&quot; Continuing the invitation, Wolfe says of a certain brandy, &quot;I hope this won&#x27;t shock you, but the way to do it is to sip it with bites of Fritz&#x27;s apple pie.&quot;

On weekdays, Fritz serves Wolfe his breakfast in his bedroom. Archie eats his separately in the kitchen, although Wolfe might ask Fritz to send Archie upstairs if he has morning instructions for him. Regularly scheduled mealtimes for lunch and dinner are part of Wolfe&#x27;s daily routine. In an early story, Wolfe tells a guest that luncheon is served daily at 1 p.m. and dinner at 8 p.m., although later stories suggest that lunchtime may have been changed to 1:15 or 1:30, at least on Fridays. Lunch and dinner are served in the dining room, on the opposite side of the first-floor hallway from the front room and the office. However, Archie will eat separately in the kitchen if he is in a rush due to pressing business or a social engagement, because Wolfe cannot bear to see a meal rushed. Wolfe also has a rule against discussing business at the table, sometimes bent but very rarely overtly broken.

In the earliest books, Archie reports that Wolfe is subject to what he terms a &quot;relapse&quot;—a period of several days during which Wolfe refuses to work or even to listen to Archie badger him about work. The cause is unknown. Wolfe either takes to bed and eats nothing but bread and onion soup, or else he consults with Fritz on menus and the preparation of nonstop meals. In &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; (chapter 6), Archie reports that, during a relapse, Wolfe once ate half a sheep in two days, different parts cooked in 20 different ways. The relapse also appears briefly in &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot; (chapter 11), &quot;The Red Box&quot; (chapter 6), and &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot; (chapter 12), but subsequently disappears from the corpus as a plot device—possibly because Archie eventually discovered how to shut down a relapse during its earliest stages, as chronicled in &quot;The Red Box&quot;.

Wolfe views much of life through the prism of food and dining, going so far as to say that Voltaire &quot;... wasn&#x27;t a man at all, since he had no palate and a dried-up stomach.&quot; He knows enough about fine cuisine to lecture on American cooking to Les Quinze Maîtres (a group of the 15 finest chefs in the world) in &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; and to dine with the Ten for Aristology (a group of epicures) in &quot;Poison à la Carte&quot;. Wolfe does not, however, enjoy visiting restaurants (with the occasional exception of Rusterman&#x27;s, owned for a time by Wolfe&#x27;s best friend Marko Vukčić and later subject to Wolfe&#x27;s trusteeship). In &quot;The Red Box&quot; (chapter 11), Wolfe states, &quot;I know nothing of restaurants; short of compulsion, I would not eat in one were Vatel himself the chef.&quot;

Wolfe appears to know his way around the kitchen; in &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; (chapter 17), he tells Jerome Berin, &quot;I spend quite a little time in the kitchen myself.&quot; In &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;, he offers to cook Yorkshire Buck and, in &quot;Immune to Murder&quot;, the State Department asks him to prepare trout Montbarry for a visiting dignitary. In &quot;The Black Mountain&quot;, Wolfe and Goodwin stay briefly in an unoccupied house in Italy on their way to Montenegro; Wolfe prepares a pasta dish using Romano cheese that, from &quot;his memory of local custom&quot;, he finds in a hole in the ground. During the short story &quot;Murder Is Corny&quot;, he lectures Inspector Cramer on the right and wrong ways to cook corn on the cob, insisting that it must be roasted rather than boiled in order to achieve the best flavor. (The 1940 story &quot;Bitter End&quot; suggests the contrary view that Wolfe was unable to prepare his own meals; Fritz&#x27;s illness with the flu causes a household crisis and forces Wolfe to resort to canned liver pâté for his lunch.)

Wolfe&#x27;s meals generally include an appetizer, a main course, a salad served after the entrée (with the salad dressing mixed at tableside and used immediately), and a dessert course with coffee. (After-dinner coffee, however, is often taken by Wolfe and Archie in the office rather than the dining room.)

Many of the dishes referred to in the various Nero Wolfe stories and novels were collected and published, complete with recipes, as &quot;The Nero Wolfe Cookbook&quot; by Rex Stout and the Editors of the Viking Press, published in 1973. All recipes are prefaced with a brief excerpt from the book or story that made reference to that particular dish.

===Beer===

Nero Wolfe&#x27;s first recorded words are, &quot;Where&#x27;s the beer?&quot;

The first novel, &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;, introduces Wolfe as he prepares to change his habits. With Prohibition at an end, he can stop buying kegs of bootleg beer and purchase it legally in bottles. Fritz brings in samples of 49 different brands for him to evaluate, from which he ultimately selects Remmers as his favorite. Several times during the story, Wolfe announces his intention to reduce his beer intake from six quarts a day to five. &quot;I grinned at that, for I didn&#x27;t believe it&quot;, Archie Goodwin writes.

Like most other things in Wolfe&#x27;s life, his beer drinking is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-karat gold bottle opener given to him by a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.

In &quot;Plot It Yourself&quot; (chapter 13), Wolfe makes an unprecedented vow after Archie tells him the killer they seek has killed again. Wolfe hits the desk with his fist, bellows in a language Archie does not understand, then coldly orders Fritz away when he enters with the beer: &quot;Take it back. I shall drink no beer until I get my fingers around that creature&#x27;s throat. And I shall eat no meat.&quot;

===Reading===
Reading is central to Nero Wolfe&#x27;s life, and books are central to the plots of many of the stories. The floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lining Wolfe&#x27;s office contain some 1,200 books (&quot;Gambit&quot;, chapter 6)—the size of Stout&#x27;s own library.

In the first paragraph of &quot;Plot It Yourself&quot;, Archie relates his own method of grading what Wolfe is reading, on a scale from A to D. If Wolfe picks up a book before he rings for beer, and if he has marked his place with a thin strip of gold given to him by a grateful client, the book is an A. &quot;I haven&#x27;t kept score, but I would say that of the two hundred or so books he reads in a year not more than five or six get an A,&quot; Archie writes. In &quot;The Red Box&quot; (chapter 12), Wolfe uses a thin strip of ebony to mark his place as he re-reads &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. Archie indicates in various stories that Wolfe prefers to finish a paragraph before acknowledging an interruption in his reading. He often dog-ears a page to mark his place.

====Select reading list====
William S. Baring-Gould&#x27;s summary of Wolfe&#x27;s library was incorporated with contributions from others into an annotated reading list created by Winnifred Louis.
===Orchids===

Known for rigidly maintaining his personal schedule, Nero Wolfe is most inflexible when it comes to his routine in the rooftop plant rooms. Ever day except Sunday, from 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning, and from 4:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon, he looks after his orchid collection alongside his employee Theodore Horstmann, the &quot;best orchid nurse alive&quot;. (Horstmann himself is said to spend up to 12 hours a day in the plant rooms.)

&quot;Wolfe spends four hours a day with his orchids. Clients must accommodate themselves to this schedule&quot;, wrote Rex Stout&#x27;s biographer John J. McAleer. &quot;Rex does not use the orchid schedule to gloss over gummy plotting. Like the disciplines the sonneteer is bound by, the schedule is part of the framework he is committed to work within. The orchids and the orchid rooms sometimes are focal points in the stories. They are never irrelevant. In forty years Wolfe has scarcely ever shortened an orchid schedule.&quot;

&quot;A dilly it was, this greenhouse&quot;, wrote Dr. John H. Vandermeulen in the &quot;American Orchid Society Bulletin&quot;.

Entering from the stairs via a vestibule, there were three main rooms—one for cattleyas, laelias, and hybrids; one for odontoglossums, oncidiums, miltonias, and their hybrids; and a tropical room (according to &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;). It must have been quite a sight with the angle-iron staging gleaming in its silver paint and on the concrete benches and shelves 10,000 pots of orchids in glorious, exultant bloom.

&quot;If Wolfe had a favorite orchid, it would be the genus Phalaenopsis&quot;, Robert M. Hamilton wrote in his article, &quot;The Orchidology of Nero Wolfe&quot;, first printed in &quot;The Gazette: Journal of the Wolfe Pack&quot; (Volume 1, Spring 1979). Phalaenopsis is mentioned in 11 Wolfe stories, and Phalaenopsis Aphrodite is named in seven—more than any other species. Wolfe personally cuts his most treasured Phalaenopsis Aphrodite for the centerpiece at the dinner for the Ten for Aristology in &quot;Poison à la Carte&quot;. In &quot;The Father Hunt&quot;, after Dorothy Sebor provides the information that solves the case, Wolfe tells Archie, &quot;We&#x27;ll send her some sprays of Phalaenopsis Aphrodite. They have never been finer.&quot;

In the earlier works, Wolfe doesn&#x27;t sell his orchids -- &quot;I do not sell orchids&quot;, Wolfe tells Archie in chapter 7 of &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; (1951). In &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot; (1946), Wolfe complains to Archie about the difficulty of the case, saying &quot;I was an ass to undertake it. I have more Cattleyas than I have room for, and I could have sold five hundred of them for twelve thousand dollars.&quot; However, he does give them away. Four or five dozen are used to advance the investigation in &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;, and Wolfe refuses to let Archie bill the client for them. In &quot;The Final Deduction&quot;, Laelia purpurata and Dendrobium chrysotoxum are sent to Dr. Vollmer and his assistant, who shelter Wolfe and Archie when they have to flee the brownstone to avoid the police. As the series progresses, Wolfe seems to be more comfortable selling his orchids. In 1957&#x27;s &quot;If Death Ever Slept&quot; (chapter 11), Archie describes Wolfe as &quot;a practicing private detective with no other source of income except selling a few orchid plants now and then&quot;. By the time of Stout&#x27;s short 1963 piece &quot;Why Nero Wolfe Likes Orchids&quot;, Archie notes that Wolfe &quot;hasn&#x27;t bought a plant from a commercial grower for 10 years, but he sells some -- a hundred or more a year.&quot;

In &quot;The Second Confession&quot;, the orchid rooms are torn apart by gunfire from across the street. The shooters are in the employ of crime boss Arnold Zeck, who wants Wolfe to drop a case that could lead back to him. Wolfe and Archie call men to take care of the plants and repair the windows before notifying the police.

===Eccentricities===
Wolfe has pronounced eccentricities and strict rules concerning his way of life. Their occasional violation adds spice to many of the stories.

Despite Wolfe&#x27;s rule never to leave the brownstone on business, the stories find him leaving his home on several occasions. At times, Wolfe and Archie are on a personal errand when a murder occurs, and legal authorities require that they remain in the vicinity (&quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;, &quot;Some Buried Caesar&quot;, &quot;Too Many Detectives&quot; and &quot;Immune to Murder&quot;, for example). In other instances, the requirements of the case force Wolfe from his house (&quot;In the Best Families&quot;, &quot;The Second Confession&quot;, &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;, &quot;Plot It Yourself&quot;, &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;, &quot;Death of a Dude&quot;). Nevertheless, Wolfe is usually able to justify the travel associated with these cases as still being within the limits of his self-imposed &quot;no leaving the house on business&quot; rule, often by noting that there was a personal non-business related reason to make the journey. Although he occasionally ventures by car into the suburbs of New York City, he is loath to travel, and clutches the safety strap continually on the occasions that Archie drives him somewhere. He does not trust trains to start or to stop. As Archie says of Wolfe in &quot;The Doorbell Rang,&quot; &quot;he distrusted all machines more complicated than a wheelbarrow.&quot;

Wolfe maintains a rigid schedule in the brownstone. He has breakfast in his bedroom while wearing yellow silk pajamas; he hates to discuss work during breakfast, and if forced to do so insists upon not uttering a word until he has finished his glass of orange juice (&quot;Murder by the Book&quot;). Afterwards, he is with Horstmann in the plant rooms from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Lunch is usually at 1:15 p.m. He returns to the plant rooms from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Dinner is generally at 7:15 or 7:30 p.m. (although in one book, Wolfe tells a guest that lunch is served at 1 o&#x27;clock and dinner at 8). The remaining hours, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and after dinner, are available for business, or for reading if there is no pressing business (even if, by Archie&#x27;s lights, there is). Sunday&#x27;s schedule is more relaxed; Theodore, the orchid-keeper, usually goes out.

Wolfe is loath to exercise, but in &quot;The Rubber Band&quot; he is sufficiently concerned about his weight that he adds a workout to his daily routine. From 3:45 to 4 p.m., he throws yellow-feathered darts (which he calls &quot;javelins&quot;) at a poker-dart board that Fritz hangs in the office. Archie joins him, using red-feathered darts, but quits when he loses nearly $100 to Wolfe in the first two months; he resumes playing only after Wolfe agrees to raise his salary. &quot;There was no chance of getting any real accuracy with it, it was mostly luck&quot;, Archie writes. Other surprising examples of Wolfe&#x27;s athleticism occur in &quot;Not Quite Dead Enough&quot; and &quot;The Black Mountain&quot;.

Wolfe does not invite people to use his first name and addresses them by honorific and surname. Aside from his employees, one of the only two men whom Wolfe addresses by their first names is his oldest friend, Marko Vukčić; Marko calls him Nero. In &quot;Death of a Doxy&quot; Julie Jaquette refers to Wolfe as Nero in a letter to Archie; and Lily Rowan has addressed Wolfe using an assumed first name. But these are exceptions. In &quot;The Rodeo Murder&quot; Wolfe finds it objectionable when Wade Eisler addresses him as Nero; and in &quot;Door to Death&quot; Sybil Pitcairn&#x27;s disdainful use of his first name makes Wolfe decide to solve the case. Men nearly always address him as Wolfe, and women as Mr. Wolfe.

He is extremely fastidious about his clothing and hates to wear, even in private, anything that has been soiled. The short story &quot;Eeny Meeny Murder Mo&quot; opens with an example of this habit, in which Wolfe removes his necktie and leaves it on his desk after dropping a bit of sauce on it during lunch. The tie is later used to commit a murder in his office. Beyond that, Wolfe has a marked preference for the color yellow, habitually wearing shirts and silk pajamas in this color and sleeping on yellow bedsheets.

He restricts his visible reactions: as Archie puts it, &quot;He shook his head, moving it a full half-inch right and left, which was for him a frenzy of negation.&quot;

Wolfe states that &quot;all music is a vestige of barbarism&quot; and denies that music can have any intellectual content. He takes a dim view of television, but TV sets did find their way into the brownstone in the later stories. Archie notes in &quot;Before Midnight&quot;, &quot;It was Sunday evening, when he especially enjoyed turning the television off.&quot; Wolfe&#x27;s attitude toward television notwithstanding, the TV set in Fritz&#x27;s basement quarters proved handy in &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;, when the volume was turned up to foil potential eavesdroppers.

Wolfe displays a pronounced, almost pathological, dislike for the company of women. Although some readers interpret this attitude as simple misogyny, various details in the stories, particularly the early ones, suggest it has more to do with an unfortunate encounter in early life with a &quot;femme fatale&quot;. It is not women themselves that he dislikes: rather, it is what he perceives as their frailties, especially a tendency to hysterics—to which he thinks every woman is prone. &quot;In the all-male Wolfe household that is an apparent bulwark of men&#x27;s-club solidarity, Wolfe&#x27;s misogyny is part pose, part protection, but above all, a shrewd tool of detective strategy&quot;, wrote critic Molly Haskell. &quot;Archie does the romancing while Wolfe prods and offends, winnowing out the traitorous and brattish women and allowing the cream, the really great women, to rise to the top. ... We deduce from the glow of those special women who do earn the detective&#x27;s good will just how discriminating and interested an observer of womankind the author is.&quot; These women include Clara Fox (&quot;The Rubber Band&quot;), Lily Rowan (introduced in &quot;Some Buried Caesar&quot;), Phoebe Gunther (&quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;) and Julie Jaquette (&quot;Death of a Doxy&quot;). In &quot;The Rubber Band&quot;, Wolfe says, &quot;It has been many years since any woman has slept under this roof. Not that I disapprove of them, except when they attempt to function as domestic animals. When they stick to the vocations for which they are best adapted, such as chicanery, sophistry, self-adornment, cajolery, mystification and incubation, they are sometimes splendid creatures.&quot;

That Wolfe disapproves of women is well established, but Archie claims that there are nuances: &quot;The basic fact about a woman that seemed to irritate him was that she was a woman; the long record showed not a single exception; but from there on the documentation was cockeyed. If woman as woman grated on him you would suppose that the most womanly details would be the worst for him, but time and again I have known him to have a chair placed for a female so that his desk would not obstruct his view of her legs, and the answer can&#x27;t be that his interest is professional and he reads character from legs, because the older and dumpier she is the less he cares where she sits. It is a very complex question and some day I&#x27;m going to take a whole chapter for it.&quot; (&quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;, chapter 30.)

Wolfe has an aversion to physical contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe&#x27;s own bedroom: &quot;Wolfe told me once ... that he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone ...&quot; When Jerome Berin, creator of &quot;saucisse minuit&quot;, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at &quot;Wolfe, who didn&#x27;t like being touched, concealing his squirm for the sake of sausages.&quot; In &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Base&quot;, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff &quot;put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man&#x27;s hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff&#x27;s, unmerited, I will not have.&quot; Wolfe&#x27;s prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in &quot;Cordially Invited to Meet Death&quot;, Archie finds Wolfe in the kitchen with a woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef hash: &quot;Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella.&quot;

Wolfe likes to solve the crossword puzzle of British newspapers in preference to those of American papers, and hates to be interrupted while so engaged.

Wolfe is very particular in his choice of words. He is a prescriptivist who hates to hear language being misused according to his lights, often chastising people who do so. One example is his dislike of the word &quot;contact&quot; being used as a verb; when Johnny Keems says that &quot;contact&quot; &quot;is&quot; a verb, transitive and intransitive, Wolfe replies &quot;Contact is not a verb under this roof&quot;. One of his most severe reactions occurs in the first chapter of &quot;Gambit&quot;, when he burns Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary in the front room fireplace because it states that the words &quot;imply&quot; and &quot;infer&quot; can be used interchangeably. Wolfe generally abhors slang (though in &quot;Murder Is Corny&quot; he says &quot;There is good slang and bad slang&quot;) and expects Archie to avoid slang and other language he disapproves of when speaking to him. However, as with other worldly concerns, he sometimes relies on Archie&#x27;s greater familiarity with slang when business demands it.

In nearly every story, Wolfe solves the mystery by considering the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, leaning back in his chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe&#x27;s thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.

===Fictional entities===
The books frequently mention brands that do not exist: for instance, Wolfe owns a Heron automobile, which Archie drives, and Wethersill automobiles are also mentioned. A Marley revolver (also Carley, in &quot;Die Like a Dog&quot;) is Archie&#x27;s weapon of choice. A semi-fictional revolver brand is the Haskell (mentioned in &quot;A Right to Die&quot;). The Rabson lock likewise does not exist; the name was borrowed by Lawrence Block and used in his Bernie Rhodenbarr mysteries. Wolfe serves Remisier brandy or Follansbee&#x27;s gin to guests and drinks Remmers&#x27; beer. Archie goes dancing at the Flamingo Club, which is now the name of more than one place in the New York City area, but the one in the books antedates them. Archie also frequently goes to Manhattan addresses that do not exist, for instance, 171 East 52nd Street in &quot;Might as Well Be Dead&quot;. Wolfe&#x27;s address, as mentioned above, is also fictional.

(Stout initially used many real brands: Archie drives a Ford, carries a Colt pistol or revolver, and uses an Underwood typewriter. Stout was bothered when his stationer mentioned that, every time Stout mentioned Underwood&#x27;s in a story, sales of that brand went up – and so switched to fictional brands. Ian Fleming, a fan of Stout, borrowed the technique for the James Bond novels, both fictional and real.)

On the other hand, real names and places also occur in the text, presumably for verisimilitude; Wolfe serves Bar-Le-Duc to a visitor on one occasion. The &quot;Churchill Hotel&quot; (officially the Hotel Churchill), mentioned many times, is a real hotel in Manhattan, and Sardi&#x27;s is a real restaurant. Real people, for example, J. Edgar Hoover (notably in &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;), Walter Winchell and Texas Guinan are also mentioned.

==Narrator==

Archie Goodwin is the narrator of all the Nero Wolfe stories and a central character in them. Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, critics and scholars of detective fiction, summarized the unique relationship between Wolfe and Archie:

First, Archie is not a friend but a paid employee, who acts as secretary, chauffeur, and legman to the mountainous and sedentary Wolfe. Then they differ in all important respects—age, background, physique, and education. Finally, it is impossible to say which is the more interesting and admirable of the two. They are complementary in the unheard-of ratio of 50–50. ... Archie has talents without which Wolfe would be lost: his remarkable memory, trained physical power, brash American humor, attractiveness to women, and ability to execute the most difficult errand virtually without instructions. Minus Archie, Wolfe would be a feckless recluse puttering in an old house on West 35th Street, New York.

Like Wolfe, Archie is a licensed private detective and handles all investigation that takes place outside the brownstone. He also takes care of routine tasks such as sorting the mail, taking dictation and answering the phone. At the time of the first novel, &quot;Fer-de-Lance,&quot; Archie had been working for Wolfe for seven years and had by then been trained by Wolfe in his preferred methods of investigation. Like Wolfe, he has developed an extraordinary memory and can recite verbatim conversations that go on for hours. But perhaps his most useful attribute is his ability to bring reluctant people to Wolfe for interrogation.

Archie&#x27;s bedroom is one floor above Wolfe&#x27;s, and his room and board at the brownstone are part of his compensation. On several occasions, he makes it a point to note that he owns his bedroom furniture. Except for breakfast (which chef Fritz Brenner generally serves him in the kitchen), Archie takes his meals at Wolfe&#x27;s table, and has learned much about &quot;haute cuisine&quot; by listening to Wolfe and Fritz discuss food. While Archie has a cocktail on occasion, his beverage of choice is milk.

Archie has frequent reason to note that he needs at least eight hours&#x27; sleep each night, and prefers more. He reacts bitterly when his sleep is interrupted or otherwise shortened by events, such as late-night interrogations at Homicide headquarters or a precinct, or a 1:45 a.m. phone call from a client who has lost her keys, or driving a suspect to her home in Carmel and returning to Manhattan at 2:30 a.m.

Archie&#x27;s initial rough edges become smoother across the decades, much as American norms evolved over the years. Noting Archie&#x27;s colloquialisms in the first two Nero Wolfe novels, Rev. Frederick G. Gotwald wrote, &quot;The crudeness of these references makes me suspect that Stout uses them in Archie to show their ugliness because he uses them unapologetically.&quot; In the first Wolfe novel, Archie uses a racially biased term, for which Wolfe chides him, but by the time that &quot;A Right to Die&quot; was published in 1964, racial epithets were mostly used by Stout&#x27;s antagonistic characters.

Many reviewers and critics regard Archie Goodwin as the true protagonist of the Nero Wolfe corpus. Compared to Wolfe, Archie is the man of action, tough and street smart. His narrative style is breezy and vivid. Some commentators see this as a conscious device by Stout to fuse the hard school of Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s Sam Spade with the urbanity of Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot. But there is no doubt that Archie was an important addition to the genre of detective fiction. Previously, foils such as Dr. Watson or Arthur Hastings were employed as confidants and narrators, but none had such a fully developed personality or was such an integral part of the plot as Archie.

==Supporting characters==
===Household===
* Fritz Brenner – exceptionally talented Swiss cook who prepares and serves all of Wolfe&#x27;s meals except those that Wolfe occasionally takes at Rusterman&#x27;s Restaurant. Fritz also acts as the household&#x27;s majordomo and butler.
* Theodore Horstmann – orchid expert who assists Wolfe in the plant rooms.

===The &#x27;Teers===
* Saul Panzer – top-notch private detective who is frequently hired by Nero Wolfe either to assist Archie Goodwin, or to carry out assignments Wolfe prefers that Archie not know about. Archie often comments on Saul&#x27;s exceptional memory, especially his talent for recalling people&#x27;s faces.
* Fred Durkin – blue-collar investigator who is often hired for mundane tasks like surveillance.
* Orrie Cather – handsome, personable detective who thinks he would look just fine sitting at Archie&#x27;s desk.

===Law enforcement officials===
* Inspector Cramer – head of Homicide in Manhattan. In some of the stories it is implied that his authority extends to other NYC boroughs.
* Sergeant Purley Stebbins – assistant to Cramer.
* Lieutenant George Rowcliff – obnoxious police lieutenant (who has been known to stutter when frustrated by Goodwin). Plays an integral part in &quot;Please Pass the Guilt&quot;.
* Hombert – in some of the novels the New York police commissioner
* Skinner – New York County Manhattan District Attorney
* Mandelbaum (aka Mandel) – Manhattan Assistant District Attorney.
* Cleveland Archer – Westchester County district attorney
* Ben Dykes – head of Westchester County detectives
* Con Noonan – lieutenant with the New York State Police. He dislikes Wolfe and Goodwin and would lock them up on the feeblest excuse (see the novella &quot;Door to Death&quot;).

===Friends===
* Lon Cohen – of the &quot;New York Gazette,&quot; Archie&#x27;s pipeline to breaking crime news. Lon apparently has no official title at the &quot;Gazette&quot; but occupies a room just two doors down from the publisher&#x27;s corner office. Archie frequently asks Lon for background information on current or prospective clients, and returns those favors by providing Lon exclusives, and occasional photos, concerning Wolfe&#x27;s cases. Lon is also one of Archie&#x27;s poker-playing pals.
* Lily Rowan – heiress and socialite, often appears as Archie&#x27;s romantic companion, although both Lily and Archie are fiercely independent and have no intention of getting engaged or settling down. (It is implied that they enjoy an intimate, ongoing but nonexclusive relationship.) Lily was introduced in &quot;Some Buried Caesar&quot;, appears in several stories (and is mentioned in passing in others), and assists in a couple of cases.
* Marko Vukčić – A fellow Montenegrin whom Wolfe has known since childhood, possibly a blood relative (since &quot;vuk&quot; means &quot;wolf&quot;). Vukčić owns the high-class Rusterman&#x27;s Restaurant in Manhattan. According to &quot;In the Best Families&quot; (in which Wolfe gives him power of attorney), he is the only man in New York who calls Wolfe by his first name. Wolfe is executor of Vukčić&#x27;s will and, following Vukčić&#x27;s death, runs Rusterman&#x27;s as a trustee for &quot;a couple of years&quot;.
* Lewis Hewitt – well-heeled orchid fancier, for whom Wolfe did a favor (as told in &quot;Black Orchids&quot;). During a prolonged absence (&quot;In the Best Families&quot;), Wolfe sends his orchids to Hewitt for care. Wolfe occasionally asks professional favors of Hewitt (as in &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;), and Hewitt has sent at least one friend, Millard Bynoe, to ask Wolfe&#x27;s assistance (&quot;Easter Parade&quot;).
* Nathaniel Parker – Wolfe&#x27;s lawyer (or occasionally a client&#x27;s lawyer, on Wolfe&#x27;s recommendation) when only a lawyer will do. The character name evolved from &quot;Henry H. Barber&quot;; in &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Base&quot; (1952) the lawyer&#x27;s name is Nathaniel Parker, but in &quot;The Golden Spiders&quot; (1953) it&#x27;s Henry Parker, and then reverts to Nathaniel Parker for the rest of the series. Parker is an old friend, and has a broad scope of interests: e.g., Parker converses with Wolfe in French, in &quot;Immune to Murder&quot;.
* Doctor Vollmer – a medical doctor who is Wolfe&#x27;s neighbor and friend. Wolfe calls upon Vollmer whenever a dead body is discovered, or medical attention is required, at the brownstone. In &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;, Vollmer contrives an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be questioned or even seen by anyone. Vollmer examines Louis Rony&#x27;s corpse for Wolfe in &quot;The Second Confession&quot; and acts as a go-between for Cramer and Archie in &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;. Vollmer&#x27;s motivation, aside from friendship, is that Wolfe helped him out with a would-be blackmailer years ago. Vollmer&#x27;s house (or perhaps Wolfe&#x27;s) moves along 35th Street from time to time. In chapter 5 of &quot;Before Midnight&quot; the houses are said to be thirty yards apart; in chapter 6 of &quot;The Final Deduction&quot; the distance is sixty yards; and in chapter 2 of &quot;Disguise for Murder&quot; the distance is two hundred yards. &quot;Cordially Invited to Meet Death&quot; is less specific, placing the houses &quot;on the same block&quot;.
* Carla Lovchen – Wolfe&#x27;s adopted daughter, who appears in only two stories, &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; and &quot;The Black Mountain&quot;.

===Other associates===
* Bill Gore – freelance operative occasionally called in when Wolfe requires additional help in the field.
* Johnny Keems – freelance operative occasionally called in by Wolfe. He makes his last appearance in the novel &quot;Might as Well Be Dead&quot;.
* Theodolinda (Dol) Bonner and Sally Corbett (aka Sally Colt) – female operatives whom Wolfe employs at need. They also play a major role in the novella &quot;Too Many Detectives&quot;. Dol Bonner is the principal character in the novel &quot;The Hand in the Glove&quot;, which is an early example of a woman private detective as the protagonist of a mystery novel. Dol Bonner and her agency operatives appear in a few Wolfe mysteries in places where female operatives are required, such as &quot;The Mother Hunt&quot; (also one of the few stories where Wolfe has to flee his home to escape arrest).
* Del Bascom – independent investigator who runs a large conventional detective agency in Manhattan. Wolfe sometimes subcontracts to Bascom when he needs a lot of men for something (as in &quot;The Silent Speaker&quot;).
* Herb Aronson and Al Goller – friendly cabbies who make themselves available to Archie for mobile surveillance jobs.
* Ethelbert Hitchcock – Wolfe&#x27;s contact in London who handles enquiries to be made in Europe. Although he is usually identified by only his surname, in &quot;The Rubber Band&quot; (chapter 10) Archie refers to him as Ethelbert Hitchcock, &quot;which I consider the all-time low for a name for a snoop, even in England.&quot; Wolfe also identifies him by that full name when speaking to FBI investigator Stahl in &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; (chapter 15). Some years later, in &quot;The Black Mountain&quot; (chapter 4), it is Geoffrey Hitchcock who meets Wolfe and Archie at the airport.
* Felix Courbet – Part owner and manager of Rusterman&#x27;s Restaurant following the death of Marko Vukčić. Felix plays a major role in both &quot;Poison à la Carte&quot; and &quot;A Family Affair&quot;, in which his surname is changed to Mauer. In &quot;The Black Mountain&quot; his surname is Martin.

===Other authors of Nero Wolfe stories===
====Robert Goldsborough====
After the death of Rex Stout&#x27;s widow in October 1984, the Stout estate approved the continuation of the Nero Wolfe series. In 1986 journalist Robert Goldsborough published the first of seven Nero Wolfe mysteries issued by Bantam Books. Goldsborough&#x27;s approach was faithful to the Rex Stout works, but he added his own touches, including an updated frame of reference (Archie now uses a personal computer to file Wolfe&#x27;s germination records; Wolfe&#x27;s ancient elevator is finally replaced by a more efficient model; etc.). Goldsborough&#x27;s first effort, &quot;Murder in E Minor&quot;, was published in 1986. Goldsborough often drew on his own background in advertising, education and journalism for color and detail.
* 1986: &quot;Murder in E Minor&quot; – Wolfe comes out of self-imposed retirement to investigate the death of a boyhood friend, who became a famous symphony conductor.
* 1987: &quot;Death on Deadline&quot; – Wolfe intervenes when his favorite newspaper is about to be taken over by a muck-raking publisher.
* 1988: &quot;The Bloodied Ivy&quot; – Murder on the college campus, mingled with the attractions and pitfalls of having dedicated groupies as graduate students.
* 1989: &quot;The Last Coincidence&quot; – The fallout of the alleged date rape of Lily Rowan&#x27;s niece.
* 1990: &quot;Fade to Black&quot; – Dirty work at an advertising agency.
* 1992: &quot;Silver Spire&quot; – Behind-the-scenes intrigue at a successful televangelism ministry based in Staten Island.
* 1994: &quot;The Missing Chapter&quot; – In retrospect, the author&#x27;s explicit farewell to Nero Wolfe: the story concerns the murder of a mediocre continuator of a popular detective series.

Goldsborough resumed the series in 2012 with &quot;Archie Meets Nero Wolfe&quot;, a prequel to Stout&#x27;s novels. The books are published by the Mysterious Press.
* 2012: &quot;Archie Meets Nero Wolfe&quot; – A prequel imagining how Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin met and became a team.
* 2014: &quot;Murder in the Ballpark&quot; – Nero and Archie investigate the murder of a state senator at a baseball game at the Polo Grounds.
* 2015: &quot;Archie in the Crosshairs&quot;
* 2016: &quot;Stop the Presses!&quot;
* 2017: &quot;Murder, Stage Left&quot;
* 2018: &quot;The Battered Badge&quot;
* 2019: &quot;Death of an Art Collector&quot;
* 2020: &quot;Archie Goes Home&quot;
* 2021: &quot;Trouble at the Brownstone&quot;
* 2023: &quot;The Missing Heiress&quot;

====Other pastiches====
* Maurice Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Last Detective Story in the World&quot; (1946) is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche in which Nero Wolfe appears along with many other detectives and villains from crime fiction history. First printed in the May 1946 issue of the British magazine &quot;Liliput&quot;, the story was reprinted in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; (February 1947).
* Viola Brothers Shore wrote a parody titled &quot;A Case of Facsimile&quot; (1948) in which Nerissa Wolfe, Samantha Spade and Elsie Queen assist Shirley Holmes in solving a mystery. The story appeared in the October 1948 issue of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.
* Thomas Narcejac included a pastiche of Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero Wolfe titled &quot;The Red Orchid&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;orchidee rouge&quot;) in his collection &quot;Faux et usage de Faux&quot; (Librairie des Champs-Elysées 1952). The story was translated by Lawrence G. Blochman for the January 1961 issue of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.
* Marion Mainwaring&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Murder in Pastiche&quot; parodies nine famous fictional detectives, including Nero Wolfe (as &quot;Trajan Beare&quot;).
* Randall Garrett&#x27;s Lord Darcy novel &quot;Too Many Magicians&quot; (1966) includes an appearance by the Marquis of London, a fat genius who looks and talks like Nero Wolfe, never leaves home, and is intensely interested in his hybridized plants. He has an assistant, Lord Bontriomphe (a literal French translation of &quot;Goodwin&quot;), who is first seen examining an exhibition of plants (like Archie in &quot;Black Orchids&quot;), and a cook corresponding to Fritz Brenner. The title pays homage to that of many Nero Wolfe stories, from &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; (1938) to &quot;Too Many Clients&quot; (1960).
* Lawrence Block&#x27;s &quot;Make Out with Murder&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Topless Tulip Caper&quot; (1975) are tongue-in-cheek mystery novels in which wisecracking narrator Chip Harrison is assistant to Leo Haig, a fat detective who explicitly emulates Nero Wolfe (raising tropical fish instead of orchids in his Manhattan brownstone). Block revisited the characters in &quot;As Dark as Christmas Gets&quot; (1997), a short story commissioned by Otto Penzler and collected in &quot;Christmas at The Mysterious Bookshop&quot; (2010).
* Julian Symons&#x27;s &quot;Great Detectives: Seven Original Investigations&quot; (1981) includes his story &quot;In Which Archie Goodwin Remembers&quot;. The author&#x27;s interview with Archie Goodwin in retirement is illustrated by Tom Adams.
* John Lescroart places numerous clues in his novels &quot;Son of Holmes&quot; (1986) and &quot;Rasputin&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1987) to suggest that the main character, Auguste Lupa (the son of Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler), later becomes Nero Wolfe.
* William L. DeAndrea&#x27;s &quot;Written in Fire&quot; (1995), a historical mystery set in the Old West, features frontier lawman Lewis &quot;Lobo&quot; Blacke. Confined to a wheelchair after he is shot in the back, Blacke takes over a newspaper and is assisted by reporter Quinn Booker, who becomes his biographer. DeAndrea completed a sequel, &quot;Fatal Elixir&quot; (1997), published posthumously.
* Loren D. Estleman created the rotund amateur detective Claudius Lyon, who is so obsessed with Nero Wolfe&#x27;s style of life that he duplicates it with just enough of a difference that his idol will not be entitled to take legal action. Ex-con Arnie Woodbine narrates the comic stories (printed in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;), which include &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Nero Wolfe?&quot; (June 2008), &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolfe&quot; (September–October 2008) and &quot;Wolfe at the Door&quot; (February 2009).
* Dave Duncan wrote the &quot;Venice Trilogy&quot; (2007–2009), starring the legendary clairvoyant, astrologer, and physician Maestro Nostradamus, who solves mysteries for the rulers of Venice, Italy while never leaving his apartments. Instead he sends the young swordsman Alfeo Zeno on various investigative tasks around the city, seeking clues, arranging interviews, and generally stirring up trouble until something happens. Nostradamus holds a similar disdain for women, and Alfeo&#x27;s primary romantic partner is a highly-ranked courtesan, similar in station to Lily Rowan (an independent socialite).
* David Langford wrote the short story &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; for the Midnight Rose anthology &quot;EuroTemps&quot; (1992), featuring the Wolfe pastiche Caligula Foxe, a London-based detective in a world where some people have paranormal abilities, although Foxe is offended by any suggestion his own deductive skills might qualify as such. Like Wolfe, Foxe seldom leaves his home (an &quot;old house in Westbourne Terrace&quot;) and is prone to &quot;relapses&quot;. He cultivates paranormal saprophytes. The story is narrated by his legman Charlie Goodman, and other characters include their chef Franz, fellow detectives Paul Sanza, Terry Carver and Sally Cole, and Government official Mr Cream (a near-anagram of Cramer). In the collection of Langford pastiches &quot;He Do the Time Police in Different Voices&quot;, &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; is credited to &quot;R*x St**t&quot;.
* Gene Wolfe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Rubber Bend&quot; (originally published in &quot;Universe 5&quot;, edited by Terry Carr; later reprinted in the Wolfe collection &quot;Storeys from the Old Hotel&quot;) is a pastiche of both Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe stories. A robot named &quot;Noel Wide&quot; stands in for Wolfe; his companion, another robot, is named &quot;Arch St. Louis&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
After the publication of &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; in 1934, several Hollywood studios were interested in the movie rights. In one of many conversations with his authorized biographer, Rex Stout told John McAleer that he himself had wanted Charles Laughton to play Nero Wolfe:

:I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all the actors I have seen, I think he would have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture producer (I forget who) asked him to do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.

In 1974 McAleer interviewed Laughton&#x27;s widow, Elsa Lanchester. &quot;I seem to remember Charles being very interested in the character of Nero Wolfe,&quot; she told him. &quot;I always regretted I did not get to play Dora Chapin.&quot;

&quot;When Columbia pictures bought the screen rights to &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; for $7,500 and secured the option to buy further stories in the series, it was thought the role would go to Walter Connolly. Instead Edward Arnold got it&quot;, McAleer reported in &quot;Rex Stout: A Biography&quot;. &quot;Columbia&#x27;s idea was to keep Arnold busy with low-cost Wolfe films between features. Two films presently were made by Columbia, &quot;Meet Nero Wolfe (Fer-de-Lance)&quot; and &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot;. Connolly did portray Wolfe in the latter film, after Arnold decided he did not want to become identified in the public mind with one part. Lionel Stander portrayed Archie Goodwin. Stander was a capable actor but, as Archie, Rex thought he had been miscast.&quot;

====&quot;Meet Nero Wolfe&quot;====

Columbia Pictures adapted the first Nero Wolfe novel, &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;, for the screen in 1936. &quot;Meet Nero Wolfe&quot; was directed by Herbert Biberman, and featured a cast led by Edward Arnold as Nero Wolfe, and Lionel Stander as Archie Goodwin. A young Rita Hayworth (then Rita Cansino) portrays Maria Maringola, who sets the story in motion when she asks for Wolfe&#x27;s help in finding her missing brother, Carlo.

&quot;&quot;Meet Nero Wolfe&quot; is an above average minor A picture, a solid mystery, and unfailingly entertaining&quot;, reported &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; magazine in 2002 when it revisited the film. &quot;No, at bottom, it&#x27;s not Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero and Archie, but it&#x27;s a well-developed mystery (thanks to Stout&#x27;s plot) with compensations all its own—and an interesting piece of Wolfeana.&quot;

====&quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot;====

In 1937, Columbia Pictures released &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot;, its adaptation of the second Nero Wolfe novel. Lionel Stander reprised his role as Archie Goodwin, and Walter Connolly took over the role of Nero Wolfe.

&quot;He drinks beer in the novel but hot chocolate in the picture. That&#x27;s the best explanation of what&#x27;s wrong with the film&quot;, wrote &quot;Variety&quot; (June 16, 1937).

After &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot;, Rex Stout declined to authorize any more Hollywood adaptations. &quot;Do you think there&#x27;s any chance of Hollywood ever making a good Nero Wolfe movie?&quot; biographer John McAleer asked the author. Stout replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I suppose so.&quot;

===Radio===

Nero Wolfe has been portrayed in four radio drama series on five different networks.

====&quot;The Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot; (ABC)====

Three actors portrayed Nero Wolfe over the course of the 1943–44 radio series, &quot;The Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot;. J. B. Williams starred in its first incarnation (April 10 – June 26, 1943) on the regional New England Network. Santos Ortega assumed the role when the suspense drama moved to ABC (July 5 – September 27, 1943; January 21 – July 14, 1944). Luis Van Rooten succeeded Ortega sometime in 1944. Louis Vittes wrote most of the scripts for the 30-minute episodes, basing none of them on Stout&#x27;s original stories.

Only one episode of the series is in circulation. &quot;The Last Laugh Murder Case&quot; (July 14, 1944) was chosen for rebroadcast by the Armed Forces Radio Service&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Playhouse&quot; series.

====&quot;The Amazing Nero Wolfe&quot; (MBS)====

Francis X. Bushman starred in &quot;The Amazing Nero Wolfe&quot;, a 1945 radio drama series on the Mutual Broadcasting System. Broadcast July 17 – November 30, 1945, the series was a product of the Don Lee Network, a California affiliate, and may have been broadcast only in that region. 
Louis Vittes wrote the scripts for the 30-minute program, based on Stout&#x27;s principal characters but not his stories.

Although 21 episodes were produced, the series finale, &quot;The Case of the Shakespeare Folio&quot;, is the only episode that has survived in radio collections.

====&quot;The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot; (NBC)====

Sydney Greenstreet starred in &quot;The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot;, a 1950–51 series that aired on NBC October 20, 1950 – April 27, 1951. Produced by Edwin Fadiman and directed by J. Donald Wilson, the show was written by Alfred Bester.

Biographer John McAleer reported that Stout enjoyed Greenstreet&#x27;s portrayal. &quot;The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot; was the first radio series that, like the Stout stories themselves, stressed characterization over plot. With all but one episode in circulation, it is regarded as the series that is most responsible for popularizing Nero Wolfe on radio.

====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (CBC)====

Mavor Moore starred in the 1982 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation series &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, broadcast January 16 – April 10, 1982. Don Francks portrayed Archie Goodwin, and Cec Linder played Inspector Cramer. The series was produced and directed by actor Ron Hartmann, who spent two years writing the hour-long radio adaptations of Stout&#x27;s original stories. The 13 episode series was praised for its high production values and faithful presentation.

====&quot;The Boy who Cried Wolfe&quot;====
The Post Meridian Radio Players, a radio theater troupe in Boston, presented a gender-swapped staged radio drama titled &quot;The Boy who Cried Wolfe&quot; July 20–28, 2018. An adaptation of a December 1950 episode of the NBC radio series, the production changed the genders of all of the characters; Nero Wolfe became Vera Wolfe, and Archie became Audrey Goodwin. The piece was performed along with an Arsene Lupin story and an adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Final Problem&quot; as part of the troupe&#x27;s summer mystery series, &quot;Moriarty&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;.

===Television===
====&quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;The Fine Art of Murder&quot; (ABC)====
Rex Stout appeared in the December 9, 1956, episode of &quot;Omnibus&quot;, a cultural anthology series that epitomized the golden age of television. Hosted by Alistair Cooke and directed by Paul Bogart, &quot;The Fine Art of Murder&quot; was a 40-minute segment described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;a homicide as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allan Poe [and] Rex Stout would variously present it&quot;. The author is credited as appearing along with Gene Reynolds (Archie Goodwin), Robert Eckles (Nero Wolfe), James Daly (narrator), Dennis Hoey (Arthur Conan Doyle), Felix Munro (Edgar Allan Poe), Herbert Voland (M. Dupin) and Jack Sydow. Writer Sidney Carroll received the 1957 Edgar Award for Best Episode in a TV Series. &quot;The Fine Art of Murder&quot; is in the collection of the Library of Congress (VBE 2397–2398) and screened in its Mary Pickford Theater February 15, 2000.

====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (CBS)====

On September 15, 1949, Rex Stout wrote a confidential memo to Edwin Fadiman, who represented his radio, film and television interests. The memo provided detailed character descriptions of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, and a physical description and diagram of Wolfe&#x27;s office. Stout&#x27;s biographer John McAleer inferred the memo was guidance for the NBC Nero Wolfe radio series that began in October 1950, but in summarizing the memo&#x27;s unique revelations he remarked, &quot;A TV producer could not have hoped for more specifics.&quot;

On October 22, 1949, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Fadiman Associates was packaging a television series featuring Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero Wolfe characters. When CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; went into production, Stout received some 50 offers from film and TV producers hoping to follow up on its success with a Nero Wolfe series. By April 1957 CBS had purchased the rights and was pitching a Nero Wolfe TV series to advertisers. The series had Stout&#x27;s enthusiastic cooperation.

In March 1959, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Kurt Kasznar and William Shatner would portray Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin in the CBS-TV series. Both actors were then starring on Broadway—the Vienna-born Kasznar in Noel Coward&#x27;s &quot;Look After Lulu!&quot; and Shatner in &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;.

&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; was co-produced by Gordon Duff and Otis L. Guernsey, Jr., with Edwin Fadiman as executive producer. The theme music was composed by Alex North.

The pilot episode, &quot;Count the Man Down&quot;, written by Sidney Carroll and directed by Tom Donovan, was filmed in Manhattan in March 1959. The half-hour program concerned the mysterious death of a scientist during a guided missile launch at Cape Canaveral. Guest stars include Alexander Scourby (Mr. Belson), Phyllis Hill (Leslie Gear), George Voskovec (Dr. Wohlgang), Eva Seregni (Mrs. Lowenberg), Frank Marth (Ernest Petchen), John McLiam (Professor Adams), John C. Becher (Mr. Faversham), Eileen Fulton (Receptionist), and Rene Paul (Christian Lowenberg).

The series was to air Mondays at 10 p.m. ET beginning in September 1959. But in April, CBS announced that the new comedy series &quot;Hennesey&quot; would occupy the time slot.

In June 1959, &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; critic Donald Kirkley reported that the &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; pilot had been &quot;in a way, too successful ... Everything seemed to point to a sale of the series. A facsimile of the brownstone house in which Wolfe lives in the novels ... was found in Grammercy Square. But when the film was made and shown around, it was considered too good to be confined to half an hour.&quot; In October 1960, William Shatner was reportedly still working to sell the first television adaptation of Nero Wolfe to the networks.

The 1959 &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; pilot episode was released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2018 by VCI Entertainment, in &quot;Television&#x27;s Lost Classics: Volume 2&quot;. The four rare pilots on the release were digitally restored in high definition by SabuCat Productions from the best archival film elements available.

====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (Paramount Television)====
In an interview May 27, 1967, Rex Stout told author Dick Lochte that Orson Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and Stout had turned him down. Disappointed with the Nero Wolfe movies of the 1930s, Stout was leery of Nero Wolfe film and TV projects in America during his lifetime: &quot;That&#x27;s something my heirs can fool around with, if they&#x27;ve a mind to&quot;, he said. In 1976, a year after Stout&#x27;s death, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Paramount paid $200,000 for the TV rights to eight hours of Nero Wolfe. The producers planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script (&quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;) and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. Thayer David was cast as Wolfe in the 1977 TV movie.

In March 1980, Paramount was planning a weekly NBC-TV series as a starring vehicle for Welles; Leon Tokatyan (&quot;Lou Grant&quot;) was to write the pilot. Welles again declined because he wanted to do a series of 90-minute specials, perhaps two or three a year, instead of a weekly series. William Conrad was cast as Wolfe in the 1981 TV series.

=====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (1977)=====

In 1977, Paramount Television filmed &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, an adaptation of Stout&#x27;s novel &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;. Thayer David and Tom Mason starred as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin; Anne Baxter costarred as Mrs. Rachel Bruner. Written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, the made-for-TV movie was produced as a pilot for a possible upcoming series—but the film had not yet aired at the time of Thayer David&#x27;s death in July 1978. &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; was finally broadcast December 18, 1979, as an ABC-TV late show.

=====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (1981)=====

Paramount Television remounted &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; as a weekly one-hour series that ran on NBC TV from January through August 1981. The project was recast with William Conrad stepping into the role of Nero Wolfe and Lee Horsley portraying Archie Goodwin. Although it was titled &quot;Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero Wolfe&quot;, the production departed considerably from the originals. All 14 episodes were set in contemporary New York City.

====&quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (A&amp;E Network)====

Independent producer Michael Jaffe&#x27;s efforts to secure the rights to the Nero Wolfe stories date back to his earliest days in the business. In the mid-1970s he was working with his father, Henry Jaffe, a successful attorney turned producer, when the Nero Wolfe rights came on the market. Warner Bros. wanted to adapt the Zeck trilogy for a feature film and approached Henry Jaffe, who traveled to New York to negotiate with the agent for Rex Stout&#x27;s estate but lost out to Paramount Television.

&quot;We finally got this opportunity&quot;, said Michael Jaffe. &quot;I had chased the rights numerous times. One of the reasons that I never actually tried to make it as a series was that I didn&#x27;t believe a network would ever let us make it the right way. Then A&amp;E came along, and Allen Sabinson. I&#x27;ve known him for years and years. He swore he&#x27;d let me make it the right way.

In March 2000, Maury Chaykin (as Nero Wolfe) and Timothy Hutton (as Archie Goodwin) starred in &quot;The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot;, a Jaffe/Braunstein Films co-production with the A&amp;E Network. High ratings led to the original series, &quot;A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot; (2001–2002), most often called &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;.

Hutton served as an executive producer and directed four telefilms. &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; adapted the plots and dialogue of the Stout originals closely; unlike previous Wolfe adaptations, the series retained Archie Goodwin&#x27;s first-person narration and did not update the stories to contemporary times. The episodes were colorful period pieces, set primarily in the 1940s–1950s. The production values were exceptional and critics responded favorably.

Other members of the principal cast were Colin Fox (Fritz Brenner), Conrad Dunn (Saul Panzer), Fulvio Cecere (Fred Durkin), Trent McMullen (Orrie Cather), Saul Rubinek (Lon Cohen), Bill Smitrovich (Inspector Cramer) and R.D. Reid (Sergeant Purley Stebbins). In a practice reminiscent of the mystery movie series of the 1930s and 1940s, the show rarely used guest stars in the roles of victims, killers and suspects, but instead used the same ensemble of supporting actors each week. An actor who had been &quot;killed off&quot; in one show might portray the murderer in the next. Actress Kari Matchett was a member of this repertory group while also having a recurring role in the series as Archie Goodwin&#x27;s girlfriend Lily Rowan; other frequent members of the troupe included Nicky Guadagni, Debra Monk, George Plimpton, Ron Rifkin, Francie Swift, and James Tolkan.

Production of &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; coincided with Rex Stout&#x27;s becoming a top-selling author some 30 years after his death. A&amp;E released the series on Region 1 DVD as two sets (&quot;The Golden Spiders&quot; bundled with the second season), and as a single eight-disc thinpack set.

====International productions====
=====German TV miniseries (1961)=====
A German TV adaption of &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;—&quot;Zu viele Köche&quot; (1961)—starred Heinz Klevenow as Nero Wolfe, and Joachim Fuchsberger as Archie Goodwin. After he protested that his story was used without permission, Rex Stout received a $3,500 settlement.

=====Italian TV series (1969–1971)=====
&quot;The name Nero Wolfe has magic in Italy,&quot; wrote Rex Stout&#x27;s biographer John McAleer. In 1968, the Italian television network RAI paid Stout $80,000 for the rights to produce 12 Nero Wolfe stories. &quot;He agreed only because he would never see them,&quot; McAleer wrote.

From February 1969 to February 1971, Italian television broadcast 10 Nero Wolfe TV movies. These are the episodes in order of appearance:

# &quot;Veleno in sartoria&quot; (&quot;The Red Box&quot;)
# &quot;Circuito chiuso&quot; (&quot;If Death Ever Slept&quot;)
# &quot;Per la fama di Cesare&quot; (&quot;Some Buried Caesar&quot;)
# &quot;Il Pesce più grosso&quot; (&quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;)
# &quot;Un incidente di caccia&quot; (&quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot;)
# &quot;Il patto dei sei&quot; (&quot;The Rubber Band&quot;)
# &quot;La casa degli attori&quot; (&quot;Counterfeit for Murder&quot;)
# &quot;La bella bugiarda&quot; (&quot;Murder Is Corny&quot;)
# &quot;Sfida al cioccolato&quot; (&quot;Gambit&quot;)
# &quot;Salsicce &#x27;Mezzanotte&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;)

&quot;In the Best Families&quot; and &quot;The Final Deduction&quot; were among the titles for which RAI also bought the rights, but were not filmed.

&quot;For audiences who might not be familiar with Wolfe and his trusty assistant Archie Goodwin, it&#x27;s a terrific introduction to the characters and the milieu&quot;, wrote the &quot;Saint Paul Pioneer Press&quot;.

The stage production was authorized by the estate of Rex Stout; Stout&#x27;s daughter, Rebecca Stout Bradbury, attended the opening. &quot;It&#x27;s something of a surprise that none of the Wolfe novels have been adapted for the stage before&quot;, wrote the &quot;Twin Cities Daily Planet&quot;. &quot;If &quot;The Red Box&quot; is any indication, many more will be.&quot;

<text>Edlingham Castle is a small castle ruin, having scheduled monument and Grade I listed building status, in the care of English Heritage. It is located in a valley to the west of Alnwick, Northumberland, England. It has been described as &quot;...one of the most interesting in the county&quot;, by Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian. Edlingham itself is little more than a hamlet with a church alongside the castle.

The ruins are mostly laid low, though much of the solar tower still stands despite an impressive crack running several storeys down to ground level. The foundations and part of the walls of the hall house, gatehouse, barbican and other courtyard buildings are still visible, most dating from the 16th century.

The castle – more properly a fortified manor house typical of many medieval houses in the North of England – guards one of the few approaches to Alnwick through the hills to its west. Its fortifications were increased in response to the border warfare which raged between England and Scotland in the period from about 1300 to 1600.

==History==

By 1174, a John of Edlingham owned a manor house at this location. In 1294, a descendant, Walter of Edlingham, sold it to William de Felton. He strengthened it by building strong ramparts and a gatehouse, fortifying the main hall, and adding other buildings inside a courtyard. In 1396 Elizabeth de Felton inherited it, marrying Sir Edmund Hastings, who added a strong solar tower. Their descendants occupied the castle and estate until 1514. It was purchased by George Swinburne, a constable of Prudhoe, whose family held it until the 18th century.

During this time it gradually fell into disrepair, with most of the buildings dismantled in the 1660s to build nearby farmhouses, but leaving the solar tower intact. In 1978 the Department for the Environment acquired the site and conducted extensive archaeological excavations, prior to which rubble filled the solar tower to a height of three metres.

The site is now in the care of English Heritage and is easily accessible from the nearby church of St John the Baptist, Edlingham. William de Felton is buried there. An interpretation board is on-site, while more detailed leaflets are available from the church for a small donation.

On the Broadway stage he earned Tony Awards—the first for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his Broadway debut role in &quot;Comedians&quot; (1977), the second for Best Actor in a Musical for the Broadway transfer of the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1991).

Pryce&#x27;s theatre work led to several supporting roles in film and television. His breakthrough screen performance was in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s satirical dystopian black comedy film &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). Critically lauded for his versatility, Pryce has appeared in big-budget films including &quot;Evita&quot; (1996), &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997) and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series (2003–2007), as well as independent films such as the film adaptation of the David Mamet play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992), Martin Scorsese&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), Christopher Hampton&#x27;s &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995), Terrence Malick&#x27;s historical film &quot;The New World&quot; (2005) and the drama &quot;The Wife&quot; (2017) opposite Glenn Close. In 2019, he earned his first Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Pope Francis in &quot;The Two Popes&quot; alongside Anthony Hopkins playing Pope Benedict XVI.

For his work on television, he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performances in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; (1993) and &quot;Return to Cranford&quot; (2010). Pryce has gained acclaim for his roles as Thomas Wolsey in the BBC limited series &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2015), the High Sparrow in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; (2015–2016) and Sir Stuart Strange in the series &quot;Taboo&quot; (2017). In 2022, he succeeded Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip in the final two seasons of the award-winning Netflix historical drama series &quot;The Crown&quot;, gaining nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor. Since 2022, he appears as David Cartwright in &quot;Slow Horses&quot;.

==Early life==
Pryce was born John Price on 1 June 1947 in Carmel, Flintshire, the son of Margaret Ellen (née Williams) and Isaac Price, a former coal miner who ran a small general grocery shop with his wife. He has two older sisters and was raised a Welsh Presbyterian. He was educated at Holywell Grammar School, and at the age of 16, went to art college before he started training to be a teacher at Edge Hill College (now Edge Hill University) in Ormskirk, Lancashire. While studying, he took part in a college theatre production and applied to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Pryce was subsequently awarded a scholarship to RADA, graduating in 1971, with Acting (RADA Diploma).

He joined Equity, and took &quot;Jonathan Pryce&quot; as his stage name because his birth name was too similar to that of a performer already represented by Equity. While at RADA, he worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings.

==Career==
===1972–1984: Rise to prominence ===
Despite finding RADA &quot;strait-laced&quot; and being told by his tutor that he could never aspire to do more than playing villains on &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, Pryce joined the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool upon graduation and eventually became its artistic director. He performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Nottingham Playhouse. To gain his Equity card, he made his first screen appearance in a minor role in &quot;Fire &amp; Brimstone&quot;, a 1972 episode of the science fiction drama series &quot;Doomwatch&quot;. He then starred in two television films directed by Stephen Frears: &quot;Daft as a Brush&quot; and &quot;Playthings&quot;.

After leaving Everyman, Pryce joined Sir Richard Eyre at the Nottingham Playhouse and starred in Trevor Griffiths&#x27; play &quot;Comedians&quot;, in a role specially written for him. The production moved to the Old Vic Theatre in London. Pryce reprised the role on Broadway in 1976, this time directed by Mike Nichols, and for which Pryce won the 1977 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. It was around this time that he appeared in his first film role, playing the character Joseph Manasse in the drama &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, starring Faye Dunaway. He did not, however, abandon the stage, appearing from 1978 to 1979 in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s productions of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; as Petruchio, and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; as Octavius Caesar.

In 1980, his performance in the title role of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre won him an Olivier Award, and was acclaimed by some critics as the definitive Hamlet of his generation. That year, Pryce had a small but pivotal role as Zarniwoop in the 12th episode of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; radio series, one that he reprised for the &quot;Quintessential Phase&quot; which was broadcast in 2005. In his original role as Zarniwoop, Pryce&#x27;s character questions the &quot;ruler of the Universe&quot;, a solipsist who has been chosen to rule arguably because of either his inherent manipulability, or immunity therefrom, on his philosophical opinions. Around the same time, in 1980, he also appeared in the film &quot;Breaking Glass&quot;. In 1983, Pryce played the role of the sinister Mr Dark in &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, based on the Ray Bradbury novel of the same title. Afterward, he began appearing mostly in films, such as the Ian McEwan-scripted &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Lunch&quot;, and &quot;Martin Luther, Heretic&quot; (both also 1983).

=== 1985–2002: Established actor ===
He achieved a breakthrough with his role as the subdued protagonist Sam Lowry in the Terry Gilliam science fiction dystopian dark comedy, &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). After &quot;Brazil&quot;, Pryce appeared in the historical thriller &quot;The Doctor and the Devils&quot; (also 1985) and then in the Gene Wilder-directed film &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot; (1986). During this period of his life, Pryce continued to perform on stage, and gained particular notice as the successful but self-doubting writer Trigorin in a London production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; in late 1985. From 1986 to 1987 Pryce played the lead part in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which also starred Sinéad Cusack as Lady Macbeth. Pryce worked once again with Gilliam in &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), playing &quot;The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson&quot;. The film was a notorious financial fiasco, with production costing more than $40 million, when the original budget was $23.5 million. The following year Pryce appeared in three of the earliest episodes of the improvisation show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, alongside Paul Merton and John Sessions, and in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, again a play by Chekhov, at the Vaudeville Theatre. After a series of major dramatic roles on stage, including Vanya and Macbeth, Pryce decided he wanted to do musicals after seeing his friend Patti LuPone in the original London production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

He successfully returned to the stage originating the role of The Engineer, a Eurasian pimp, in the West End musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;. His performance was praised in England where he won the Olivier and Variety Club awards, but when the production transferred to Broadway the Actors&#x27; Equity Association (AEA) tried to stop Pryce from portraying The Engineer because, according to their executive secretary, &quot;[t]he casting of a Caucasian actor made up to appear Asian is an affront to the Asian community.&quot; The London production featured Pryce in yellowface, wearing prosthetics to alter the shape of his eyes and makeup to alter the colour of his skin. The show&#x27;s producer, Cameron Mackintosh, decided to cancel the $10 million New York production. Realising that its decision would result in the loss of many jobs, and after Pryce received much support from fellow actors (both Charlton Heston and John Malkovich threatened to leave the union if Pryce was not allowed to perform) the AEA decided to make a deal with Mackintosh, allowing Pryce to appear in the production. He won a Tony Award for his performance in 1991. The controversy over Pryce&#x27;s casting in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; provided playwright David Henry Hwang the inspiration for his plays &quot;Face Value&quot; and &quot;Yellow Face&quot;.

Made in the same period, Pryce starred in the ITV mini-series &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1991) as Gerd Heidemann. Pryce returned to the London stage the following year to star for one night only at the Royal Festival Hall for an AIDS charity alongside Elaine Paige and Lilliane Montivecchi in the 1992 revival of the Federico Fellini-inspired musical &quot;Nine&quot;. Pryce featured, alongside Kathy Burke and Minnie Driver, in the BBC serial &quot;Mr. Wroe&#x27;s Virgins&quot; (1993), directed by Danny Boyle. Pryce played Henry Kravis in the HBO produced made-for-TV movie &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; (1993). He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and for a Golden Globe Award for his role. Also during 1993, Pryce starred alongside River Phoenix and Judy Davis in the unfinished film &quot;Dark Blood&quot;, but production had to be shut down when, 11 days short of completion, Phoenix died from a drug overdose. Director George Sluizer, who owns the rights to what has been filmed, has made available some of the raw material, which features Pryce and Phoenix on a field in Utah, on his personal website. Between 1993 and 1997, Pryce, on a multimillion-dollar contract became the spokesman for the Infiniti automobile marque in a series of American television commercials, in particular for the Infiniti J30 and Infiniti Q45. In one of these advertisements Pryce appeared alongside jazz singer Nancy Wilson in a Prague nightclub. In 1994, Pryce portrayed Fagin in a revival of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and starred alongside Emma Thompson in the film &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995), which centres on a platonic relationship between gay writer Lytton Strachey and painter Dora Carrington. For his portrayal of Strachey, Pryce received the Best Actor Award at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.
During the early 2000s Pryce starred and participated in a variety of movies, such as &quot;The Affair of the Necklace&quot; (2001), and &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; (2002). While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show&#x27;s run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. On her first night, Pryce introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying &quot;This will be your first Eliza, my second today and my third this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available.&quot; Pryce performed with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. The show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, and McCutcheon won in her category.

=== 2003–2013: Theatre and franchise roles ===
In April 2003 Pryce returned to the non-musical stage with &quot;A Reckoning&quot;, written by American dramatist Wesley Moore. The play co-starred Flora Montgomery and after premiering at the Soho Theatre in London was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;one of the most powerful and provocative new American plays to have opened since David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot;.&quot; Pryce had a role in live-action Disney Studios action-adventure film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), in which he portrayed a fictional Governor of Jamaica, Weatherby Swann, a film he has described as &quot;one of those why-not movies.&quot; Pryce portrayed Governor Weatherby Swann the father of Elizabeth Swan portrayed by Keira Knightley. He reprised the role of Governor Weatherby Swann for the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; sequels, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006) and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007). Both were filmed at the same time but released a year apart.

After &quot;Pirates&quot;, Pryce appeared in several large-scale motion pictures, such as the romantic teen comedy &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (2003), and &quot;De-Lovely&quot; (2004), his second musical film, a chronicle of the life of songwriter Cole Porter, for which Kevin Kline and Pryce covered a Porter song called &quot;Blow, Gabriel, Blow&quot;. &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; (2005), Pryce&#x27;s third completed film with Terry Gilliam, starred Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, and &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), in which he had a cameo role as King James I. In 2005, Pryce was nominated for another Olivier Award in the best actor category for his role in the 2004 London production of &quot;The Goat or Who is Sylvia?&quot;, where he played Martin, a goat-lover who has to face the recriminations of his cheated-on wife, played by his real-life wife Kate Fahy. Pryce&#x27;s performance was highly praised, but he lost the Olivier to Richard Griffiths.

Pryce lent his voice to the French animated film, &quot;Renaissance&quot; (2006), which he stated he wanted to do because he had never &quot;done anything quite like it before.&quot; Pryce returned to the Broadway stage replacing John Lithgow, from January to July 2006, as Lawrence Jameson in the musical version of &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;. During early 2007, the BBC serial &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars&quot; was first broadcast with Pryce in the lead. From September 2007 through June 2008, he returned to the theatre portraying Shelly Levene in a new West End production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; at the Apollo Theatre, London. Pryce also appeared as part of an ensemble cast in the 2008 real-time strategy video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot;, playing the role of Marshall Robert Bingham alongside Tim Curry, J.K. Simmons, George Takei and several other veteran actors.

=== 2015–present: Resurgence and acclaim ===

In 2015, he joined the cast of the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Season 5 as the High Sparrow. Pryce admitted that one of the main reasons he took on the role was because of how influential the character is plot-wise. While initially being quite sceptical about &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; shows, Pryce later had a change of heart after his positive experiences on the &quot;Thrones&quot; sets. In 2015, he also appeared at The Globe Theatre as Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. His real life daughter Phoebe played Shylock&#x27;s daughter Jessica. In 2015, he joined the cast of &quot;The Healer&quot; starring with Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Camilla Luddington, and Jorge Garcia. In 2018 he portrayed Don Quixote in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot; starring Adam Driver.

In 2018, Pryce starred alongside Dame Eileen Atkins in Florian Zeller&#x27;s play, &quot;The Height of the Storm&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in the West End to rapturous reviews. The play was named best play of the year by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The play was transferred to Broadway stage where it ran from September to November 2019 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club with Pryce and Atkins reprising their performances. The play and the performances received a strong reception from New York critics. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the leading actors describing Pryce&#x27;s performance as an elderly man struggling with early forms of dementia as &quot;achingly sensitive&quot;, and like &quot;quicksilver&quot;.

Late that same year, Pryce portrayed Pope Francis, opposite Anthony Hopkins playing Pope Benedict XVI, in the acclaimed Netflix film &quot;The Two Popes&quot;, directed by Fernando Meirelles, which was released that winter on Netflix. Meirelles cast him for his striking resemblance to the real Pope Francis. The film and their performances received critical acclaim, with Stephen Farber of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praising their chemistry, writing in particular of Pryce, &quot;[He] goes head-to-head against Hopkins and matches him in subtlety as well as charismatic force.&quot; He received his first ever Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for the film. In August 2020, it was announced that Pryce would portray Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in the final two seasons of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Crown&quot;. His performance in the fifth season earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series – Comedy/Musical or Drama.

==Personal life==
Pryce has been married twice. While working at the Everyman Theatre in 1972, Pryce met actress Kate Fahy; after a decades-long relationship, they married in 2015. They live in London and have three children. Pryce was raised in the Presbyterian Church of Wales but is no longer religious.

In 2006, Pryce was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool. He is a fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama and a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours.

Pryce was knighted in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

<doc id="144366" wikidata="Q4589170" url="?curid=144366" title="Irv Rubin">
<text>Irving David Rubin (April 12, 1945 – November 13, 2002) was a Canadian-born American political and religious activist who served as chairman of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) from 1985 to 2002. He committed suicide in jail when awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to bomb private and government property.

==Early life and activism==
Rubin was born in Montreal, Quebec. He and his parents and sister moved to Granada Hills, California, a neighbourhood of Los Angeles, which has a large Jewish population. He became a United States citizen and served as a sergeant in the United States Air Force. He was a staunch supporter of the right to keep and bear arms.

In 1978, Rubin offered a $500 bounty to anyone who would wound or kill a member of the American Nazi Party. Indicted on solicitation of murder charges, he was acquitted in 1981.

==Jewish Defense League activism==
Rubin became the successor to JDL founder Rabbi Meir Kahane, after Kahane moved to Israel in 1985 and formed the Kach Party, which was eventually outlawed by the Israeli government as racist.

In 1985, it was reported that Rubin said about the bombing of the home of historian and Holocaust denier Dr. George Ashley, &quot;It&#x27;s too bad that Mr. Ashley wasn&#x27;t blown up&quot; and &quot;I applaud those who took such actions. I think these people have a righteous place in the world.&quot; Moderate Jews also criticized him. Rob Eshman, the Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles&quot; commented: &quot;In the solar system of Jewish life, Irv Rubin is Pluto&quot;, and asserted &quot;Here in Los Angeles, for years now Rubin has been escorted out of far more Jewish events than he&#x27;s ever been invited in to.&quot;

In 1985, Alex Odeh, the local chairman of the pro-Palestinian American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) was killed by a bomb while opening the door to his Santa Ana, California office. Rubin was suspected, and further antagonized his opponents by saying that &quot;Odeh got what he deserved.&quot; However, the JDL insisted the attack was committed by others. The FBI was unable to prove its original allegations. The crime remains unsolved. The investigation of Rubin was headed by FBI special agent Mary Hogan, the same agent who signed the affidavit accusing Rubin of planning to destroy government property and other targets in 2001.

Before joining the Libertarian Party in 2000, Irv Rubin was an active Republican, and served as a page at the 1964 Republican National Convention, at which Barry Goldwater was nominated to run for the presidency. 

Rubin&#x27;s joining the Libertarian Party was greeted with shock by many members because of the allegations of terrorism against both the JDL and Rubin himself. Membership requires a pledge to not &quot;initiate force.&quot; In June 2001, Rubin let it be known that he was considering running for governor of California on the Libertarian ticket, renewing controversies among libertarians.

In an attempt to disrupt the events, Rubin regularly attended rallies held by the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations. He was regularly assisted by some of his followers. During the civil suit brought by the SPLC against Aryan Nations founder and Pastor Richard Butler held in Coeur d&#x27; Alene, Idaho, in 2000, Rubin stayed for at least 4 days holding vigil during the proceedings. He frequently spoke out against Butler and his followers who were also holding vigil.

==Appearances on television==
Rubin made a number of televised appearances during his lifetime. These include a lively 1988 debate on &quot;Crossfire&quot; with black nationalist Steve Cokely, shortly following a controversial lecture that Cokely gave in which he stated his belief that Jewish doctors were inoculating black babies with the HIV virus, appearing on the History Channel documentary &quot;Nazi America: A Secret History&quot;, and an October 22, 1997 appearance on the &quot;Jerry Springer Show&quot;, in which he and his bodyguards scuffled with members of the Ku Klux Klan after he attacked a member of the KKK who mocked him by removing his hood to reveal a yarmulke. One of the more celebrated debates that Rubin had was with Klansman and founder of the White Aryan Resistance Tom Metzger on KDOC Channel 56&#x27;s &quot;Hot Seat&quot; with Wally George. The debate was cut off after Rubin threw a cup of water in Metzger&#x27;s face. Security intervened and police were called.

==Organized crime==
The FBI suspected Rubin of running a protection racket against Los Angeles rappers including Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E, issuing threats and then offering to protect the rappers. He was involved in a cross-country grand theft auto racket where new Honda Accords would be stolen from ports on the East Coast, driven across country, and sold for $12,000. Several of Rubin&#x27;s associates were implicated in an FBI sting called &quot;Operation Stow Biz&quot; concerning extortion with moving companies.

==2001 conspiracy charges==
On December 12, 2001, Rubin and Earl Krugel, a member of the JDL, were charged with conspiracy to bomb private and government property. The two allegedly were caught in the act of planning bomb attacks against the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California, and on the office of U.S. Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), who is a Christian of Lebanese and Czech descent. The two were arrested as part of a sting operation after an FBI informant named Danny Gillis delivered explosives to Krugel&#x27;s home in L.A.

The JDL claims that Danny Gillis struck a deal with the FBI to neutralize the JDL by infiltrating the organization and by arranging criminal charges of its leadership. However, according to the Jewish Journal of Los Angeles, Gillis was a former JDL member who joined the organization due to conflicts with white skinheads. According to journalist David Sheen, Rubin via his attorney Mark Werksman, offered one of Rubin&#x27;s disgruntled criminal associates &quot;Moshe V&quot; $50,000 to kill Gillis.

On February 4, 2003, Earl Krugel, Rubin&#x27;s first lieutenant, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges stemming from the plot. This plea was later withdrawn by the presiding Judge, and he was charged with additional crimes which, if convicted, could result in a 55-year imprisonment in a federal penitentiary. The plea bargain was apparently reinstated in late September 2005, and the 62-year-old Krugel was sentenced to 20 years in federal detention, after an initial plea agreement based on his revealing the names of those involved in the Alex Odeh bomb plot was withdrawn. On November 4, 2005, he was killed after being transferred to a Phoenix federal prison. Another inmate struck Krugel on the head from behind with a cement block.

==Death in prison==
In November 2002, while imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles awaiting trial, Rubin allegedly cut his own throat and then jumped off an balcony. He had been threatening suicide in the days before. The injuries from the fall resulted in his death at Los Angeles County General Hospital several days later. 

Rubin&#x27;s wife demanded an investigation. Defense attorney Mark Werksman said that Rubin had been despondent for months, losing , and that the pressure of an upcoming trial &quot;may have pushed him over the top.&quot; The Rubin family launched a wrongful death suit against the government. While in BOP custody, Rubin was given BOP# 20965-112.

<doc id="144367" wikidata="Q1536659" url="?curid=144367" title="Justice Society of America">
<text>The Justice Society of America (JSA) is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. It was conceived by editor Sheldon Mayer and writer Gardner Fox during the Golden Age of Comic Books. It first appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 (Winter 1940–1941), making it the first team of superheroes in comic books. Its original members were Doctor Fate, Hourman, the Spectre, Sandman, Atom, the Flash, Green Lantern and Hawkman.

The team was initially popular, but after superhero comics waned in the late 1940s, the JSA&#x27;s adventures ceased with issue #57 of the title (March 1951). During the Silver Age of Comic Books, DC Comics reinvented several Justice Society members and brought many of them together in a new team, the Justice League of America. Other JSA members remained absent from comics for ten years until Jay Garrick appeared alongside Barry Allen, his Silver Age counterpart, in &quot;The Flash&quot; #123 (September 1961). The Justice Society was established as existing on &quot;Earth-Two&quot; and the Justice League on &quot;Earth-One&quot;, different versions of Earth in different universes. This allowed for annual cross-dimensional team-ups of the teams between 1963 and 1985. New series, such as &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, &quot;Infinity, Inc.,&quot; and a new &quot;All-Star Comics,&quot; featured the JSA, their children, and their heirs and explored the issues of aging, generational differences, and contrasts between the Golden Age and subsequent eras.

The 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series merged all of the company&#x27;s various alternate realities into one, placing the JSA as World War II era predecessors to the company&#x27;s modern characters. A &quot;JSA&quot; series was published from 1999 to 2006, and a &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; series that ran from 2007 to 2011. As part of DC Comics&#x27; 2011 relaunch of its entire line of monthly books, an unnamed version of the team appears in the &quot;Earth 2&quot; Vol 1 (2012-2015), &quot;Earth 2 World&#x27;s End&quot; (2014-2015), and &quot;Earth 2: Society&quot; (2015-2017).

==Publication history==
===&quot;All Star Comics&quot;===

The Justice Society of America first appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 (Winter 1940–1941) written by Gardner Fox and edited by Sheldon Mayer during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The team initially included: Doctor Fate, Hour-Man (as his name was then spelled), the Spectre, the Sandman, the Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman. Because some of these characters (the Atom, the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman) were published by All-American Publications rather than DC Comics, &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #3 is the first inter-company superhero title, as well as the first team-up title. Comics&#x27; historian Les Daniels noted that: &quot;This was obviously a great notion, since it offered readers a lot of headliners for a dime, and also the fun of watching fan favorites interact&quot;.

The JSA&#x27;s adventures were written by Gardner Fox as well as by John Broome and Robert Kanigher. The series was illustrated by a legion of artists including: Martin Nodell, Joe Kubert, Jack Kirby, Harry Lampert, Joe Simon, Alex Toth, Sheldon Moldoff, Carmine Infantino, Joe Giella, Win Mortimer, Bernard Baily, Frank Giacoia, H. G. Peter, Jack Burnley, Lee Elias, Irwin Hasen, Bob Oksner, Paul Reinman, Everett Edward Hibbard, and Bernard Sachs.

The first JSA story featured the team&#x27;s first meeting, with a framing sequence for each member telling a story of an individual exploit. In the next issue, the team worked together on a common case, but each story from there on still featured the members individually on a mission involving part of the case, and then banding together in the end to wrap things up. An in-house rule explicitly laid out on the last page of &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #5, reprinted on page 206 of &quot;All Star Comics Archives&quot; Vol. 1, required that whenever a member received his or her own title, that character would leave &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, becoming an &quot;honorary member&quot; of the JSA. Thus, the Flash was replaced by Johnny Thunder after #6, and Green Lantern left shortly thereafter for the same reason. For this reason, Superman and Batman were established as already being &quot;honorary&quot; members prior to &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3. How these two heroes helped found the JSA before becoming honorary members was not explained until &quot;DC Special&quot; #29 in 1977. Hawkman is the only member to appear in every JSA adventure in the original run of &quot;All Star Comics&quot;.

&quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (December 1941/January 1942) featured the first appearance of Wonder Woman. Unlike the other characters who had their own titles, she was allowed to appear in the series, but only as the JSA&#x27;s secretary from #11 onward, and did not actively take part in most adventures until much later in the series. She was excluded from the title because of the same rules that had excluded the Flash, Green Lantern, Superman, and Batman from the title, though in #13 it was claimed she had become an active member.

A fan club for the team called the &quot;Junior Justice Society of America&quot; was introduced in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #14 (Dec. 1942-Jan. 1943). The membership kit included a welcome letter, a badge, a decoder, a four-page comic book, and a membership certificate.

By &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #24 (Spring 1945), a real-world schism between National Comics and All-American Publications—a nominally independent company run by Max Gaines and Jack Liebowitz—had occurred, which resulted in the Detective Comics, Inc. (National Comics) heroes being removed from the title. As a result, the Flash and Green Lantern returned to the team. With issue #27 (Winter 1945), National Comics bought out Max Gaines&#x27; share of All-American and the two companies merged to form Detective Comics, Inc. The JSA roster remained mostly the same for the rest of the series. Gardner Fox left the series with issue #34 (April–May 1947) with a story that introduced a new super-villain, the Wizard. The Injustice Society first battled the JSA in issue #37 in a tale written by Robert Kanigher. The team&#x27;s second female member Black Canary first helped the group in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #38 and became a full member in #41.

&quot;All Star Comics&quot; and the JSA&#x27;s Golden Age adventures ended with issue #57, the title becoming &quot;All-Star Western&quot;, with no superheroes. A good amount of artwork has survived from an unpublished &quot;All Star Comics&quot; story titled &quot;The Will of William Wilson&quot; and has been reprinted in various publications from TwoMorrows Publishing.

The explanation for the team&#x27;s disappearance, and the inactivity of most of its roster after the early 1950s, was first given in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #466 (&quot;The Defeat of the Justice Society!&quot;, December 1979) by writer Paul Levitz, which explained that most of the Society chose to disband and retire rather than appear in front of the Joint Un-American Activities Committee, which demanded that they unmask themselves.

The chairmanship of the Justice Society mostly resided with Hawkman, although initially the Flash, and later Green Lantern, took turns leading the team. For a brief period in 1942, they were known as the Justice Battalion, as they became an extension of the armed forces of the United States of America during World War II. It was later explained that the reason the JSA did not invade Europe and end the war was because of the influence of the Spear of Destiny, which caused the JSA&#x27;s most powerful members to fall under the control of its wielder, Adolf Hitler. In the 1980s, it was established that the JSA had a loose affiliation with the All-Star Squadron. The All-Star Squadron&#x27;s adventures were set in the 1940s, and were considered to have happened concurrently with the Justice Society&#x27;s in a &quot;retcon&quot;.

The headquarters for the JSA was a hotel suite in New York City initially and, after the war, the team settled on a brownstone building in Gotham City, and later in Civic City. The JSA was provided with an orbital satellite headquarters, much like their later counterparts, the JLA, but it was immediately abandoned when it was revealed to be a death trap built in an attempt to kill off the team. The Gotham City brownstone remained unoccupied until years later when the team was active again. The headquarters used in the 2000s was a brownstone in Morningside Heights.

===The Silver Age===
Having successfully introduced new versions of several characters (the Flash, Green Lantern, etc.) during the late 1950s, DC tapped industry veteran, and former Justice Society writer, Gardner Fox to create a new version of the Justice Society. Editor Julius Schwartz, influenced by the popularity of Major League Baseball&#x27;s National League and American League, decided to change the name of the team from Justice &quot;Society&quot; to Justice &quot;League&quot;.

In &quot;The Flash&quot; #123 (September 1961) &quot;The Flash of Two Worlds&quot;, the Silver Age Flash meets his Golden Age counterpart, Jay Garrick who, along with the rest of the original Justice Society, is said to inhabit an alternative universe. This historic meeting thus became one of the classic DC comics of the Silver Age. Fan letters on the pages of following issues were wildly enthusiastic about the revival of the original Flash, both from older fans who remembered the old JSA tales, and younger fans eager to learn more about these new heroes. Further meetings occurred in &quot;The Flash&quot; #129 &quot;Double Danger on Earth&quot; (June 1962), and &quot;The Flash&quot; #137 &quot;Vengeance of the Immortal Villain&quot; (June 1963). &quot;The Flash&quot; #129 contains the first mention of the JSA in the Silver Age, and refers directly to their last adventure in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #57, while in &quot;The Flash&quot; #137 the JSA re-form.

These stories set the stage for &quot;Crisis on Earth-One&quot; (&quot;Justice League of America&quot; #21, August 1963) and &quot;Crisis on Earth-Two&quot; (&quot;Justice League of America&quot; #22, September 1963), a two-part tale where the Golden Age Justice Society teams up with the Silver Age Justice League to combat a team of villains from both worlds. The following year, the two teams of heroes worked together to stop an evil version of the Justice League from another alternative Earth (&quot;Justice League of America&quot; #29, &quot;Crisis on Earth-Three&quot;, August 1964). These stories became the first in a long series of team-ups of the two supergroups, an annual summer tradition which continued until 1985.

As well as the annual Justice League of America appearances, members of the JSA guest-starred in other titles over the next several years: the Golden Age Atom in &quot;The Atom&quot; #29 and #36, and the Golden Age Green Lantern in several issues of &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. In addition, a number of the characters appeared in team-up stories in issues of the DC titles &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; and &quot;Showcase&quot;, while the Spectre was given a solo run in the latter which led to his own series.

Some JSA members during this period, residing on &quot;Earth-Two&quot;, were portrayed as middle-aged versions of their younger, contemporary &quot;Earth-One&quot; counterparts; the &quot;Earth-Two&quot; characters&#x27; portrayal as older than their counterparts eased incorporation of the existing fictional history of the Justice Society of America into newly written stories about the &quot;Earth-Two&quot; characters. Later, this fictional age gap was to become a major theme for character development, with the fictional histories of different versions of the same characters deviating significantly from each other in ways impacted by their differences in age, including even the deaths of popular characters such as Batman in one setting while different, contemporary versions of the characters lived on as inhabitants of a different fictional &quot;Earth&quot;.

===The Bronze Age===

The JSA&#x27;s popularity grew until they regained their own title. &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #58 (January/February 1976) saw the group return as mentors to a younger set of heroes briefly called the &quot;Super Squad&quot; until they were integrated into the JSA proper. This run lasted until #74, with a brief run thereafter in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #461–466, but it had three significant developments: it introduced Power Girl in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #58, chronicled the death of the Golden Age Batman in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #461–462, and, after nearly 40 years, it finally provided the JSA with an origin story in &quot;DC Special&quot; #29. The Huntress was introduced in &quot;DC Super Stars&quot; #17 (Nov.–Dec. 1977) which told her origin, and &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #69 (Nov.–Dec. 1977), which was published the same day. The 1970s run of &quot;All Star Comics&quot; was written by Gerry Conway and Paul Levitz, and artists included Ric Estrada, Wally Wood, Keith Giffen, Joe Staton, and Bob Layton.

The series was noteworthy for depicting the heroes as having aged into their 50s. The artwork gave them graying hair and lined faces. It was highly unusual, then or now, for a comic book to have heroes this old. Most comic books obscure the timelines or periodically relaunch the series to keep the characters youthful. This depiction was a consequence of the fact that the heroes were closely linked to the era of World War II. This became problematic in the 1980s when the heroes would logically be well into their 60s. The explanation given for this by writer Roy Thomas in &quot;All-Star Squadron Annual&quot; #3 is that the team, and several friends, have absorbed energy from the magical villain Ian Karkull during an adventure in the 1940s that slows their aging process.

Meanwhile, the JSA continued their annual team-ups with the Justice League. Notable events include meeting the Fawcett Comics heroes, including Captain Marvel, the death of Mr. Terrific, and the origin of the Black Canary.

The JLA/JSA crossovers often involved a third team as well such as the Legion of Super-Heroes, the New Gods, the Secret Society of Super Villains, and the All-Star Squadron.

&quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; was a series taking place in the JSA&#x27;s original setting of the wartime 1940s. This led to a spinoff, modern day series entitled &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; which starred the children and heirs of the JSA members. Both series were written by noted JSA fan Roy Thomas and featured art by Rich Buckler, Jerry Ordway, Todd McFarlane, and others.

In 1985, DC retconned many details of the DC Universe in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Among the changes, the Golden Age Superman, Batman, Robin, and Wonder Woman ceased to exist, and the Earth-One/Earth-Two dichotomy was resolved by merging the Multiverse into a single universe. This posed a variety of problems for the JSA, whose history—especially in the 1980s comics—was strongly tied up in these four characters.

The JLA–JSA team-ups ended with the last pre-Crisis teamup occurring in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #244 and &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; #19 during the &quot;Crisis&quot;.

===After &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===
One of Roy Thomas&#x27;s efforts to resolve the &quot;Crisis&quot;-created inconsistencies was to introduce some analogues to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, in a sequel to &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; titled &quot;Young All-Stars&quot;.

In 1986, DC decided to write off the JSA from active continuity. &quot;The Last Days of the Justice Society&quot; one-shot involved most of the team battling the forces of evil while merged with the Norse gods in an ever-repeating Ragnarök-like Limbo, written by Thomas, with art by David Ross and Mike Gustovich. Only Power Girl, the Star-Spangled Kid, the Spectre, and Doctor Fate escaped the cataclysm. A later comic book series, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, portrays this scenario as a simulation, created by Odin in his search for a way to thwart the real Ragnarök. Roy Thomas revised the JSA&#x27;s origin for post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; vol. 2 #31.

====&quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vols. 1 and 2) (1991–1993)====

Fan interest resulted in the revival of the JSA in 1991. An eight-issue &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; limited series featuring a previously untold story set in the 1950s was published in 1991. In the final issues of the four-issue &quot;Armageddon: Inferno&quot; limited series, the JSA returns to the modern-day DC Universe when Waverider transported the &quot;daemen&quot; of the interdimensional Abraxis to Asgard as a substitute for the JSA in the Ragnarök cycle, allowing the team to return to Earth.

In 1992, the JSA was given an ongoing monthly series titled &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, written by Len Strazewski with art by Mike Parobeck, featuring the original team adjusting to life after returning from Ragnarök. Though &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; was intended as an ongoing series, and was popular with readers, the decision was made to cancel the book after the third issue&#x27;s release. Twelve issues of the new series were ultimately commissioned, though publication itself ended with issue #10. Portions of the remaining two issues originally intended for #11–12, which were part of a planned crossover with &quot;Justice League Europe&quot;, were published in &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; #49–50.

Strazewski, in an interview explaining the cancellation of this series, said, &quot;It was a capricious decision made personally by Mike Carlin because he didn&#x27;t like Mike&#x27;s artwork or my writing and believed that senior citizen super-heroes was not what DC should be publishing. He made his opinion clear to me several times after the cancellation.&quot;

&quot;Justice Society of America&quot; included the first appearance of Jesse Quick, the daughter of All-Star Squadron members Liberty Belle and Johnny Quick, who would go on to be a major figure in &quot;Flash&quot;, &quot;Titans&quot;, and later &quot;Justice Society&quot; comics.

Not long after, most of the team was incapacitated or killed in the 1994 crossover series &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot;. During the battle between the Justice Society and the villain Extant, the latter removes the chronal energies keeping the Justice Society young. The Atom, Doctor Mid-Nite, and Hourman die immediately. Hawkman and Hawkgirl, who were separated from the rest of the Justice Society after being pulled into the timestream, merge into a new Hawkgod being, resulting in their deaths. Doctor Fate dies of the resulting aging shortly after &quot;Zero Hour&quot;. Green Lantern is kept young because of the mystical effects of the Starheart, but loses his ring and subsequently changes his name to Sentinel.

The rest of the team is now too physically old to continue fighting crime and retires. Starman retires and passes on the Starman legacies to his sons, resulting in the creation of one of the new series following &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, James Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Starman&quot;.

====&quot;JSA&quot; (1999–2006)====

The JSA remained inactive for some time after the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, but the surviving members of the Flash, Wildcat, and Alan Scott (now going by the name Sentinel) have remained active throughout the DC Universe, having been placed as reserve JLI members, as evidenced in &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; #50.

The Justice Society was revived as a monthly series called JSA in 1999 which mixed the few remaining original members with younger counterparts. This incarnation of the team focused on the theme of generational legacy and of carrying on the heroic example established by their predecessors. The series was launched by James Robinson and David S. Goyer. Goyer later co-wrote the series with Geoff Johns, who continued to write the series solo after Goyer&#x27;s departure. The series featured the art of Stephen Sadowski, Leonard Kirk, and Don Kramer, among others. It featured a story by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon.

During the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, some of the surviving Golden Age characters, such as Wildcat and the Flash, are transported to the new &quot;Earth-Two,&quot; as created by Alexander Luthor Jr., and seem to recall the existence of the original one, albeit vaguely.

====&quot;JSA: Classified&quot; (2005–2008)====

In September 2005, &quot;JSA&quot;″s popularity led to a spinoff series, &quot;JSA: Classified&quot;, which tells stories of the team at various points in its existence, as well as spotlighting specific members in solo stories. The first arc, written by Geoff Johns with art by Amanda Conner, featured Power Girl&#x27;s origin. The series was cancelled with issue #39 (August 2008).

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
After the events of DC&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover and the World War III event chronicled in &quot;52&quot;, JSA members Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, and Ted Grant decide to revive the Justice Society.

====&quot;Justice Society of America&quot; vol. 3 (2006–2011)====

On December 6, 2006, a new series was launched with the creative team of Geoff Johns (writer), Dale Eaglesham (pencils), and Alex Ross (cover art). The beginning of the new series showed JSA veterans the Flash, Green Lantern, and Wildcat choosing members of the new generation of superheroes to train. Continuing a major theme from the previous JSA title, this new series focused on the team being the caretakers of the superhero legacy from one generation to the next.

The crossovers between the JLA and JSA began again with &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; (see below) in &quot;JLA&quot; vol. 4 #8–10 and &quot;JSA&quot; #5–6 and an epilogue in issue #7.

&quot;Justice Society of America Annual&quot; #1 (September 2008) featured the Justice Society Infinity, a team continuing from an analogous post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Two. Most of the members of the Justice Society Infinity are original members of Earth-Two&#x27;s Justice Society, such as the Atom and Robin (Dick Grayson), but the Society includes characters that are normally associated with Infinity, Inc., such as Jade and Nuklon (Albert Rothstein).

Johns&#x27; run as writer of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; ended with issue #26. Following a two-issue story by Jerry Ordway, Bill Willingham and Lilah Sturges took over as writers with issue #29 in July 2009.

Another JLA/JSA crossover was chronicled in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #44–48 and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #41–42 under the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; banner. James Robinson, the writer who co-wrote the 1999 &quot;JSA&quot; relaunch, took over as the book&#x27;s writer for the crossover while Mark Bagley illustrated the entire event. After the crossover, Robinson wrote one final issue with artist Jesus Merino, which dealt with the relationship between Green Lantern and his son Obsidian.

Following the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; story arc, Marc Guggenheim became the new writer with issue #44, and Scott Kolins took over art duties from Merino. During his first several issues, Guggenheim introduced a number of new characters to the team, such as Blue Devil and Manhunter. In issue #49, he expanded the JSA&#x27;s roster by bringing back all of the JSA All-Stars except for Magog, who had been killed in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, and Power Girl, who had unofficially departed from the JSA during the same maxi-series, as well as the original Liberty Belle. In addition, Guggenheim introduced a new character named Red Beetle (a gadget-wielding heroine clad in a red variation of the Silver Age Blue Beetle&#x27;s costume), and brought in Ri and Darknight, two Chinese superheroes that he had created for his &quot;Batman Confidential&quot; run.

====&quot;JSA All-Stars&quot; vol. 2 (2009–2011)====

An ongoing series titled &quot;JSA All-Stars&quot; debuted with a February 2010 cover date (distinct from &quot;JSA: All Stars&quot;, a limited series published from July 2003 to February 2004). The series focused on a second team that formed after the JSA split. Calling themselves the &quot;All-Stars&quot;, the group included more of the newer, younger members of the JSA. The roster consisted of: Magog, Damage, Power Girl, Hourman, Atom Smasher, Sand, Stargirl, Cyclone, Wildcat (Ton Bronson), Citizen Steel, Judomaster, King Chimera, Anna Fortune, and the A.I. Roxy, with Damage and Magog later being killed.

DC cancelled &quot;JSA All-Stars&quot; with issue #18 (July 2011) because of the events of &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, the DC 2011 summer event. As a result of the title&#x27;s cancellation, writer Marc Guggenheim had all of the All-Stars except Power Girl and Magog rejoin the JSA in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #49.
===DC Rebirth (2011–2017)===
In the &quot;DC Universe Rebirth&quot; one-shot, Johnny Thunder is in a nursing home. He is trying to escape, but Kid Flash Wally West appears to Johnny trying to establish a link to return from the Speed Force. Johnny admits he threw away the magic pen containing Thunderbolt. In &quot;The Flash Rebirth&quot; series, the interaction between Pre-&quot;New 52&quot; Wally West and &quot;New 52&quot; Wally West triggers a disturbance in the Speed Force, which causes Barry to have a strange vision. In the vision, Barry sees Johnny Quick&#x27;s Speed formula and Jay Garrick&#x27;s Flash helmet. Johnny Thunder is seen again during the &quot;Button&quot; crossover, where he is on a roof shouting for his Thunderbolt and that it is his fault they lost the Justice Society. At the end of the crossover, it is revealed that the Pre-&quot;New 52&quot; Jay Garrick was also stuck in the Speed Force, and Barry is able to momentarily free him. However, when Barry tries to secure him to the universe just as he did to Wally, Jay instead is transported back into the Speed Force in a blast of blue energy.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Doctor Manhattan recalls various events in which he indirectly killed Alan Scott and thus brought about changes in the timeline. On July 16, 1940, Alan Scott was riding on a train over a collapsing bridge, but he survived by grabbing onto a green lantern. He continues his life, eventually &quot;sitting at a round table wearing a mask&quot; and later testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee but refusing to implicate anyone in his employ. On July 16, 1940, again, Doctor Manhattan moves the lantern six inches out of Alan Scott&#x27;s reach so that Scott dies in the train accident and leaves no family behind. At the Daily Planet, Lois Lane finds a flash-drive showing footage of various members of the Justice Society of America such as Alan Scott, Jay Garrick, Doctor Fate, Hawkman, Hourman, Sandman, and Spectre. Lois did not know about the Justice Society until now. When Doctor Manhattan first arrived in the DC Universe, he witnesses the creation of the JSA and each of its founding members superhero personas. In one timeline (Golden Age/Earth-2), Doctor Manhattan watches as the JSA wait for the arrival of Superman to formally create their team. This then changes to a timeline (Post-Crisis/New Earth) where Superman was not a founding member and did not arrive until 1956. Curious about the importance of Superman and what would happen if time were to be changed and how it would affect him, Doctor Manhattan prevented Alan Scott from becoming Green Lantern. This in turn created the &quot;New 52&quot; Universe, and with it, the creation of the Justice Society of America was erased. When Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society and the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Justice Society (consisting of Atom-Smasher, Cyclone, Damage, Doctor Fate, Doctor Mid-Nite II, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Hourman II, Jade, Jakeem Thunder and Johnny Thunderbolt, Liberty Belle, Mister Terrific, Obsidian, Power Girl, Sandman II, Stargirl, S.T.R.I.P.E., Wildcat I, and Wildcat II) appears to help Superman fight the rampaging metahumans. Afterwards, the Justice Society investigates the Department of Metahuman Affairs which led to the arrest of those involved.

The Justice Society returns in the pages of &quot;Justice League&quot;. The League splits up to retrieve fragments on the Totality from the past and future. Flash and Green Lantern are transported to 1941 to retrieve a fragment. They arrive in December 1941 to discover that the Legion of Doom has already travelled to the past and meddled in history, attacking and seemingly conquering the United States. They encounter the Justice Society, much to their surprise, as they are not aware of any superheroes active in the 1940s. However, they begin to develop an affinity for their Golden Age counterparts, and feel that there is an intricate shared history they cannot fully remember.

In the fifth volume of &quot;Hawkman&quot; following the defeat of Anton Hastor, a deceased Hawkman and Hawkwoman are reborn as their Golden Age counterparts, reuniting with their old friends in the Justice Society.

===New Justice (2018–2021)===
In the pages of &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, Justice Society members Green Lantern, Flash, Doctor Fate, and Wildcat were shown to be guarding the Valhalla Cemetery. The password to get in was &quot;Ma Hunkel&quot; where Green Lantern mentioned that she was the first guardian of the JSA&#x27;s first headquarters. As Superman and his allies prepare for their final fight against both Perpetua and the Darkest Knight, Justice Society members Damage, Green Lantern, and Flash were present. In addition, Batman used the Black Lantern ring to revive JSA members Atom, Hourman, Ma Hunkel, and Sandman. At the end of &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, the Justice Society are shown fighting in World War II alongside the narrator of the series Sgt. Rock. It is explicitly noted that this is 1943 in the DC universe, indicating that they have been fully restored to the timeline.

===Infinite Frontier (2021–2023)===


===Dawn of DC (2023–2024)===

In August 2022 it was announced that following the conclusion of &quot;Flashpoint Beyond&quot;, a one shot entitled &quot;The New Golden Age&quot; would release in November that year, with heavy ties to the fourth volume of the Justice Society of America series, with Geoff Johns writing and Mikel Janín providing art. The central storyline also ties in to several limited series like &quot;Stargirl: The Lost Children&quot;, &quot;Alan Scott: The Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Jay Garrick: The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Wesley Dodds: The Sandman&quot;.

The first five issues had the Justice Society encountering a Huntress from a possible future and fighting Per Degaton and his time clones. Per Degaton is defeated and Huntress&#x27; possible future is erased with Huntress remaining in the present.

===Television===
====Animation====
* The &quot;Justice League&quot; two-part episode &quot;Legends&quot; pays homage to the Justice Society with the Justice Guild of America (JGA), a team of imaginary superheroes who exist in another universe and consists of the Green Guardsman, the Streak, Black Siren, Catman, and Tom Turbine, who are all based on JSA members Alan Scott / Green Lantern, Jay Garrick / Flash, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, Ted Grant / Wildcat, and Al Pratt / Atom respectively. They fought crime until they were all killed in a nuclear war. Over the course of the following 40 years, a boy mutated by the radiation named Ray Thompson used his psionic powers to recreate the JGA as an illusion until the Justice League arrive in his universe and eventually inspire the JGA to sacrifice themselves to restore reality. According to the writers, the creative team originally intended to use the JSA for the episode, but DC Comics declined as their portrayal clashed with their comic counterparts&#x27; post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; portrayal.
* The Justice Society appear in &quot;&quot;, consisting of Jay Garrick / Flash, Ted Grant / Wildcat, Rex Tyler / Hourman, Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite, Carter Hall / Hawkman, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, the Spectre, Terry Sloane / Mister Terrific, Alan Scott / Green Lantern, Wesley Dodds / Sandman, and Ted Knight / Starman. This version of the group tutored Batman in his early days. Additionally, Drake was killed in action and asked Grant to look after her daughter Dinah Laurel Lance.
* The Justice Society of America (JSA) appear in &quot;Young Justice&quot;. According to the series&#x27; producers, most of the original JSA members are either dead or retired by the time the series takes place. Most of the team itself appears in a flashback sequence in the episode &quot;Humanity&quot;, consisting of Alan Scott / Green Lantern, Jay Garrick / Flash, Wesley Dodds / Sandman, Ted Grant / Wildcat, Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, and Red Tornado. Additionally, Firebrand was also a member for a short time before she was revealed to be an android created by T. O. Morrow while Dan Garrett / Blue Beetle appears as a member in the episode &quot;Failsafe&quot;.

====Live-action====
* The Justice Society of America appear in the &quot;Smallville&quot; two-part episode &quot;Absolute Justice&quot;, primarily consisting of Carter Hall / Hawkman, Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, and Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl. Additionally, Sylvester Pemberton / Star-Spangled Kid, Wesley Dodds / Sandman, Ted Grant / Wildcat, Jay Garrick / Flash, Al Pratt / Atom, Alan Scott / Green Lantern, and Red Tornado appear briefly or in flashbacks while Shiera Hall / Hawkgirl, Rex Tyler / Hourman, Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite, Terry Sloane / Mister Terrific, the Spectre, and Dinah Drake / Black Canary appear in a painted group portrait. Like their post-&quot;Crisis&quot; incarnation, this version of the group is an earlier generation of superheroes who were forced to retire when the government tried to take control of them after determining their real identities before resurfacing in the present to mentor new superheroes.
* The Justice Society of America appear in &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, led by Rex Tyler / Hourman and consisting of Henry Heywood / Commander Steel, Todd Rice / Obsidian, Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl, Amaya Jiwe / Vixen, and Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite. This version of the group operated during World War II. In 1942, the JSA work with the time-traveling Legends to stop a group of Nazis after they obtain a super-power granting serum from Eobard Thawne. After his plan is foiled, Thawne kills Tyler, leading to Vixen joining the Legends to avenge his death. In 1956, the JSA became inactive when everyone but Obsidian were believed to have been killed during a covert mission. In reality, they recovered the Spear of Destiny with the help of Rip Hunter, who then transported Stargirl, Steel, and Mid-Nite to differing points in time to guard fragments of the Spear and prevent its reassembly. However, the Legion of Doom brainwashes Hunter into joining them and recovering the fragments, killing Mid-Nite and Steel in the process.
* Two incarnations of the Justice Society of America appear in &quot;Stargirl&quot;.
** The original group was led by Sylvester Pemberton / Starman and consisted of Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite, Jay Garrick / Flash, Alan Scott / Green Lantern, Carter Hall / Hawkman, Shiera Hall / Hawkgirl, Rex Tyler / Hourman, Johnny Thunder and Thunderbolt, Wesley Dodds / Sandman, and Ted Grant / Wildcat. A decade prior, the JSA was attacked by the Injustice Society of America (ISA) while deciding how to address Eclipso&#x27;s Black Diamond. When Pat Dugan arrived, most of the team had been killed and he only had time to evacuate a fatally wounded Starman. Before he died, the latter told the former to find someone worthy of wielding the Cosmic Staff to keep the JSA&#x27;s legacy alive.
** By the present day, Courtney Whitmore finds the Cosmic Staff, becomes Stargirl, and rebuilds the JSA with Pat as S.T.R.I.P.E. and her friends Yolanda Montez, Beth Chapel and Rick Tyler as the new Wildcat, Doctor Mid-Nite, and Hourman respectively. At the end of the second season, Whitmore recruits Cindy Burman into the JSA. Ten years later, as depicted in the series finale, the JSA&#x27;s ranks have grown to include Jennie-Lynn Hayden / Jade, Todd Rice / Obsidian, Mike Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E. 2.0, Jakeem Thunder and Thunderbolt, Cameron Mahkent / Icicle, Artemis Crock, Sandy Hawkins / Sand, Damage, Solomon Grundy, and Richard Swift / Shade. Additionally, Whitmore and Burman went on to become Starwoman and Dragon Queen respectively.
*** Ahead of the series premiere, the founding members of Stargirl&#x27;s JSA made a cameo appearance in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; via archive footage.

===Film===
* The Justice Society of America appears in the opening credits of &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot;, consisting of Rex Tyler / Hourman, Ted Grant / Wildcat, Alan Scott / Green Lantern, Jay Garrick / Flash, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, Carter Hall / Hawkman, and Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite. After Tyler is killed, the JSA retire, though Grant remained active as a professional boxer.
* The Earth-2 incarnation of the Justice Society of America appears in &quot;Justice Society: World War II&quot;, led by Wonder Woman and consisting of Rex Tyler / Hourman, Dinah Drake / Black Canary, Carter Hall / Hawkman, and Jay Garrick / Flash.

<doc id="144368" wikidata="Q7265789" url="?curid=144368" title="Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi">
<text>Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harithi (19553 November 2002), also known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Abu Ali al-Harithi, was a Yemeni Islamist militant who served as the leader of al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQY) from some time before 2000 until his death in 2002. 

Harithi developed a relationship with Osama bin Laden while fighting alongside him in the Soviet–Afghan War. He was sent to Yemen by Bin Laden in the late 1990s to assist in planning al-Qaeda attacks. Harithi was regarded as the highest-ranking leader among al-Qaeda operatives in Yemen by late 2001. He was implicated in several al-Qaeda attacks in Yemen, including the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing in October 2000 and the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing in October 2002. Harithi was killed in a drone strike conducted by the United States on 3 November 2002.

== Early life and militancy ==
Harithi was born in 1955 in Shabwah Governorate, Yemen. A member of the Banu al-Harith tribe, Harithi moved to Marib in North Yemen as a young man due to the government of South Yemen becoming increasing hostility towards tribal customs and identity during the late 1960s and 1970s.

During the 1980s, Harithi travelled to Afghanistan to participate in the fight against the Soviet Union. During his time in the country, Harithi met and fought alongside Osama bin Laden, developing a close relationship with him by the end of the war. 

Harithi returned to his family farm in Shabwah after the conclusion of the war. During the early 1990s, Harithi joined the Islamic Jihad in Yemen, an Islamist organization composed of former Afghan mujahideen. With the financial support of Bin Laden, he set up camps for the group in Shabwah, Marib and Saada governorates to train their members for attacks against the Yemeni Socialist Party. 

During this time, Harithi frequently traveled to Sudan to visit Bin Laden. He reportedly acted as a bodyguard for Bin Laden during an instance where gunmen attempted to assassinate him at his home in Khartoum. The gun battle resulted in him gaining a permanent wound in his leg. Harithi later returned to Yemen to participate in the civil war in 1994, fighting alongside the Yemeni government against the Southern secessionist Democratic Republic of Yemen. Soon after the end of the war, Harithi moved to the United Arab Emirates, where he was arrested in 1997 before being released three months later. He then immediately moved to Afghanistan, where Bin Laden had relocated the year prior.

== Al-Qaeda in Yemen ==
Some time before 2000, while residing in Afghanistan, Harithi received orders from Bin Laden to travel back to Yemen to begin planning attacks. By that time, Bin Laden had already authorized Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri to begin planning an attack on a United States Navy vessel in Yemen two years prior. Al-Nashiri&#x27;s plan eventually culminated in the bombing of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; in October 2000. The United States government listed Harithi as one of the main planners of the attack. The US government eventually came to identify Harithi as the highest-ranking leader of AQY, placing him on a kill list alongside the likes of Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Harithi, alongside senior AQY member Mohammed al-Ahdal, went into hiding during 2001 after being tipped off that they were wanted for questioning for their role in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. Between August and November 2001, the two hid in Hosun al-Jalal, a village in the rural areas of Marib Governorate. In November 2001, two months after the September 11 attacks, US President George W. Bush prioritized the arrest of Harithi and al-Ahdal as a &quot;good first step&quot; in defining Yemen&#x27;s relations with the US during a meeting with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. This eventually resulted in Yemeni soldiers executing a raid on Hosun al-Jalal to arrest both militants in December 2001. The raid failed, with both Harithi and al-Ahdal escaping and Yemeni forces suffering 18 casualties as they clashed with hostile Abidah tribesmen in the area.

According to the transcripts of interviews between investigators and AQY members convicted for the MV &quot;Limburg&quot; bombing in October 2002, the attack on the French oil tanker was conducted on the orders of Harithi.

== Death ==

On 3 November 2002, Harithi was killed in a drone strike alongside six other individuals linked to al-Qaeda, indlucing Lackawanna Six member Kamal Derwish. A CIA-controlled Predator drone targeted the vehicle that the group of six were using while travelling through Marib. Harithi&#x27;s killing represented first instance of the US launching a drone strike outside of Afghanistan.

Harithi was buried in Shabwah on 9 November. His funeral was attended by about 30 people, most of them family and friends.

<text>Rex Todhunter Stout (; December 1, 1886–October 27, 1975) was an American writer noted for his detective fiction. His best-known characters are the detective Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin, who were featured in 33 novels and 39 novellas or short stories between 1934 and 1975.

In 1959, Stout received the Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s Grand Master Award. The Nero Wolfe corpus was nominated Best Mystery Series of the Century at Bouchercon XXXI, the world&#x27;s largest mystery convention, and Rex Stout was nominated as Best Mystery Writer of the Century.

In addition to writing fiction, Stout was a prominent public intellectual for decades. Stout was active in the early years of the American Civil Liberties Union and a founder of the Vanguard Press. He served as head of the Writers&#x27; War Board during World War II, became a radio celebrity through his numerous broadcasts, and was later active in promoting world federalism. He was the long-time president of the Authors Guild and sought to benefit authors by lobbying for improvement of authors&#x27; rights under the copyright laws. He also served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America in 1959.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stout was born in Noblesville, Indiana, in 1886, but shortly afterwards his Quaker parents John Wallace Stout and Lucetta Elizabeth Todhunter Stout moved their family (nine children in all) to Kansas.

His father was a teacher who encouraged his son to read, leading to Rex having read the entire Bible twice by the age of four. At age thirteen he was the state spelling bee champion. Stout attended Topeka High School, Kansas, and the University of Kansas, Lawrence. His sister, Ruth Stout, also authored several books on no-work gardening and some social commentaries.

He served in the U.S. Navy from 1906 to 1908 (including service as a yeoman on Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential yacht) and then spent about the next four years working at a series of jobs in six states, including cigar-store clerk.

In 1910–11, Stout sold three short poems to the literary magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. Between 1912 and 1918, he published more than forty works of fiction in various magazines, ranging from literary publications such as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; to pulp magazines like the &quot;All-Story Weekly.&quot;

Stout invented a school banking system around 1916, which he promoted with his brother Robert. About 400 U.S. schools adopted his system for keeping track of the money that school children saved in accounts at school. Royalties from this work provided Stout with enough money to travel in Europe extensively during the 1920s.

In 1916, Stout married Fay Kennedy of Topeka, Kansas. They divorced in February 1932 and, in December 1932, Stout married Pola Weinbach Hoffmann, a designer who had studied with Josef Hoffmann in Vienna.

==Writings==

Rex Stout began his literary career in the 1910s writing for magazines, particularly pulp magazines, writing more than 40 stories that appeared between 1912 and 1918. Stout&#x27;s early stories appeared most frequently in &quot;All-Story Magazine&quot; and its affiliates, but he was also published in magazines as varied as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, &quot;The Smart Set&quot;, &quot;Young&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Golfers Magazine&quot;. The early stories spanned genres including romance, adventure, science fiction/fantasy, and detective fiction, including two murder mystery novellas (&quot;Justice Ends at Home&quot; and &quot;The Last Drive&quot;) that prefigured elements of the Wolfe stories.

By 1916, Stout grew tired of writing a story whenever he needed money. He decided to stop writing until he had made enough money to support himself through other means, so he would be able to write when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the money that he had made as a businessman in the Great Depression of 1929.

In 1929, Stout wrote his first published book, &quot;How Like a God&quot;, an unusual psychological story written in the second person. The novel was published by the Vanguard Press, which he had helped to found. Stout published a total of four psychological novels between 1929 and 1933, the first three with Vanguard and the fourth at Farrar &amp; Rinehart, to which he was recruited by editor John C. Farrar. 

In the 1930s, Stout turned to writing detective fiction, a genre that he and Farrar thought might be more financially rewarding than his previous novels. In 1933, he wrote &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;, which introduced Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin. The novel was published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in October 1934, and in abridged form as &quot;Point of Death&quot; in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; (November 1934). The same year, Stout also published a political thriller &quot;The President Vanishes&quot; (1934), which was originally published anonymously.

&quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot; was the first of 72 Nero Wolfe stories (33 novels and 39 novellas) that Stout published from 1934 to 1975. Stout continued writing the Nero Wolfe series for the rest of his life. Beginning in 1940, Nero Wolfe began to appear in novellas as well as full-length novels, at the behest of his editors at &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. Stout wrote at least one Nero Wolfe story every year through 1966 (except in 1943, when war-related activities took priority). Stout&#x27;s rate of production declined somewhat after 1966, but he still published four further Nero Wolfe novels prior to his death in 1975, at the age of 88.

The characters of Wolfe and Goodwin are considered among Stout&#x27;s main contributions to detective fiction. Wolfe was described by reviewer Will Cuppy as &quot;that Falstaff of detectives&quot;.

Stout also wrote several non-Wolfe mystery novels during the 1930s, but none approached the success of the Nero Wolfe books. In 1937, Stout&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hand in the Glove&quot; introduced the character of Theodolinda &quot;Dol&quot; Bonner, a female private detective who is an early and significant example of the female PI as fictional protagonist. Bonner would also appear as a character in some later Nero Wolfe stories. Stout also created two other detective protagonists, Tecumseh Fox (who appeared in three books) and Alphabet Hicks (one book). His novel &quot;Red Threads&quot; featured Inspector Cramer, a familiar character from the Wolfe books, working on his own. After 1938, Stout wrote no fiction but mysteries, and after 1941, almost entirely Nero Wolfe stories.

During World War II, Stout cut back on his detective writing to focus on war-related activities. For four years, he chaired the Writers&#x27; War Board, which coordinated the volunteer services of American writers to help the war effort. He also joined the Fight for Freedom organization and hosted three weekly radio shows. After the war, in addition to continuing to write the Nero Wolfe books, Stout supported democracy and world government. He served as president of the Authors Guild and of the Mystery Writers of America, which in 1959 presented Stout with the Grand Master Award – the pinnacle of achievement in the mystery field.

Stout was a longtime friend of British humorist P. G. Wodehouse, writer of the Jeeves novels and short stories. Each was a fan of the other&#x27;s work, and parallels are evident between their characters and techniques. Wodehouse contributed the foreword to &quot;Rex Stout: A Biography&quot;, John McAleer&#x27;s Edgar Award-winning 1977 biography of the author (reissued in 2002 as &quot;Rex Stout: A Majesty&#x27;s Life&quot;). Wodehouse also mentions Rex Stout in several of his Jeeves books, as both Bertie and his Aunt Dahlia are fans.

===Public activities===
In the fall of 1925, Roger Nash Baldwin appointed Rex Stout to the board of the American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s powerful National Council on Censorship; Stout served one term. Stout helped start the radical Marxist magazine &quot;The New Masses&quot;, which succeeded &quot;The Masses&quot; and &quot;The Liberator&quot; in 1926. He had been told that the magazine was primarily committed to bringing arts and letters to the masses, but he realized after a few issues &quot;that it was Communist and intended to stay Communist&quot;, and he ended his association with it.

Stout was one of the officers and directors of the Vanguard Press, a publishing house established with a grant from the Garland Fund to reprint left-wing classics at an affordable cost and publish new books otherwise deemed &quot;unpublishable&quot; by the commercial press of the day. He served as Vanguard&#x27;s first president from 1926 to 1928, and continued as vice president until at least 1931. During his tenure, Vanguard issued 150 titles, including seven books by Scott Nearing and three of Stout&#x27;s own novels—&quot;How Like a God&quot; (1929), &quot;Seed on the Wind&quot; (1930), and &quot;Golden Remedy&quot; (1931).

In 1942, Stout described himself as a &quot;pro-Labor, pro-New Deal, pro-Roosevelt left liberal&quot;.

During World War II, he worked with the advocacy group Friends of Democracy, chaired the Writers&#x27; War Board (a propaganda organization), and supported the embryonic United Nations. He lobbied for Franklin D. Roosevelt to accept a fourth term as president. He developed an extreme anti-German attitude and wrote the provocative essay &quot;We Shall Hate, or We Shall Fail&quot; which generated a flood of protests after its January 1943 publication in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The attitude is expressed by Nero Wolfe in the 1942 novella &quot;Not Quite Dead Enough&quot;.

On August 9, 1942, Stout conducted the first of 62 wartime broadcasts of &quot;Our Secret Weapon&quot; on CBS Radio. The idea for the counterpropaganda series had been that of Sue Taylor White, wife of Paul White, the first director of CBS News. Research was done under White&#x27;s direction. &quot;Hundreds of Axis propaganda broadcasts, beamed not merely to the Allied countries but to neutrals, were sifted weekly&quot;, wrote Stout&#x27;s biographer John McAleer. &quot;Rex himself, for an average of twenty hours a week, pored over the typewritten yellow sheets of accumulated data ... Then, using a dialogue format – Axis commentators making their assertions, and Rex Stout, the lie detective, offering his refutations – he dictated to his secretary the script of the fifteen-minute broadcast.&quot; By November 1942, Berlin Radio was reporting that &quot;Rex Stout himself has cut his own production in detective stories from four to one a year and is devoting the entire balance of his time to writing official war propaganda.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; described Stout as &quot;stripping Axis short-wave propaganda down to the barest nonsensicals ... There&#x27;s no doubt of its success.&quot;

In September 1942, Stout defended FDR&#x27;s policy of sending Japanese-Americans to concentration camps in a debate with the Socialist civil libertarian Norman Thomas. Stout charged &quot;that Japanese-Americans include more fifth columnists than any other comparable group in the United States.&quot; When Thomas condemned the military&#x27;s role as a &quot;disgrace to our democracy&quot; and comparable to &quot;the powers of totalitarian dictators,&quot; Stout responded that moving &quot;Japanese-Americans inland hardly constitutes Totalitarianism.&quot;

During the later part of the war and the post-war period, he also led the Society for the Prevention of World War III which lobbied for a harsh peace for Germany. When the war ended, Stout became active in the United World Federalists.

House Committee on Un-American Activities chairman Martin Dies called him a Communist, and Stout is reputed to have said to him, &quot;I hate Communists as much as you do, Martin, but there&#x27;s one difference between us. I know what a Communist is and you don&#x27;t.&quot;

Stout was one of many American writers closely watched by J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s FBI. Hoover considered him an enemy of the bureau and either a Communist or a tool of Communist-dominated groups. Stout&#x27;s leadership of the Authors League of America during the McCarthy era was particularly irksome to the FBI. About a third of Stout&#x27;s FBI file is devoted to his 1965 novel &quot;The Doorbell Rang&quot;.

== Later years and death ==

In later years, Stout alienated some readers with his hawkish stance on the Vietnam War and with the contempt for communism expressed in certain of his works. The latter viewpoint is given voice in the 1952 novella &quot;Home to Roost&quot; (first published as &quot;Nero Wolfe and the Communist Killer&quot;) and most notably in the 1949 novel &quot;The Second Confession&quot;. In this work, Archie and Wolfe express their dislike for &quot;Commies&quot;, while at the same time Wolfe arranges for the firing of a virulently anti-Communist broadcaster, likening him to Hitler and Mussolini.

Stout continued writing until just before his death. He died on October 27, 1975, at the age of 88 at his estate, High Meadow, on the New York/Connecticut border.

===Cultural references===
&quot;A number of the paintings of René Magritte (1898–1967), the internationally famous Belgian painter, are named after titles of books by Rex Stout,&quot; wrote Harry Torczyner, Magritte&#x27;s attorney and friend. &quot;He read Hegel, Heidegger and Sartre, as well as Dashiell Hammett, Rex Stout and Georges Simenon,&quot; the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; wrote of Magritte. &quot;Some of his best titles were &#x27;found&#x27; in this way.&quot; Magritte&#x27;s 1942 painting &quot;Les compagnons de la peur&quot; (&quot;The Companions of Fear&quot;) bears the title given to &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot; (1935) when it was published in France by Gallimard (1939). It is one of Magritte&#x27;s series of &quot;leaf-bird&quot; paintings, created during the Nazi occupation of Brussels. It depicts a stormy, mountainous landscape in which a cluster of plants has metamorphosed into a group of vigilant owls.

Stout is also mentioned in Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond book &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1963).

<doc id="144374" wikidata="Q2250869" url="?curid=144374" title="Archie Goodwin (character)">
<text>Archie Goodwin is a fictional character in a series of detective stories and novels by American author Rex Stout. Archie is the witty narrator of the cases featuring his boss, Nero Wolfe, from 1934 (&quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;) to 1975 (&quot;A Family Affair&quot;). Although his job title is Wolfe&#x27;s secretary and chauffeur, Archie is effectively Wolfe&#x27;s partner in the detective business, and the stories often contrast his middle class streetwise persona with Wolfe&#x27;s aristocratic intelligence. 

==Character==
Archie is Wolfe&#x27;s live-in assistant in the private investigation business Wolfe runs out of his comfortable and luxurious New York City brownstone house on West 35th Street. Wolfe rarely leaves the brownstone – and makes it a special point to never leave the house for reasons concerning his work – so Archie does most of the actual investigating, followed by reporting his findings to Wolfe, who solves the mystery. Archie is a skilled observer and has trained his memory so that he can make verbatim reports, oral or typewritten, of extended conversations. He claims to be able to type 6 to 7 pages per hour on average, or up to 10 when he needs to hurry. Because Wolfe is generally ignorant of the logistical details of the world outside his house (and uninterested in them) he relies on Archie for various kinds of practical information and opinions. Wolfe also turns to Archie for personal judgments regarding the character of the women connected with a case, as Wolfe is wary of women and tends to keep them at arms-length.

Archie&#x27;s bedroom is on the third floor of the brownstone, and he owns all of the furniture within it. Under his bed is a gong that is part of an alarm system designed to sound if anyone gets too close to Wolfe&#x27;s bedroom door or windows at night. He typically eats his breakfast in the kitchen, and lunch and dinner in the dining room with Wolfe. However, if he must hurry to keep an appointment, he will eat in the kitchen or at a restaurant because Wolfe hates to see anyone rush through a meal.

In addition to detective work, Archie also handles Wolfe&#x27;s bookkeeping and banking, types his correspondence, and keeps the germination and other records for the orchids Wolfe raises as a hobby. His salary was $200 per week, but later it is $400 per week. Archie&#x27;s hobbies include dancing (usually at the Flamingo), poker, and baseball. He was a fan of the New York Giants until they relocated to San Francisco in 1957, then later became a fan of the New York Mets when that team was founded in 1962. When moving around Manhattan on business, he often prefers to walk rather than using Wolfe&#x27;s car or taking taxis. Unlike his employer, Archie has only two conspicuous eccentricities: His favorite drink is milk, and he always knows the exact time.

Archie&#x27;s conversations with other characters often feature his penchant for arch wit, which can serve purposes such as playing devil&#x27;s advocate to &quot;badger&quot; Wolfe into working; stalling or goading police officers; issuing threats under the guise of ironically ingenuous observations; or charming female characters into cooperating with Wolfe&#x27;s professional desiderata.

Regardless of what year the story takes place, Archie and the other principal characters in the corpus do not age. Archie is in his early 30s. He was born on October 23 in Chillicothe, Ohio. At age 12 he lived in Zanesville. Archie once mentions a sister in Ohio (who sent him silk pajamas for his birthday).

Rex Stout was never overly concerned with consistency in the Wolfe books, and Archie himself comfortably relates unreliable information as it came during the course of the story, so some specifics of Archie&#x27;s background vary in the corpus. In &quot;Fer-de-Lance&quot;, he comments that his parents died when he was a child, but in &quot;The Final Deduction&quot; his mother is still living.

The most concentrated – but suspect – biography of Archie comes from &quot;Too Many Women&quot;, in which Mrs. Jasper Pine has his background investigated. The details she relates are contradicted in other stories. She tells Archie that his father&#x27;s name is James Arner Goodwin that his mother&#x27;s maiden name is Leslie, that he has two brothers and two sisters, and that he was born in Canton, Ohio. Archie never mentions the alleged brothers and second sister in the series.

Although he is from the American Midwest, Archie has the ‘street smarts’ to handle just about any situation he finds himself in, and he knows New York City like the back of his hand. Though he freely admits that there is no one better than Saul Panzer in many aspects of investigative work, such as remembering faces and tailing people, Goodwin is one of the most competent private detectives in the city. 

When Wolfe disappears for an extended period in &quot;In the Best Families&quot;, Archie rents an office of his own and works as an independent detective. During this time, Archie writes, &quot;My idea was to net more per week than I had been getting from Wolfe, not that I cared for the money, but as a matter of principle.&quot; Later, Archie needles Wolfe, pointing out that he made a little more than double the amount that Wolfe had been paying him; Wolfe claims not to believe it.

Archie has a long-time cordial relationship with Lily Rowan, a wealthy society woman. However, they do not try to limit each other&#x27;s social lives, and Archie has many passing love interests throughout the series. When meeting a woman he considers particularly beautiful, Archie often facetiously expresses a desire to propose marriage. The only serious affair apart from Lily that he shares with the reader is Lucy Valdon, with whom he has a series of extended assignations during &quot;The Mother Hunt&quot;, prompting Wolfe and Fritz to fear that Archie may finally settle down. This does not happen, and Lucy Valdon did not appear in any other story although she receives a mention in &quot;A Right to Die&quot;.

==As narrator==
Archie, as Stout&#x27;s first-person narrator, faithfully relates each case in the past tense in meticulous detail. His narrative includes his own thoughts over the course of the story, from ruminations on the case in progress to personal impressions of and opinions about the people involved. He is very thorough in describing the details of other characters&#x27; physical appearances, often adding his own positive or negative judgments.

Because Wolfe routinely keeps Archie in the dark about certain key insights and key tasks assigned to other operatives, Archie&#x27;s openness with the reader over the course of the story he is telling from his own point of view does not risk giving away the solution prior to Wolfe&#x27;s climactic revelations. (However, despite his candor toward the reader, Archie occasionally discloses that he&#x27;s holding back some particularly private thought or event.)

From time to time Archie acknowledges the reader directly, by speculating as to whether we will be interested in this or that detail, showing us supposed copies of vital documents when the originals are no longer accessible to him at the time he is writing, or discussing whether we might have figured something out yet at a certain point in the narrative. He occasionally expresses mild concern that another character, such as Wolfe or Inspector Cramer, may read his account of the case and take offense at something he has written.

Archie&#x27;s narratorial wittiness includes a repeatedly employed callback maneuver whereby he quotes a character using a striking or unusual turn of phrase, and then later uses the phrase himself, in some other context, in the course of his narration.

<doc id="144378" wikidata="Q4741350" url="?curid=144378" title="Amberjack">
<text>Amberjacks are Atlantic and Pacific fish in the genus &quot;Seriola&quot; of the family Carangidae. They are widely consumed across the world in various cultures, most notably for Pacific amberjacks in Japanese cuisine; they are most often found in the warmer parts of the oceans. There are many variations of amberjack, including greater amberjack (Atlantic), lesser amberjack (Atlantic), Almaco jack (Pacific), yellowtail (Pacific), and the banded rudderfish (Atlantic). Though most of the Seriola species are considered &quot;amberjacks&quot;, the species &quot;Seriola hippos&quot; (samson fish) is not.

== Atlantic types ==

=== Greater amberjacks ===

Greater amberjacks, &quot;Seriola dumerili&quot;, are the largest of the jacks. They usually have dark stripes extending from nose to in front of their dorsal fins. They have no scutes and soft dorsal bases less than twice the length of the anal fin bases. They are usually 18 kg (40 pounds) or less, and are found associated with rocky reefs, debris, and wrecks, typically in 20 to 75 m (10 to 40 fathoms). Greater amberjacks are also found in the Pacific.

=== Lesser amberjacks ===

Lesser amberjacks, &quot;Seriola fasciata&quot;, have proportionately larger eyes and deeper bodies than greater amberjacks. They are olive green or brownish-black with silver sides, and usually have a dark band extending upward from their eyes. Juveniles have split or wavy bars on their sides. The adults are usually under 5 kg (10 lbs). They are found deeper than other jacks, commonly 50 to 130 m (30 to 70 fathoms).

Amberjacks are voracious predators, which feed on squid, fish, and crustaceans, and are thought to spawn offshore throughout most of the year.

Juveniles can be caught in about of water, near floating objects.

=== Banded rudderfish ===
Banded rudderfish, &quot;Seriola zonata&quot;, is the second-smallest amberjack. This jack can be distinguished from the pilot fish by the presence of a first dorsal fin. Juveniles are banded vertically like pilotfish, and follow large objects or animals. Large individuals (over 10 inches) have no bands. This fish, though commonly caught, is rarely identified. Large ones, with a raccoon-stripe on the eye and an iridescent gold stripe on the side, are usually called amberjacks when caught, and juveniles are called pilotfish. They are found as far north as Nova Scotia. They are less dependent on sharks, etc., than pilotfish. They can be caught on shrimp, silversides, lures (e.g. spoons), and flies.

=== Others ===

Other species exist in other parts of the world, such as: yellowtail amberjack (including the Asian yellowtail, the California yellowtail, and yellowtail kingfish or southern yellowtail), Almaco jack, and Japanese amberjack (five-ray yellowtail).

== Biology ==
Amberjacks are predators. They primarily feed on pelagic and benthic fish, though their prey also includes squid, crustaceans, sardines and bigeye scad. Younger juvenile jacks tend to feed on plankton and small invertebrates.

Greater Amberjacks mature at around 4 years old, and migrate in late spring to early summer (March to June) to reproduce. They migrate to deeper water to spawn, producing their young near shipwrecks or large objects as a safe haven.

Females are much larger than males, and have a longer life expectancy. The maximum lifespan for females is 17 years, whilst the average is 10 due to popular demand for them in big game fishing and as a high-quality food fish.

Amberjacks are not at top of the food chain in their habitat, and therefore are prone to being prey for yellowfin tuna, sharks and other larger fish.

<text>The Alabama Hills are a range of hills and rock formations near the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada in the Owens Valley, west of Lone Pine in Inyo County, California.

Though geographically separate from the Sierra Nevada, they are part of the same geological formation.

== Alabama Hills National Scenic Area ==

Beginning on May 24, 1969, the Alabama Hills were managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the Alabama Hills Recreation Area. In March 2019, the U.S. Congress redesignated the area as the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area.

== Camping ==
The Alabama Hills serve as a gateway to Mount Whitney and the Eastern Sierra Nevada. While dispersed camping is very popular with the backpackers, car campers, and the RV community, the region&#x27;s fragile ecosystem and increasing numbers of visitors prompted the Bureau of Land Management to discourage the practice, appealing that camping in campgrounds helps maintain the area&#x27;s great scenery and recreational opportunities. 

The City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power lands in the area are open for day use only.&quot;

== Geology ==
Two main types of rock are exposed at the Alabama Hills, an orange, drab weathered metamorphosed volcanic rock that is 150200 million years old, and an 85-million-year-old biotite monzogranite which weathers to large roundish boulders, many of which stand on end due to spheroidal weathering acting on many nearly vertical joints in the rock.
The rounded contours of the Alabama Hills contrast with the sharp ridges of the Sierra Nevada to the west. Though this might suggest that they formed from a different rock, the Sierra Nevada peaks that loom above the hills are also formed from monzogranite. The difference in shape and color can be accounted for by a difference in weathering.

Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, towers nine thousand feet above this low range, which itself is above the floor of Owens Valley. Gravity surveys indicate that the Owens Valley is filled with about of sediment and that the hills are the tip of a very steep escarpment. This feature was created by the same fault system as the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake which, in a single event, caused a vertical displacement of .
Dozens of natural arches are among the main attractions at the Alabama Hills. They can be accessed by short hikes from the Whitney Portal Road, the Movie Flat Road and the Horseshoe Meadows Road. Among the notable features of the area are: Mobius Arch, Lathe Arch, the Eye of Alabama and Whitney Portal Arch.

== History ==
The Alabama Hills were named for the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, a Confederate warship deployed during the American Civil War. When news of the ship&#x27;s exploits reached prospectors in California sympathetic to the Confederates, they named many mining claims after the ship, and the name came to be applied to the entire range. When the &quot;Alabama&quot; was finally sunk off the coast of Normandy by the USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; in 1864, prospectors sympathetic to the Union named a mining district, a mountain pass, a mountain peak, and a town after the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;.

== Filming location ==
The Alabama Hills are a popular filming location for television and movie productions, especially Westerns set in an archetypical rugged, isolated milieu. The first known movies to be filmed there are the lost films &quot;Water, Water Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Cupid, the Cowpuncher,&quot; both shot in 1919 and released in early 1920. The oldest surviving film shot in the hills is &quot;The Round-Up&quot; (1920), starring Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, which includes a cameo from his friend, Buster Keaton.

Since then, hundreds of movies have been filmed there, including: &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, &quot;The Walking Hills&quot;, &quot;Yellow Sky&quot;, &quot;Springfield Rifle&quot;, &quot;The Violent Men&quot;, &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot;, the Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott &quot;Ranown&quot; cycle, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, &quot;Joe Kidd&quot;, &quot;Saboteur,&quot; and &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, &quot;Tremors, Iron Man,&quot; and &quot;The Monolith Monsters&quot;. 

Among the television shows that have been shot there are &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Bonanza,&quot; and &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;.

In Lone Pine, the closest town to the Alabama Hills, the Lone Pine Film History Museum explores the area&#x27;s relationship to the art of cinema. Exhibits include the Dr. King Schultz dentist wagon from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, the 1937 Plymouth Humphrey Bogart drove in Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;High Sierra&quot;. and a Graboid underground monster from &quot;Tremors&quot;. 

Every Fall the Museum hosts the Lone Pine Film Festival, which bills itself as &quot;the only film festival on location&quot;, because festival-goers watch films shot in the area and then take tours to see the very spots where the scenes were filmed.

== Astronomy ==
The Alabama Hills feature exceptional skies for Central California. It is Bortle class 2 or &quot;average dark sky&quot; site; this low level of light pollution meets or exceeds conditions in many of other popular nearby areas for amateur astronomy, such as Joshua Tree National Park (Bortle class 2–4). On a clear night with no moon, a visitor with good, dark-adapted vision may see the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies with the unaided eye; the central Milky Way appears highly structured under these conditions.

<doc id="144386" wikidata="Q156315" url="?curid=144386" title="Voyager Golden Record">
<text>The Voyager Golden Records are two identical phonograph records one of each which were included aboard the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and data to reconstruct raster scan images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form who may find them. The records are a time capsule.

Although neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; will pass within 1.6 light-years&#x27; distance of the star Gliese 445, currently in the constellation Camelopardalis, in about 40,000 years.

Carl Sagan noted that &quot;The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space, but the launching of this &#x27;bottle&#x27; into the cosmic &#x27;ocean&#x27; says something very hopeful about life on this planet.&quot;

== Background ==
The &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth. Both &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; have reached interstellar space, the region between stars where the galactic plasma is present. Like their predecessors &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot;, which featured a simple plaque, both &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; were launched by NASA with a message aboard—a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of humans on Earth.

== Contents ==
The contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 116 images (one used for calibration) and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of birds and whales). To this they added audio content to represent humanity: spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, including a spoken greeting in English by U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim and a greeting by Sagan&#x27;s six-year-old son, Nick; other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan&#x27;s); the inspirational message &quot;Per aspera ad astra&quot; in Morse code; and musical selections from different cultures and eras. The record also includes a printed message from U.S. president Jimmy Carter.

The collection of images includes many photographs and diagrams both in black and white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the Solar System and its planets, DNA, and human anatomy and reproduction. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of chemical composition. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the universe.

The musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as J. S. Bach (interpreted by Glenn Gould), Mozart, Beethoven (played by the Budapest String Quartet), and Stravinsky. The disc also includes music by Guan Pinghu, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry, Kesarbai Kerkar, Valya Balkanska, and electronic composer Laurie Spiegel, as well as Azerbaijani folk music (Mugham) by oboe player Kamil Jalilov. The inclusion of Berry&#x27;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; was controversial, with some claiming that rock music was &quot;adolescent&quot;, to which Sagan replied, &quot;There are a lot of adolescents on the planet.&quot; The selection of music for the record was completed by a team composed of Carl Sagan as project director, Linda Salzman Sagan, Frank Drake, Alan Lomax, Ann Druyan as creative director, artist Jon Lomberg, ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown, Timothy Ferris as producer, and Jimmy Iovine as sound engineer. It also included the sounds of humpbacked whales from the 1970 album by Roger Payne, &quot;Songs of the Humpback Whale&quot;.

The Golden Record also carries an hour-long recording of the brainwaves of Ann Druyan. During the recording of the brainwaves, Druyan thought of many topics, including Earth&#x27;s history, civilizations and the problems they face, and what it was like to fall in love.

After NASA had received criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included. However, the record does contain &quot;Diagram of vertebrate evolution&quot;, by Jon Lomberg, with drawings of an anatomically correct naked male and naked female, showing external organs. The person waving on the diagram was also changed: on the Pioneer plaque, the man is waving, while on the &quot;Vertebrate evolution&quot; image, the woman is waving.

The pulsar map and hydrogen molecule diagram are shared in common with the Pioneer plaque.

The 116 images (one used for calibration) are encoded in analogue form and composed of 512 vertical lines. The remainder of the record is audio, designed to be played at revolutions per minute.

Jimmy Iovine, who was still early in his career as a music producer, served as sound engineer for the project at the recommendation of John Lennon, who was contacted to contribute but was unable to take part.

Sagan&#x27;s team wanted to include the Beatles 1969 song &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on the record, but the record company EMI, which held the copyrights, declined. In the 1978 book &quot;Murmurs of Earth&quot;, the failure to secure permission for the song is cited as one of the legal challenges faced by the team compiling the Voyager Golden Record. In the book, Sagan said that the Beatles favoured the idea, but &quot;[they] did not own the copyright, and the legal status of the piece seemed too murky to risk.&quot; When asked about the obstacle presented by EMI with regard to &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, despite the artists&#x27; wishes, Ann Druyan said in 2015: &quot;Yeah, that was one of those cases of having to see the tragedy of our planet. Here&#x27;s a chance to send a piece of music into the distant future and distant time, and to give it this kind of immortality, and they&#x27;re worried about money ... we got this telegram [from EMI] saying that it will be $50,000 per record for two records, and the entire Voyager record cost $18,000 to produce.&quot; However, this was denied in 2017 by Timothy Ferris; in his recollection, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; was not seriously considered for inclusion.

In July 2015, NASA uploaded the audio contents of the record to the audio streaming service SoundCloud.

== Playback ==
In the upper left-hand corner of the record cover is a drawing of the phonograph record and the stylus carried with it. The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary notation is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side of the record—about an hour (more precisely, between 53 and 54 minutes).

The information in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs at the start of a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog television (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the &quot;picture lines&quot;, about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered &quot;interlace&quot; to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture raster, showing that there are 512 (29) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly. A circle was used in this picture to ensure that the recipients use the correct ratio of horizontal to vertical height in picture reconstruction. Color images were represented by three images in sequence, one each for red, green, and blue components of the image. A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.

The drawing in the lower left-hand corner of the cover is the pulsar map previously sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11. It shows the location of the Solar System with respect to 14 pulsars, whose precise periods are given. The drawing containing two circles in the lower right-hand corner is a drawing of the hydrogen atom in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale, both for the time given on the cover and in the decoded pictures.

==Manufacturing==
Blank records were provided by the Pyral S.A. of Créteil, France. CBS Records contracted the JVC Cutting Center in Boulder, Colorado to cut the lacquer masters which were then sent to the James G. Lee record-processing center in Gardena, California to cut and gold-plate eight Voyager records. After the records were plated they were mounted in aluminum containers and delivered to JPL.

The record is a copper disk in diameter plated first with nickel and then gold. The record&#x27;s cover is aluminum and electroplated upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope uranium-238. Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.468 billion years. It is possible (e.g., via mass spectrometry) that a civilization that encounters the record will be able to use the ratio of remaining uranium to the other elements to determine the age of the record.

The records also had the inscription &quot;To the makers of music – all worlds, all times&quot; hand-etched on its surface. The inscription was located in the &quot;takeout grooves&quot;, an area of the record between the label and playable surface. Since this was not in the original specifications, the record was initially rejected, to be replaced with a blank disc. Sagan later convinced the administrator to include the record as is.


== Journey ==

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was launched in 1977, passed the orbit of Pluto in 1990, and left the Solar System (in the sense of passing the termination shock) in November 2004. It is now in the Kuiper belt. In about 40,000 years, it and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; will each come to within about 1.8 light-years of two separate stars: &quot;Voyager 1&quot; will have approached star Gliese 445, located in the constellation Camelopardalis, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; will have approached star Ross 248, located in the constellation of Andromeda.

In May 2005, it was reported that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had entered the heliosheath, the region beyond the termination shock. The termination shock is where the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically charged gas blowing continuously outward from the Sun, is slowed by pressure from gas between the stars. At the termination shock, the solar wind slows abruptly from its average speed of and becomes denser and hotter.

In March 2012, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was over 17.9 billion km from the Sun and traveling at a speed of 3.6 AU per year (approximately ), while &quot;Voyager 2&quot; was over 14.7 billion km away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year (approximately ).

On September 12, 2013, NASA announced that &quot;Voyager 1&quot; had left the heliosheath and entered interstellar space, although it still remains within the Sun&#x27;s gravitational sphere of influence.

Of the eleven instruments carried on &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, four are still operational and continue to send back data. It is expected that at least one science instrument will remain operational through 2025 and that engineering data could be transmitted for several more years afterward.

== Publications ==
Most of the images used on the record (reproduced in black and white), together with information about its compilation, can be found in the 1978 book &quot;Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record&quot; by Carl Sagan, F. D. Drake, Ann Druyan, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg, and Linda Salzman. A CD-ROM version was issued by Warner New Media in 1992. Author Ann Druyan, who later married Carl Sagan, wrote about the Voyager Record in the epilogue of Sagan&#x27;s final book &quot;Billions and Billions&quot; (1997).

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the record, Ozma Records launched a Kickstarter project to release the record contents in LP format as part of a box set also containing a hardcover book, turntable slipmat, and art print. The Kickstarter was successfully funded with over $1.4 million raised. Ozma Records then produced another edition of the three-disc LP vinyl record box set that also includes the audio content of the Golden Record, softcover book containing the images encoded on the record, images sent back by &quot;Voyager&quot;, commentary from Ferris, art print, turntable slipmat, and a collector&#x27;s box. This edition was released in February 2018 along with a 2xCD-Book edition. In January 2018, Ozma Records&#x27; &quot;Voyager Golden Record; 40th Anniversary Edition&quot; won a Grammy Award for best boxed or limited-edition package.

<text>Five ships of the British Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot;, after the sceptre, a symbol of royal authority.

* The first , launched in 1781, was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line. She was lost with 291 hands during a violent storm in Table Bay, near the Cape of Good Hope, when a series of anchor cables parted in the rising winds on 5 November 1799.
* The second , launched in 1802, was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line. In 1815, she was decommissioned at Chatham. Her final years were spent in the Channel blockade of the French before she was finally broken up in 1821.
* The third , launched in 1917, was an . She survived World War I and was sold for disposal in 1926.
* The fourth , launched in 1943, was a 1940-programme S-class submarine. She served in World War II and was sold to BISCO for scrap in August 1949.
* The present , launched in 1976, is a nuclear submarine.

<text>Gregory Howe (born December 8, 1963) is an American guitarist and composer. An active musician across four decades, he has released ten studio albums in addition to collaborating with a wide variety of artists.

==Recording career==
===Solo===
After leaving high school and playing the club circuit around the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania areas with his brother Albert Howe (a singer) for most of the 1980s, Greg Howe officially began his solo career after sending a demo tape to Shrapnel Records in 1987, upon which he was immediately signed by founder Mike Varney. His self-titled debut album, &quot;Greg Howe&quot;, was released in 1988 during the popular shred era, and went on to become his highest-selling album; a 2009 article in &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine ranked it tenth in the all-time top ten list of shred albums.

The following year, he joined with Albert to form a Van Halen-inspired hard rock group named Howe II. Through Shrapnel, they released two studio albums: &quot;High Gear&quot; (1989) and &quot;Now Hear This&quot; (1991). His second solo album, &quot;Introspection&quot;, was released in 1993. At this point his style had changed radically from the straightforward instrumental rock of both his debut and the Howe II albums, to a more jazz fusion-laden approach which remains unique and identifiable to this day; some of his signature traits being fast left-hand legato passages (having been influenced greatly by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth), and the frequent use of tapping and odd time signatures. One particularly noteworthy aspect of Howe&#x27;s legato technique is the &quot;hammer-on from nowhere&quot;, in which a note is hammered-on to a different string without first being picked.

A trio of albums spanning the middle part of the decade – &quot;Uncertain Terms&quot; (1994), &quot;Parallax&quot; (1995) and &quot;Five&quot; (1996) – were all a consistent evolution of the sound he had adopted on &quot;Introspection&quot;. During this time he collaborated twice with guitarist Richie Kotzen for the albums &quot;Tilt&quot; and &quot;Project&quot; in 1995 and 1997, respectively. He then briefly dabbled with a heavier, neo-classical metal style for his 1999 release, &quot;Ascend&quot;, which featured keyboardist Vitalij Kuprij. Howe has since spoken of his dissatisfaction for that project, as well as an earlier collaboration on Kuprij&#x27;s own album, &quot;High Definition&quot; (1997).

After switching labels to Shrapnel&#x27;s jazz-oriented counterpart, Tone Center Records, he returned to his familiar style with &quot;Hyperacuity&quot; (2000), which still stands as some of his most prominent experimentation with jazz fusion. After a highly troubled recording process for &quot;Extraction&quot; (2003) – a collaboration with drummer Dennis Chambers and bassist Victor Wooten – he took an extended hiatus from recording solo material until the release of his eighth studio album, &quot;Sound Proof&quot;, in 2008. It would be another nine years until Howe&#x27;s next solo release, &quot;Wheelhouse&quot;, in 2017, which has been described as his &quot;most personal work to date&quot; and marks his return to solo instrumental work. For one track of the album, &quot;Shady Lane&quot;, Richie Kotzen provided vocals.

In a 2015 article by &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Howe was ranked tenth in the &quot;Top 10 Pick Squealers of All Time&quot;. In December 2019, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked Howe&#x27;s &quot;Wheelhouse&quot; album #6 in &quot;The 20 best guitar albums of the decade&quot;.

===Maragold===
In 2012 it was announced that Howe would play in a new band named Maragold, which would include drummer Gianluca Palmieri (who previously played on &quot;Sound Proof&quot;), bassist Kevin Vecchione (from &quot;Five&quot;), and singer Meghan Krauss. A promotional video was uploaded to YouTube on October 6, 2012, and the band&#x27;s self-titled album was released on April 23, 2013. They would also release three official music videos via YouTube. In a 2016 interview, Howe said that the band was no longer active.

==Session and touring career==
Currently residing in Las Vegas, Nevada (having previously lived in Easton, Pennsylvania until around 2006), Howe continues to work as a session musician and producer, as well as providing online guitar lessons through his official website. From 2010 onwards he has toured Europe for the first time, having long stated a desire to tour the continent as a solo artist.

During his solo career, Howe has continuously made himself available as a session musician for many of the world&#x27;s biggest pop stars. Most recently he has played with artists such as Christina Aguilera, Rihanna, Lady Antebellum, P Diddy, T-Pain and Salt-n-Pepa. In 1996, he replaced Jennifer Batten as primary guitarist during the Asian and European legs of singer Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;HIS&quot;tory World Tour. He would later provide guitar duties for singer Enrique Iglesias in 2000, which culminated in a series of high-profile televised performances and a European tour. The following two years saw Howe recruited as lead guitarist for boy band &#x27;N Sync during two tours of the United States. After singer Justin Timberlake left &#x27;N Sync, Howe continued to tour with him in 2003.

Eight years later, Howe teamed up again with Timberlake, as well as rapper T.I., for a performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards. In the same year, Howe played as part of keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson&#x27;s Ultimate Zero Project, in a line-up which included bassists Tony Levin and John Wetton, and drummers Marco Minnemann and Simon Phillips. In 2011, Howe toured Vladivostok, Italy and Israel with drummer Dennis Chambers and bassist Stu Hamm. In November of that year, Michael Jackson&#x27;s second posthumous album, &quot;Immortal&quot;, featured Howe&#x27;s playing on &quot;Dancing Machine&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;.

===Protocol===
In 2017 Howe joined the band Protocol, featuring Simon Phillips on drums, Ernest Tibbs on bass, and Otmaro Ruiz on keyboard. The &quot;Protocol 4&quot; album was nominated for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album at the 61st Grammy Awards.

==Equipment==
As of 2017, Howe is endorsed by DV Mark amplification, who released a &#x27;Maragold&#x27; signature amplifier in 2014. He is also endorsed by DiMarzio, D&#x27;Addario and Floyd Rose. His effects pedals include Carl Martin, Pigtronix and T-Rex. Also in 2014, Howe was endorsed by Kiesel Guitars, who released a signature &#x27;GH24 model in February 2015. A second signature guitar called the GH3 was released in 2017 by Kiesel Guitars. This guitar featured a three single coil pickups mounted on a pickguard giving it a look similar to the Fender Stratocaster. Kiesel also offers the option of having a Seymour Duncan humbucking pickup in the bridge position of the GH3. As of Feb 2022, Kiesel Guitars offers a Greg Howe signature guitar, with various customizable features such as number of frets and fingerboard wood, with a fixed two single coil, one (bridge) humbucker pickup layout.

<text>Charles Sheffield (25 June 1935 – 2 November 2002), was an English-born mathematician, physicist, and science-fiction writer who served as a President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and of the American Astronautical Society.

His novel &quot;The Web Between the Worlds&quot;, featuring the construction of a space elevator, was published almost simultaneously with Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel on the subject, &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; - a coincidence that amused them both. Excerpts from both Sheffield&#x27;s &quot;The Web Between the Worlds&quot; and Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; have appeared recently in a space-elevator anthology, &quot;Towering Yarns&quot;.

Sheffield served as Chief Scientist of Earth Satellite Corporation, a company that processed remote-sensing satellite data. The association gave rise to many technical papers and two popular non-fiction books, &quot;Earthwatch&quot; (1981) and &quot;Man on Earth&quot; (1983), both collections of false-colour and enhanced images of Earth from space.

He won the Nebula and Hugo awards for his 1993 novelette &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; and the 1992 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel for his 1992 novel &quot;Brother to Dragons&quot;.

Sheffield was Toastmaster at BucConeer, the 1998 World Science Fiction Convention in Baltimore. He was also a former President of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writes of America.

Before he died, he was writing a column for the Baen Books web-site; his last column concerned the discovery of the brain tumor that led to his death.

== Personal life ==

Charles Sheffield attended St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Double First in Mathematics and Physics. During his studies he met and later married his first wife, Sarah Sanderson, whose death in 1977 became the catalyst for his writing career. They had a son, Charles Christopher (&quot;Kit&quot;), and a daughter, Ann Elizabeth. The family soon after moved to the United States, where Sheffield began working in the field of practical physics, a career that would lead him to a consultancy with NASA and the role of chief scientist at the Earth Satellite Corporation in Washington.

In response to the traumatic grief from the death of his wife Sarah to cancer (in 1977), Sheffield began a second career as a science fiction author, winning both the prestigious Nebula and Hugo awards and serving as President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (1984–1986). He maintained two successful careers, consulting for various scientific corporations while earning fame for his hard science fiction. During this period he lived in Washington, DC, and met and married Linda Zall, a fellow scientist, and had two daughters, Elizabeth Rose and Victoria Jane.

At the time of his death, he was married to writer Nancy Kress, and lived with his children in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<doc id="144415" wikidata="Q497850" url="?curid=144415" title="The Santa Clause">
<text>The Santa Clause is a 1994 American Christmas fantasy comedy film directed by John Pasquin and written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick. The first instalment in &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; franchise, it stars Tim Allen as Scott Calvin, an ordinary man who accidentally causes Santa Claus to fall from his roof to his death on Christmas Eve. When he and his young son, Charlie, finish the late St. Nick&#x27;s trip and deliveries, they go to the North Pole where Scott learns that he must become the new Santa and convince those he loves that he is indeed Santa Claus.

&quot;The Santa Clause&quot; premiered at Hollywood on November 5, 1994, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 11. It grossed $190 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics, and it has since become a Christmas-time staple among viewers. Its success led to two sequels, &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot; (2006), which were both financially successful despite the former&#x27;s mixed and the latter&#x27;s negative reception. The franchise continues with a follow-up series, &quot;The Santa Clauses&quot;, which premiered November 16, 2022 on Disney+.

The film was originally going to be released under the Hollywood Pictures banner, but following positive test screenings among children, it was transferred to the Walt Disney Pictures banner.

== Plot ==

37-year-old Scott Calvin is a marketing director for a toy company in Lakeside, Illinois, who prepares to spend Christmas Eve with his 6-year-old son Charlie. Scott wants Charlie to maintain his belief in Santa Claus, despite not believing himself. Scott&#x27;s ex-wife Laura and her psychiatrist husband Dr. Neal Miller stopped believing in Santa at a young age and feel it is time for Charlie to do the same.

Following an evening at Denny&#x27;s (after Scott accidentally burned the dinner at home), Scott and Charlie are awakened that night by a noise on the roof. While investigating, Scott startles Santa Claus, who falls off the roof. Santa&#x27;s body vanishes, leaving behind a red suit and business card stating that if anything were to happen to him, someone should put on the suit and the reindeer will know what to do. Scott and Charlie find Santa’s sleigh and reindeer on the roof. At Charlie&#x27;s request, Scott reluctantly dons the suit and spends the rest of the night delivering gifts before the reindeer take them to the North Pole.

It turns out that, by putting on the suit, Scott is subject to a legal technicality known as &quot;the Santa Clause,&quot; and has accepted all of the late Santa&#x27;s duties and responsibilities. The head elf, Bernard, gives Scott 11 months to get his affairs in order before reporting back to the North Pole on Thanksgiving. Overwhelmed, Scott changes into pajamas provided to him and falls asleep. The next morning, Scott awakes in his own bed and believes the previous events were a dream, but realizes he is still wearing the pajamas given to him. Charlie is proud that his father is the new Santa Claus, and this arouses concern in Laura, Neal, and the school staff. Scott, not wanting to destroy Charlie&#x27;s newfound enthusiasm, asks him to keep their North Pole trip a secret.

Over the next year, Scott undergoes a drastic change; he gains a large amount of weight and develops an increased fondness for sweets, particularly milk and cookies. He also develops a white beard that instantly regrows after shaving, and his hair turns white in spite of attempts to dye it. During a meeting with his company, Scott is angered at a proposal to advertise a toy military tank by showing Santa riding it. Scott also begins to recount &#x27;naughty&#x27; and &#x27;nice&#x27; children by name when he sees them. After Laura and Neal witness children wanting to sit on Scott&#x27;s lap at Charlie&#x27;s soccer game, they convince a judge that he is a danger to Charlie&#x27;s welfare and have his visitation rights suspended.

On Thanksgiving, a devastated Scott goes to Laura and Neal&#x27;s house to see Charlie one last time. Charlie, desperate to help Scott realize how important he is to the children of the world, shows him a magical snow globe (a gift from Bernard), convincing Scott that he really is Santa. When Laura and Neal allow Scott a minute to talk to Charlie alone, Bernard arrives and takes them both to the North Pole. Thinking Scott has kidnapped Charlie, Laura and Neal call the police.

On Christmas Eve, Scott sets out to deliver gifts with Charlie in tow. Upon arriving at Laura and Neal&#x27;s home, Scott is arrested while Charlie waits for him in the sleigh. The elves eventually break him out of jail. Scott returns Charlie to his house and insists he spend Christmas with Laura and Neal. His heartfelt speech to Charlie about the importance of everyone in the family convinces Laura and Neal that he is Santa. Laura burns the suspension papers and tells him he can visit anytime. Bernard assures Charlie that anytime he shakes his snow globe, his father will appear. Before leaving, Scott gives Laura and Neal the two presents that they never got as children, which caused their disbelief in Santa. His takeoff from the roof proves his identity to the police and various witnesses outside the house. After Scott leaves, Charlie summons him back with the snow globe, and Laura agrees to let them go together in the sleigh to finish delivering the presents.

== Production ==
The script was written on spec by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti. In November 1992, it was announced Hollywood Pictures had acquired the script as a potential starring vehicle for Tim Allen.

The film was shot at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California, and on location in the Greater Toronto Area, with Oakville serving as the city of Lakeside, Illinois. The reindeer used in the film were all from the Toronto Zoo. The trains used in the North Pole scene and the start of the film were all made by LGB. Eric Lloyd had to wear fake teeth and part of his dialogue was rearranged after he knocked out his teeth in an accident on a day off.

Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were offered the role of Scott Calvin, but both turned it down; Chase declined due to scheduling conflicts, and Murray did not want to do another holiday-themed movie after doing &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Tom Selleck, Robin Williams, Tom Hanks, and Mel Gibson were also considered for the role. Jeff Daniels, Stanley Tucci, Christopher McDonald, and Bradley Whitford were considered for the role of Neal Miller. Patricia Richardson, Patricia Clarkson, Patricia Heaton, and Kate Burton were considered for the role of Laura Miller.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Santa Clause&quot; grossed $145.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45 million in other territories, for a worldwide, total of $190.3 million.

The film grossed $19.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the US box office behind &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; which opened with $36 million. In its second weekend it grossed $17.1 million, finishing third. Over the three-day Thanksgiving frame it then made $20.4 million. In November 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic limiting new releases, &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; was re-released into 1,581 theaters and grossed $711,000.

Freeform and AMC have played the film on television during the holiday season with record ratings.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Santa Clause&quot; is utterly undemanding, but it&#x27;s firmly rooted in the sort of good old-fashioned holiday spirit missing from too many modern yuletide films.&quot; 
On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Sandi Davis of &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; ended up placing the film sixth overall on her list of the best films of 1994.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Santa Clause&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 25, 1995.

At one point in the film, a brief exchange between Scott and Laura takes place in which Laura hands Scott a piece of paper with Neal&#x27;s mother&#x27;s phone number on it. Scott then says &quot;1-800-SPANK-ME. I know that number.&quot; In 1996, this line caused an incident in which a child from Steilacoom, Washington called the number (which turned out to be an actual, working sex line number) and incurred a phone bill of . Beginning with the 1999 DVD release, the exchange was removed from all future United States home media releases of the film (though it remains in the earlier released VHS and LaserDisc releases) and most digital downloads. The line is also removed from the Disney+ print. On television broadcasts, the number is changed to 1-800-POUND.

A special edition DVD of &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; was released on DVD on October 29, 2002, and was presented in widescreen and fullscreen versions.

<text>Jacobus Balduinus (about 1175 – 10 April 1235) was an Italian jurist.

Balduinus was born in Bologna probably about 1175, and is reputed to have been of a noble family. He was a pupil of Azo, and the master of Odofredus, of the canonist Hostiensis (Henricus de Segusio), and of Jacobus de Ravanis (Jacques de Revigny), who taught at Orléans. His great fame as a professor of civil law at the University of Bologna caused Balduinus to be elected podestà of the city of Genoa, where he was entrusted with the reforms of the law of the Genoese Republic. He died at Bologna in 1235, and has left behind him some treatises on procedure.

<doc id="144417" wikidata="Q2092045" url="?curid=144417" title="Comoving and proper distances">
<text>In standard cosmology, comoving distance and proper distance (or physical distance) are two closely related distance measures used by cosmologists to define distances between objects. &quot;Comoving distance&quot; factors out the expansion of the universe, giving a distance that does not change in time except due to local factors, such as the motion of a galaxy within a cluster. &quot;Proper distance&quot; roughly corresponds to where a distant object would be at a specific moment of cosmological time, which can change over time due to the expansion of the universe. Comoving distance and proper distance are defined to be equal at the present time. At other times, the Universe&#x27;s expansion results in the proper distance changing, while the comoving distance remains constant.

==Comoving coordinates==
Although general relativity allows the formulation of the laws of physics using arbitrary coordinates, some coordinate choices are more natural or easier to work with. Comoving coordinates are an example of such a natural coordinate choice. They assign constant spatial coordinate values to observers who perceive the universe as isotropic. Such observers are called &quot;comoving&quot; observers because they move along with the Hubble flow.
A comoving observer is the only observer who will perceive the universe, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, to be isotropic. Non-comoving observers will see regions of the sky systematically blue-shifted or red-shifted. Thus isotropy, particularly isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, defines a special local frame of reference called the comoving frame. The velocity of an observer relative to the local comoving frame is called the peculiar velocity of the observer.

Most large lumps of matter, such as galaxies, are nearly comoving, so that their peculiar velocities (owing to gravitational attraction) are small compared to their Hubble-flow velocity seen by observers in moderately nearby galaxies, (i.e. as seen from galaxies just outside the group local to the observed &quot;lump of matter&quot;).
The comoving time coordinate is the elapsed time since the Big Bang according to a clock of a comoving observer and is a measure of cosmological time. The comoving spatial coordinates tell where an event occurs while cosmological time tells when an event occurs. Together, they form a complete coordinate system, giving both the location and time of an event.

Space in comoving coordinates is usually referred to as being &quot;static&quot;, as most bodies on the scale of galaxies or larger are approximately comoving, and comoving bodies have static, unchanging comoving coordinates. So for a given pair of comoving galaxies, while the proper distance between them would have been smaller in the past and will become larger in the future due to the expansion of the universe, the comoving distance between them remains &quot;constant&quot; at all times.

The expanding Universe has an increasing scale factor which explains how constant comoving distances are reconciled with proper distances that increase with time.

==Comoving distance and proper distance==
Comoving distance is the distance between two points measured along a path defined at the present cosmological time. For objects moving with the Hubble flow, it is deemed to remain constant in time. The comoving distance from an observer to a distant object (e.g. galaxy) can be computed by the following formula (derived using the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric):
formula_1
where &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;′) is the scale factor, &quot;t&quot;e is the time of emission of the photons detected by the observer, &quot;t&quot; is the present time, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum.

Despite being an integral over time, this expression gives the correct distance that would be measured by a set of comoving local rulers at fixed time &quot;t&quot;, i.e. the &quot;proper distance&quot; (as defined below) after accounting for the time-dependent &quot;comoving speed of light&quot; via the inverse scale factor term formula_2 in the integrand. By &quot;comoving speed of light&quot;, we mean the velocity of light &quot;through&quot; comoving coordinates [formula_3] which is time-dependent even though &quot;locally&quot;, at any point along the null geodesic of the light particles, an observer in an inertial frame always measures the speed of light as formula_4 in accordance with special relativity. For a derivation see &quot;Appendix A: Standard general relativistic definitions of expansion and horizons&quot; from Davis &amp; Lineweaver 2004. In particular, see &quot;eqs&quot;. 16–22 in the referenced 2004 paper [note: in that paper the scale factor formula_5 is defined as a quantity with the dimension of distance while the radial coordinate formula_6 is dimensionless.]

===Definitions===
Many textbooks use the symbol formula_7 for the comoving distance. However, this formula_7 must be distinguished from the coordinate distance formula_9 in the commonly used comoving coordinate system for a FLRW universe where the metric takes the form (in reduced-circumference polar coordinates, which only works half-way around a spherical universe):
formula_10

In this case the comoving coordinate distance formula_9 is related to formula_7 by:
formula_13

Most textbooks and research papers define the comoving distance between comoving observers to be a fixed unchanging quantity independent of time, while calling the dynamic, changing distance between them &quot;proper distance&quot;. On this usage, comoving and proper distances are numerically equal at the current age of the universe, but will differ in the past and in the future; if the comoving distance to a galaxy is denoted formula_7, the proper distance formula_15 at an arbitrary time formula_16 is simply given by 
formula_17 
where formula_18 is the scale factor (e.g. Davis &amp; Lineweaver 2004). The proper distance formula_15 between two galaxies at time &quot;t&quot; is just the distance that would be measured by rulers between them at that time.

===Uses of the proper distance===
Cosmological time is identical to locally measured time for an observer at a fixed comoving spatial position, that is, in the local comoving frame. Proper distance is also equal to the locally measured distance in the comoving frame for nearby objects. To measure the proper distance between two distant objects, one imagines that one has many comoving observers in a straight line between the two objects, so that all of the observers are close to each other, and form a chain between the two distant objects. All of these observers must have the same cosmological time. Each observer measures their distance to the nearest observer in the chain, and the length of the chain, the sum of distances between nearby observers, is the total proper distance.

It is important to the definition of both comoving distance and proper distance in the cosmological sense (as opposed to proper length in special relativity) that all observers have the same cosmological age. For instance, if one measured the distance along a straight line or spacelike geodesic between the two points, observers situated between the two points would have different cosmological ages when the geodesic path crossed their own world lines, so in calculating the distance along this geodesic one would not be correctly measuring comoving distance or cosmological proper distance. Comoving and proper distances are not the same concept of distance as the concept of distance in special relativity. This can be seen by considering the hypothetical case of a universe empty of mass, where both sorts of distance can be measured. When the density of mass in the FLRW metric is set to zero (an empty &#x27;Milne universe&#x27;), then the cosmological coordinate system used to write this metric becomes a non-inertial coordinate system in the Minkowski spacetime of special relativity where surfaces of constant Minkowski proper-time τ appear as hyperbolas in the Minkowski diagram from the perspective of an inertial frame of reference. In this case, for two events which are simultaneous according to the cosmological time coordinate, the value of the cosmological proper distance is not equal to the value of the proper length between these same events, which would just be the distance along a straight line between the events in a Minkowski diagram (and a straight line is a geodesic in flat Minkowski spacetime), or the coordinate distance between the events in the inertial frame where they are simultaneous.

If one divides a change in proper distance by the interval of cosmological time where the change was measured (or takes the derivative of proper distance with respect to cosmological time) and calls this a &quot;velocity&quot;, then the resulting &quot;velocities&quot; of galaxies or quasars can be above the speed of light, &quot;c&quot;. Such superluminal expansion is not in conflict with special or general relativity nor the definitions used in physical cosmology. Even light itself does not have a &quot;velocity&quot; of &quot;c&quot; in this sense; the total velocity of any object can be expressed as the sum formula_20 where formula_21 is the recession velocity due to the expansion of the universe (the velocity given by Hubble&#x27;s law) and formula_22 is the &quot;peculiar velocity&quot; measured by local observers (with formula_23 and formula_24, the dots indicating a first derivative), so for light formula_22 is equal to &quot;c&quot; (−&quot;c&quot; if the light is emitted towards our position at the origin and +&quot;c&quot; if emitted away from us) but the total velocity formula_26 is generally different from &quot;c&quot;. Even in special relativity the coordinate speed of light is only guaranteed to be &quot;c&quot; in an inertial frame; in a non-inertial frame the coordinate speed may be different from &quot;c&quot;. In general relativity no coordinate system on a large region of curved spacetime is &quot;inertial&quot;, but in the local neighborhood of any point in curved spacetime we can define a &quot;local inertial frame&quot; in which the local speed of light is &quot;c&quot; and in which massive objects such as stars and galaxies always have a local speed smaller than &quot;c&quot;. The cosmological definitions used to define the velocities of distant objects are coordinate-dependent – there is no general coordinate-independent definition of velocity between distant objects in general relativity. How best to describe and popularize that expansion of the universe is (or at least was) very likely proceeding – at the greatest scale – at above the speed of light, has caused a minor amount of controversy. One viewpoint is presented in Davis and Lineweaver, 2004.

===Short distances vs. long distances===
Within small distances and short trips, the expansion of the universe during the trip can be ignored. This is because the travel time between any two points for a non-relativistic moving particle will just be the proper distance (that is, the comoving distance measured using the scale factor of the universe at the time of the trip rather than the scale factor &quot;now&quot;) between those points divided by the velocity of the particle. If the particle is moving at a relativistic velocity, the usual relativistic corrections for time dilation must be made.

<text>Baldus de Ubaldis (Italian: &quot;Baldo degli Ubaldi&quot;; 1327 – 28 April 1400) was an Italian jurist, and a leading figure in Medieval Roman Law and the school of Postglossators.

==Life==

A member of the noble family of the Ubaldi (Baldeschi), Baldus was born at Perugia in 1327, and studied civil law there under Bartolus de Saxoferrato, being admitted to the degree of doctor of civil law at the early age of seventeen. Federicus Petrucius of Siena is said to have been the master under whom he studied canon law.

Baldus had two brothers, Angelus (1328–1400) and Petrus (1335–1400). It is probably due to confusion between Baldus and his brother Petrus that the famous jurist&#x27;s name is sometimes given as Petrus Baldus de Ubaldis.

On his promotion to the doctorate he went to Bologna, where he taught law for three years, after which he was advanced to a professorship at Perugia, where he remained for thirty-three years, and he had among his students Francesco Albergotti. He subsequently taught law at Pisa, Florence, Padua and Pavia, the rivals to Bologna. During his period at Pavia he sometimes also taught at Piacenza. He died at Pavia on 28 April 1400 and was buried in the church of San Francesco.

Baldus was the master of Pierre Roger de Beaufort, who became pope under the title of Gregory XI, and whose immediate successor, Urban VI, summoned Baldus to Rome to assist him by his consultations in 1380 against the anti-pope Clement VII. Baldus&#x27; view on the legal issues relating to the schism are laid down in the so-called &quot;Questio de schismate&quot;. Cardinal Francesco Zabarella and Paulus Castrensis were also among his pupils.

==Works==
Many of Baldus&#x27; works are incomplete. He left voluminous commentaries on the &quot;Pandects&quot; and on the &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot;. His Commentary on the &quot;Libri Feudorum&quot;, a twelfth-century compilation of feudal law provisions, is considered to be one of his best works. He also commented on the canon law compilations of decretals, the &quot;Liber Extra&quot; and the &quot;Liber Sextus&quot;. In addition to these commentaries, Baldus wrote a number of treatises on specialised legal topics. His major effort, however, went into the writing of some 3,000 &quot;consilia&quot; (legal opinions). No other medieval lawyer has so many consilia preserved.

Baldus&#x27;s work on the law of evidence and the gradations of proof was a high point of medieval thought in the discipline and remained the standard treatment of the subject for centuries.

The jurist Flavio Torti (died 1622) wrote annotated observations on his work.

<text>Bahyā ibn Pāqudā (Bahya ben Joseph ibn Pakuda, Pekudah, Bakuda; , ), c. 1050–1120, was a Jewish philosopher and rabbi who lived in the Taifa of Zaragoza in al-Andalus (now Spain). He was one of two people now known as Rabbeinu Behaye, the other being the Bible commentator Bahya ben Asher.

==Life and works==
He was the author of the first Jewish system of ethics, &quot;Guidance to the Duties of the Heart,&quot; written around 1080&quot;.&quot; It was translated into Hebrew by Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon in the years 1161-80 under the title .

Little is known of his life except that he bore the title of dayan &quot;judge&quot; at the beth din. Bahya was thoroughly familiar with Jewish rabbinic literature and philosophical and scientific Arabic, Greek, and Roman literature, frequently quoting from the works of non-Jewish moral philosophers in his work.

In the introduction to &quot;Duties of the Heart&quot;, Bahya says that he wished to fill a great need in Jewish literature; he felt that neither the rabbis of the Talmud nor subsequent rabbis adequately brought all the ethical teachings of Judaism into a coherent system.

Bahya felt that many Jews paid attention only to the outward observance of halakha, &quot;the duties to be performed by the parts of the body&quot; (&quot;Hovot HaEvarim&quot;), without regard to the inner ideas and sentiments that should be embodied in the Jewish way of life, &quot;the duties of the heart&quot; (&quot;Hovot HaLev&quot;). He also felt that many disregarded all duties incumbent upon them, whether outward observances or inner moral obligations.

In his view, most people acted according to selfish, worldly motives. Bahya, therefore, felt compelled to attempt to present the Jewish faith as a great spiritual truth founded on reason, revelation (especially regarding the Torah), and Jewish tradition. He stressed the willingness and the joyful readiness of the God-loving heart to perform life&#x27;s duties. He wrote, &quot;It is impossible to think that the nations would recognize us as being wise and understanding if we were not to provide infallible proofs and explanations for the truths of the Torah and our faith.&quot;
Many Jewish writers familiar with his work consider him an original thinker of high rank. According to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;:

&quot;Duties of the Heart&quot; became a popular book among the Jews worldwide, and parts of it were once recited for devotional purposes during the days before Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

Ibn Paquda&#x27;s works inspired and shaped many later Jewish writers, including Berechiah ha-Nakdan in his encyclopedic philosophical work &quot;Sefer HaHibbur&quot;, &quot;The Book of Compilation.&quot;

==Neoplatonism==
He often followed the method of the anonymously-authored &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&#x27;&quot; ().

Bahya, inclined to contemplative mysticism and asceticism, eliminated from his system every element that he felt might obscure monotheism or interfere with halakha. He wanted to present a religious system that was at once lofty and pure and in full accord with reason.

Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant &quot;Nicotiana tabacum,&quot; which in turn is named after Jean Nicot de Villemain, who sent tobacco and seeds to Paris in 1560, presented it to the King Francis II, and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague.

==Early life==
Jean Nicot was born in 1530 in Nîmes, in the south of France. His father was a notary. He was educated in Toulouse and Paris.

==Career==
At 29-years-old in 1559, he was sent from France to Portugal to negotiate the marriage of six-year-old princess Margaret of Valois to five-year-old King Sebastian of Portugal. Nicot served as the French ambassador in Lisbon, Portugal from 1559 to 1561 under Henry II, under king Francis II from 1559 to 1560, and from 1560 to 1574 under Charles IX.

===Introduction of tobacco===

When Nicot returned, he brought tobacco plants. He introduced snuff tobacco to the French royal court. The plant was also an instant success with the Father Superior of Malta, who shared tobacco with all of his monks. More and more of the fashionable people of Paris began to use the plant, making Nicot a celebrity.

Although André Thevet argued that he had introduced tobacco to France, the plant was called Nicotina. But nicotine later came to refer specifically to the particular chemical in the plant. The tobacco plant, &quot;Nicotiana&quot;, also a flowering garden plant, was named after him by Carl Linnaeus, as was nicotine. Nicot described its believed medicinal properties (1559) and sent it as a medicine to the French court.

===French dictionary===

For his service to the French royal court, Nicot was given the name &#x27;de Villemain&#x27; and land near Brie-Comte-Robert. There, he compiled one of the first French dictionaries, (published in 1606). His dictionary, according to Ibram X. Kendi, was the first that included an entry for the concept of race.
The IETF language tags have registered for &quot;16th century French as in Jean Nicot, &#x27;Thresor de la langue francoyse&#x27;, 1606, but also including some French similar to that of Rabelais&quot;.

==Death==
He died on May 4, 1604, in Paris, France.

<doc id="144424" wikidata="Q298896" url="?curid=144424" title="Baldwin I, Latin Emperor">
<text>Baldwin I (; ; July 1172 – ) was the first Emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople; Count of Flanders (as Baldwin IX) from 1194 to 1205 and Count of Hainaut (as Baldwin VI) from 1195 to 1205. Baldwin was one of the most prominent leaders of the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the sack of Constantinople in 1204, the conquest of large parts of the Byzantine Empire, and the foundation of the Latin Empire. The following year he was defeated at the Battle of Adrianople by Kaloyan, the emperor of Bulgaria, and spent his last days as a prisoner.

==Early life and family history==
Baldwin was the son of Count Baldwin V of Hainaut and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. When the childless Count Philip I of Flanders left on the last of his personal crusades in 1177, he designated Baldwin, his brother-in-law, as his heir. When Philip returned in 1179 after an unsuccessful siege of Harim during a joint campaign on behalf of the Principality of Antioch, he was designated as the chief adviser of Philip Augustus by his sickly father, King Louis VII of France. One year later, Philip of Flanders had his protégé married to his niece, Isabelle of Hainaut, offering the County of Artois and other Flemish territories as dowry, much to the dismay of Baldwin V. In 1180, war broke out between King Philip and his mentor Philip I of Flanders, resulting in the devastation of Picardy and Île-de-France; King Philip refused to give open battle and gained the upper hand, and Baldwin V of Hainaut, at first allied with his brother-in-law Philip I of Flanders, intervened on behalf of his son-in-law, King Philip, in 1184, in support of his daughter&#x27;s interests.

Count Philip&#x27;s wife Elisabeth died in 1183, and Philip Augustus seized the province of Vermandois on behalf of Elisabeth&#x27;s sister, Eleonore. Philip then remarried, to Matilda of Portugal. Philip gave Matilda a dower of a number of major Flemish towns, in an apparent slight to Baldwin V. Fearing that he would be surrounded by the royal domain of France and the County of Hainaut, Count Philip signed a peace treaty with Philip Augustus and Count Baldwin V on 10 March 1186, recognizing the cession of Vermandois to the king, although he was allowed to retain the title Count of Vermandois for the remainder of his life. Philip died without further issue of disease on the Third Crusade at the siege of Acre in 1191, he was succeeded in Flanders by Baldwin V of Hainaut, although the two had been on seemingly uncordial terms since the 1186 treaty. Baldwin V thereupon ruled as Baldwin VIII of Flanders by right of marriage. When Countess Margaret I died in 1194, Flanders descended to her eldest son, Baldwin IX.

In 1186, the younger Baldwin had married Marie, daughter of Count Henry I of Champagne, and Marie of France. The chronicler Gislebert describes Baldwin as being infatuated with his young bride, who nevertheless preferred prayer to the marital bed.
Through Marie, Baldwin had additional connections and obligations to the defenders of the Holy Land: her brother Henry II of Champagne had been King of Jerusalem in the 1190s (leaving a widow and two daughters who needed help to keep and regain their territories in Palestine). Marie&#x27;s uncles Richard I of England and Philip II of France had just been on the Third Crusade.

Baldwin&#x27;s own family had also been involved in the defence of Jerusalem: his uncle Philip had died on Crusade. Baldwin&#x27;s maternal grandmother was a great-aunt of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and the Counts of Flanders had tried to help Jerusalem relatives in their struggle. Baldwin wanted to continue the tradition. Margaret died in 1194, and the younger Baldwin became Count of Flanders. His father died the next year, and he succeeded to Hainaut.

==Count of Flanders and Hainaut==

Baldwin took possession of a much-reduced Flanders, lessened by the large chunk, including Artois, given by Philip of Alsace as dowry to Baldwin&#x27;s sister Isabelle of Hainaut, and another significant piece to his own wife. Isabelle had died in 1190, but King Philip still retained her dowry, on behalf of Isabelle&#x27;s son, the future Louis VIII of France. The eight years of Baldwin&#x27;s rule in Flanders were dominated by his attempts to recover some of this land. After Philip II of France took Baldwin&#x27;s brother, Philippe of Namur, prisoner, Baldwin was forced to agree to a truce to ensure his safety. The Treaty of Péronne was signed in January 1200 on the condition that Baldwin receive the territories he had won during the war. Baldwin was made the vassal of Philip II, and the king returned portions of Artois to Baldwin.

In this fight against the French king, Baldwin allied with others who had quarrels with Philip, including kings Richard I and John of England, and the German King Otto IV. A month after the treaty, on Ash Wednesday (23 February) 1200 in the town of Bruges, Baldwin took the cross, meaning he committed to embark on a crusade. He spent the next two years preparing, finally leaving on 14 April 1202.

As part of his effort to leave his domains in good order, Baldwin issued two notable charters for Hainaut. One detailed an extensive criminal code and appears to be based on a now-lost charter of his father. The other laid down specific rules for inheritance. These are an important part of the legal tradition in Belgium.

Baldwin left behind his two-year-old daughter and his pregnant wife, Countess Marie. Marie was regent for Baldwin for the two years she remained in Flanders and Hainaut, but by early 1204, she had left both her children behind to join him in the East. They expected to return in a couple of years, but in the end, neither would see their children or their homeland again. In their absence, Baldwin&#x27;s younger brother Philip of Namur was regent in Flanders, with custody of the daughters. Baldwin&#x27;s uncle William of Thy (an illegitimate son of Baldwin IV of Hainaut) was regent for Hainaut.

Meanwhile, desperate for funds to support themselves and pay for their expenses, the leaders of the Fourth Crusade were persuaded to divert to Constantinople in large part due to the exiled Byzantine prince Alexios (future Emperor Alexios IV Angelos) who promised them supplies and money in return for their help in ousting his uncle Emperor Alexios III Angelos and freeing his father Isaac II Angelus. In April 1204, after numerous negotiations attempting to obtain the promised funds from the Byzantines, the Crusaders conquered the most powerfully protected city in the world. Stunned at their own success and unsure of what to do next, the leaders adopted a similar track as their forefathers had during the First Crusade. They elected one of their own, Count Baldwin of Flanders as emperor (of what modern historians refer to as the Latin Empire) and divided imperial lands into feudal counties.

==Latin emperor==

The imperial crown was at first offered to Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, who refused it. The choice then lay between Baldwin and the nominal leader of the crusade, Boniface of Montferrat. While Boniface was considered the most probable choice, due to his connections with the Byzantine court, Baldwin was young, gallant, pious, and virtuous, one of the few who interpreted and observed his crusading vows strictly, and the most popular leader in the host. With Venetian support, he was elected on 9 May 1204 and crowned on 16 May in the Hagia Sophia at a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices. During his coronation, Baldwin wore a very rich jewel that had been bought by Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos for 62,000 silver marks. Baldwin&#x27;s wife Marie, unaware of these events, had sailed to Acre. There she learned of her husband&#x27;s election as emperor, but died in August 1204 before she could join him.

The Latin Empire was organized on feudal principles; the emperor was feudal superior of the princes who received portions of the conquered territory: in October 1204 he enfeoffed 600 knights who occupied lands formerly held by Greek nobles. His own special portion consisted of the city of Constantinople, the adjacent regions both on the European and the Asiatic side, along with some outlying districts, and several islands including Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios and Tenos. The territories still had to be conquered; first of all, it was necessary to break the resistance of the Greeks in Thrace and secure Thessalonica. In this enterprise in the summer of 1204, Baldwin came into collision with Boniface of Montferrat, the rival candidate for the empire, who received a large territory in Macedonia with the title of king of Thessalonica.

Boniface hoped to make himself quite independent of the empire and do no homage to his kingdom, and he opposed Baldwin&#x27;s proposal to march to Thessalonica. The antagonism between Flemings and Lombards aggravated the quarrel. Baldwin insisted on going to Thessalonica; Boniface laid siege to Adrianople, where Baldwin had established a governor; civil war seemed inevitable. An agreement was effected by the efforts of Dandolo and Count Louis I of Blois. Boniface received Thessalonica as a fief from the emperor and was appointed commander of the forces which were to march to the conquest of Greece.
During the following winter (1204–1205) the Franks prosecuted conquests in Bithynia, in which Henry, Baldwin&#x27;s brother, took part. But in February the Greeks revolted in Thrace, relying on the assistance of Kaloyan, tsar of Bulgaria, whose overtures of alliance had been rejected by the emperor. The garrison of Adrianople was expelled. Baldwin along with Dandolo, the count of Blois, and Marshal Villehardouin, the historian, marched to besiege that city. The Frankish knights were defeated (14 April 1205); the count of Blois was slain, and the emperor was captured by the Bulgarians (see Battle of Adrianople).

==Captivity and death==
For some time Baldwin&#x27;s fate was uncertain, and in the meanwhile Henry, his brother, assumed the regency. Not until the middle of July the following year was it ascertained that he was dead. The circumstances of Baldwin&#x27;s death are not exactly known. It seems that he was at first treated well as a valuable hostage, but was executed by the Bulgarian monarch in a sudden outburst of rage, perhaps in consequence of the revolt of Philippopolis, which passed into the hands of the Franks. According to a Bulgarian legend, Baldwin had caused his downfall by trying to seduce Kaloyan&#x27;s wife. The historian George Acropolites reports that the Tsar had Baldwin&#x27;s skull made into a drinking cup, just as had happened to Nicephorus I almost four hundred years before.

Tsar Kaloyan wrote to Pope Innocent III, reporting that Baldwin had died in prison. A tower of the Tsarevets fortress of the medieval Bulgarian capital, Veliko Tarnovo, is still called Baldwin&#x27;s Tower; supposedly, it was the tower where he was interned.

It was not until July 1206 that the Latins in Constantinople had reliable information that Baldwin was dead. His brother Henry was crowned emperor in August.

Back in Flanders, however, there seemed to be doubt whether Baldwin was truly dead. In any case, Baldwin&#x27;s other brother Philip of Namur remained as regent, and eventually, both of Baldwin&#x27;s daughters, Joan and Margaret II, were to rule as countesses of Flanders.

Twenty years later, in 1225, a man appeared in Flanders claiming to be the presumed dead Baldwin. His claim soon became entangled in a series of rebellions and revolts in Flanders against the rule of Baldwin&#x27;s daughter Jeanne. A number of people who had known Baldwin before the crusade rejected his claim, but he nonetheless attracted many followers from the ranks of the peasantry. Eventually unmasked as a Burgundian serf named Bertrand of Ray, the false Baldwin was executed in 1226.
