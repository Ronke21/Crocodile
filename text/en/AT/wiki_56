<text>Skiffle is a genre of folk music with influences from American folk music, blues, country, bluegrass, and jazz, generally performed with a mixture of manufactured and homemade or improvised instruments. 

Originating as a form in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became extremely popular in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, where it was played by such artists as Lonnie Donegan, the Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer, and Chas McDevitt. 

Skiffle was a major part of the early careers of some musicians who later became prominent in other genres, including the Quarrymen (who were later renamed the Beatles), Tony Sheridan and Rory Gallagher. The skiffle style has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, the British blues boom, and the British Invasion of American popular music.

==Origins in the United States==

The origins of skiffle are obscure but generally thought to lie in African-American musical culture in the early 20th century. Skiffle is often said to have developed from New Orleans jazz, but this claim has been disputed. Improvised jug bands playing blues and jazz were common across the American South in the early decades of the 20th century. They used instruments such as the washboard, jugs, washtub bass, cigar-box fiddle, musical saw and comb-and-paper kazoos, as well as more conventional instruments, such as acoustic guitar and banjo.

The origin of the English word &quot;skiffle&quot; is unknown. However, in the dialect of the west of England &quot;to make a skiffle&quot;, meaning to make a mess of any business, is attested from 1873. In early 20th century America the term &quot;skiffle&quot; was one of many slang phrases for a rent party, a social event with a small charge designed to pay rent on a house. It was first recorded in Chicago in the 1920s and may have been brought there as part of the African-American migration to northern industrial cities.

The first use of the term on record was in 1925 in the name of Jimmy O&#x27;Bryant and his Chicago Skifflers. Most often it was used to describe country blues music records, which included the compositions &quot;Hometown Skiffle&quot; (1929) and &quot;Skiffle Blues&quot; (1946) by Dan Burley &amp; his Skiffle Boys. It was used by Ma Rainey (1886–1939) to describe her repertoire to rural audiences. The term &quot;skiffle&quot; disappeared from American music in the 1940s.

==Revival in the United Kingdom==
Skiffle was a relatively obscure genre, and it might have been largely forgotten if not for its revival in the United Kingdom in the 1950s and the success of its main proponent, Lonnie Donegan. British skiffle grew out of the developing post-war British jazz scene, which saw a move away from swing music and towards trad jazz. Among these bands were Bill Bailey Skiffle Group and Ken Colyer&#x27;s Jazzmen, a band formed by Chris Barber. Lonnie Donegan played banjo for the Jazzmen, and also performed skiffle music during intervals. He would sing and play guitar with accompaniment of two other members, usually on washboard and tea-chest bass. They played a variety of American folk and blues songs, particularly those derived from the recordings of Lead Belly, in a lively style that emulated American jug bands. These were listed on posters as &quot;skiffle&quot; breaks, a name suggested by Ken Colyer&#x27;s brother Bill after recalling the Dan Burley Skiffle Group. Soon the breaks were as popular as traditional jazz. After disagreements in 1954, Colyer left to form a new outfit, and the band became Chris Barber&#x27;s Jazz Band.

The first British recordings of skiffle were carried out by Colyer&#x27;s new band in 1954, but it was the release by Decca of two skiffle tracks by Barber&#x27;s Jazz Band under the name of the &quot;Lonnie Donegan Skiffle Group&quot; that transformed the fortunes of skiffle in late 1955. Donegan&#x27;s fast-tempo version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; was a major hit in 1956, featuring a washboard (but not a tea-chest bass), with &quot;John Henry&quot; on the B-side. It spent eight months in the Top 20, peaking at No. 6 (and No. 8 in the U.S.). It was the first debut record to go gold in Britain, selling over a million copies worldwide.

The Acoustic Music organization makes this comment about Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;. &quot;It flew up the English charts. Donegan had synthesized American Southern Blues with simple acoustic instruments: acoustic guitar, washtub bass and washboard rhythm. The new style was called &#x27;Skiffle&#x27; ... and referred to music from people with little money for instruments. The new style captivated an entire generation of post-war youth in England.&quot; After splitting from Barber, Donegan went on to make a series of popular records as &quot;Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s Skiffle Group&quot;, with successes including &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; (1957), &quot;Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour&quot; (1958) and &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; (1960).

It was the success of Donegan&#x27;s &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; and the lack of a need for expensive instruments or high levels of musicianship that set off the British skiffle craze. A few bands enjoyed chart success in the skiffle craze, including the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group (&quot;Freight Train&quot;), Johnny Duncan and the Bluegrass Boys, and the Vipers, but the main impact of skiffle was as a grassroots amateur movement, particularly popular among working class men, who could cheaply buy, improvise, or build their own instruments and who have been seen as reacting against the drab austerity of post-war Britain. The craze probably reached its height with the broadcasting of the BBC TV programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; from 1957. It was the first British youth music programme, using a skiffle song as its title music and showcasing many skiffle acts. However, the British rock and roll scene was starting to take off, producing home-grown stars like Tommy Steele, Marty Wilde and Cliff Richard and the Shadows (themselves originally involved in skiffle). By February 1958, Pete Murray, host of &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;, noted a trend of groups wishing to &quot;play down that word skiffle&quot;, considering it limiting. By the end of 1958, the boom was over as enthusiasts either abandoned music for more stable employment or moved into some of the forms of music that it had first suggested, including folk, blues and rock and roll. As a result, it has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second folk revival, blues boom and the British Invasion of the US popular music scene. Donegan continued his career in skiffle until his death in 2002.

It has been estimated that in the late 1950s, there were 30,000–50,000 skiffle groups in Britain. Sales of guitars grew rapidly, and other musicians were able to perform on improvised bass and percussion in venues such as church halls and cafes and in the flourishing coffee bars of Soho, London, like the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar, the Cat&#x27;s Whisker and nightspots like Coconut Grove and Churchill&#x27;s, without having to aspire to musical perfection or virtuosity. A large number of British musicians began their careers playing skiffle in this period, and some became leading figures in their fields. These included leading Northern Irish musician Van Morrison and British blues pioneer Alexis Korner, as well as Ronnie Wood, Alex Harvey and Mick Jagger; folk musicians Martin Carthy, John Renbourn and Ashley Hutchings; rock musicians Roger Daltrey, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Robin Trower and David Gilmour; and popular Beat-music successes Graham Nash and Allan Clarke of the Hollies. Most notably, the Beatles developed from John Lennon&#x27;s 1957 skiffle group the Quarrymen; Paul McCartney was added after a few months and George Harrison joined in 1958. Similarly, the Bee Gees developed from Barry Gibb&#x27;s skiffle group The Rattlesnakes.

In a 2010 radio interview, Tony Sheridan recalls his encounter with skiffle:
&quot;I always felt a bit out of place anyway. So when the puberty thing started, Lonnie Donegan came along, I think it was the end of &#x27;55, early &#x27;56. Rock Island Line. All I heard was the beginning [of the song]... It sort of turned a switch in me. I&#x27;m sure John Lennon on the other side of the country, in Liverpool, I&#x27;m sure he felt something very, very similar... the first time he heard Donegan. It was usually Donegan with us, you know, before Elvis.&quot;

During summer 1970, the skiffle-like song &quot;In the Summertime&quot; by British band Mungo Jerry reached the top of the charts in several countries around the world. In 2017, performer Billy Bragg&#x27;s book &quot;Roots, Radicals and Rockers&quot;, a history of the skiffle movement, was published. Bragg has compared the development of skiffle in Britain in the 1950s to punk rock in the 1970s, noting that skiffle was a revolt by young people against the culture of their parents, and allowed them to create their own style of music without expensive equipment or great musical virtuosity.

<text>Senser are an English rap rock band, originally formed in South West London.

==History==
Senser were formed in 1991.

In 1992, they were joined by Spiral Tribe D.J, Andy Clinton. The band toured in support of psychedelic rockers the Ozric Tentacles in 1992. In 1993, the band were signed to Ultimate Records.

In 1993, Senser released two indie singles on Ultimate – &quot;Eject&quot; and &quot;The Key&quot;. The latter would appear on NME Singles of the Week 1993 album.

In March 1994, Senser released their third single, &quot;Switch&quot;, which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 39. Senser&#x27;s first album, &quot;Stacked Up&quot;, was released in May 1994, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4.

At the beginning of 1995, Senser toured the UK supported by Skunk Anansie before setting off to tour the United States with Moby. It was during this tour that the band decided to split over musical differences. Al-Sayed and Morgan left to form a new band with Haggis called Lodestar. The remaining members of Senser found a new drummer, Paul Soden, and set about writing Senser&#x27;s second album.

In the summer of 1998, Haigh was able to tour and the band released the second album, &quot;Asylum&quot;. Once again musical differences became apparent and by February 1999 the band decided to split.

In 2003, the original line-up reunited originally to perform for one show, but decided to re-form and record again. They released their third studio album &quot;SCHEMAtic&quot; in 2004. 

In 2009, they released &quot;How To Do Battle&quot;.

In 2013, they released their fifth album &quot;To the Capsules&quot; via Pledgemusic and toured with Erika Footman on vocals in place of Kerstin Haigh.

In 2014, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut &quot;Stacked Up&quot;, the band re-released the album in expanded edition with a remastered version of the original tracks on the first CD, and bonus tracks from the era (remixes and previously unreleased songs) on the second disc.

Although Senser have not released new music since 2014, as of 2024 the band still perform live shows.

==Soundtracks to films==
&quot;The Key&quot; was used as part of the cult extreme 1990s ski film, &quot;The Tribe&quot;.

Senser&#x27;s song &quot;States of Mind&quot; from &quot;Stacked Up&quot;, was used as the soundtrack to the well-known demoscene production, &quot;State of Mind&quot;, by Bomb.

In 2012, one of their songs was also used in the soundtrack to the film &quot;Learning Hebrew: A Gothsploitation Movie&quot;.

<text>The umbra, penumbra and antumbra are three distinct parts of a shadow, created by any light source after impinging on an opaque object. Assuming no diffraction, for a collimated beam (such as a point source) of light, only the umbra is cast.

These names are most often used for the shadows cast by celestial bodies, though they are sometimes used to describe levels, such as in sunspots.

==Umbra==

The umbra (Latin for &quot;shadow&quot;) is the innermost and darkest part of a shadow, where the light source is completely blocked by the occluding body. An observer within the umbra experiences a total occultation. The umbra of a round body occluding a round light source forms a right circular cone. When viewed from the cone&#x27;s apex, the two bodies appear the same size.

The distance from the Moon to the apex of its umbra is roughly equal to that between the Moon and Earth: . Since Earth&#x27;s diameter is 3.7 times the Moon&#x27;s, its umbra extends correspondingly farther: roughly .

== Penumbra ==
The penumbra (from the Latin &quot;paene&quot; &quot;almost, nearly&quot; and &quot;umbra&quot; &quot;shadow&quot;) is the region in which only a portion of the light source is obscured by the occluding body. An observer in the penumbra experiences a partial eclipse.
An alternative definition is that the penumbra is the region where &quot;some or all&quot; of the light source is obscured (i.e., the umbra is a subset of the penumbra). For example, NASA&#x27;s Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility defines that a body in the umbra is also within the penumbra.

== Antumbra ==
The antumbra (from the Latin &quot;ante&quot; &quot;before&quot; and &quot;umbra&quot; &quot;shadow&quot;) is the region from which the occluding body appears entirely within the disc of the light source. An observer in this region experiences an annular eclipse, in which a bright ring is visible around the eclipsing body. If the observer moves closer to the light source, the apparent size of the occluding body increases until it causes a full umbra.

<text>A rent party (sometimes called a house party) is a social occasion where tenants hire a musician or band to play and pass the hat to raise money to pay their rent, originating in Harlem during the 1920s. These parties were a means for Black tenants to eat, dance, and get away from everyday hardship and discrimination. The rent party played a major role in the development of jazz and blues music, alongside forms of swing dancing. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the term &quot;skiffle&quot; means &quot;rent party&quot;, indicating the informality of the occasion. Thus, the word became associated with informal music. However, many notable jazz musicians are associated with rent parties, including pianists Speckled Red, Georgia Tom, Little Brother Montgomery, James P. Johnson, Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith, and Fats Waller, although rent parties also featured bands as well. The &quot;OED&quot; also gives &quot;boogie&quot; as a term meaning &#x27;rent party&#x27;.

Rent parties were often the location of so-called cutting contests, which involves jazz pianists taking turns at the piano, attempting to out-do each other. 

== History ==
At the start of the Great Migration, and at the start of World War I, hundreds of thousands of African Americans began to move north into more urbanized areas of the United States. This was brought on with the need for a large labor force to help supply the war effort. Many at the time sought out new employment opportunities, as well as a means to escape Jim Crow laws in the south. Over the course of this time, around 1.5 million African Americans had moved up north and taken up factory positions or other urban jobs. Of that population, 200,000 had migrated to Harlem.

African Americans were still faced with social and economic discrimination within these urban areas, most notably when it came to rental payments. Black tenants were required to pay higher apartment rent than white tenants for small and cramped apartments, all while making less money as well. While a white family was more likely to make around $1,600 a year, a black family was more likely to make around $1,300. Alongside that, black tenants would often have to pay $20-$30 more in rent than white tenants.

Out of this grew the grounds for rent parties. Parties were hosted to raise enough money to make up the difference in rent due. While this was the original intent of these sorts of parties, eventually, they grew so popular that tenants started to throw them to supplement their salaries. Rent parties also evolved into an event of cultural importance, as rent parties were places for middle-class African Americans to go on their nights off and get away from the everyday struggle.

== Organization ==
Rent parties were predominantly advertised through &quot;rent party tickets.&quot; These were printed as business cards and leaflets in order to be easily distributed. These tickets often had quirky rhymes or euphemisms, without explicitly identifying the event as a rent party. Some hosts would distribute these tickets to friends, neighbors, and acquaintances, while some hosts would pass tickets to random strangers, often hiding them amid various public spaces. Many were still careful when it came to handing out tickets, not wanting to attract the attention of police. Tickets never explicitly referred to events as rent parties, instead referring to them as a &quot;Social Party&quot; or a &quot;Social Dance.&quot;

The cost of admission ranged around 25 cents. Parties were typically held on Saturdays, which was when many of the laborers were paid, or on Thursdays, which was when most domestic workers were off duty. Hosts often provided a variety of southern comfort food, such as fried chicken and collard greens. A big draw was the presence of bootleg alcohol, illegal at the time due to Prohibition. Live music and dancing was also a popular feature. Piano players and jazz bands were invited to provide live music for dancing. Dancing was a big part of the scene, often accompanied with contests and newly-invented dance moves.

Rent parties were very competitive, with up to twelve occurring on a single block within any given week. Rent parties were considered to be much rowdier than the average house party at the time, with drugs, gambling, and paid rooms for sex being widely available. Gangsters and racketeers would also host rent parties as fronts. Because of this, Black intellectuals of the time looked down upon these gatherings, worrying that they would reflect badly upon African Americans as a whole. Nevertheless, rent parties were also seen as means of building Black community and a creative way to tackle economic hardship.

== Legacy ==
Rent parties had a great impact on dance within the 1920s. Due to these parties being so crowded and highly energetic, the dance styles were often erratic and unpredictable. Dance styles, like the Lindy Hop, were invented through these parties. The Lindy Hop in particular was a jazz-based dance style that was heavily based on improvisation and swing dancing. This dance style would eventually gain popularity at the Savoy Ballroom, a very popular ballroom in Harlem that was the center of recreation and cultural life.

Rent parties were also the birthplace of new forms of music. Stride piano playing had emerged, which involved the left hand performing rhythmic chords, while the right had would play out blues melodies and riffs. The play style emerged due to the crowded nature of the parties, with the tenants wanting to hire as few musicians as possible. Because of this, lone piano players would have to entertain the entire party. The busy nature of the play style would compensate for the lack of an actual band. The style was referred to as the &quot;Harlem Stride&quot; and was popularized by several notable jazz musicians, such as James P Johnson, Fats Waller, and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith.

Renowned writer and poet Langston Hughes personally collected various rent party tickets and wrote and about his fond memories of rent parties. As a poet, he was fond of the little rhymes found on each of the party tickets and would store them in a personal collection. These can be found now amidst his other papers within the Yale Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.

The rent party experienced a revival during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the disappearance of paid gigs during the lockdown in the United States, pianist and Harlem resident Emmet Cohen started his version of the rent party as an online streaming concert on Monday nights to provide income for his trio with bassist Russell Hall, drummer Kyle Poole, as well as other musicians living or traveling through New York. The concert series is titled &quot;Live From Emmet&#x27;s Place.&quot; The in-person audience was limited to eight while the live online audience averaged 1000 attendees on Facebook and YouTube. One of the uploaded concert videos featuring singer Cyrille Aimee has accumulated over 4 million views.

==In popular culture==
The band Steely Dan&#x27;s 2009 tour of the United States was named the &quot;Rent Party 09&quot; tour.

Rent parties not featuring either jazz or specifically African American crowds are featured in the plots of movies set in New York during the 1980s and 1990s such as&quot; Party Girl&quot; (starring Parker Posey). The song &quot;House Rent Party&quot; (1955) by Babs Gonzales and The Waldos&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Rent Party&quot; are references to the practice.

<text>() is the Welsh-language name for Wales, a country of the United Kingdom, on the island of Great Britain.

== Etymology ==
The modern Welsh name is the Welsh name for Wales, while the name for the Welsh people is . These words (both of which are pronounced ) are descended from the Brythonic word &quot;combrogi&quot;, meaning &quot;fellow-countrymen&quot; or a &quot;compatriot&quot;. The use of the word as a self-designation derives from the location in the post-Roman era (after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons) of the Welsh (Brythonic-speaking) people in modern Wales as well as in northern England and southern Scotland (, &#x27;The Old North&#x27;). It emphasised that the Welsh in modern Wales and in the were one people, different from other peoples. In particular, the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples, who are of similar heritage, culture, and language to the Welsh. The word came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century. It is attested in a praise poem to (, by ) . In Welsh literature, the word was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples (including the Welsh) and was the more common literary term until . Thereafter prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until the word was spelt or , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland, including as &quot;Kymry&quot;, in the &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, in the 10th century.

&quot;Wales&quot; on the other hand, is derived from an Old English word meaning &#x27;foreigner&#x27;, specifically those who were under Roman rule (specifically a &#x27;Romanised foreigner&#x27;). Cambria is a medieval Latin name also historically used to refer to Wales, and is a latinisation of .

== Use of in English ==
In recent history, in particular following Welsh devolution, calls to drop English-language place-names in Wales in favour of their Welsh-language equivalents have been increasing. These have included calls to prohibit the coining of English-language names for places with existing names in Welsh and for all non-Welsh place-names in Wales to be removed. These attitudes have been criticised by the London-based &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper and by the British government. The controversial origin of the meaning of &quot;Wales&quot;, which derives from a term meaning &#x27;foreigner&#x27;, and it stated to be an &quot;imposed&quot; non-Welsh name, are some of the reasons given for stopping the use of &quot;Wales&quot;, or at least to prefer . Proponents for such a change compare Wales&#x27;s case to those of other countries which have changed their names in English-language usage, such as Ceylon to Sri Lanka, Persia to Iran and, in 2022, Turkey to Türkiye.

In 2019, during discussions on renaming the National Assembly for Wales, () was considered as the body&#x27;s sole potential name; however, this name was rejected by Assembly Members in November 2019. Simply &quot;Senedd&quot; was also proposed, but this was rejected by the first minister Carwyn Jones, who feared that would be not understood. The parliament instead chose two names, and &quot;Welsh Parliament&quot;, with &quot;Senedd&quot; being the shorthand name used in both English and Welsh. However, the legal preferred name, used in all post-2020 legislation, is in both languages.

In 2022, the Football Association of Wales considered changing references to the national football team (both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) to use rather than &quot;Wales&quot;. The association already uses the name in its internal and external communications. This was seen as part of the team&#x27;s overall shift towards becoming more Welsh nationalist and pro-independence. The association has been increasing its use of and of Welsh words in general since UEFA Euro 2016.

===Calls for use as the country&#x27;s sole name===
In 2024, a petition called for the prohibition of the name &quot;Wales&quot; and for the Welsh name to be the only name. The petition had gained 5,400 signatures by 4 January 2024, and over 10,000 by 15 January, meeting the threshold for a Senedd debate. A counter-petition was launched afterwards.

The petition follows other removals of English names in Wales in 2023, such as the removal of the English names &quot;Snowdonia&quot; and &quot;Snowdon&quot; for and , their Welsh names respectively, and the removal of &quot;Brecon Beacons&quot; for .

While is also used by pro-independence organisations such as YesCymru and AUOBCymru, it is also used by various non-political charities and organisations. The Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru is a recent example of dropping Wales for Cymru in English.

<text>Matthias Ettrich (born 14 June 1972) is a German computer scientist and founder of the KDE and LyX projects.

== Early life ==
Ettrich was born in Bietigheim-Bissingen, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany, and went to school in Beilstein while living with his parents in Oberstenfeld. He passed the Abitur in 1991. Ettrich studied for his MSc in Computer Science at the Wilhelm Schickard Institute for Computer Science at the University of Tübingen.

== Career ==
He currently resides in Berlin, Germany. He is currently focused on advising start-ups and corporations on digital transformation and in sound technical decision-making.

== Free software projects ==
Ettrich founded and furthered the LyX project in 1995, initially conceived as a university term project. LyX is a graphical frontend to LaTeX.

Since LyX&#x27;s main target platform was Linux, he started exploring different ways to improve the graphical user interface, ultimately leading him to the KDE project. Ettrich founded KDE in 1996 when he proposed on Usenet a &quot;consistent, nice looking free desktop environment&quot; for Unix-like systems using Qt as its widget toolkit.

On 6 November 2009, Ettrich was decorated with the Federal Cross of Merit for his contributions to free software.

<doc id="143421" wikidata="Q610258" url="?curid=143421" title="Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!">
<text>&quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; is a song recorded by the English rock band the Beatles for their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was written and composed primarily by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney.

Most of the lyrics came from a 19th-century circus poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal appearance at Rochdale. It was one of three songs from the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album that was banned from playing on the BBC, supposedly because the phrase &quot;Henry the Horse&quot; combined two words that were individually known as slang for heroin. Lennon denied that the song had anything to do with heroin.

==Background==

The inspiration to write the song was a 19th-century circus poster for Pablo Fanque&#x27;s Circus Royal appearance at Rochdale. Lennon purchased the poster on 31 January 1967 at a Sevenoaks antiques shop while the Beatles were filming promotional films for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; in Sevenoaks, Kent. Lennon claimed years later to still have the poster in his home. &quot;Everything from the song is from that poster,&quot; he explained, &quot;except the horse wasn&#x27;t called Henry.&quot; (The poster identifies the horse as &quot;Zanthus&quot;.)

The song&#x27;s lyrics (based on the original poster) detail the evening&#x27;s program, which was to occur at Bishopsgate in the following sequence: On Saturday at 5:50 pm the band was to begin playing while Mr. Kite would perform, flying &quot;through the ring.&quot; Meanwhile, Mr. Henderson would execute ten Somersets, and then perform on the trampoline, &quot;over men and horses, through hoops and over garters,&quot; and &quot;lastly through a hogshead of real fire.&quot; This act would be followed by the Hendersons dancing and singing. Finally, Henry the Horse would dance the waltz.

Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite, who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845. &quot;Mr. J. Henderson&quot; was John Henderson, a wire-walker, equestrian, trampoline artist, and clown. While the poster made no mention of &quot;Hendersons&quot; plural, as Lennon sings, John Henderson did perform with his wife Agnes, the daughter of circus owner Henry Hengler. The Hendersons performed throughout Europe and Russia during the 1840s and 1850s.

&quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; is credited to Lennon–McCartney, but Lennon said he had written it entirely himself. In 1977, when shown a list of songs Lennon claimed writing on (including &quot;Mr. Kite&quot;), McCartney disputed only &quot;In My Life&quot;. In his 1997 memoir, he claimed to have also co-written &quot;Mr. Kite&quot;. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, he recalled spending an afternoon with Lennon writing the song based on the poster, and said that &quot;the song just wrote itself&quot;. Pete Shotten, however, in his book &quot;John Lennon: In My Life&quot;, also remembers Lennon writing the song alone.

==Recording==
One of the most musically complex songs on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, it was recorded by the Beatles on 17 February 1967 with overdubs on 20 February (organ sound effects), 28 March (harmonica, organ, guitar), 29 March (more organ effects) and 31 March. Lennon wanted the track to have a &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot;, and told producer George Martin that he wanted &quot;to smell the sawdust on the floor&quot;. In the middle eight bars, multiple recordings of fairground organs and calliope music were spliced together to attempt to satisfy this request. In a 1968 interview, Martin recalled that he achieved this &quot;by playing the Hammond organ myself and speeding it up&quot;. In addition to the Hammond organ, an attempt was made to find a 19th-century steam organ for hire in London, to enhance the carnival atmosphere effect, but to no avail. After a great deal of unsuccessful experimentation, Martin instructed recording engineer Geoff Emerick to chop the tape into pieces with scissors, throw them up in the air, and re-assemble them at random.

Before the start of the first take, Lennon sings the words &quot;For the benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; in a joke accent, then Emerick announces, &quot;For the Benefit of Mr. Kite! This is take 1.&quot; Lennon immediately responds, &quot;&quot;Being&quot; for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, reinforcing his title preference from a phrase lifted intact from the original Pablo Fanque poster. The exchange is recorded in &quot;The Beatles Recording Sessions&quot; and audible on track 8 of disc 2 of &quot;Anthology 2&quot;. The original recording can also be heard during the loading screen for the song if it is downloaded in the 2009 video game &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot;.

Although Lennon once said of the song that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t proud of that&quot; and &quot;I was just going through the motions&quot;, in 1980 he described it as &quot;pure, like a painting, a pure watercolour&quot;. AllMusic stated that &quot;the Beatles and Martin pulled out all the stops to make a layer of sound that was only possible to create in the recording studio [...] resulting in a sound both redolent of the circuses of bygone days, and as avant-garde as anything in rock music.&quot;

<text>&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as the final track of their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Credited to Lennon–McCartney, the opening and closing sections of the song were mainly written by John Lennon, with Paul McCartney primarily contributing the song&#x27;s middle section. All four Beatles shaped the final arrangement of the song.

Lennon&#x27;s lyrics were mainly inspired by contemporary newspaper articles, including a report on the death of Guinness heir Tara Browne. The recording includes two passages of orchestral glissandos that were partly improvised in the avant-garde style. In the song&#x27;s middle segment, McCartney recalls his younger years, which included riding the bus, smoking, and going to class. Following the second crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous chords in popular music history, played on several keyboards, that sustains for over forty seconds. 

A reputed drug reference in the line &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot; resulted in the song initially being banned from broadcast by the BBC. Jeff Beck, Chris Cornell, Barry Gibb, the Fall and Phish are among the artists who have covered the song. The song inspired the creation of the Deep Note, the audio trademark for the THX film company. It remains one of the most influential and celebrated songs in popular music, appearing on many lists of the greatest songs of all time, and being commonly appraised as the Beatles&#x27; finest song.

==Background==
John Lennon wrote the melody and most of the lyrics to the verses of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; in mid-January 1967. Soon afterwards, he presented the song to Paul McCartney, who contributed a middle-eight section. According to Lennon, McCartney also contributed the pivotal line &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on.&quot; In a 1970 interview, Lennon discussed their collaboration on the song:

In 1968, Lennon said, &quot;It was a good piece of work between Paul and me. I had the &#x27;I read the news today&#x27; bit, and it turned Paul on, because now and then we really turn each other on with a bit of song, and he just said &#x27;yeah&#x27; – bang bang, like that.&quot;

According to author Ian MacDonald, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; was strongly informed by Lennon&#x27;s LSD-inspired revelations, in that the song &quot;concerned &#x27;reality&#x27; only to the extent that this had been revealed by LSD to be largely in the eye of the beholder&quot;. Having long resisted Lennon and George Harrison&#x27;s insistence that he join them and Ringo Starr in trying LSD, McCartney took it for the first time in late 1966. This experience contributed to the Beatles&#x27; willingness to experiment on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and to Lennon and McCartney returning to a level of collaboration that had been somewhat absent.

==Lyrics==

===Tara Browne===
Music critic Tim Riley says that in &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, Lennon uses the same lyrical device introduced in &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, whereby free-form lyrics allow a greater freedom of expression and create a &quot;supernatural calm&quot;. According to Lennon, the inspiration for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who had crashed his car on 18 December 1966. Browne was a friend of Lennon and McCartney, and had instigated McCartney&#x27;s first experience with LSD. Lennon adapted the song&#x27;s verse lyrics from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which reported the ruling on a custody action over Browne&#x27;s two young children.

During a writing session at McCartney&#x27;s house in north London, Lennon and McCartney fine-tuned the lyrics, using an approach that author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William S. Burroughs. &quot;I didn&#x27;t copy the accident,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;Tara didn&#x27;t blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the songnot noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scenewere similarly part of the fiction.&quot; In 1997, McCartney expounded on the subject: &quot;The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don&#x27;t believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John&#x27;s head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who&#x27;d stopped at some traffic lights and didn&#x27;t notice that the lights had changed. The &#x27;blew his mind&#x27; was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash.&quot; But in 2021, McCartney recalled the inspiration for this part of the composition as follows: &quot;That was around this same time, when I was twenty-something and going out on the moped from my dad&#x27;s house to Betty&#x27;s house. I was taking a friend, Tara Guinness. He died later in a car accident. He was a nice boy. I wrote about him in &#x27;A Day in the Life&#x27;: &#x27;He blew his mind out in a car / He didn&#x27;t notice that the lights had changed&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;4,000 holes&quot;===
Lennon wrote the song&#x27;s final verse inspired by a &quot;Far &amp; Near&quot; news brief, in the same 17 January edition of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that had inspired the first two verses. Under the headline &quot;The holes in our roads&quot;, the brief stated: &quot;There are 4,000 holes in the road in Blackburn, Lancashire, or one twenty-sixth of a hole per person, according to a council survey. If Blackburn is typical, there are two million holes in Britain&#x27;s roads and 300,000 in London.&quot;
The story had been sold to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in Manchester by Ron Kennedy of the Star News agency in Blackburn. Kennedy had noticed a &quot;Lancashire Evening Telegraph&quot; story about road excavations and in a telephone call to the Borough Engineer&#x27;s department had checked the annual number of holes in the road. Lennon had a problem with the words of the final verse, however, not being able to think of how to connect &quot;Now they know how many holes it takes to&quot; and &quot;the Albert Hall&quot;. His friend Terry Doran suggested that the holes would &quot;fill&quot; the Albert Hall, and the lyric was eventually used.

===Drug culture===
McCartney said about the line &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot;, which concludes both verse sections: &quot;This was the time of Tim Leary&#x27;s &#x27;Turn on, tune in, drop out&#x27; and we wrote, &#x27;I&#x27;d love to turn you on.&#x27; John and I gave each other a knowing look: &#x27;Uh-huh, it&#x27;s a drug song. You know that, don&#x27;t you? George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer, commented that he had always suspected that the line &quot;found my way upstairs and had a smoke&quot; was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would &quot;disappear and have a little puff&quot;, presumably of marijuana, but not in front of him. &quot;When [Martin] was doing his TV programme on Pepper&quot;, McCartney recalled later, &quot;he asked me, &#x27;Do you know what caused Pepper?&#x27; I said, &#x27;In one word, George, drugs. Pot.&#x27; And George said, &#x27;No, no. But you weren&#x27;t on it all the time.&#x27; &#x27;Yes, we were.&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was a drug album.&quot;

===Other reference points===
Author Neil Sinyard attributed the second-verse line &quot;The English Army had just won the war&quot; to Lennon&#x27;s role in the film &quot;How I Won the War&quot;, which he had filmed during September and October 1966. Sinyard said: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to think of [the verse] without automatically associating it with Richard Lester&#x27;s film.&quot;

The middle-eight provided by McCartney was written as a wistful recollection of his younger years, which included riding the 82 bus to school, smoking, and going to class. This theme the Beatles&#x27; youth in Liverpool matched that of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; (named after the street in Liverpool) and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (named after the orphanage near Lennon&#x27;s childhood home in Liverpool), two songs written for the album but instead released as a double A-side.

==Musical structure and development==

===Basic track===
The Beatles began recording the song, with a working title of &quot;In the Life of ...&quot;, at EMI&#x27;s Studio Two on 19 January 1967. The line-up as they rehearsed the track was Lennon on piano, McCartney on Hammond organ, Harrison on acoustic guitar, and Starr on congas. The band then taped four takes of the rhythm track, by which point Lennon had switched to acoustic guitar and McCartney to piano, with Harrison now playing maracas.

As a link between the end of the second verse and the start of McCartney&#x27;s middle-eight, the band included a 24-bar bridge. At first, the Beatles were not sure how to fill this link section. At the conclusion of the session on 19 January, the transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and the voice of assistant Mal Evans counting out the bars. Evans&#x27; voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo. The 24-bar bridge ended with the sound of an alarm clock triggered by Evans. Although the original intent was to edit out the ringing alarm clock when the section was filled in, it complemented McCartney&#x27;s piece – which begins with the line &quot;Woke up, fell out of bed&quot; – so the decision was made to keep the sound. A second transition follows McCartney&#x27;s final line of the middle eight (&quot;I went into a dream&quot;) consisting of vocalised &quot;aah&quot;s that link to the song&#x27;s final verse. (Accounts differ as to which of the Beatles sang it.)

The track was refined with remixing and additional parts added on 20 January and 3 February. During the latter session, McCartney and Starr re-recorded their contributions on bass guitar and drums, respectively. Starr later highlighted his fills on the song as typical of an approach whereby &quot;I try to become an instrument; play the mood of the song. For example, &#x27;Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire,&#x27; – boom ba bom. I try to show that; the disenchanting mood.&quot; As on the 1966 track &quot;Rain&quot;, music journalist Ben Edmonds recognises Starr&#x27;s playing as reflective of his empathy with Lennon&#x27;s songwriting. In Edmonds&#x27; description, the drumming on &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; &quot;embod[ies] psychedelic driftmysterious, surprising, without losing sight of its rhythmic role&quot;.

===Orchestra===

The orchestral portions of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; reflect Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s interest in the work of avant-garde composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio and John Cage. To fill the empty 24-bar middle section, Lennon&#x27;s request to George Martin was that the orchestra should provide &quot;a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world&quot;. McCartney suggested having the musicians improvise over the segment. To allay concerns that classically trained musicians would be unable to do this, Martin wrote a loose score for the section. Using the rhythm implied by Lennon&#x27;s staggered intonation on the words &quot;turn you on&quot;, the score was an extended, atonal crescendo that encouraged the musicians to improvise within the defined framework. The orchestral part was recorded on 10 February 1967 in Studio One at EMI Studios, with Martin and McCartney conducting a 40-piece orchestra. The recording session was completed at a total cost of £367 (equivalent to £ in ) for the players, an extravagance at the time. Martin later described explaining his score to the puzzled orchestra:

McCartney had originally wanted a 90-piece orchestra, but this proved impossible. Instead, the semi-improvised segment was recorded multiple times, filling a separate four-track tape machine, and the four different recordings were overdubbed into a single massive crescendo. The results were successful; in the final edit of the song, the orchestral bridge is reprised after the final verse.

The Beatles hosted the orchestral session as a 1960s-style happening, with guests including Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Donovan, Pattie Boyd, Michael Nesmith, and members of the psychedelic design collective the Fool. Overseen by Tony Bramwell of NEMS Enterprises, the event was filmed for use in a projected television special that never materialised. Reflecting the Beatles&#x27; taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire. This resulted in different players wearing anything from fake noses to fake stick-on nipples. Martin recalled that the lead violinist performed wearing a gorilla paw, while a bassoon player placed a balloon on the end of his instrument.

At the end of the night, the four Beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an extended humming sound to close the song – an idea that they later discarded. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the tapes from this 10 February orchestral session reveal the guests breaking into loud applause following the second orchestral passage. Among the EMI staff attending the event, one recalled how Ron Richards, the Hollies&#x27; producer, was stunned by the music he had heard; in Lewisohn&#x27;s description, Richards &quot;[sat] with his head in his hands, saying &#x27;I just can&#x27;t believe it... I give up. Martin later offered his own opinion of the orchestral session: &quot;part of me said &#x27;We&#x27;re being a bit self-indulgent here.&#x27; The other part of me said &#x27;It&#x27;s bloody !

===Final chord and completion===
Following the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal experiment from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI&#x27;s Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair. In author Jonathan Gould&#x27;s commentary on &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, he describes the final chord as &quot;a forty-second meditation on finality that leaves each member of the audience listening with a new kind of attention and awareness to the sound of nothing at all&quot;.

One of the first outsiders to hear the completed recording was the Byrds&#x27; David Crosby when he visited the Beatles during their 24 February overdubbing session for &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;. He recalled his reaction to the song: &quot;Man, I was a . I was floored. It took me several minutes to be able to talk after that.&quot; Due to the multiple takes required to perfect the orchestral cacophony and the final chord, the total time spent recording &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; was 34 hours. By contrast, the Beatles&#x27; debut album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, had been recorded in its entirety in only 15 hours, 45 minutes.

===High-pitched tone and run-out groove===
Following &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; on the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album (as first released on LP in the UK and years later worldwide on CD) is a high-frequency 15-kilohertz tone and some randomly spliced studio chatter. The tone is the same pitch as a dog whistle, at the upper limit of human hearing, but within the range that dogs and cats can hear. This addition was part of the Beatles&#x27; humour and was suggested by Lennon. The studio babble, titled in the session notes &quot;Edit for LP End&quot; and recorded on 21 April 1967, two months after the mono and stereo masters for &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; had been finalised, was added to the run-out groove of the initial British pressing. The two or three seconds of gibberish looped back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic phonograph arm return. Some listeners discerned words among the vocal gibberish, including Lennon saying &quot;Been so high&quot;, followed by McCartney&#x27;s response: &quot;Never could be any other way.&quot; or &quot;That’s all for now. Thanks for listening. Please come back to our next LP.&quot; US copies of the album lacked the high-pitched tone and the studio babble.

==Variations==
On the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album, the start of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is cross-faded with the applause at the end of the previous track, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)&quot;. On the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1967–1970&quot; compilation LP, the crossfade is cut off, and the track begins abruptly after the start of the original recording, but on the soundtrack album &quot;&quot; and the CD versions of &quot;1967–1970&quot;, the song starts cleanly, with no applause effects.

The &quot;Anthology 2&quot; album, released in 1996, featured a composite remix of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, including elements from the first two takes, representing the song at its early, pre-orchestral stage, while &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, the last in a trilogy of albums with &quot;Anthology 1&quot; and &quot;Anthology 2&quot;, all of which tie in with the televised special &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, included a version of &quot;The End&quot;, the last track of the album that signifies the end of The Beatles Anthology by having the last note fade into the final chord of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (reversed, then played forwards). The version on the 2006 soundtrack remix album &quot;Love&quot; has the song starting with Lennon&#x27;s intro of &quot;sugar plum fairy&quot;, with the strings being more prominent during the crescendos. In 2017, a handful of outtakes from the recording sessions, including the first take, were included on the two-disc and six-disc versions of the 50th-anniversary edition of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The six-disc version of that edition also included, on a disc of mono mixes, a previously unreleased early demo mix of the song in its pre-orchestral stage, as of 30 January.

==BBC radio ban==
The song became controversial for its supposed references to drugs. On 20 May 1967, during the BBC Light Programme&#x27;s preview of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album, disc jockey Kenny Everett was prevented from playing &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. The BBC announced that it would not broadcast the song due to the line &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot;, which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include &quot;found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream&quot;. A spokesman for the BBC stated: &quot;We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking.&quot;

At the time, Lennon and McCartney denied that there were drug references in &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and publicly complained about the ban at a dinner party at the home of their manager, Brian Epstein, celebrating their album&#x27;s release. Lennon said that the song was simply about &quot;a crash and its victim&quot;, and called the line in question &quot;the most innocent of phrases&quot;. McCartney later said: &quot;This was the only one in the album written as a deliberate provocation. A stick-that-in-your-pipe ... But what we want is to turn you on to the truth rather than pot.&quot; The Beatles nevertheless aligned themselves with the drug culture in Britain by paying for (at McCartney&#x27;s instigation) a full-page advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot;, in which, along with 60 other signatories, they and Epstein denounced the law against marijuana as &quot;immoral in principle and unworkable in practice&quot;. In addition, on 19 June, McCartney confirmed to an ITN reporter, further to his statement in a recent &quot;Life&quot; magazine interview, that he had taken LSD. Described by MacDonald as a &quot;careless admission&quot;, it led to condemnation of McCartney in the British press, recalling the outcry caused by the publication of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;More popular than Jesus&quot; remark in the US in 1966. The BBC ban on the song was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.

==Recognition and reception==
Recalling the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in his 1977 book &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot;, Nicholas Schaffner wrote that &quot;Nothing quite like &#x27;A Day in the Life&#x27; had been attempted before in so-called popular music&quot; in terms of the song&#x27;s &quot;use of dynamics and tricks of rhythm, and of space and stereo effect, and its deft intermingling of scenes from dream, reality, and shades in between&quot;. Schaffner said that in the context of 1967, the track &quot;was so visually evocative it seemed more like a film than a mere song. Except that the pictures were all in our heads.&quot; Having been given a tape of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by Harrison before leaving London, David Crosby proselytised strongly about &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; to his circle in Los Angeles, sharing the recording with his Byrds bandmates and Graham Nash. Crosby later expressed surprise that by 1970 the album&#x27;s powerful sentiments had not been enough to stop the Vietnam War.

Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the song &quot;a deadly earnest excursion in emotive music with a chilling lyric&quot; and said that it &quot;stands as one of the most important Lennon–McCartney compositions … [and] an historic Pop event&quot;. In his praise for the track, he drew comparisons between its lyrics and the work of T. S. Eliot and likened its music to Wagner. In a contemporary music critics&#x27; poll published by &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; won in the categories of Best Pop Song and Best Pop Arrangement.

In his appraisal of the song, musicologist Walter Everett states that, as on the band&#x27;s &quot;Revolver&quot; album, &quot;the most monumental piece on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s&quot;. He identifies the track&#x27;s most striking feature as &quot;its mysterious and poetic approach to serious topics that come together in a larger, direct message to its listeners, an embodiment of the central ideal for which the Beatles stood: that a truly meaningful life can be had only when one is aware of one&#x27;s self and one&#x27;s surroundings and overcomes the status quo.&quot; Beatles biographer Philip Norman describes &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and cites it as an example of how &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;certainly was John&#x27;s &quot;Freak Out!&quot;&quot;, referring to the 1966 album by the Mothers of Invention. As the closing track on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, the song was the object of intense scrutiny and commentary. In Ian MacDonald&#x27;s description, it has been interpreted &quot;as a sober return to the real world after the drunken fantasy of &#x27;Pepperland&#x27;; as a conceptual statement about the structure of the pop album (or the artifice of the studio, or the falsity of recorded performance); as an evocation of a bad [LSD] trip; as a &#x27;pop &quot;Waste Land&quot;″; even as a morbid celebration of death&quot;.

&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; became one of the Beatles&#x27; most influential songs, and many now consider it to be the band&#x27;s greatest work. Paul Grushkin, in his book &quot;Rockin&#x27; Down the Highway: The Cars and People That Made Rock Roll&quot;, called the track &quot;one of the most ambitious, influential, and groundbreaking works in pop music history&quot;. According to musicologist John Covach, A Day in the Life&#x27; is perhaps one of the most important single tracks in the history of rock music; clocking in at only four minutes and forty-five seconds, it must surely be among the shortest epic pieces in rock.&quot; In his review of the 50th anniversary edition of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Mikal Gilmore says that &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Within You Without You&quot; are the only songs on the album that transcend its legacy as &quot;a gestalt: a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. In a 2017 article for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Tim de Lisle cited Chris Smith&#x27;s recollection of him and fellow art student Freddie Mercury &quot;writ[ing] little bits of songs which we linked together, like &#x27;A Day in the Life, as evidence to show that &quot;No &quot;Pepper&quot;, no &#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27;.&quot;

James A. Moorer has said that both &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and a fugue in B minor by Bach were his sources of inspiration for Deep Note, the audio trademark he created for the THX film company. The song&#x27;s final chord inspired Apple sound designer Jim Reekes in creating the start-up chime of the Apple Macintosh featured on Macintosh Quadra computers. Reekes said he used &quot;a C Major chord, played with both hands stretched out as wide as possible&quot;, played on a Korg Wavestation EX.

&quot;A Day in the Life&quot; appears on many top songs lists. It placed twelfth on CBC&#x27;s 50 Tracks, the second highest Beatles song on the list after &quot;In My Life&quot;. It placed first in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 greatest British songs of all time, and was at the top of &quot;Mojo&quot; 101 Greatest Beatles&#x27; Songs, as decided by a panel of musicians and journalists. &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; was also nominated for a Grammy in 1967 for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist or Instrumentalist. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 28 on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, number 28 on a revised list in 2011, number 24 on a revised list on 2021, and in 2010, deemed it to be the Beatles&#x27; greatest song. It is listed at number 5 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot; list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s&quot;.

==Legacy==
On 27 August 1992 Lennon&#x27;s handwritten lyrics were sold by the estate of Mal Evans in an auction at Sotheby&#x27;s London for $100,000 (£56,600) to Joseph Reynoso, an American from Chicago. The lyrics were put up for sale again in March 2006 by Bonhams in New York. Sealed bids were opened on 7 March 2006 and offers started at about $2 million. The lyric sheet was auctioned again by Sotheby&#x27;s in June 2010. It was purchased by an anonymous American buyer who paid $1,200,000 (£810,000).

McCartney has performed the song in some of his live shows since his 2008 tour. It is played in a medley with &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. On 11 March 2022, the song was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales and streams exceeding 200,000 units.

===Cover versions===
The song has been recorded by many other artists, notably by Jeff Beck on the 1998 George Martin album &quot;In My Life&quot;, which was used in the film &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, and on Beck&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club&quot;, which won Beck the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

English group The Fall recorded a version for the NME compilation &quot;Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father&quot;.

Jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery released a smooth jazz version of the song, in his recognisable octave style with string accompaniment, on his 1967 album &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. The album also included the guitarist&#x27;s version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. The recording is one of Montgomery&#x27;s popular song adaptations, made after his shift from the hardbop and postbop Riverside Records sound to smooth jazz, A&amp;M period records that were targeted at popular audiences. The album reached number 13, Montgomery&#x27;s highest showing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

The London Symphony Orchestra released an orchestral cover of the song in 1978 on &quot;Classic Rock: The Second Movement&quot;. It was also covered by the Bee Gees for the 1978 film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and was included on the soundtrack of the same name, produced by Martin. Credited to Barry Gibb, this version was released as a single, backed by &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, which he also recorded for the film.

David Bowie used the lyric &quot;I heard the news today—oh, boy!&quot; in his 1975 song &quot;Young Americans&quot;. Lennon appeared twice on Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;Young Americans&quot;, providing guitar and backing vocals. Bob Dylan included the same line in his tribute song to Lennon, &quot;Roll on John&quot;, on the 2012 album &quot;Tempest&quot;.

Phish has covered the song more than 65 times since debuting it on 10 June 1995, often as an encore selection. Page McConnell and Trey Anastasio have split vocal duties for the Lennon/McCartney sections respectively.

A live version by Sting can be found on the EP &quot;Demolition Man&quot;.

The song&#x27;s most recent cover can be found on esperanza spalding and Milton Nascimento&#x27;s album Milton + esperanza, released on August 9, 2024.

<doc id="143431" wikidata="Q866099" url="?curid=143431" title="Stereographic projection">
<text>In mathematics, a stereographic projection is a perspective projection of the sphere, through a specific point on the sphere (the &quot;pole&quot; or &quot;center of projection&quot;), onto a plane (the &quot;projection plane&quot;) perpendicular to the diameter through the point. It is a smooth, bijective function from the entire sphere except the center of projection to the entire plane. It maps circles on the sphere to circles or lines on the plane, and is conformal, meaning that it preserves angles at which curves meet and thus locally approximately preserves shapes. It is neither isometric (distance preserving) nor equiareal (area preserving).

The stereographic projection gives a way to represent a sphere by a plane. The metric induced by the inverse stereographic projection from the plane to the sphere defines a geodesic distance between points in the plane equal to the spherical distance between the spherical points they represent. A two-dimensional coordinate system on the stereographic plane is an alternative setting for spherical analytic geometry instead of spherical polar coordinates or three-dimensional cartesian coordinates. This is the spherical analog of the Poincaré disk model of the hyperbolic plane.

Intuitively, the stereographic projection is a way of picturing the sphere as the plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the stereographic projection; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. Sometimes stereographic computations are done graphically using a special kind of graph paper called a stereographic net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net.

The origin of the stereographic projection is not known, but it is believed to have been discovered by Ancient Greek astronomers and used for projecting the celestial sphere to the plane so that the motions of stars and planets could be analyzed using plane geometry. Its earliest extant description is found in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Planisphere&quot; (2nd century AD), but it was ambiguously attributed to Hipparchus (2nd century BC) by Synesius (), and Apollonius&#x27;s &quot;Conics&quot; () contains a theorem which is crucial in proving the property that the stereographic projection maps circles to circles. Hipparchus, Apollonius, Archimedes, and even Eudoxus (4th century BC) have sometimes been speculatively credited with inventing or knowing of the stereographic projection, but some experts consider these attributions unjustified. Ptolemy refers to the use of the stereographic projection in a &quot;horoscopic instrument&quot;, perhaps the described by Vitruvius (1st century BC).

By the time of Theon of Alexandria (4th century), the planisphere had been combined with a dioptra to form the planispheric astrolabe (&quot;star taker&quot;), a capable portable device which could be used for measuring star positions and performing a wide variety of astronomical calculations. The astrolabe was in continuous use by Byzantine astronomers, and was significantly further developed by medieval Islamic astronomers. It was transmitted to Western Europe during the 11th–12th century, with Arabic texts translated into Latin.

In the 16th and 17th century, the equatorial aspect of the stereographic projection was commonly used for maps of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. It is believed that already the map created in 1507 by Gualterius Lud was in stereographic projection, as were later the maps of Jean Roze (1542), Rumold Mercator (1595), and many others. In star charts, even this equatorial aspect had been utilised already by the ancient astronomers like Ptolemy.

François d&#x27;Aguilon gave the stereographic projection its current name in his 1613 work &quot;Opticorum libri sex philosophis juxta ac mathematicis utiles&quot; (Six Books of Optics, useful for philosophers and mathematicians alike).

In the late 16th century, Thomas Harriot proved that the stereographic projection is conformal; however, this proof was never published and sat among his papers in a box for more than three centuries. In 1695, Edmond Halley, motivated by his interest in star charts, was the first to publish a proof. He used the recently established tools of calculus, invented by his friend Isaac Newton.

==Definition==

===First formulation===
The unit sphere in three-dimensional space is the set of points such that . Let be the &quot;north pole&quot;, and let be the rest of the sphere. The plane runs through the center of the sphere; the &quot;equator&quot; is the intersection of the sphere with this plane.

For any point on , there is a unique line through and , and this line intersects the plane in exactly one point , known as the stereographic projection of onto the plane.

In Cartesian coordinates on the sphere and on the plane, the projection and its inverse are given by the formulas

:formula_1

In spherical coordinates on the sphere (with the zenith angle, , and the azimuth, ) and polar coordinates on the plane, the projection and its inverse are

:formula_2

Here, is understood to have value when = 0. Also, there are many ways to rewrite these formulas using trigonometric identities. In cylindrical coordinates on the sphere and polar coordinates on the plane, the projection and its inverse are

:formula_3

===Other conventions===

Some authors define stereographic projection from the north pole (0, 0, 1) onto the plane , which is tangent to the unit sphere at the south pole (0, 0, −1). This can be described as a composition of a projection onto the equatorial plane described above, and a homothety from it to the polar plane. The homothety scales the image by a factor of 2 (a ratio of a diameter to a radius of the sphere), hence the values and produced by this projection are exactly twice those produced by the equatorial projection described in the preceding section. For example, this projection sends the equator to the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. While the equatorial projection produces no infinitesimal area distortion along the equator, this pole-tangent projection instead produces no infinitesimal area distortion at the south pole.

Other authors use a sphere of radius and the plane . In this case the formulae become
:formula_4
In general, one can define a stereographic projection from any point on the sphere onto any plane such that
* is perpendicular to the diameter through , and
* does not contain .
As long as meets these conditions, then for any point other than the line through and meets in exactly one point , which is defined to be the stereographic projection of &quot;P&quot; onto &quot;E&quot;.

===Generalizations===
More generally, stereographic projection may be applied to the unit -sphere in ()-dimensional Euclidean space . If is a point of and a hyperplane in , then the stereographic projection of a point is the point of intersection of the line with . In Cartesian coordinates (, from 0 to ) on and (, from 1 to &quot;n&quot;) on , the projection from is given by
formula_5
Defining
formula_6
the inverse is given by
formula_7

Still more generally, suppose that is a (nonsingular) quadric hypersurface in the projective space . In other words, is the locus of zeros of a non-singular quadratic form in the homogeneous coordinates . Fix any point on and a hyperplane in not containing . Then the stereographic projection of a point in is the unique point of intersection of with . As before, the stereographic projection is conformal and invertible on a non-empty Zariski open set. The stereographic projection presents the quadric hypersurface as a rational hypersurface. This construction plays a role in algebraic geometry and conformal geometry.

==Properties==
The first stereographic projection defined in the preceding section sends the &quot;south pole&quot; (0, 0, −1) of the unit sphere to (0, 0), the equator to the unit circle, the southern hemisphere to the region inside the circle, and the northern hemisphere to the region outside the circle.

The projection is not defined at the projection point = (0, 0, 1). Small neighborhoods of this point are sent to subsets of the plane far away from (0, 0). The closer is to (0, 0, 1), the more distant its image is from (0, 0) in the plane. For this reason it is common to speak of (0, 0, 1) as mapping to &quot;infinity&quot; in the plane, and of the sphere as completing the plane by adding a point at infinity. This notion finds utility in projective geometry and complex analysis. On a merely topological level, it illustrates how the sphere is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the plane.

In Cartesian coordinates a point on the sphere and its image on the plane either both are rational points or none of them:
: formula_8

Stereographic projection is conformal, meaning that it preserves the angles at which curves cross each other (see figures). On the other hand, stereographic projection does not preserve area; in general, the area of a region of the sphere does not equal the area of its projection onto the plane. The area element is given in coordinates by
:formula_9
Along the unit circle, where , there is no inflation of area in the limit, giving a scale factor of 1. Near (0, 0) areas are inflated by a factor of 4, and near infinity areas are inflated by arbitrarily small factors.

The metric is given in coordinates by
:formula_10
and is the unique formula found in Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot; on the foundations of geometry, delivered at Göttingen in 1854, and entitled &quot;Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen&quot;.

No map from the sphere to the plane can be both conformal and area-preserving. If it were, then it would be a local isometry and would preserve Gaussian curvature. The sphere and the plane have different Gaussian curvatures, so this is impossible.

Circles on the sphere that do &quot;not&quot; pass through the point of projection are projected to circles on the plane. Circles on the sphere that &quot;do&quot; pass through the point of projection are projected to straight lines on the plane. These lines are sometimes thought of as circles through the point at infinity, or circles of infinite radius. These properties can be verified by using the expressions of formula_11 in terms of formula_12 given in : using these expressions for a substitution in the equation formula_13 of the plane containing a circle on the sphere, and clearing denominators, one gets the equation of a circle, that is, a second-degree equation with formula_14 as its quadratic part. The equation becomes linear if formula_15 that is, if the plane passes through the point of projection.

All lines in the plane, when transformed to circles on the sphere by the inverse of stereographic projection, meet at the projection point. Parallel lines, which do not intersect in the plane, are transformed to circles tangent at projection point. Intersecting lines are transformed to circles that intersect transversally at two points in the sphere, one of which is the projection point. (Similar remarks hold about the real projective plane, but the intersection relationships are different there.)
The loxodromes of the sphere map to curves on the plane of the form
:formula_16
where the parameter measures the &quot;tightness&quot; of the loxodrome. Thus loxodromes correspond to logarithmic spirals. These spirals intersect radial lines in the plane at equal angles, just as the loxodromes intersect meridians on the sphere at equal angles. 

The stereographic projection relates to the plane inversion in a simple way. Let and be two points on the sphere with projections and on the plane. Then and are inversive images of each other in the image of the equatorial circle if and only if and are reflections of each other in the equatorial plane.

In other words, if:
* is a point on the sphere, but not a &#x27;north pole&#x27; and not its antipode, the &#x27;south pole&#x27; ,
* is the image of in a stereographic projection with the projection point and
* is the image of in a stereographic projection with the projection point ,
then and are inversive images of each other in the unit circle.
: formula_17
==Wulff net==
Stereographic projection plots can be carried out by a computer using the explicit formulas given above. However, for graphing by hand these formulas are unwieldy. Instead, it is common to use graph paper designed specifically for the task. This special graph paper is called a stereonet or Wulff net, after the Russian mineralogist George (Yuri Viktorovich) Wulff.

The Wulff net shown here is the stereographic projection of the grid of parallels and meridians of a hemisphere centred at a point on the equator (such as the Eastern or Western hemisphere of a planet).

In the figure, the area-distorting property of the stereographic projection can be seen by comparing a grid sector near the center of the net with one at the far right or left. The two sectors have equal areas on the sphere. On the disk, the latter has nearly four times the area of the former. If the grid is made finer, this ratio approaches exactly 4.

On the Wulff net, the images of the parallels and meridians intersect at right angles. This orthogonality property is a consequence of the angle-preserving property of the stereographic projection. (However, the angle-preserving property is stronger than this property. Not all projections that preserve the orthogonality of parallels and meridians are angle-preserving.)
For an example of the use of the Wulff net, imagine two copies of it on thin paper, one atop the other, aligned and tacked at their mutual center. Let be the point on the lower unit hemisphere whose spherical coordinates are (140°, 60°) and whose Cartesian coordinates are (0.321, 0.557, −0.766). This point lies on a line oriented 60° counterclockwise from the positive -axis (or 30° clockwise from the positive -axis) and 50° below the horizontal plane . Once these angles are known, there are four steps to plotting :
#Using the grid lines, which are spaced 10° apart in the figures here, mark the point on the edge of the net that is 60° counterclockwise from the point (1, 0) (or 30° clockwise from the point (0, 1)).
#Rotate the top net until this point is aligned with (1, 0) on the bottom net.
#Using the grid lines on the bottom net, mark the point that is 50° toward the center from that point.
#Rotate the top net oppositely to how it was oriented before, to bring it back into alignment with the bottom net. The point marked in step 3 is then the projection that we wanted.
To plot other points, whose angles are not such round numbers as 60° and 50°, one must visually interpolate between the nearest grid lines. It is helpful to have a net with finer spacing than 10°. Spacings of 2° are common.

To find the central angle between two points on the sphere based on their stereographic plot, overlay the plot on a Wulff net and rotate the plot about the center until the two points lie on or near a meridian. Then measure the angle between them by counting grid lines along that meridian.
==Applications within mathematics==

===Complex analysis===
Although any stereographic projection misses one point on the sphere (the projection point), the entire sphere can be mapped using two projections from distinct projection points. In other words, the sphere can be covered by two stereographic parametrizations (the inverses of the projections) from the plane. The parametrizations can be chosen to induce the same orientation on the sphere. Together, they describe the sphere as an oriented surface (or two-dimensional manifold).

This construction has special significance in complex analysis. The point in the real plane can be identified with the complex number . The stereographic projection from the north pole onto the equatorial plane is then
:formula_18

Similarly, letting be another complex coordinate, the functions
:formula_19
define a stereographic projection from the south pole onto the equatorial plane. The transition maps between the - and -coordinates are then and , with approaching 0 as goes to infinity, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. This facilitates an elegant and useful notion of infinity for the complex numbers and indeed an entire theory of meromorphic functions mapping to the Riemann sphere. The standard metric on the unit sphere agrees with the Fubini–Study metric on the Riemann sphere.

===Visualization of lines and planes===
The set of all lines through the origin in three-dimensional space forms a space called the real projective plane. This plane is difficult to visualize, because it cannot be embedded in three-dimensional space.

However, one can visualize it as a disk, as follows. Any line through the origin intersects the southern hemisphere  ≤ 0 in a point, which can then be stereographically projected to a point on a disk in the XY plane. Horizontal lines through the origin intersect the southern hemisphere in two antipodal points along the equator, which project to the boundary of the disk. Either of the two projected points can be considered part of the disk; it is understood that antipodal points on the equator represent a single line in 3 space and a single point on the boundary of the projected disk (see quotient topology). So any set of lines through the origin can be pictured as a set of points in the projected disk. But the boundary points behave differently from the boundary points of an ordinary 2-dimensional disk, in that any one of them is simultaneously close to interior points on opposite sides of the disk (just as two nearly horizontal lines through the origin can project to points on opposite sides of the disk).

Also, every plane through the origin intersects the unit sphere in a great circle, called the &quot;trace&quot; of the plane. This circle maps to a circle under stereographic projection. So the projection lets us visualize planes as circular arcs in the disk. Prior to the availability of computers, stereographic projections with great circles often involved drawing large-radius arcs that required use of a beam compass. Computers now make this task much easier.

Further associated with each plane is a unique line, called the plane&#x27;s &quot;pole&quot;, that passes through the origin and is perpendicular to the plane. This line can be plotted as a point on the disk just as any line through the origin can. So the stereographic projection also lets us visualize planes as points in the disk. For plots involving many planes, plotting their poles produces a less-cluttered picture than plotting their traces.

This construction is used to visualize directional data in crystallography and geology, as described below.

===Other visualization===
Stereographic projection is also applied to the visualization of polytopes. In a Schlegel diagram, an -dimensional polytope in is projected onto an -dimensional sphere, which is then stereographically projected onto . The reduction from to can make the polytope easier to visualize and understand.

===Arithmetic geometry===

In elementary arithmetic geometry, stereographic projection from the unit circle provides a means to describe all primitive Pythagorean triples. Specifically, stereographic projection from the north pole (0,1) onto the -axis gives a one-to-one correspondence between the rational number points on the unit circle (with ) and the rational points of the -axis. If is a rational point on the -axis, then its inverse stereographic projection is the point

:formula_20

which gives Euclid&#x27;s formula for a Pythagorean triple.

===Tangent half-angle substitution===
The pair of trigonometric functions can be thought of as parametrizing the unit circle. The stereographic projection gives an alternative parametrization of the unit circle:
:formula_21
Under this reparametrization, the length element of the unit circle goes over to
:formula_22
This substitution can sometimes simplify integrals involving trigonometric functions.

==Applications to other disciplines==

===Cartography===
The fundamental problem of cartography is that no map from the sphere to the plane can accurately represent both angles and areas. In general, area-preserving map projections are preferred for statistical applications, while angle-preserving (conformal) map projections are preferred for navigation.

Stereographic projection falls into the second category. When the projection is centered at the Earth&#x27;s north or south pole, it has additional desirable properties: It sends meridians to rays emanating from the origin and parallels to circles centered at the origin.

===Planetary science===

The stereographic is the only projection that maps all circles on a sphere to circles on a plane. This property is valuable in planetary mapping where craters are typical features. The set of circles passing through the point of projection have unbounded radius, and therefore degenerate into lines.
===Crystallography===
A crystallographic pole figure for the [[Diamond cubic|diamond lattice]] in [[Miller index|[111] direction]]
In crystallography, the orientations of crystal axes and faces in three-dimensional space are a central geometric concern, for example in the interpretation of X-ray and electron diffraction patterns. These orientations can be visualized as in the section Visualization of lines and planes above. That is, crystal axes and poles to crystal planes are intersected with the northern hemisphere and then plotted using stereographic projection. A plot of poles is called a pole figure.

In electron diffraction, Kikuchi line pairs appear as bands decorating the intersection between lattice plane traces and the Ewald sphere thus providing &quot;experimental access&quot; to a crystal&#x27;s stereographic projection. Model Kikuchi maps in reciprocal space, and fringe visibility maps for use with bend contours in direct space, thus act as road maps for exploring orientation space with crystals in the transmission electron microscope.
===Geology===
Researchers in structural geology are concerned with the orientations of planes and lines for a number of reasons. The foliation of a rock is a planar feature that often contains a linear feature called lineation. Similarly, a fault plane is a planar feature that may contain linear features such as slickensides.

These orientations of lines and planes at various scales can be plotted using the methods of the Visualization of lines and planes section above. As in crystallography, planes are typically plotted by their poles. Unlike crystallography, the southern hemisphere is used instead of the northern one (because the geological features in question lie below the Earth&#x27;s surface). In this context the stereographic projection is often referred to as the equal-angle lower-hemisphere projection. The equal-area lower-hemisphere projection defined by the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection is also used, especially when the plot is to be subjected to subsequent statistical analysis such as density contouring.
===Rock mechanics===
The stereographic projection is one of the most widely used methods for evaluating rock slope stability. It allows for the representation and analysis of three-dimensional orientation data in two dimensions. Kinematic analysis within stereographic projection is used to assess the potential for various modes of rock slope failures—such as plane, wedge, and toppling failures—which occur due to the presence of unfavorably oriented discontinuities. This technique is particularly useful for visualizing the orientation of rock slopes in relation to discontinuity sets, facilitating the assessment of the most likely failure type. For instance, plane failure is more likely when the strike of a discontinuity set is parallel to the slope, and the discontinuities dip towards the slope at an angle steep enough to allow sliding, but not steeper than the slope itself.

Additionally, some authors have developed graphical methods based on stereographic projection to easily calculate geometrical correction parameters—such as those related to the parallelism between the slope and discontinuities, the dip of the discontinuity, and the relative angle between the discontinuity and the slope—for rock mass classifications in slopes, including slope mass rating (SMR) and rock mass rating.

===Photography===
Some fisheye lenses use a stereographic projection to capture a wide-angle view. Compared to more traditional fisheye lenses which use an equal-area projection, areas close to the edge retain their shape, and straight lines are less curved. However, stereographic fisheye lenses are typically more expensive to manufacture. Image remapping software, such as Panotools, allows the automatic remapping of photos from an equal-area fisheye to a stereographic projection.

The stereographic projection has been used to map spherical panoramas, starting with Horace Bénédict de Saussure&#x27;s in 1779. This results in effects known as a &quot;little planet&quot; (when the center of projection is the nadir) and a &quot;tube&quot; (when the center of projection is the zenith).

The popularity of using stereographic projections to map panoramas over other azimuthal projections is attributed to the shape preservation that results from the conformality of the projection.

<doc id="143432" wikidata="Q792363" url="?curid=143432" title="Culture of Belgium">
<text>The culture of Belgium involves both the aspects shared by all Belgians regardless of the language they speak and the differences between the main cultural communities: the Dutch-speaking Belgians (mostly Flemish) and the French-speaking Belgians (mostly Walloons and Brusselians). Most Belgians view their culture as an integral part of European culture.

The territory corresponding to present-day Belgium having always been located at the meeting point of Germanic and Latin Europe, it benefited from a rich cross-fertilization of cultures for centuries. Due to its strategic position in the heart of Europe, Belgium has been at the origin of many European artistic and cultural movements.

Famous elements of Belgian culture include gastronomy (Belgian beers, fries, chocolate, waffles, etc.), the comic strip tradition (&quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Spirou &amp; Fantasio&quot;, &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, etc.), painting and architecture (Mosan art, Early Netherlandish painting, the Flemish Renaissance, Baroque painting and Art Nouveau, as well as major examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture), folklore, and surrealism.

Since modern culture is more than ever related to languages (theatre, media, literature, etc), modern Belgian cultural life has tended to develop in each linguistic community (with common elements however). Members of each of the two main linguistic groups generally make their cultural choices from within their own language community, and then, when going beyond, the Flemish draw intensively from both English-speaking culture (which dominates sciences, professional life and most news media) and the Netherlands, whereas French-speakers tend to focus more on cultural life in France and elsewhere in the French-speaking world.

Minorities, such as the Jews who have formed a component of Belgian culture — in particular that of Antwerp — for over five hundred years, have some specific cultural aspects.

==Art==
===Painting===

Belgium&#x27;s contributions to painting have been especially rich. Mosan art, Early Netherlandish painting, the Flemish Renaissance, and Baroque painting are milestones in the history of art. While 15th-century art in the Low Countries is dominated by the religious paintings of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, the 16th century is characterised by a broader panel of styles such as Peter Brueghel&#x27;s landscape paintings and Lambert Lombard&#x27;s representation of the antique. Though the Baroque style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands, it gradually declined thereafter.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, many original romantic, expressionist and surrealist Belgian painters emerged, including James Ensor and other artists belonging to the Les XX group, Constant Permeke, Paul Delvaux and René Magritte. The avant-garde CoBrA movement appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor Panamarenko remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art. Multidisciplinary artists Jan Fabre, Wim Delvoye and the painter Luc Tuymans are other internationally renowned figures on the contemporary art scene.

===Comics===

Belgium has numerous well-known cartoonists, such as Hergé (&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;), Peyo (&quot;The Smurfs&quot;), Franquin (&quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;, &quot;Marsupilami&quot;, &quot;Gaston&quot;), Willy Vandersteen (&quot;Spike and Suzy&quot;), Morris (&quot;Lucky Luke&quot;), Edgar P. Jacobs (&quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot;), Jef Nys (&quot;Jommeke&quot;) and Marc Sleen (&quot;Nero&quot;). More recently, Jean Van Hamme (&quot;XIII&quot;, &quot;Largo Winch&quot;, &quot;Thorgal&quot;, etc.), Raoul Cauvin (&quot;Les Tuniques Bleues&quot;, &quot;Agent 212&quot;), François Schuiten and Benoît Peeters (&quot;Les Cités Obscures&quot;) are among the most read cartoonists.

Belgium is home to some of the most important European comics magazines and publishers, with Dupuis (&quot;Spirou&quot; magazine), Le Lombard (&quot;Tintin&quot; magazine) and Casterman.

===Museums===
Some of the most impressive museums in Belgium are the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, which has a cinema, a concert hall and artworks of many periods, including a large René Magritte collection; the Royal Museum for Fine Arts in Antwerp, which has an admirable collection of works by Peter Paul Rubens; the Groeningemuseum in Bruges, with the Flemish Primitives; and the Museum aan de Stroom (MAS) in Antwerp, which is located on &#x27;t eilandje and is the biggest museum in Belgium.

Furthermore, the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the complete factory of the largest 17th-century publishing house.

==Architecture==

Examples of Belgian architecture include the Romanesque Collegiate Church of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (1046) and the Cathedral of Our Lady in Tournai, the Gothic 15th-century Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp and the Baroque Grand-Place/Grote Markt (main square) in Brussels. Mosan style is typical of the architecture within the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.

Belgian contributions to architecture also continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde, who were major initiators of the Art Nouveau style in Belgium and abroad.

==Literature==
Belgium has produced several well-known authors, including the poets Emile Verhaeren, Guido Gezelle, Robert Goffin, Paul van Ostaijen, and Henri Michaux, as well as the novelists Cyriel Buysse, Hendrik Conscience, Stijn Streuvels, Charles de Coster, Willem Elsschot, Michel de Ghelderode, Georges Simenon, Louis Paul Boon, Suzanne Lilar, Hugo Claus, Pierre Mertens, Ernest Claes, and Amélie Nothomb. The poet and playwright Maurice Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911.

Belgian literature was more cohesive in the past but is now divided based on linguistic lines. Until the mid-20th century, Belgian writers more often wrote in French even if they were Flemish, due both to the then-dominant position of that language in worldwide culture as well as within Belgium itself (e.g. Suzanne Lilar, Emile Verhaeren, and Maurice Maeterlinck). As the Flemish movement grew in importance, Dutch-penned authors became increasingly prominent in Flanders and even played an important role in the said movement (e.g. Hendrik Conscience). Important contemporary Flemish authors are Tom Lanoye or Dimitri Verhulst.

Belgian francophone literature is sometimes difficult to distinguish from French literature as a whole, because several great French authors went to Belgium for refuge (e.g. Apollinaire, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, and more recently Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt) and conversely, top French-speaking writers sometimes settle in Paris (e.g. Simenon and Amélie Nothomb). Belgian francophone literature is characterised by authors who achieved a nationwide success in Belgium while being little known in France, and shares traits that are perceived as typically Belgian: use of black humour, self-derision, surrealism and absurdism (in a similar vein as Belgian painters such as René Magritte), as well as references to Belgian history and society (such as Belgian royalty, language conflicts, former colony of the Congo, Belgian beers and gastronomy, and whatever is typically Belgian) and they are often active in Belgian medias as columnists or entertainers. Such authors include Thomas Gunzig, Juan d&#x27;Oultremont, and Jacques Mercier.

There have also been writers in the Walloon language, such as Nicolas Defrecheux and Edouard Remouchamps.

==Cinema==
Belgian cinema has brought a number of mainly Flemish novels to life on-screen. Notable examples include &quot;De Witte&quot; (1934, remake as &quot;De Witte van Sichem&quot;, 1980); &quot;De man die zijn haar kort liet knippen&quot; (1965); &quot;Mira&quot; (1971); &quot;Malpertuis&quot; (1971); &quot;De loteling&quot; (1974); &quot;Dood van een non&quot; (1975); &quot;Pallieter&quot; (1976); &quot;De komst van Joachim Stiller&quot; (1976); &quot;De Leeuw van Vlaanderen&quot; (1985); and &quot;Daens&quot; (1992).

Belgian films have been awarded several times at the Cannes Film Festival and in other less-known festivals. They are generally made with a small budget, and are mostly funded by the regional governments (the Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds, and Wallimage, among others) and private corporations by means of sponsorship and product placement.

Famous Belgian directors include André Delvaux, Stijn Coninx, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne; well-known actors include Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jan Decleir and Marie Gillain; and successful films include &quot;Bullhead, Man Bites Dog&quot; and &quot;The Alzheimer Affair&quot;.

==Music==

The vocal music of the Franco-Flemish School developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture. Many great medieval and Renaissance composers, such as Gilles Binchois, Orlande de Lassus, Guillaume Dufay, Heinrich Isaac, and Jacob Obrecht came from the area which is now Belgium.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as Henri Vieuxtemps, Eugène Ysaÿe and Arthur Grumiaux. Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone, was born in Belgium, and so were many important classical composers. One of the most famous is César Franck, but Guillaume Lekeu and Wim Mertens are also noteworthy.

Contemporary popular music in Belgium is also of repute. Well-known singers include Lara Fabian, Stromae, Jacques Brel, Angèle, Arno, Maurane, Bobbejaan Schoepen, Salvatore Adamo, Philippe Lafontaine and Pierre Rapsat. Other popular Belgian pop acts include Axelle Red, Vaya Con Dios, Kate Ryan and K3. In rock/pop music, Telex, Front 242, K&#x27;s Choice, Hooverphonic, Zap Mama, Soulwax and dEUS are well known. In the heavy metal scene, bands like Machiavel, Channel Zero and Enthroned have a worldwide fan-base. Belgium has a very active jazz scene that is achieving international recognition with bands like Aka Moon, Maak&#x27;s Spirit and Octurn. Harmonicist Toots Thielemans, guitarist Philip Catherine and Django Reinhardt are probably the best known Belgian jazz musicians. Belgian hip-hop started with the rise of Starflam, CNN (a Brussels-based crew) and &#x27;t Hof van Commerce in the mid-1990s. The country has also influenced electronic music with a.o. Front 242, Praga Khan (also known as Lords of Acid) and 2 Many DJ&#x27;s.

Belgium is also home to some very popular music festivals such as Tomorrowland, Rock Werchter and Pukkelpop.

==Fashion==
Belgium is also home to a number of successful fashion designers. For instance, in the 1980s, Antwerp&#x27;s Royal Academy of Fine Arts produced important fashion trendsetters, known as the Antwerp Six.

==Cuisine==

Belgium is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles and French fries. The national dishes are &quot;steak and fries&quot;, and &quot;mussels with fries&quot;. Many highly ranked Belgian restaurants can be found in the most influential restaurant guides, such as the Michelin Guide. One of the many beers with high prestige is the ale produced by the Trappist monks. Traditionally each abbey&#x27;s beer is served in its own glass (the forms, heights and widths are different). Six of the eleven breweries sanctioned to brew Trappist beer are Belgian.

Although Belgian gastronomy is connected to French cuisine, some recipes were reputedly invented there, such as French fries (despite the name, although their exact place of origin is uncertain), Flemish Stew (a beef stew with beer, mustard and bay laurel), speculaas (or &quot;speculoos&quot; in French, a sort of cinnamon and ginger-flavoured shortcrust biscuit), Brussels waffles (and their variant, Liège waffles), waterzooi (a broth made with chicken or fish, cream and vegetables), endive with bechamel sauce, Brussels sprouts, Belgian pralines (Belgium has some of the most renowned chocolate houses), &quot;charcuterie&quot; (deli meats) and &quot;Paling in &#x27;t groen&quot; (river eels in a sauce of green herbs).

Brands of Belgian chocolate and pralines, like Côte d&#x27;Or, Neuhaus, Leonidas and Godiva are famous, as well as independent producers such as Burie and Del Rey in Antwerp and Mary&#x27;s in Brussels. Belgium produces over 1100 varieties of beer. The Trappist beer of the Abbey of Westvleteren has repeatedly been rated the world&#x27;s best beer.
The biggest brewer in the world by volume is Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in Leuven.

==Folklore==

Folklore plays a major role in Belgium&#x27;s cultural life; the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, ommegangs, ducasses, kermesses, and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or mythological background. The three-day Carnival of Binche, near Mons, with its famous Gilles (men dressed in high, plumed hats and bright costumes) is held just before Lent (the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter). Together with the &#x27;Processional Giants and Dragons&#x27; of Ath, Brussels, Dendermonde, Mechelen and Mons, it is recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

Other examples are the three-day Carnival of Aalst in February or March; the still very religious processions of the Holy Blood taking place in Bruges in May, the Virga Jesse procession held every seven years in Hasselt, the annual procession of Hanswijk in Mechelen, the 15 August festivities in Liège, and the Walloon festival in Namur. Originated in 1832 and revived in the 1960s, the Gentse Feesten (a music and theatre festival organised in Ghent around Belgian National Day, on 21 July) have become a modern tradition. Several of these festivals include sporting competitions, such as cycling, and many fall under the category of kermesses.

A major non-official holiday (which is however not an official public holiday) is Saint Nicholas Day (Dutch: &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;, French: &quot;la Saint-Nicolas&quot;), a festivity for children, and in Liège, for students. It takes place each year on 6 December and is a sort of early Christmas. On the evening of 5 December, before going to bed, children put their shoes by the hearth with water or wine and a carrot for Saint Nicholas&#x27;s horse or donkey. According to tradition, Saint Nicholas comes at night and travels down the chimney. He then takes the food and water or wine, leaves presents, goes back up, feeds his horse or donkey, and continues on his course. He also knows whether children have been good or bad. This holiday is especially loved by children in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dutch immigrants imported the tradition into the United States, where Saint Nicholas is now known as Santa Claus.

<doc id="143433" wikidata="Q212156" url="?curid=143433" title="Angel (1999 TV series)">
<text>Angel is an American supernatural television series, a spinoff of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The series was created by &quot;Buffy&quot;″s creator, writer and director Joss Whedon, in collaboration with David Greenwalt. It aired on The WB from October 5, 1999, to May 19, 2004, consisting of five seasons and 110 episodes. Like &quot;Buffy&quot;, it was produced by Whedon&#x27;s production company, Mutant Enemy.

The show details the ongoing trials of Angel, a vampire whose human soul was restored to him by a Romani curse as a punishment for the murder of one of their own. After more than a century of murder and the torture of innocents, Angel&#x27;s restored soul torments him with guilt and remorse. Angel moves to Los Angeles, California, after it is clear that his doomed relationship with Buffy, the vampire slayer, cannot continue. During the majority of the show, he works as a private detective in Los Angeles, where he and a variety of associates work to &quot;help the helpless&quot;, restoring the faith and saving the souls of those who have lost their way. While he must also battle his own demonic nature, he typically battles with evil demons or humans allied to them, primarily related to Wolfram &amp; Hart, a law firm supported by occult practices which is an extension of otherworldly demonic forces.

The show is considered by many critics as one of the best TV spin-off series of all time with praise for its darker tone, characters and performances.

== Characters ==
The series focuses on Angel (David Boreanaz), an Irish vampire who is over 240 years old. Angel was known as Angelus during his rampages across Europe, but was cursed with a soul, which gave him a conscience and guilt for centuries of murder and torture. He left &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; at the end of season 3 to move to Los Angeles in search of redemption.

He soon finds himself assisted by Allen Francis Doyle (Glenn Quinn), another Irish character who is a half-human, half-demon who, although he comes across as a ne&#x27;er-do-well hustler, has a heroic side. Doyle serves to pass along cryptic visions from The Powers That Be to Angel. They&#x27;re soon joined by Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), also a previous cast member of &quot;Buffy.&quot; Formerly a popular high school cheerleader of Sunnydale High, Cordelia starts her tenure on the show as a more vain and self-centered personality, but grows over the course of the series into a hero. Cordelia acquires Doyle&#x27;s visions via a shared kiss prior to Doyle&#x27;s death. With the death of Doyle in the ninth episode of the show&#x27;s first season, another character from the &quot;Buffy&quot; series makes the jump to its spinoff: Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) joins the team under the brave guise of &quot;rogue demon hunter,&quot; acting as comic relief and initially not well accepted. Over time, Wesley shows bravery and strength as well as some cold-blooded killing ability, like his colleague Rupert Giles, and grows into a leader.

In season 2 of the show, Angel, Cordelia and Wesley are joined by Charles Gunn (J. August Richards), a young demon hunter who must initially adjust to working with and for a vampire. At the end of season 2, they travel to the demon world Pylea, where they save Winifred &quot;Fred&quot; Burkle (Amy Acker), a young Texan physicist whose social skills have become stunted after five years&#x27; captivity; she later grows to become more outspoken. Season 3 saw the introduction of Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), the &quot;miracle&quot; human-like child of two vampires, Angel and Darla. Abducted into a Hell dimension as a baby, he is raised by Angel&#x27;s enemy Daniel Holtz, and only a few weeks after he left comes back as a teenager and reluctantly comes to accept his lineage. Although introduced during season 2, Lorne (Andy Hallett) joins the team during season 3. An outgoing, pacifist demon with prophetic and empathic abilities, Lorne&#x27;s role is predominantly to support the team.

Season 5, the show&#x27;s final season, introduces several new cast members, chief amongst them Spike (James Marsters), an old vampire ally/foe of Angel&#x27;s who also starred in &quot;Buffy.&quot; In this series, Spike reluctantly fights beside Angel as their rivalry continues—now tinged with Spike existing as another vampire with a soul, and by the romantic feelings that both of them have for Buffy Summers. One of the legendary Old Ones, Illyria (Amy Acker) starts off as an adversary of the team after taking over Fred&#x27;s body, but comes to join the team as she must learn to cope with the changed world and the new emotions she feels as a result of taking over a human. Finally, there&#x27;s Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), another &quot;Buffy&quot; alumna and former friend of Cordelia who was turned into a vampire. Resembling the old personality of Cordelia, Harmony is grudgingly accepted by Angel as his secretary when he takes over the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram &amp; Hart.

Many characters on &quot;Angel&quot; made recurring appearances. The two longest-running recurring characters are Lilah Morgan (Seasons 1–4) and Lindsey McDonald (Seasons 1, 2, and 5), appearing in 36 and 21 episodes, respectively; Lindsey is the only character besides Angel to appear in both the first and last episode of the series. Angel&#x27;s sire Darla (Julie Benz), first seen in &quot;Buffy&quot;, plays an expanded role on &quot;Angel&quot; and appears in 20 episodes over the course of the series. Elisabeth Röhm appears in 15 episodes (Seasons 1–2) as LAPD Detective Kate Lockley, a woman with an often-strained relationship with Angel.

Throughout the series, there were also guest appearances from &quot;Buffy&quot; characters, including main cast members Buffy Summers, Willow Rosenberg and Daniel &quot;Oz&quot; Osbourne. The rogue slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) played an important part in episodes of Seasons 1, 2, and 4; Anne Steele and Andrew Wells also originated on &quot;Buffy&quot; and appeared in two or more &quot;Angel&quot; episodes. Whedon also used two actors from his cancelled television series &quot;Firefly&quot;, Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin, to play Jasmine and Marcus Hamilton, respectively.

== Setting and filming locations ==
Much of &quot;Angel&quot; was shot on location in Los Angeles, where it is also set. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; are the first words spoken in the premiere episode, and the cityscape is the first image seen in the opening credits. Joss Whedon said, &quot;It is set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told.&quot; Producer Marti Noxon has expanded on this explanation: &quot;Los Angeles was the place that Joss Whedon picked for very specific reasons. There&#x27;s a lot of preconceptions about what the place is, but there are a lot of truths. It&#x27;s a pretty competitive, intense town, where a lot of lonely, isolated, and desperate people end up. It&#x27;s a good place for monsters.&quot; Many episodes feature references to the city, and the opening episode of the second season features Lorne offering this observation of the city:

In the essay, &quot;Los Angeles: The City of Angel&quot; (from the essay collection, &quot;Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul&quot;), Benjamin Jacob explores why Los Angeles in particular should be important to the series. Jacob suggests several explanations: first, the name connection (&#x27;City of Angels&#x27;); second, the double-sided nature, the &quot;other side of the stereotypical sunshine city, Beach Boys and Walt Disney&quot;, &quot;the place of pain, anonymity, alienation and broken dreams&quot;.; third, American noir was originally a &quot;Los Angelian genre&quot;. &quot;Angel&quot; was originally conceived as supernatural noir. Noir had continued investigation of the &quot;dark city, a place of regression and darkness as a counterpoint to the city&#x27;s promise of progress and civilization&quot; that had begun under William Blake and Charles Dickens.

During Season 1, Angel Investigations is based in Angel&#x27;s apartment. Actor Alexis Denisof, who played Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, said: &quot;Angel had this dark, foreboding, underground cellar apartment with columns, with this antique furniture all around, and this pokey little office upstairs&quot; These offices were blown up at the climax of the first season, and Angel Investigations found a new base in the episode &quot;Are You Now or Have You Ever Been&quot;.

Production designer Stuart Blatt outlined the new base: &quot;An old hotel, something [the writers] could use to evoke the past of Los Angeles and some of Angel&#x27;s history, something kind of creepy and spooky but not too dark because they didn&#x27;t want something depressing, it&#x27;s called the Hyperion Hotel. It&#x27;s based on many hotels in Los Angeles... Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and get away from it all, do a little pondering, a little brooding, and a little research. Every once in a while, someone will come up to have a little conversation.&quot; In the final season, the team moves to the evil law firm, Wolfram &amp; Hart.

== Format ==
Much like &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; is told in a serialized format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger storyline. Unlike &quot;Buffy&quot;, however, the season-long narratives are not marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful antagonist, commonly referred to as the &quot;Big Bad&quot; in the parent series. Instead, the overarching story of all five seasons of the series pitted Angel as the central player in a battle between the &quot;good&quot; Powers That Be and the &quot;evil&quot; law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart and his possible role in a prophesied apocalypse. It mixes the complex, series-long storyline along with more stand-alone, villain-of-the-week episodes. The show blends different genres, including horror, fantasy, supernatural, and a combination of comedic and dramatic content.

Season 1 is mainly told in a &quot;monster of the week&quot; format, with each episode creating a self-contained story that took place around the title character. Later seasons became more serialized, where the majority of episodes contribute to a larger story arc that unfolded over many episodes. The most extreme example of this is season 4, in which almost every episode contributed to the main storyline, and often picked up exactly where the previous episode ended.

The series&#x27; narrative revolves around Angel and his colleagues, collectively making up the detective agency Angel Investigations, who fight against supernatural evils and work to &quot;help the helpless&quot;. A typical episode contains one or more villains, or supernatural phenomena that is thwarted or defeated, and one or more people in need of help, a few of whom Angel and associates are not able to assist (including some main characters) since episode one. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses centrally on Angel and his road to redemption.

The most prominent monsters in the &quot;Angel&quot; bestiary are vampires, which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. Angel and his companions fight a wide variety of demons, as well as ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and ethically unsound humans. They sometimes even save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, magic, and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. Visions from higher powers guide the group, and are received by Doyle and later Cordelia. Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Angel and later Gunn, though every member of Angel Investigations is combat-ready to some degree. Lorne is able to read peoples&#x27; destinies and intentions. Fred uses her scientific knowledge to contribute, whilst Wesley contributes his extensive knowledge of demonology and supernatural lore.

== Storylines ==
At the start of the series, Angel has just moved to Los Angeles. He is soon visited by Doyle, a messenger sent to him on behalf of The Powers That Be, enigmatic and ancient forces that assist the side of good. Doyle receives visions that can guide Angel on his mission as a champion of humankind. Angel also encounters Cordelia Chase, who is trying to launch an acting career. The three group together to form Angel Investigations, a detective agency that hopes to &quot;help the hopeless&quot; (later on &quot;help the helpless&quot;). When Doyle dies in the episode &quot;Hero&quot;, he passes on his &quot;visions&quot; to Cordelia with a kiss. Shortly thereafter, the ex-Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, joins the group. Meanwhile, the evil law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart pay increasing attention to Angel. They tempt him toward darkness when they resurrect Darla, Angel&#x27;s ex-lover and sire—killed by Angel in the first season of &quot;Buffy&quot; in the episode &quot;Angel&quot;.

Charles Gunn, who was introduced toward the end of season 1 in the episode &quot;War Zone&quot;, is a street-tough leader of a gang of vampire hunters. He is initially determined to kill Angel but slowly comes to accept him and join his cause throughout season 2. Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s star lawyer Lindsey McDonald primes Darla as its weapon to bring down Angel. However, Darla is brought back as a human, not a vampire. But as a human, she suffers from a terminal case of syphilis—which she had contracted in her original life before being sired. Lindsey brings in Drusilla, a vampire originally sired by Angelus, to restore Darla to the cause of evil. Enraged by this, Angel begins to grow darker. He cuts himself off from his staff (secretly to keep them away from this kind of dark territory for their own sake) and attempts to go after the pair himself. In despair, Angel sleeps with Darla (cf. &quot;Reprise&quot;) but the next morning, he has an epiphany; seeing the error of his ways, he banishes Darla and reunites with his group. When Cordelia vanishes, Lorne, the flamboyant demon owner of karaoke bar Caritas, reluctantly takes Angel and his crew to his home dimension, Pylea, to rescue her. They return with Winifred &quot;Fred&quot; Burkle, a former physics student who has been trapped in the dimension for five long years.

To get over news of the death of his ex-girlfriend, Buffy, Angel spends three months in a monastery, where he encounters some demon monks and goes home frustrated in season 3. He returns to Los Angeles, as does Darla—now bearing his child. Daniel Holtz, an old enemy of both Angel and Darla, is resurrected by a demon to take revenge on the vampires that killed his family. The group is puzzled over what might be the first vampire birth. Darla sacrifices her life to save the life of her child, Connor. The gang is eager to care for the infant, but Wesley soon learns of a (false) frightening prophecy that suggests that Angel will murder his son. Feeling disconnected from the group, Wesley does not share this information and quietly kidnaps Connor. This backfires as he is attacked and the child is seized by Holtz and his protégée Justine. Wanting Angel to suffer the loss of a child as he did, Holtz escapes through a rip in the fabric of space to the dimension of Quor&#x27;Toth, and raises the boy as his own. Angel feels that his son is lost forever and tries to murder Wesley. Though he survives, Wesley is banished from the group. Weeks later, Connor returns, but because time moves faster in Quor&#x27;Toth, he is now a teenage boy, having been raised by Holtz. Tricking Angel into believing he needs to be the one to take Connor in, Holtz gives Angel a letter letting Connor know that he will be leaving and to trust Angel. Holtz gets Justine to kill him but ends up making it look like a vampire attack so Connor will assume the worst. Connor imprisons his birth father, Angel, in a casket and drops it to the bottom of the ocean. Cordelia&#x27;s visions have been progressively getting worse, and she becomes part demon to make them easier on herself. Her old lover, the Groosalugg, comes back from Pylea to be with her but leaves her when he discovers that she instead loves Angel. Cordelia, having been approached by a seeming agent of the Powers That Be with an offer to become a Higher Being, ascends to a higher dimensional plane at season&#x27;s end.

Despite his exile from his old friends, Wesley locates and frees Angel at the beginning of season four. A hellish Beast emerges and blocks out the sun over L.A. He then proceeds to kill the staff at Wolfram &amp; Hart. Although the city survives, the sunlight seems to have been vanquished permanently. The team resorts to releasing Angel&#x27;s soul, believing Angelus knows helpful information about the beast. Although the team takes safety precautions, Angelus is released from his cell by Cordelia, who is, at the time, under the influence of the soon to be born Jasmine. Luckily, they manage to restore Angel&#x27;s soul, thanks to help from Faith and Willow. Their efforts, however, do not prevent the coming of Jasmine, who was indirectly responsible for the work of the Beast. Jasmine, it turns out, was formerly one of the Powers That Be and plans to solve all the world&#x27;s problems by giving humanity total happiness through spiritual enslavement to her. She arrives in our world through manipulation of Cordelia and Connor, using them as a conduit into our world, eventually forcing Cordelia to fall into a coma. Fred is accidentally inoculated against Jasmine&#x27;s spell by contact with her blood and frees the rest of the gang though they remain hopelessly outnumbered by thousands already entranced by Jasmine. Angel travels through a magic portal into a world previously visited by Jasmine to find a way of breaking her power over L.A.&#x27;s populace. By revealing her true name, they are able to break Jasmine&#x27;s spell over everyone. Jasmine confronts Angel but is then killed by Connor. Connor is revealed never to have been under Jasmine&#x27;s influence, but he went along for the sake of having a semblance of family and happiness. In the season finale, they are met by Lilah Morgan, the resurrected Head of Wolfram &amp; Hart&#x27;s Special Project Division, who congratulates them on preventing world peace, and says that as a token of their appreciation, Wolfram &amp; Hart would like to give them the Los Angeles branch. To help save Cordelia and Connor, who has gone mad with confusion over losing everything, Angel reluctantly agrees.

In season 5, the gang begins to settle into their new lives at Wolfram &amp; Hart. Gunn undergoes a special cognitive procedure that transforms him into a brilliant lawyer. The group receives an amulet that resurrects a past companion of Angelus, the en-souled vampire Spike, initially as a ghost-like presence but later regains corporeal status due to the machinations of Lindsey McDonald in a surprise return. Cordelia, who has been in a coma, has &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; grant her one last request, in which she helps Angel get &quot;back on track,&quot; then dies. Angel is briefly reunited with his son Connor, now in a new identity thanks to the agreement between Angel and Wolfram &amp; Hart at the end of Season Four. Connor regains the memories of his former identity but does not acknowledge this to protect his new parents (though he later reveals to Angel that he does, in fact, remember his previous life). Fred finally declares her affections to Wesley, but shortly after is possessed by an ancient and powerful demon called Illyria. Wesley is devastated by the loss of Fred but agrees to help Illyria adjust to her new form and the unfamiliar world she is in. Angel, after getting one last vision from Cordelia before her death, infiltrates the Circle of the Black Thorn, a secret society responsible for engineering the Apocalypse, and plans to take them all out in a simultaneous, hard-hitting strike. Because this is probably a suicide mission, he tells each of his friends to spend the day as if it were their last. That night, the team launches its attack on the Circle, dividing up their targets. When Wesley is fatally stabbed, Illyria, concerned for his safety, arrives at his side after killing her targets but is unable to save him. Illyria asks Wesley if he&#x27;d like her to assume the form of Fred, and Wesley agrees, allowing him to say goodbye to the woman he loved. Lorne leaves and disappears into the night, his innocence destroyed after fulfilling Angel&#x27;s last order to kill Lindsey, the former Wolfram &amp; Hart lawyer who had turned his back on the firm. Angel confronts Senior Partners&#x27; new liaison Marcus Hamilton and defeats him with help from Connor.

Once the Circle has been dismantled, Angel and the surviving members of his gang in the alley behind the Hyperion Hotel. Illyria arrives with news of Wesley&#x27;s death and feels the need to retaliate in her anger and grief. Spike also arrives, triumphant about his successful mission and hungry for further violent fighting. Gunn emerges, staggering from a serious stomach wound, but ready to fight. The survivors wait as the Senior Partners&#x27; army of warriors, giants, and a dragon approaches. Angel, Spike, Gunn and Illyria prepare for the upcoming battle, with Angel saying, &quot;Well, personally, I kind of want to slay the dragon.&quot; The series then ends with Angel saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to work,&quot; after which he and his team attack the army of monsters head-on.

==Production==

===Episodes===

===Origins===
Co-producer Greenwalt points out, &quot;There&#x27;s no denying that &quot;Angel&quot; grew out of &quot;Buffy&quot;.&quot; Several years before &quot;Angel&quot; debuted, Joss Whedon developed the concept behind &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; to invert the Hollywood formula of &quot;the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.&quot; The character Angel was first seen in the first episode and became a regular, appearing in the opening credits during seasons 2 and 3. According to the fictional universe first established by &quot;Buffy&quot;, the &#x27;Buffyverse&#x27;, Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually set out on a path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that &quot;Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero.&quot; Whedon has compared the series to its parent: &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit more straightforward action show and a little bit more of a guys&#x27; show.&quot;

While the central concept behind &quot;Buffy&quot; was &quot;high school as a horror movie&quot; in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make &quot;Angel&quot; into a different &quot;gritty, urban show.&quot; Whedon explained, &quot;We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It&#x27;s set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It&#x27;s those two things that creatively make the shows different.&quot;

Whedon and Greenwalt prepared a six-minute promotional video pitch, often called the &quot;Unaired &quot;Angel&quot; pilot&quot; for The WB. Some shots from this short were later used in the opening credits.

Early during the life of the series, some effort was made to slightly soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, &quot;City of&quot;, in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, &quot;Corrupt&quot;, was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explained, &quot;The network was shocked. They said &#x27;We can&#x27;t shoot this. This is way too dark.&#x27; We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days.&quot; Instead, the tone was lightened and the opening episodes established Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation.

A first draft script reveals that &quot;Angel&quot; was originally intended to include the character Whistler, played by Max Perlich, who had already been featured in two &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, &quot;Becoming, Part One&quot; and &quot;Part Two&quot;. In an interview, Perlich said, &quot;I never got called again. If they had called, I would have probably accepted because it was a great experience and I think Joss is very original and talented.&quot; Instead, the producers created a Whistler-like character, Doyle. Cordelia Chase, also from the original Sunnydale crew, joined Angel and Doyle.

===Executive producers===
Joss Whedon is credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series. Alongside &quot;Angel&quot;, he was also working on a series of other projects such as &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Fray&quot;, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;, which would later also lead to the film &quot;Serenity&quot;.

For the first three seasons, David Greenwalt, who co-created the series with Whedon, was also credited as executive producer; during this time, he also took on the role of show runner. He left to oversee &quot;Miracles&quot;, but continued to work on &quot;Angel&quot; as a consulting producer for the final two seasons. Tim Minear also served as an executive producer during the second season, contributing heavily to the season&#x27;s story arc. At the start of the fourth season, David Simkins was made showrunner and executive producer, but after three months, he left the show due to &quot;creative differences&quot; and is not credited in any episodes. Established &quot;Angel&quot; writer Jeffrey Bell took over for the balance of season 4 and became executive producer for season 5. After &quot;Buffy&quot; concluded, writer David Fury joined the staff as executive producer for the final season.

Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, Kaz Kuzui, were also credited as executive producers throughout &quot;Angel&quot;, but were not involved in any writing or production for the show. Jeffrey Bell mentions in his DVD commentary during the closing credits of the &quot;Angel&quot; series finale &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; that two people were credited and paid for &quot;Angel&quot; without needing to ever step on the set. &quot;Angel&quot; crew member Dan Kerns also revealed in an essay that two executive producers &quot;received credit and sizeable checks for the duration of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; for doing absolutely nothing&quot;. Their credit, rights and royalties for the whole &quot;Buffy&quot; franchise, which includes spinoff &quot;Angel&quot;, relate to their funding, producing and directing of the original movie version of &quot;Buffy&quot;.

===Writing===
Script-writing was done by Mutant Enemy, a production company created by Joss Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits for the series include: Joss Whedon, David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, Jeffrey Bell, David Fury, Steven S. DeKnight, Mere Smith, and Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain. Other authors with writing credits include: Shawn Ryan, Ben Edlund, Drew Goddard, Jeannine Renshaw, Howard Gordon, Jim Kouf, Jane Espenson, Doug Petrie, Tracey Stern, David H. Goodman, Scott Murphy, Marti Noxon and Brent Fletcher.

Jane Espenson has explained how scripts came together for Mutant Enemy Productions series &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;: a meeting was held and an idea was floated (generally by Whedon) and the writers brainstormed to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the staff met in the anteroom to Whedon&#x27;s office to begin &quot;breaking&quot; the story into acts and scenes; the only one absent would be the writer working on the previous week&#x27;s episode.

Next, the writers developed the scenes onto a marker-filled whiteboard, featuring a &quot;brief ordered description of each scene.&quot; A writer was then selected to create an outline of the episode&#x27;s concept– occasionally with some dialogue and jokes– in one day. The outline was then given to the show runner, who revised it within a day. The writer used the revised outline to write the first draft of the script while the other writers worked on developing the next. This first draft was usually submitted for revision within 3–14 days; afterward, a second (and sometimes third) draft was written. After all revisions were made, the final draft would be produced as the &quot;shooting draft&quot;.

===Music===

&quot;Angel&quot; features a mix of original, indie, rock and pop music.

The opening theme was composed by Holly Knight and Darling Violetta, an alternative rock group that performed two songs during the third season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Holly Knight was the music producer of the track. The next year, &quot;Angel&quot; invited bands to submit demos for the theme music to the show. They asked bands to use &quot;dark superhero ideas&quot; and &quot;Cello-rock&quot;. Darling Violetta watched pivotal Angel-related episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot; such as &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Becoming, Parts One and Two&quot; for inspiration. Eventually, Whedon accepted Darling Violetta&#x27;s interpretation of an &quot;Angel&quot; theme as that most suitable to the show. The theme has a slower tempo than the &quot;Buffy&quot; theme, as well as heavier use of acoustic instruments such as cello. In 2005, the band composed an extended version of the &quot;Angel&quot; theme called &quot;The Sanctuary Extended Remix&quot;, which featured on the soundtrack of the series &quot;&quot;.

The demon karaoke bar, Caritas, is frequently used to spotlight pop hits. There has also been a soundtrack album, &quot;Angel: Live Fast, Die Never&quot;. The soundtrack mostly consists of scores created for the show by Robert J. Kral along with a remixed theme and four other songs from the show. Douglas Romayne scored 33 episodes of &quot;Angel&quot; in seasons 4 and 5, along with series lead composer, Rob Kral.

===Cancellation===
On February 14, 2004, the WB Network announced that &quot;Angel&quot; would not be brought back for a sixth season. The one-paragraph statement indicated that the news, which had been reported by an Internet site the previous day, had been leaked well before the network intended to make its announcement. Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site, The Bronze: Beta, in which he expressed his dismay and surprise, saying he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; and described the situation as &quot;Healthy Guy Falls Dead From Heart Attack.&quot; Fan reaction was to organize letter-writing campaigns, online petitions, blood and food drives, advertisements in trade magazines and via mobile billboards, and attempts to lobby other networks. UPN was a favorite target, as it had already picked up &quot;Buffy&quot;, but the network declined. Outrage for the cancellation focused on Jordan Levin, WB&#x27;s Head of Entertainment. It was the second highest-rated program to be canceled on the WB.

Head writer David Fury &quot;guaranteed&quot; that if Joss Whedon had not requested an early renewal, &quot;Angel&quot; would have been back for a Season 6, saying Whedon&#x27;s request for an early pick-up decision put Levin in a corner, forcing him to cancel the show, adding simply waiting would have gotten the show renewed. Marsters made a similar statement, saying cancellation took the cast and production staff &quot;completely by surprise&quot;. He said in 2021 that Spike&#x27;s addition to the show prevented cancellation after four seasons, although his request for a salary equal to what he was paid on &quot;Buffy&quot; caused Whedon to remove Carpenter from the main cast.

&quot;Angel&quot;&#x27;s final episode, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, aired on the WB on May 19, 2004. The ambiguous final moments left some fans hoping for the continuation of &quot;Angel&quot; and the Buffyverse in the future - hopes that came to fruition in November 2007 with the publication of the first issue of the comic book series &quot;&quot;. The series is Joss Whedon&#x27;s official continuation of the &quot;Angel&quot; television series and follows in the footsteps of the comic book &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, whose first issue was published in March 2007.

==Themes==
While &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was built around the angst of adolescence, &quot;Angel&quot; chronicles the different stages of adulthood after one leaves home and begins working. Cordelia Chase, who had been the most popular and superficial girl in Sunnydale High on &quot;Buffy&quot;, develops over the course of the series from an insecure young woman struggling in a daunting real world into an unexpectedly mature woman. Similarly, Wesley, the once uptight and bookish Watcher, becomes a man of quiet confidence and often ruthless action.

In much the same way as &quot;Buffy&quot; had been both an homage and parody of traditional horror films, &quot;Angel&quot; gave the same treatment to the classical film noir. Producer Kelly Manners said &quot;&quot;Angel&quot; is a dark show about a man looking for redemption... We have an alcoholic metaphor with &quot;Angel&quot;. Angel is a guy who is one drink away from going back to his evil roots&quot; He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives. The first episode even included a Philip Marlowe-style voiceover. Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters. In this case, the &quot;underworld&quot; is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings. In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe. Many traditional &quot;noir&quot; stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops. These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.

The style and focus of the show changed considerably over its run, and starting late in season two the original noir idea was mostly discarded in favor of more large-scale supernatural-themed conflicts. In later seasons, the mythology and stories became increasingly complex; in Season Four, one of the characters on the show itself described the storyline as &quot;a turgid supernatural soap opera.&quot; Whereas the show initially dealt with the difficulty of being kind to people on a personal basis, the show ultimately focused on Angel&#x27;s status as an archetypal Champion for humanity, and explored ideas such as moral ambiguity, the spiritual cost of violence, and the nature of free will. The enduring theme throughout the series was the struggle for redemption.

&quot;Angel&quot; explored trust motifs as an increasingly central focus of the show. In the first two seasons, there were sprinklings of deceit and treachery, but in the last three seasons duplicity began to pervade the thematic structure, culminating in Season Five when almost every episode included some kind of double-cross, trickery, or illusion. An idea presented in Season Three was that even prophecy can betray, as they are often deceiving if not plain lies. In Season Five, it is repeatedly emphasized that the characters can trust no one in their new situation. The series is also notable for harsh betrayals within the cast of main characters; such events often having lethal consequences.

&quot;Angel&quot; depicted the feelings of loneliness, danger, and callousness often attributed to the urban Los Angeles megalopolis. The divisions between the ordered world of the day and the chaotic world of the night have been trademark themes of &quot;noir&quot; and by depicting a protagonist who literally has no daytime life, the series was able to explore these same themes in more dramatic, metaphorical ways. As the series progressed, the creators were able to explore darker aspects of the characters, particularly Angel, who commits a number of morally questionable actions, and periodically reverts to his evil persona Angelus.

==Home media==
The series was released to DVD, produced by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, from 2001 to 2005.

In 2009, the DVDs were repackaged into slimmer cases, which resemble regular DVD packaging.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
An article in &quot;The Independent&quot; stated, &quot;The LA-set spin-off to &quot;Buffy&quot; was initially dismissed as the original&#x27;s poor cousin but gradually developed into a darkly entertaining show in its own right.&quot;

===U.S. ratings===
In two of the four seasons when both shows were in production, &quot;Buffy&quot;″s overall yearly ratings were higher than &quot;Angel&quot;″s.

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;Angel&quot; gathered a number of awards. the International Horror Guild Award for Best Television in 2001. It received many awards and nominations from the Saturn Awards which are presented annually by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films: it won Best Network TV Series in 2004 and David Boreanaz won Best TV Actor in 2000, 2003, and 2004. Specific episodes, &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;, &quot;Smile Time&quot;, and &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005.

==Spin-offs==
&quot;Angel&quot;, itself a spinoff from &quot;Buffy&quot;, has in turn inspired a whole &quot;industry&quot; of books, comics, and merchandise.

===Expanded universe===

Outside of the TV series, &quot;Angel&quot; has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called &quot;Buffyverse Expanded Universe&quot;. The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe and sometimes contradicted such continuity.

Many of these works are set at particular times within the Buffyverse. For example, Joss Whedon has written an &quot;Angel&quot; mini-series of comics, &quot;Long Night&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which was specifically set in early &quot;Angel&quot; Season Two. &quot;Angel&quot; comics were originally published by Dark Horse Comics, which published them from 2000 until 2002. IDW Publishing obtained rights to publish &quot;Angel&quot; comics in 2005 and has been releasing them since. Spinning off from the &quot;Angel&quot; comics comes an entire series of &quot;Spike&quot; comics, using the &quot;Angel&quot; logo&#x27;s typeface in its depiction of the name &quot;Spike&quot;, among these are the comics &quot;Spike vs. Dracula&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. As of November 2007 to February 2009, the story of the series was continued canonically in lieu of a Season Six in a 17-issue maxi-series titled &quot;&quot;, written by Brian Lynch and plotted by both Lynch and Joss Whedon. This spun off into numerous &quot;Angel&quot; titles set after the television series, of which all are now considered canon, until 2011 when &quot;Angel&quot; rights revert to Dark Horse Comics who began to publish &quot;Angel&quot; comics under the banner of &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot;.

Following their success with a series of &quot;Buffy&quot; novels, Pocket Books purchased the license to produce novels for &quot;Angel&quot;. Twenty-four &quot;Angel&quot; novels were published. Jeff Mariotte became the most successful &quot;Angel&quot; novelist, publishing eleven &quot;Angel&quot; novels. They also published seven &quot;Buffy&quot;/&quot;Angel&quot; crossover books that featured settings and characters from both series.

===Undeveloped spin-offs===

In March 2006, Joss Whedon still talked of the possibility of a TV movie involving Spike to be written and directed by Tim Minear.

===Merchandise===
&quot;Angel&quot; has inspired magazines and companion books, as well as countless websites, online discussion forums, and works of fan fiction. Eden Studios have published an &quot;Angel&quot; role-playing game.

<text>Band Aid is a charity supergroup featuring mainly British and Irish musicians and recording artists. It was founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for anti-famine efforts in Ethiopia by releasing the song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; for the Christmas market that year. On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, and was released in the UK on Monday 3 December. The single surpassed the hopes of the producers to become the Christmas number one on that release. Three re-recordings of the song to raise further money for charity also topped the charts, first the Band Aid II version in 1989, the Band Aid 20 version in 2004 and finally the Band Aid 30 version in 2014. Band Aid II and Band Aid 20 were also Christmas number one. The original was produced by Ure. The 12&quot; version was mixed by Trevor Horn.

==Background and discography==
The supergroup was formed by Bob Geldof, who was then lead singer of the Irish band the Boomtown Rats. The BBC played a major role in capturing the poverty affecting Ethiopian citizens and thereby influenced Geldof to take action. Paula Yates, Geldof&#x27;s partner, is considered to have been the brains behind the original Band Aid. She was the driving force that inspired (and helped) Geldof to rally the most famous pop stars of the 1980s to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.

The group was composed of forty artists to raise awareness and funds for the Ethiopian famine in 1983–1985. The group&#x27;s name stemmed from the idea that the musicians were providing aid to the less fortunate and suggested that their project was likened to putting a Band-Aid on a wound. Geldof was looking for support from all nations for Africa beginning in the United Kingdom. To do so, the artists recorded a hit single titled &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; depicting the poverty-stricken African scenery of the time.

==Original Band Aid==

===Chronology (1984)===
Geldof was so moved by the plight of starving children in Ethiopia that he decided to try to raise money using his contacts in pop music. Geldof enlisted the help of Midge Ure, from the group Ultravox, to produce a charity record. Ure took Geldof&#x27;s lyrics, and created the melody and backing track for the record. Geldof called many of the most popular British and Irish performers of the time, persuading them to donate their time. His one criterion for selection was how famous they were, to maximise sales of the record. He then kept an appointment to appear on a show on BBC Radio 1, with Richard Skinner, but instead of promoting the new Boomtown Rats material as planned, he announced the plan for Band Aid.

The recording studio waived their £85-per-hour fee and gave (the as yet unnamed) Band Aid 24 free hours to record and mix the record, on 25 November 1984. The recording took place at SARM Studios in Notting Hill, owned by Trevor Horn&#x27;s ZTT Records, between 11 am and 7 pm. It was filmed by director Nigel Dick to be released as the pop video, though some basic tracks had been recorded the day before at Midge Ure&#x27;s home studio. The first tracks to be recorded were the group/choir choruses which were filmed by the international press. The footage was rushed to newsrooms where it aired while the recording process continued. Later, drums by Phil Collins were recorded. The introduction of the song features a slowed-down drum sample from the Tears for Fears track &quot;The Hurting&quot; (which had been released in 1983). Tony Hadley, of Spandau Ballet, was the first to record his vocal, while a section sung by Status Quo was deemed unusable, and replaced with a section comprising Paul Weller, Sting, and Glenn Gregory from Heaven 17. Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran sang between contributions from George Michael and Sting. Paul Young has since admitted, in a documentary, that he knew his opening lines were written for David Bowie, who was not able to make the recording but made a contribution to the B-side (Bowie performed his lines at the Live Aid concert the following year). Boy George arrived last, at 6 pm, after Geldof woke him up by phone telling Boy George that he wanted him on the song. George&#x27;s group, Culture Club, were touring the US and George caught a Concorde jet from New York City to London, at his own expense, to record his solo part.

The following morning, Geldof appeared on the Radio 1 breakfast show with Mike Read, to promote the record further and promise that every penny would go to the cause. This led to a stand-off with the British government, who refused to waive the VAT on the sales of the single. Geldof made headlines publicly standing up to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government in 1985 agreed to make a donation to charities working in Ethiopia and Chad equivalent to the VAT (Value Added Tax) collected on sales of the original 1984 Band Aid record.

The record was released on 7 December 1984 and went straight to No. 1 in the UK singles chart, outselling all the other records in the chart put together. It became the fastest-selling single of all time in the UK, selling a million copies in the first week alone. It stayed at No. 1 for five weeks, selling over three million copies and becoming easily the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK, beating the seven-year record held by &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;. It has since been surpassed by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; (his tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales). At the 1986 Grammy Awards the original music video from &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; won Band Aid a Grammy Award nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form.

After Live Aid, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was re-released in late 1985 in a set that included a special-edition &#x27;picture disc&#x27; version, modeled after the Live Aid logo with &#x27;Band&#x27; in place of &#x27;Live&#x27;. An added bonus, &quot;One Year On&quot; (a statement from Geldof and Ure on the telephone) was available as a B-side. A transcript of &quot;One Year On&quot; can be found in a booklet which was included in the DVD set of Live Aid, the first disc of which features the BBC news report, as well as the Band Aid video.

Live Aid inspired a number of charity events, such as Media Aid, which raised money for Save the Children.

===Effectiveness===

The hit single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; was highly successful worldwide. It sold over two million copies around the globe and raised more than US$24 million. The super group&#x27;s success was seen as a large increase in celebrity diplomacy and inspired similar actions of support from countries such as Canada, France, Spain and the United States. The success influenced two organisations of live benefit concerts run by celebrity charity. The concerts were USA for Africa and Live Aid and were broadcast in over 160 countries. Band Aid and Live Aid combined raised about US$150 million for the famine relief effort in Ethiopia.

==Band Aid II==
This version, released in 1989, was produced by a British songwriting and production team formed by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman known as Stock Aitken Waterman. The only artists from the original Band Aid to be featured again on this version were Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward of Bananarama. This version topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.

===Production===
On Friday 1 December 1989, Bob Geldof called Pete Waterman to ask if he would consider producing a new version of the song featuring the big stars from that time. Waterman immediately postponed his wedding and began calling up the artists. With just two days&#x27; notice, on Sunday 3 December, recording took place at PWL Studios in South London. Present in the studio was Bob Geldof, wife Paula Yates and six-year-old daughter Fifi Trixiebelle, who was eager to meet Jason Donovan.

Production continued through the Monday, and by Tuesday 5 December the song was broadcast for the first time on London&#x27;s Capital Radio. Advance sales of the record reached 500,000. The song was released the following week on 11 December and spent three weeks at number one, becoming the ninth biggest-selling song of the year.

==Band Aid 30==

Band Aid 30 was the 2014 incarnation of the charity supergroup Band Aid. Announced by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the aim was to aid 2014 Ebola outbreak victims in Western Africa and preventing its spread. As in previous incarnations, the group covered the track &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, written in 1984 by Geldof and Ure. The song was recorded by some of the biggest-selling current British and Irish pop acts, including One Direction, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Emeli Sandé, Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, and Bastille, along with Chris Martin (Coldplay) and Bono (U2)—the third time he contributed to a Band Aid recording.

Their version of the song debuted at the chart&#x27;s summit during the week of its release, then dropped down a place in each of the following two weeks before dropping out of the Top 10 in its fourth week. It also received a polarised reception from many music critics due to its new lyric directed towards Africa.

Also, for the first time, a German version was produced and reached the top position of the German single charts at the beginning of December 2014. The project is led by Geldof&#x27;s close friend Campino, lead vocalist of the punk rock band Die Toten Hosen. A French version of the song is led by Carla Bruni.

==Band Aid 40==
For the 40th anniversary in 2024, a new mix of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; has been released. This mixes recordings from the original version with the Band Aid 20 and Band Aid 30 versions. It has been mixed by Trevor Horn.

Ed Sheeran claimed his permission had not been sought to re-use his vocals from the 2014 version, and that had he had the choice he would not have consented to it.

==Related projects and Band Aid Liverpool==
The Band Aid project inspired other charity records around the world, including &quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa in the United States, &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; by Northern Lights in Canada, Hear &#x27;n Aid a supergroup of 40 heavy metal musicians with a track called &quot;Stars&quot;, and many others.

A compilation of video games for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum was published under the name Soft Aid. Each platform had its own selection of games from ten different publishers; Elite Systems, Ocean Software, Quicksilva, and Virgin were represented on both. The cassette also featured a recording of the &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; single.

===Band Aid Liverpool===
In December 2020, a group of musicians from Liverpool recorded a version of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; as a charity record in support of Shelter. Retitled &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas (Feed the World)&quot; with lyrics referring to places on Merseyside, the project was given the go-ahead by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to release their cover version on 10 December 2020. Band Aid Liverpool features about 70 musicians/personalities from Liverpool, including Asa Murphy from BBC Radio Merseyside, five-piece band the Hummingbirds and project originator Tony Cook, from tribute band the Mersey Beatles.

==Criticism==

===Claims of self-righteousness===
In 1986, the anarchist band Chumbawamba released the album &quot;Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records&quot;, as well as an EP entitled &quot;We Are the World?&quot;, jointly recorded with US band A State of Mind, both of which were intended as anti-capitalist critiques of the Band Aid/Live Aid phenomenon. They argued that the record was primarily a cosmetic spectacle, designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of world hunger.

In a 1985 &quot;Time Out&quot; interview, Morrissey (who was not invited to participate in Band Aid) gave his views about the song:
&#x27;I&#x27;m not afraid to say that I think Band Aid was diabolical. Or to say that I think Bob Geldof is a nauseating character. Many people find that very unsettling, but I&#x27;ll say it as loud as anyone wants me to. In the first instance the record itself was absolutely tuneless. One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it&#x27;s another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of Great Britain. It was an awful record considering the mass of talent involved. And it wasn&#x27;t done shyly. It was the most self-righteous platform ever in the history of popular music.&#x27;

<text>John Silas Reed (October 22, 1887 – October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and communist activist. Reed first gained prominence as a war correspondent during the Mexican Revolution for &quot;Metropolitan&quot; and World War I for &quot;The Masses&quot;. He is best known for his coverage of the October Revolution in Petrograd, Russia, which he wrote about in his 1919 book &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;.

Reed supported the Soviet takeover of Russia, even briefly taking up arms to join the Red Guards in 1918. He hoped for a similar communist revolution in the United States, and co-founded the short-lived Communist Labor Party of America in 1919. He died in Moscow of spotted typhus in 1920. 

==Early life and education==
Reed was born on October 22, 1887, in his maternal grandparents&#x27; mansion in what is now the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. His grandmother&#x27;s household had Chinese servants. Reed wrote of paying a nickel to a &quot;Goose Hollowite&quot; (young toughs in a gang in the working-class neighborhood below King&#x27;s Hill) to keep from being beaten up. In 2001 a memorial bench dedicated to Reed was installed in Washington Park, which overlooks the site of Reed&#x27;s birthplace (the mansion no longer exists).

His mother, Margaret Reed (née Green), was the daughter of Portland industrialist Henry Dodge Green, who had made a fortune founding and operating three businesses: the first gas &amp; light company, the first pig iron smelter on the West Coast, and the Portland water works (he was its second owner). SW Green Avenue was named in his honor.

John&#x27;s father, Charles Jerome Reed, was born in the East and came to Portland as the representative of an agricultural machinery manufacturer. With his ready wit, he quickly won acceptance in Portland&#x27;s business community. The couple had married in 1886, and the family&#x27;s wealth came from the Green side, not the Reed side.

A sickly child, young Jack grew up surrounded by nurses and servants. His mother carefully selected his upper-class playmates. He had a brother, Harry, who was two years younger. Jack and his brother were sent to the recently established Portland Academy, a private school. Jack was bright enough to pass his courses but could not be bothered to work for top marks, as he found school dry and tedious. In September 1904, he was sent to Morristown, a New Jersey prep school, to prepare for college. His father, who did not attend college, wanted his sons to go to Harvard. At Morristown Jack continued his poor classroom performance, but made the football team and showed some literary promise.

Reed failed his first attempt at Harvard College&#x27;s admission exam but passed on his second try, and enrolled in the fall of 1906. Tall, handsome, and lighthearted, he threw himself into all manner of student activities. He was a member of the cheerleading team, the swimming team, and the dramatic club, served on the editorial boards of the &quot;Lampoon&quot; and &quot;The Harvard Monthly&quot;, and was president of the Harvard Glee Club. In 1910 he held a position in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and also wrote music and lyrics for their show &quot;Diana&#x27;s Debut&quot;. Reed failed to make the football and crew teams, but excelled in swimming and water polo. He was also made &quot;Ivy orator and poet&quot; in his senior year.

Reed attended meetings of the Socialist Club, over which his friend Walter Lippmann presided, but never joined. The group introduced legislation into the state legislature, attacked the university for failing to pay its servants living wages, and petitioned the administration to establish a course on socialism. Reed later recalled:

All this made no ostensible difference in the look of Harvard society, and probably the club-men and the athletes, who represented us to the world, never even heard of it. But it made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities, and turned our attention to the writings of men like H. G. Wells and Graham Wallas, wrenching us away from the Oscar Wildian dilettantism which had possessed undergraduate litterateurs for generations.

Reed graduated from Harvard College in 1910. That summer he set out to see more of the &quot;dull outside world&quot;, visiting England, France, and Spain before returning home to America the following spring. To pay his fare to Europe, Reed worked as a common laborer on a cattle boat. His travels were encouraged by his favorite professor, Charles Townsend Copeland (&quot;Copey&quot;), who told him he must &quot;see life&quot; if he wanted to successfully write about it.

==Career==

===Journalist===
Reed had determined to become a journalist and set out to make his mark in New York. Reed made use of a valuable contact from Harvard, Lincoln Steffens, who was establishing a reputation as a muckraker. Steffens quickly appreciated Reed&#x27;s skills and intellect and landed his young admirer an entry-level position on &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, where Reed read manuscripts, corrected proofs, and helped with the composition. Reed supplemented his salary by taking an additional job as the business manager of a new short-lived quarterly magazine, &quot;Landscape Architecture.&quot;

Reed made his home in Greenwich Village, a burgeoning hub of poets, writers, activists, and artists. He came to love New York, relentlessly exploring it and writing poems about it. His formal jobs on the magazines paid the rent, but it was as a freelance journalist that Reed sought to establish himself. He collected rejection slips, circulating an essay and short stories about his six months in Europe, eventually breaking through in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Within a year, Reed had other work accepted by &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Forum&quot;, and &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;. One of his poems was set to music by composer Arthur Foote, another by Marion Bauer. The editors at &quot;The American&quot; came to see him as a contributor and began to publish his work.

Reed&#x27;s serious interest in social problems was first aroused about this time by Steffens and Ida Tarbell. He moved beyond them to a more radical political position than theirs. In 1913, he joined the staff of &quot;The Masses&quot;, edited by Max Eastman. Reed contributed more than 50 articles, reviews, and shorter pieces to this socialist publication.

The first of Reed&#x27;s many arrests came in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913, for attempting to speak on behalf of strikers in the New Jersey silk mills. The harsh treatment meted out by the authorities to the strikers and the short jail term he served further radicalized Reed. He allied with the general socialist union, the Industrial Workers of the World. His account of his experiences was published in June as an article, &quot;War in Paterson&quot;. During the same year, following a suggestion made by IWW leader Bill Haywood, Reed put on &quot;The Pageant of the Paterson Strike&quot; in Madison Square Garden as a benefit for the strikers.

In the autumn of 1913, Reed was sent to Mexico by the &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot; to report on the Mexican Revolution. He shared the perils of Pancho Villa&#x27;s army for four months and was with Villa&#x27;s Constitutional (Constitutionalist) Army (whose &quot;Primer Jefe&quot; political chief was Venustiano Carranza) when it defeated Federal forces at Torreón, opening the way for its advance on Mexico City. Reed adored Villa, but Carranza left him cold.

Reed&#x27;s reporting on the Villistas in a series of outstanding magazine articles gained him a national reputation as a war correspondent. Reed deeply sympathized with the peons and vehemently opposed American intervention. Reed&#x27;s reports were collected and published as the book &quot;Insurgent Mexico&quot; (1914).

On April 30, 1914, Reed arrived in Colorado, scene of the recent Ludlow massacre, which was part of the Colorado Coalfield War between the John D. Rockefeller Jr.-owned Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company and United Mine Workers union supporters. There he spent a little more than a week, during which he investigated the events, spoke on behalf of the miners, and wrote an impassioned article on the subject (&quot;The Colorado War&quot;, published in July). He came to believe much more deeply in class conflict.

Reed spent summer 1914 in Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mabel Dodge and her son, putting together &quot;Insurgent Mexico&quot; and interviewing President Wilson on the subject. The resulting report, much watered down at White House insistence, was not a success.

===War correspondent===
On August 14, 1914, shortly after Germany declared war on France, Reed set sail for neutral Italy, on assignment for the &quot;Metropolitan&quot;. He met his lover Mabel Dodge in Naples, and the pair made their way to Paris. Reed believed the war was the result of imperialist commercial rivalries and felt little sympathy for any of the parties.

In an unsigned piece titled &quot;The Traders&#x27; War&quot;, published in the September 1914 issue of &quot;The Masses&quot;, Reed wrote:

In France, Reed was frustrated by wartime censorship and the difficulty of reaching the front. Reed and Dodge went to London, and Dodge soon left for New York, to Reed&#x27;s relief. The rest of 1914 he spent drinking with French prostitutes and pursuing an affair with a German woman. The pair went to Berlin in early December. While there, Reed interviewed Karl Liebknecht, one of the few socialists in Germany to vote against war credits. Reed was deeply disappointed by the general collapse in working-class solidarity promised by the Second International, and by its replacement with militarism and nationalism.

He returned to New York in December and wrote more about the war. In 1915, he traveled to Central Europe, accompanied by Boardman Robinson, a Canadian artist and frequent &quot;Masses&quot; contributor. Traveling from Thessaloniki, they saw scenes of profound devastation in Serbia (including a bombed-out Belgrade), also going through Bulgaria and Romania. They passed through the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Bessarabia. In Chełm, they were arrested and incarcerated for several weeks. At risk of being shot for espionage, they were saved by the American ambassador.

Traveling to Russia, Reed was outraged to learn that the American ambassador in Petrograd was inclined to believe they were spies. Reed and Robinson were rearrested when they tried to slip into Romania. This time the British ambassador (Robinson being a British subject) finally secured permission for them to leave, but not until after all their papers were seized in Kiev. In Bucharest, the duo spent time piecing together more of their journey. At one point Reed traveled to Constantinople in hopes of seeing action at Gallipoli. From these experiences he wrote the book, &quot;The War in Eastern Europe&quot;, published in April 1916.

After returning to New York, Reed visited his mother in Portland. There he met and fell in love with Louise Bryant, who joined him on the East Coast in January 1916. Though happily involved, both also had affairs with others in accordance with their bohemian circle and ideas about sexual liberation. Early in 1916, Reed met the young playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill. Beginning that May, the three rented a cottage in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a summer destination on Cape Cod for many artists and writers from Greenwich Village. Not long after, Bryant and O&#x27;Neill began a romance.

That summer Reed covered the presidential nominating conventions. He endorsed Woodrow Wilson, believing that he would make good on his promise to keep America out of the war. In November 1916 he married Bryant in Peekskill, New York. The same year, he underwent an operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove a kidney. He was hospitalized until mid-December. The operation rendered him ineligible for conscription and saved him from registering as a conscientious objector, as had been his intention. During 1916 he privately published &quot;Tamburlaine and Other Verses&quot;, in an edition of 500 copies.

As the country raced towards war, Reed was marginalized: his relationship with the &quot;Metropolitan&quot; was over. He pawned his late father&#x27;s watch and sold his Cape Cod cottage to the birth control activist and sex educator Margaret Sanger.

When Wilson asked for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, Reed shouted at a hastily convened meeting of the People&#x27;s Council in Washington: &quot;This is not my war, and I will not support it. This is not my war, and I will have nothing to do with it.&quot; In July and August Reed continued to write vehement articles against the war for &quot;The Masses&quot;, which the United States Post Office Department refused to mail, and for &quot;Seven Arts&quot;. Due to antiwar articles by Reed and Randolph Bourne, the arts magazine lost its financial backing and ceased publication. Reed was stunned by the nation&#x27;s pro-war fervor, and his career lay in ruins.

===Witness to the Russian Revolution===
On August 17, 1917, Reed and Bryant set sail from New York to Europe, having first provided the State Department with legally sworn assurances that neither would represent the Socialist Party at a forthcoming conference in Stockholm. The pair were going as working journalists to report on the sensational developments taking place in the fledgling republic of Russia. Traveling by way of Finland, the pair arrived in the capital city of Petrograd immediately after the failed military coup of monarchist General Lavr Kornilov. This was an attempt to topple the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky by force of arms. Reed and Bryant found the Russian economy in shambles. Several of the subject nations of the old empire, such as Finland and Ukraine, had gained autonomy and were seeking separate military accommodations with Germany.

Reed and Bryant were in Petrograd for the October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin, toppled the Kerensky government; the Bolsheviks believed this was the first blow of a worldwide socialist revolution.

Food shortages made the situation dire in the capital, and social disorder reigned. Reed later recalled:

The last month of the Kerensky regime was marked first by the falling off of the bread supply from 2 pounds a day to 1 pound, to half a pound, to a quarter of a pound, and, the final week, no bread at all. Holdups and crime increased to such an extent that you could hardly walk down the streets. The papers were full of it. Not only had the government broken down, but the municipal government had absolutely broken down. The city militia was quite disorganized and up in the air, and the street-cleaning apparatus and all that sort of thing had broken down—milk and everything of that sort.

A mood for radical change was in the air. The Bolsheviks, seeking an all-socialist government and immediate end to Russian participation in the war, sought the transfer of power from Kerensky to a Congress of Soviets, a gathering of elected workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; deputies to be convened in October. The Kerensky government considered this a kind of coup, and moved to shut down the Bolshevik press. It issued warrants of arrest for the Soviet leaders and prepared to transfer the troops of the Petrograd garrison, believed to be unreliable, back to the front. A Military Revolutionary Committee of the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik Party, determined to seize power on behalf of the future Congress of Soviets. At 11 pm on the evening of November 7, 1917, it captured the Winter Palace, the seat of Kerensky&#x27;s government. Reed and Bryant were present during the fall of the Winter Palace, the symbolic event that started the Bolshevik Revolution.

Reed was an enthusiastic supporter of the new revolutionary socialist government. He went to work for the new People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, translating decrees and news of the new government into English. &quot;I also collaborated in the gathering of material and data and distributing of papers to go into the German trenches,&quot; Reed later recalled.

Reed was close to the inner circle of the new government. He met Leon Trotsky and was introduced to Lenin during a break of the Constituent Assembly on January 18, 1918. By December, his funds were nearly exhausted, and he took a job with American Raymond Robins of the International Red Cross. Robins wanted to set up a newspaper promoting American interests; Reed complied. But in the dummy issue he prepared, he included a warning beneath the masthead: &quot;This paper is devoted to promoting the interests of American capital.&quot;

The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly left Reed unmoved. Two days later, armed with a rifle, he joined a patrol of Red Guards prepared to defend the Foreign Office from counter-revolutionary attack. Reed attended the opening of the Third Congress of Soviets, where he gave a short speech promising to bring the news of the revolution to America, saying he hoped it would &quot;call forth an answer from America&#x27;s oppressed and exploited masses.&quot; American journalist Edgar Sisson told Reed that he was being used by the Bolsheviks for their propaganda, a rebuke he accepted.

In January, Trotsky, responding to Reed&#x27;s concern about the safety of his substantial archive, offered Reed the post of Soviet Consul in New York. As the United States did not recognize the Bolshevik government, Reed&#x27;s credentials would almost certainly have been rejected and he would have faced prison (which would have given the Bolsheviks some propaganda material). Most Americans in Petrograd considered Reed&#x27;s appointment a massive blunder. Businessman Alexander Gumberg met with Lenin, showing him a prospectus in which Reed called for massive American capital support for Russia and for setting up a newspaper to express the American viewpoint on the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. Lenin found the proposal unsavory and withdrew Reed&#x27;s nomination. Learning of Gumberg&#x27;s intervention, Reed always denigrated him afterward.

Reed and Bryant wrote and published books about their Russian experiences. Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Six Red Months in Russia&quot; appeared first, but Reed&#x27;s &quot;10 Days That Shook the World&quot; (1919) garnered more notice.

Bryant returned to the United States in January 1918, but Reed did not reach New York City until April 28. On his way back, Reed traveled from Russia to Finland; he did not have a visa or passport while crossing to Finland. In Turku harbor, when Reed was boarding a ship on his way to Stockholm, Finnish police arrested him; he was held at Kakola prison in Turku until he was released. From Finland, Reed traveled to Kristiania, Norway via Stockholm.

Because he remained under indictment in the &quot;Masses&quot; case, federal authorities immediately met Reed when his ship reached New York, holding him on board for more than eight hours while they searched his belongings. Reed&#x27;s papers, the material from which he intended to write his book, were seized. He was released upon his own recognizance after his attorney, Morris Hillquit, promised to make him available at the Federal Building the next day. His papers were not returned to him until November.

===Radical political activist===
Back in America, Reed and Bryant defended the Bolsheviks and opposed the American intervention. Incensed at Russia&#x27;s departure from the war against Germany, the public gave Reed a generally cold reception. While he was in Russia, his articles in &quot;The Masses&quot;, particularly one headlined &quot;Knit a straight-jacket for your soldier boy&quot;, had been instrumental in the government gaining an indictment for sedition against the magazine (antiwar agitation was considered sedition and treason).

The first &quot;Masses&quot; trial ended in a hung jury the day before Reed reached New York. The defendants, including him, were to be retried. He immediately posted $2,000 bail on April 29. The second &quot;Masses&quot; trial also ended in a hung jury.

In Philadelphia, Reed stood outside a closed hall on May 31, and harangued a crowd of 1,000 about the case and the war until police dragged him away. He was arrested for inciting a riot, and posted $5,000 bail. Reed became more aggressively political, intolerant, and self-destructive. On September 14, he was arrested for the third time since returning from Russia, charged with violating the Sedition Act and freed on $5,000 bail. This was a day after possibly the largest demonstration for Bolshevik Russia was held in the United States (in the Bronx). Reed had passionately defended the revolution, which he seemed to think was coming to America as well. He tried to prevent Allied intervention in Russia, arguing that the Russians were contributing to the war effort by checking German ambitions in Ukraine and Japanese designs on Siberia, but this argument came to naught.

On February 21–22, 1919, Bryant was fiercely grilled before a Senate committee exploring Bolshevik propaganda activities in the US, but emerged resilient. Reed followed her. According to Homberger, his testimony was &quot;savagely distorted&quot; by the press. Later that day Reed went to Philadelphia to stand trial for his May speech; despite a hostile judge, press, and patriotic speech by the prosecutor, Reed&#x27;s lawyer, David Wallerstein, convinced the jury the case was about free speech, and he was acquitted. Returning to New York, Reed continued speaking widely and participating in the various twists of socialist politics that year. He served as editor of &quot;The New York Communist&quot;, the weekly newspaper issued by the Left Wing Section of Greater New York.

Affiliated with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, Reed with the other radicals was expelled from the National Socialist Convention in Chicago on August 30, 1919. The radicals split into two bitterly hostile groups, forming the Communist Labor Party of America (Reed&#x27;s group, which he helped create) and, the next day, the Communist Party of America. Reed was the international delegate of the former, wrote its manifesto and platform, edited its paper, &quot;The Voice of Labor&quot;, and was denounced as &quot;Jack the Liar&quot; in the Communist Party organ, &quot;The Communist&quot;. Reed&#x27;s writings of 1919 displayed doubts about Western-style democracy and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. He believed this was a necessary step that would prefigure the true democracy &quot;based upon equality and the liberty of the individual.&quot;

===Comintern functionary===
Indicted for sedition and hoping to secure Communist International (Comintern) backing for the CLP, Reed fled the US with a forged passport in early October 1919 on a Scandinavian frigate; he worked his way to Bergen, Norway as a stoker. Given shore leave, he disappeared to Kristiania, crossed into Sweden on October 22, passed through Finland with Ivar Lassy&#x27;s help, and made his way to Moscow by train. In the cold winter of 1919–1920, he traveled in the region around Moscow, observing factories, communes, and villages. He filled notebooks with his writing and had an affair with a Russian woman.

Reed&#x27;s feelings about the revolution became ambivalent. Activist Emma Goldman had recently arrived aboard the &quot;Buford&quot;, among hundreds of aliens deported by the United States under the Sedition Act. She was especially concerned about the Cheka. Reed told her that the enemies of the revolution deserved their fate, but suggested that she see Angelica Balabanoff, a critic of the current situation. He wanted Goldman to hear the other side.

Though facing the threat of arrest in Illinois, Reed tried to return to the United States in February 1920. At that time, the Soviets organized a convention to establish a United Communist Party of America. Reed attempted to leave Russia through Latvia, but his train never arrived, forcing him to hitch a ride in the boxcar of an eastbound military train to Petrograd. In March, he crossed into Helsinki, where he had radical friends, including Hella Wuolijoki, the future politician and member of parliament. With their help, he was hidden in the hold of a freighter.

On 13 March, Finnish Customs officials found Reed in a coal bunker on the ship. He was taken to the police station, where he maintained that he was seaman &quot;Jim Gormley&quot;. Eventually, the jewels, photographs, letters, and fake documents he had in his possession forced him to reveal his true identity. Although beaten several times and threatened with torture, he refused to surrender the names of his local contacts. Because of his silence, he could not be tried for treason. He was charged and convicted of smuggling and having jewels in his possession (102 small diamonds worth $14,000, which were confiscated).

The US Secretary of State was satisfied with Reed&#x27;s arrest and pressured the Finnish authorities for his papers. American authorities, however, remained indifferent to Reed&#x27;s fate. Although Reed paid the fine for smuggling, he was still detained. His physical condition and state of mind deteriorated rapidly. He suffered from depression and insomnia, wrote alarming letters to Bryant, and on May 18 threatened a hunger strike. He was finally released in early June, and sailed for Tallinn, Estonia, on the 5th. Two days later, he traveled to Petrograd, recuperating from malnutrition and scurvy caused by having been fed dried fish almost exclusively. His spirits were high.

At the end of June, Reed traveled to Moscow. After he discussed with Bryant the possibility of her joining him, she gained passage on a Swedish tramp steamer and arrived in Gothenburg on August 10. At the same time, Reed attended the Second Comintern Congress. Although his mood was as jovial and boisterous as ever, his physical appearance had deteriorated.

During this congress, Reed bitterly objected to the deference other revolutionaries showed to the Russians. The latter believed the tide of revolutionary fervor was ebbing, and that the Communist Party needed to work within the existing institutions—a policy Reed felt would be disastrous. He was contemptuous of the bullying tactics displayed during the congress by Karl Radek and Grigory Zinoviev, who ordered Reed to attend the Congress of the Peoples of the East to be held at Baku on August 15.

The journey to Baku was a long one, five days by train through a countryside that was devastated by civil war and typhus. Reed was reluctant to go. He asked for permission to travel later, as he wanted to meet Bryant in Petrograd after she arrived from Murmansk. Zinoviev insisted that Reed take the official train: &quot;the Comintern has made a decision. Obey.&quot; Reed, needing Soviet goodwill and unprepared for a final break with the Comintern, made the trip with reluctance. Years after having abandoned communism himself, his friend Benjamin Gitlow asserted that Reed became bitterly disillusioned with the communist movement because of his treatment by Zinoviev.

During his time in Baku, Reed received a telegram announcing Bryant&#x27;s arrival in Moscow. He followed her there, arriving on September 15, and was able to tell her of the events of the preceding eight months. He appeared older and his clothes were in tatters. While in Moscow, he took Bryant to meet Lenin, Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks, and also to visit Moscow&#x27;s ballet and art galleries.

==Death==

Reed was determined to return to the United States but fell ill on September 25. At first thought to have influenza, he was hospitalized five days later and diagnosed with spotted typhus. Bryant spent all her time with him, but there were no medicines to be obtained because of the Allied blockade. Reed&#x27;s mind started to wander; eventually he lost the use of the right side of his body and could no longer speak. His wife was holding his hand when he died in Moscow on October 17, 1920. After a hero&#x27;s funeral, Reed&#x27;s body was buried in Mass Grave No. 5 at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis next to Inessa Armand. Only three Americans have received this honor; the others are C. E. Ruthenberg, the founder of the Communist Party USA; and Bill Haywood, a founding member and leader of the Industrial Workers of the World.

==Legacy==
Reed&#x27;s interpretation in popular culture has varied. Some, such as biographer Robert A. Rosenstone, have called him a romantic, while Upton Sinclair derided him as a &quot;playboy of the revolution&quot;. For the communist movement to which he belonged, Reed became a symbol of the international nature of the October Revolution, a martyr buried at the Kremlin wall amid solemn fanfare, his name to be uttered reverently as a member of the radical pantheon.

===Representation in other media===
* Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s influential 1927 silent film &quot;&quot; was based on Reed&#x27;s book.
* John Dos Passos included a highly stylized, brief biography of Reed in his 1932 novel/history work &quot;1919,&quot; the second part of his U.S.A. trilogy.
* The 1958 Soviet film &quot;In October Days&quot; (), directed by Sergei Vasilyev, depicted Reed and Bryant.
* Actor and director Warren Beatty made the film &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), based on Reed&#x27;s life. Beatty starred as Reed, Diane Keaton as Louise Bryant and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O&#x27;Neill. The movie won three Academy Awards and was nominated for nine others.
* Two films are based on Reed&#x27;s accounts of the Mexican Revolution, one with two parts released a year apart. Mexican director Paul Leduc made &quot;&quot; (1973). A Mexican–Soviet-Italian co-production released &quot;Red Bells&quot; (1982) and &quot;Red Bells II&quot; (1983), both directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, with Franco Nero as Reed.

<doc id="143441" wikidata="Q81802" url="?curid=143441" title="Province of Almería">
<text>Almería (, ; ) is a province of the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. It was named after the Arab ruler of Taifa, Banu Al-Miri. It is bordered by the provinces of Granada, Murcia, and the Mediterranean Sea. Its capital is the homonymous city of Almería.

Almería has an area of . With 701,688 (2014) inhabitants, its population density is 79.96/km2, slightly lower than the Spanish average. It is divided into 103 municipalities.

==Geography==

The highest mountain range in the Province of Almería is the long Sierra de Los Filabres, a subrange of the Sierra Nevada.

Europe&#x27;s driest area is found in Almería and is part of the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park. The arid landscape and climate of the province have made it an ideal setting for Western films, especially during the 1960s. Because of the demand for these locations, quite a number of Western towns were built near the Tabernas Desert. Films such as &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, and &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot; were shot here. Years later, the film of &quot;800 Bullets&quot; was filmed in the same place. Large sections of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Patton&quot; were shot there as well.

The main rivers are the Andarax River and Almanzora River, which are located near Granada in the Alpujarras. The Benínar Reservoir, located near Darrical, provides part of the water needed in the production in greenhouses.

==Fauna==
Almería has very diverse and rich fauna. Animals found in Cabo de Gata and Níjar include the red fox, the Algerian hedgehog and reptiles such as the ocellated lizard, &quot;Timon nevadensis&quot;, and the ladder snake. Birds characteristic of the Sierra de María-los Vélez include the crested lark, the calandria, and the common pipit, as well as birds of prey like Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. Snakes and butterflies are common. The Parnassius butterfly stands out due to its endemic status. In the Sierra Nevada and the Sierra de los Filabres there are also many birds of prey and protected mammals such as the mountain goat, the European wildcat and the wild boar.

==Economy==
Historically, Almería was an important exporter of minerals (especially iron, lead, and fine marble) and grapes. The most important economic activity is now greenhouse farming. Millions of tons of vegetables are exported to other European countries and other parts of the world each year. 

Tourism is also a key sector of the economy, due to the sunny weather and attractive areas such as Roquetas de Mar, Aguadulce, El Ejido, Mojacar, Vera or Cabo de Gata.

=== Industry ===
The principal industrial activity is in the Macael (Comarca del Marmol) &quot;canteras&quot; marble quarrying area in the Sierra de los Filabres region from Macael Viejo to Chercos, Lijar and Cobdar which produce in excess of 1.3 million tons. The Cantoria, Fines, Olula del Rio and Purchena area of the Alto Almanzora valley is fast becoming the regional megalopolis through high imports and exports and employment in local, national and international marble processing. All the tourist accommodations and construction throughout coastal Spain has driven high demand and brought huge modernisation. Small &quot;pueblos&quot; of agriculturalists have given rise to computerised machining factories.

=== Research facilities ===

The German-Spanish Calar Alto Observatory is one of the most important observatories of Spain.
In Tabernas there is a solar energy research centre, 
the &quot;Plataforma Solar de Almería&quot; (PSA).

France&#x27;s Michelin operates an industrial research centre in Cabo de Gata.

== Issues ==
===Fruit pickers===
An estimated 7,000-10,000 immigrant fruit pickers live in toxic conditions in shanty towns next to fruit farms in the region, and are exploited by employers who pay them less than minimum wage and offer no PPE as mandated by law.

==History==

=== Prehistoric ===
The Paleolithic Age of Almería was characterized by small nomadic and hunter-gatherer groups. The oldest Paleolithic site is Zájara Cave I (Cueva de Zájara I) in the Caves of the Almanzora (Cuevas del Almanzora).

The first villages and spaces dedicated exclusively to burials appear by the Neolithic Age, and even before the Upper Paleolithic Age. The cave paintings of the Cave of the Signs (Cueva de los Letreros) and twenty other caves and shelters of Los Vélez are dated to this era, and were designated a World Heritage site by Unesco in 1989.

In one of the shelters of the first settlers of the peninsula, the Coat of the Beehives (Abrigo de las Colmenas), there remains a human figure with arms outstretched holding an arc above its head. According to legend, this picture represents a covenant made by prehistoric man with the gods to prevent future floods. It is the earliest depiction of the Almerían Indalo, which was named in memory of Saint Indaletius, and means &quot;Indal Eccius&quot; (&quot;messenger of the gods&quot;) in the Iberian language.

Over the years, the Indalo has become the best known symbol of Almería. Some see this figure as a man holding a rainbow, but it might also be an archer pointing a bow towards the sky. The Indalo lent its name to the artistic and intellectual movement of the Indalianos led by Jesús de Perceval and Eugenio d&#x27;Ors which was a movement of nostalgic attraction by the people of Mojácar. The people of Mojácar painted Indalos with chalk on the walls of their houses to guard against storms and the Evil Eye.

It was Luis Siret y Cels, an eminent Belgian archaeologist, who described the rich prehistoric wealth of Almería, particularly that of the Metal Age. Siret said that Almería was like &quot;an open-air museum&quot;. Indeed, Almería is home to two of the most important cultures of the Metal Age in the peninsula: Los Millares and El Argar.

The earliest known city, Los Millares, dates to the Copper Age and is strategically located on a spur of rock between the Andarax River and the Huéchar Ravine (rambla de Huéchar), in the southern part of the province. It was a town of more than a thousand inhabitants, protected by three lines of walls and towers, and had an economy based on copper metallurgy, agriculture, animal husbandry, and hunting on a moderate scale. Furthermore, they constructed a large necropolis and exported metal figures and pottery to a large part of the peninsula.

The equally influential culture of El Argar appeared later, during the Bronze Age. They developed a characteristic form of pottery, the vaso campaniforme (&quot;beaker&quot;) that spread throughout all of Northern Spain. Their cemeteries were more advanced with respect to the culture of Los Millares and they had diverse agricultural production and animal husbandry.

=== Ancient ===
The rich customs and Fiestas of the denizens retain links deep into the past, unto the Umayyads, the Romans, the Greeks, and the Phoenicians.

=== Middle Ages ===
It became part of the Muslim Empire in 711. During the taifa era, it was ruled by the Arab Muslim Banu al-Amiri tribe from 1012 to 1038, briefly annexed by Valencia (1038–1041), then given by Zaragoza to the Banu Sumadih dynasty until its conquest by the Almoravids in 1091. Some centuries later, it became part of the kingdom of Granada.

==Economy==

=== Tourism ===
The coast of Granada province is known as the Costa Tropical. It attracts large numbers of both Spanish and foreign holiday-makers. The main resorts are Almuñecar, Salobreña and La Herradura. The city of Granada brings in tourists from all over the world thanks to its Moorish architecture, especially the famous Alhambra palace. In the winter the mountains of the Sierra Nevada play host to Europe&#x27;s most southerly ski resort. Hiking and eco-tourism also attract a number of visitors to areas such as the Alpujarras and Lecrin Valley.

=== Major employers ===
Puleva: founded in Granada in 1910, the company has been a subsidiary of the Lactalis group since 2001. It produces a wide range of dairy products, including milk and milkshakes, cream and products for infants. Puleva Biotech S.A. developed the first infant formula to contain nucleotides, and was a pioneer in the use of Omega-3 fatty acids in infant food products.

Each year the city also attracts over 10,000 foreign students, including over 2,000 European students through the Erasmus programme. As well as providing employment to a large number of people, the university also boosts the local economy by creating demand for rental property. The money spent by students also helps to support shops, restaurants, bars and other services in the city. In recent years the university has also been working to capitalise on the research it does through commercial ventures.

=== Other ===
Primary industries such as agriculture and fishing play an important role in the local economy. There was previously also a very large construction sector, but as of 2011 it was experiencing a deep downturn. The Granada Health Science Technological Park has created some high-skilled jobs in the biotechnology sector.

<text>Live Aid was a two-venue benefit concert and music-based fundraising initiative held on Saturday, 13 July 1985. The event was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise further funds for relief of the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia, a movement that started with the release of the successful charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in December 1984. Billed as the &quot;global jukebox&quot;, Live Aid was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.

On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative were held in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, Yugoslavia, Austria, Australia, and West Germany. It was one of the largest satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time. An estimated audience of 1.9 billion people in 150 nations watched the live broadcast, nearly 40 percent of the world population.

The impact of Live Aid on famine relief has been debated for years. One aid relief worker stated that following the publicity generated by the concert, &quot;humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy&quot; for Western governments. Geldof has said, &quot;We took an issue that was nowhere on the political agenda and, through the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the planet – which is not English but rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll – we were able to address the intellectual absurdity and the moral repulsion of people dying of want in a world of surplus.&quot; In another interview he stated that Live Aid &quot;created something permanent and self-sustaining&quot; but also asked why Africa is getting poorer.

The organisers of Live Aid tried to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to NGOs in Ethiopia. It has been alleged that much of this went to the Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam – a regime the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed – and it is also alleged some funds were spent on guns. Although the BBC World Service programme &quot;Assignment&quot; reported in March 2010 that the funds had been diverted, the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit later found &quot;that there was no evidence to support such statements&quot;. Brian Barder, British Ambassador to Ethiopia from 1982 to 1986, wrote on his website &quot;The programme itself, and in particular the BBC’s advance publicity for it, gave the impression that these allegations concerned not only the aid operation in TPLF [rebel]-controlled areas but also the much larger international relief aid operation in the rest of Ethiopia, including in particular money for famine relief raised by Bob Geldof’s Band Aid and Live Aid. This impression is entirely false. Nothing of the sort occurred.&quot;.

== Background ==

The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; which was also the idea of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk&#x27;s BBC News reports on the 1984 famine. The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk&#x27;s report on 23 October describing it as &quot;a biblical famine in the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to hell on Earth&quot;. The reports featured a young nurse, Claire Bertschinger, who, surrounded by 85,000 starving people, told of her sorrow of having to decide which children would be allowed access to the limited food supplies in the feeding station and which were too sick to be saved. She would put a little mark on the children who got chosen, with Geldof stating of her at the time, &quot;In her was vested the power of life and death. She had become God-like and that is unbearable for anyone.&quot; Traumatised by what she experienced she did not speak about it for two decades, recalling in 2005, &quot;I felt like a Nazi sending people to the death camps. Why was I in this situation? Why was it possible in this time of plenty that some have food and some do not? It is not right.&quot;
Shocked by the report, the British public inundated relief agencies, such as Save the Children, with donations, with the report also bringing the world&#x27;s attention to the crisis in Ethiopia. Such was the magnitude of Buerk&#x27;s report it was also broadcast in its entirety on a major US news channel—almost unheard of at the time. From his home in London Geldof also saw the report and called Ure from Ultravox (Geldof and Ure had previously worked together for charity when they appeared at the 1981 benefit show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; in London) and together they quickly co-wrote the song, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in the hope of raising money for famine relief. Geldof then contacted colleagues in the music industry and persuaded them to record the single under the title &#x27;Band Aid&#x27; for free. On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, and was released four days later. It stayed at number one for five weeks in the UK, was Christmas number one, and became the fastest-selling single ever in Britain and raised £8 million, rather than the £70,000 Geldof and Ure had initially expected. Geldof then set his sights on staging a huge concert to raise further funds.

The idea to stage a charity concert to raise more funds for Ethiopia originally came from Boy George, the lead singer of Culture Club. George and Culture Club drummer Jon Moss had taken part in the recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and in the same month, the band were undertaking a tour of the UK, which culminated in six nights at Wembley Arena. On the final night at Wembley, 22 December 1984, an impromptu gathering of some of the other artists from &quot;Band Aid&quot; joined Culture Club on stage at the end of the concert for an encore of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; George was so overcome by the occasion he told Geldof that they should consider organising a benefit concert. Speaking to the UK music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; at the beginning of January 1985, Geldof revealed his enthusiasm for George&#x27;s idea, saying, &quot;If George is organising it, you can tell him he can call me at any time, and I&#x27;ll do it. It&#x27;s a logical progression from the record, but the point is you don&#x27;t just talk about it, you go ahead and do it!&quot;

It was clear from the interview that Geldof had already had the idea to hold a dual venue concert and how the concerts should be structured:

Live Aid production manager Andy Zweck said, &quot;Bob (Geldof) had to play some tricks to get artists involved. He had to call Elton and say Queen are in and Bowie&#x27;s in, and of course they weren&#x27;t. Then he&#x27;d call Bowie and say Elton and Queen are in. It was a game of bluff.&quot;

== Organisation ==

Among those involved in organising Live Aid were Harvey Goldsmith, who was responsible for the Wembley Stadium concert, and Bill Graham, who put together the American leg. On promoting the event, Goldsmith stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to say no. Bob [Geldof] arrived in my office and basically said, &#x27;We&#x27;re doing this.&#x27; It started from there.&quot;

The concert grew in scope as more acts were added on both sides of the Atlantic. Tony Verna, one of the inventors of instant replay, was able to secure John F. Kennedy Stadium through his friendship with Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode and was able to procure, through his connections with ABC&#x27;s prime time chief, John Hamlin, a three-hour prime time slot on the ABC Network and, in addition, was able to supplement the lengthy programme through meetings that resulted in the addition of an ad-hoc network within the US, which covered 85 per cent of TVs there. Verna designed the needed satellite schematic and became the executive director as well as the co-executive producer along with Hal Uplinger. Uplinger, the co-inventor of instant replay, came up with the idea to produce a four-hour video edit of Live Aid to distribute to those countries without the necessary satellite equipment to rebroadcast the live feed.

== Collaborative effort ==
The concert began at noon British Summer Time (BST) (7:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) at Wembley Stadium in the United Kingdom. It continued at John F. Kennedy Stadium (JFK) in the United States, starting at 13:51 BST (8:51 EDT). The UK&#x27;s Wembley performances ended at 22:00 BST (17:00 EDT). The JFK performances and the whole concert in the US ended at 04:05 BST on 14 July (23:05 EDT). Thus, the concert continued for just over 16 hours, but since many artists&#x27; performances were conducted simultaneously in Wembley and JFK, the total concert length was much longer.

Mick Jagger and David Bowie intended to perform a transatlantic duet, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia. Problems of synchronisation meant the only practical solution was to have one artist, likely Bowie at Wembley, mime along to prerecorded vocals broadcast as part of the live sound mix for Jagger&#x27;s performance from Philadelphia. Veteran music engineer David Richards (Pink Floyd and Queen) was brought in to create footage and sound mixes Jagger and Bowie could perform to in their respective venues. The BBC would then have had to ensure those footage and sound mixes were in sync while also performing a live vision mix of the footage from both venues. The combined footage would then have had to be bounced back by satellite to the various broadcasters worldwide. Due to the time lag (the signal would take several seconds to be broadcast twice across the Atlantic Ocean), Richards concluded there was no way for Jagger to hear or see Bowie&#x27;s performance, meaning there could be no interaction between the artists, essentially defeating the whole point of the exercise. On top of this, both artists objected to miming during what was perceived as a historic event. Instead, Jagger and Bowie worked with Richards to create a video of the song they would have performed, a cover of &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, which was shown on the screens of both stadiums and broadcast as part of many TV networks&#x27; coverage.

Each of the two main parts of the concert ended with their particular continental all-star anti-hunger anthems, with Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; closing the UK concert, and USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; closing the US concert (and thus the entire event itself).

Concert organisers have subsequently said they were particularly keen to ensure at least one surviving member of the Beatles, ideally Paul McCartney, took part in the concert as they felt that having an &#x27;elder statesman&#x27; from British music would give it greater legitimacy in the eyes of the political leaders whose opinions the performers were trying to shape. McCartney agreed to perform and has said it was &quot;the management&quot; – his children – who persuaded him to take part. In the event, he was the last performer (aside from the Band Aid finale) to take to the stage and one of the few to be beset by technical difficulties; his microphone failed for the first two minutes of his piano performance of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, making it difficult for television viewers and impossible for those in the stadium to hear him. He later joked by saying he had thought about changing the lyrics to &quot;There will be some feedback, let it be&quot;.

Phil Collins performed at both Wembley Stadium and JFK, travelling from Wembley by helicopter (piloted by UK TV personality Noel Edmonds) to London Heathrow Airport, then took a British Airways Concorde flight to New York City, before taking another helicopter to Philadelphia. As well as his own set at both venues, he also played the drums for Sting in London, then for Eric Clapton, and played with the reuniting surviving members of Led Zeppelin at JFK. On the Concorde flight, Collins encountered actress and singer Cher, who was unaware of the concerts. Upon reaching the US, she attended the Philadelphia concert and can be seen performing as part of the concert&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; finale. In a 1985 interview, singer-songwriter Billy Joel stated that he had considered performing at the event, but ultimately chose not to because he had difficulties getting his band together and did not want to perform by himself.

== Broadcasts ==
Broadcaster Richard Skinner opened the Live Aid concert with the words:

The concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the BBC, whose broadcast was presented by Richard Skinner, Andy Kershaw, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth, Andy Batten-Foster, Steve Blacknell, Paul Gambaccini, Janice Long and Mike Smith and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts. The BBC&#x27;s television sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before NICAM was introduced, but the BBC Radio 1 feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers Only Broadcast two songs from the reunion of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young after 10 pm; the same applied to Rick Springfield and REO Speedwagon. BBC only broadcast one song from the BLACK SABBATH set around 3 am. Ashford &amp; Simpson - Solid was not broadcast on the BBC.

The BBC, however, did supply a &#x27;clean feed&#x27; to various television channels in Europe.

ABC was largely responsible for the US broadcast (although ABC themselves only telecast the final three hours of the concert from Philadelphia, hosted by Dick Clark, with the rest shown in syndication through Orbis Communications, acting on behalf of ABC). An entirely separate and simultaneous US feed was provided for cable viewers by MTV, whose broadcast was presented in stereo and accessible as such for those with stereo televisions. At the time, before multichannel television sound was enacted nationwide, very few televisions reproduced stereo signals, and few television stations were able to broadcast in stereo. While the telecast was run advertisement-free by the BBC, both the MTV and syndicated/ABC broadcasts included advertisements and interviews. As a result, many songs were omitted due to the commercial breaks, as these songs were played during these slots.

The biggest issue of the syndicated/ABC coverage is that the network had wanted to reserve some of the biggest acts that had played earlier in the day for certain points in the entire broadcast, particularly in the final three hours in prime time; thus, Orbis Communications had some sequences replaced by others, especially those portions of the concert that had acts from London and Philadelphia playing simultaneously. For example, while the London/Wembley finale was taking place at 22:00 (10:00 pm) London time, syndicated viewers saw segments that had been recorded earlier so that ABC could show the UK finale during its prime-time portion. In 1995, VH1 and MuchMusic aired a re-edited ten-hour re-broadcast of the concert for its 10th anniversary.

The Live Aid concert in London was also the first time that the BBC outside broadcast sound equipment had been used for an event of such scale. In stark contrast to the mirrored sound systems commonly used by the rock band touring engineers, with two 40–48-channel mixing consoles at the front of house and another pair for monitors, the BBC sound engineers had to use multiple 12-channel desks. Some credit this as the point where the mainstream entertainment industry realised that the rock concert industry had overtaken them in technical expertise.

== Stages and locations ==
=== Wembley Stadium ===

The Coldstream Guards band opened with the &quot;Royal Salute&quot;, a brief version of the national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Status Quo were the first act to appear and started their set with &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot;, also playing &quot;Caroline&quot; and fan favourite &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste My Time&quot;. &quot;Bob told me, &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t matter a fuck what you sound like, just so long as you&#x27;re there,&#x27;&quot; recalled guitarist and singer Francis Rossi. &quot;Thanks for the fucking honesty, Sir Bob.&quot; This would be the band&#x27;s last appearance with bassist and founding member Alan Lancaster and drummer Pete Kircher. Princess Diana and Prince Charles were among those in attendance as the concert commenced.

Bob Geldof performed with the rest of the Boomtown Rats, singing &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot;. He and the band paused just after the line &quot;The lesson today is how to die&quot; to loud applause. According to Gary Kemp, &quot;Dare I say it, it was evangelical, that moment when Geldof stopped &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&#x27; and raised his fist in the air. He was a sort of statesman. A link between punk and the New Romantics and the Eighties. You would follow him. He just has a huge charisma; he&#x27;d make a frightening politician.&quot; He finished the song and left the crowd to sing the final words. Elvis Costello sang a version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, which he introduced by asking the audience to &quot;help [him] sing this old northern English folk song&quot;.

Queen&#x27;s twenty-one-minute performance, which began at 6:41 pm, was voted the greatest live performance in the history of rock in a 2005 industry poll of more than 60 artists, journalists and music industry executives. Freddie Mercury at times led the crowd in unison refrains, and his sustained note—&quot;Aaaaaay-o&quot;—during the a cappella section came to be known as &quot;The Note Heard Round the World&quot;. The band&#x27;s six-song set opened with a shortened version of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and closed with &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. According to the BBC&#x27;s presenter David Hepworth, their performance produced &quot;the greatest display of community singing the old stadium had seen and cemented Queen&#x27;s position as the most-loved British group since the Beatles&quot;. Later in the evening, Mercury and guitarist Brian May performed the first song of the three-part Wembley event finale, &quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot;

Other well-received performances on the day included those by U2 and David Bowie. Both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; have cited Live Aid as the event that made stars of U2. The band played a 12-minute rendition of &quot;Bad&quot;. The length of &quot;Bad&quot; limited them to two songs; a third, &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, had to be dropped. During &quot;Bad&quot;, vocalist Bono jumped off the stage to join the crowd and dance with a teenage girl. In July 2005, the woman said that he had saved her life. She was being crushed by people pushing forward; Bono saw this and gestured frantically at the ushers to help her. They did not understand what he was saying, and so he jumped down to help her himself. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described David Bowie&#x27;s performance as &quot;arguably Bowie&#x27;s last triumph of the 1980s&quot;, observing that &quot;as approximately two billion people sang along to &#x27;Heroes&#x27; [...], he still seemed like one of the biggest and most vital rock stars in the world&quot;. According to &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, Phil Collins also &quot;performed an especially crowd-pleasing selection of songs&quot;, and John Illsley of Dire Straits recalled, &quot;It was a very special feeling to be part of something so unique. Live Aid was a unique privilege for all of us. It&#x27;s become a fabulous memory.&quot;
The broadcast from Wembley suffered technical problems and failed during the Who&#x27;s performance of their opening song &quot;My Generation&quot;, immediately after Roger Daltrey sang &quot;Why don&#x27;t you all fade ...&quot; (the last word &quot;away&quot; was cut off when a blown fuse caused the Wembley stage TV feed to temporarily fail). The broadcast returned as the last verse of &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; was played. John Entwistle&#x27;s bass wouldn&#x27;t work at the start, causing an awkward delay of over a minute before they could start playing. The band played with Kenney Jones on drums, and it was their first performance since disbanding after a 1982 &#x27;farewell&#x27; tour. The Who&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;rough but right&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, but they would not perform together again for another three years. At 32 minutes Elton John had the longest set on the day; his setlist included the first performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; with George Michael.

While performing &quot;Let It Be&quot; near the end of the Wembley show, the microphone mounted to Paul McCartney&#x27;s piano failed for the first two minutes of the song, making it difficult for television viewers and the stadium audience to hear him. During this performance, the TV audience were better off, audio-wise, than the stadium audience, as the TV sound was picked up from other microphones near McCartney. The stadium audience, who could obviously not hear the electronic sound feed from these mics unless they had portable TV sets and radios, drowned out what little sound from McCartney could be heard during this part of his performance. As a result, organiser and performer Bob Geldof, accompanied by earlier performers David Bowie, Alison Moyet and Pete Townshend, returned to the stage to sing with him and back him up (as did the stadium audience despite not being able to hear much), by which time McCartney&#x27;s microphone had been repaired.

At the conclusion of the Wembley performances, Geldof was raised onto the shoulders of the Who&#x27;s guitarist Pete Townshend and Paul McCartney. Geldof stated that he hadn&#x27;t slept &quot;in weeks&quot; in the lead-up to the concert, and when asked what his plans were post-Live Aid, he told an interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m going to go home and sleep.&quot;

The Wembley speaker system was provided by Hill Pro Audio. It consisted primarily of the Hill J-Series Mixing Consoles and Hill M3 Speaker System powered by the Hill 3000 amplifiers. In an interview with Studio Sound in December 1985, Malcolm Hill described the concept for the system in detail.

=== John F. Kennedy Stadium ===
Actor Jack Nicholson hosted the televised portion of the Philadelphia concert. The opening artist Joan Baez announced to the crowd, &quot;This is your Woodstock, and it&#x27;s long overdue&quot;, before leading the crowd in singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

Despite the ambient temperature, Madonna proclaimed &quot;I ain&#x27;t taking shit off today!&quot; during her set, referring to the recent release of early nude photos of her in &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines.

During his opening number, &quot;American Girl&quot;, Tom Petty flipped the middle finger to somebody off stage about one minute into the song. Petty stated the song was a last-minute addition when the band realised that they would be the first act to play the American side of the concert after the London finale and &quot;since this is, after all, JFK Stadium&quot;.

When Bob Dylan broke a guitar string while playing with the Rolling Stones members Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, Wood took off his guitar and gave it to Dylan. Wood was left standing on stage guitarless. After shrugging to the audience, he played air guitar, even mimicking the Who&#x27;s Pete Townshend by swinging his arm in wide circles until a stagehand brought him a replacement. The performance was included in the DVD, including the guitar switch and Wood talking to stagehands, but much of the footage used was close-ups of either Dylan or Richards.

During their duet on the reprise of &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Mick Jagger ripped away part of Tina Turner&#x27;s dress, leaving her to finish the song in what was, effectively, a leotard.

The JFK portion included reunions of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the original Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne, the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson, and surviving members of Led Zeppelin, with Phil Collins and the Power Station (and former Chic) member Tony Thompson sharing duties on drums in place of the band&#x27;s late drummer John Bonham (although they were not officially announced by their group name from the stage but were announced as Led Zeppelin on the VH1 10th Anniversary re-broadcast in 1995).

Teddy Pendergrass made his first public appearance since his near-fatal car accident in 1982, which paralysed him. Pendergrass, along with Ashford &amp; Simpson, performed &quot;Reach Out and Touch&quot;. Bryan Adams (who came on after Judas Priest), recalled &quot;it was bedlam backstage&quot;, before performing a four-song set, including &quot;Summer of &#x27;69&quot;.

Duran Duran performed a four-song set, which was the final time the five original band members publicly performed together until 2003. Their set saw a weak, off-key falsetto note hit by frontman Simon Le Bon during &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. The error was dubbed &quot;The Bum Note Heard Round the World&quot; by various media outlets, in contrast to Freddie Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Note Heard Round the World&quot; at Wembley. Le Bon later recalled it was the most embarrassing moment of his career.

The UK TV feed from Philadelphia was dogged by intermittent buzzing on the sound during Bryan Adams&#x27; turn on stage. This continued less frequently throughout the rest of the UK reception of the American concert, and the audio and video feed failed entirely during that performance and during Simple Minds&#x27; performance.

Phil Collins, who had performed in London earlier in the day, began his solo set with the quip, &quot;I was in England this afternoon. Funny old world, innit?&quot; to cheers from the Philadelphia crowd. Collins played the drums during Eric Clapton&#x27;s 17-minute set, which included well-received performances of &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;White Room&quot;.

== Fundraising ==
Throughout the concerts, viewers were urged to donate money to the Live Aid cause. The BBC operated three hundred phone lines so that members of the public could make donations using their credit cards. The phone number and an address to which viewers could send cheques were repeated every twenty minutes.

Nearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised so far; he was told about £1.2 million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen, which he later called &quot;absolutely amazing&quot;, Geldof gave an interview in which BBC presenter David Hepworth had attempted to provide a postal address to which potential donations could be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted &quot;fuck the address, let&#x27;s get the numbers&quot;. Although the phrase &quot;give us your fucking money&quot; has passed into folklore, Geldof has said that it was never uttered. &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine made great humorous capital out of this outburst, emphasising Geldof&#x27;s Irish accent, which meant the profanities were heard as &quot;fock&quot; or &quot;focking&quot;. After the outburst, donations increased to £300 per second.

Later in the evening, following David Bowie&#x27;s set, a video shot by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was shown to the audiences in London and Philadelphia, as well as on televisions around the world (though neither US feed showed the film), showing starving and diseased Ethiopian children set to &quot;Drive&quot; by the Cars (this would also be shown at the London Live 8 concert in 2005). The rate of donations became faster in the aftermath of the video. Geldof had previously refused to allow the video to be shown due to time constraints and had only relented when Bowie offered to drop the song &quot;Five Years&quot; from his set as a trade-off.

Geldof mentioned during the concert that the Republic of Ireland gave the most donations per capita, despite being in the midst of a serious economic recession. The largest donation came from Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who was part of the ruling family of Dubai, who donated £1m in a phone conversation with Geldof. The next day, news reports stated that between £40 and £50 million had been raised. It is now estimated that around £150 million in total has been raised for famine relief as a direct result of the concerts.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
Bob Dylan&#x27;s performance generated controversy; prior to performing &quot;When the Ship Comes In,&quot; he said: &quot;I hope that some of the money that&#x27;s raised for the people in Africa, maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe one or two million, maybe, and use it, say, to pay the mortgages on some of the farms that the farmers here owe to the banks.&quot; He is often misquoted, as on the Farm Aid website, as saying: &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we did something for our own farmers right here in America?&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Is That It?&quot; (published in 1986), Geldof was critical of the remark, saying, &quot;He displayed a complete lack of understanding of the issues raised by Live Aid. ... Live Aid was about people losing their lives. There is a radical difference between losing your livelihood and losing your life. It did instigate Farm Aid, which was a good thing in itself, but it was a crass, stupid, and nationalistic thing to say.&quot; Although Dylan&#x27;s comments were criticised, his remark inspired fellow musicians Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp to organise the Farm Aid charity, which held its first concert in September 1985. The concert raised over $9 million for America&#x27;s family farmers and became an annual event.

Geldof was not happy about the Hooters being added as the opening band in Philadelphia. He felt pressured into it by Graham and local promoter Larry Magid. Magid, promoting the concert through Electric Factory Concerts, argued that the band was popular in Philadelphia; their first major label album &quot;Nervous Night&quot; had been released almost three months earlier and had been a hit. In an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Geldof asked: &quot;Who the fuck are the Hooters?&quot; However, in a twist of irony in December 2004, Geldof appeared on the bill with the Hooters in Germany as &quot;their&quot; opening act.

Adam Ant subsequently criticised the event and expressed regrets about playing it, saying, &quot;I was asked by Sir Bob [sic] to promote this concert. They had no idea they could sell it out. Then, in Bob&#x27;s book, he said, &#x27;Adam was over the hill, so I let him have one number.&#x27; ... Doing that show was the biggest fucking mistake in the world. Knighthoods were made, Bono got it made, and it was a waste of fucking time. It was the end of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; Geldof stated in his autobiography that Miles Copeland, manager of Adam Ant and Sting, asked Geldof if he had thought of asking Ant after Geldof contacted him to get Sting to appear: &quot;I hadn&#x27;t. I thought he was a bit passé. But then, so were the Boomtown Rats, and each represented a certain piece of pop history, so I agreed. I also thought that might entice him to encourage Sting, or perhaps all three of the Police.&quot;

BBC coverage co-host Andy Kershaw was heavily critical of the event in his autobiography &quot;No Off Switch&quot;, stating, &quot;Musically, Live Aid was to be entirely predictable and boring. As they were wheeled out – or rather bullied by Geldof into playing – it became clear that this was another parade of the same old rock aristocracy in a concert for Africa, organised by someone who, while advertising his concern for and sympathy with, the continent didn&#x27;t see fit to celebrate or dignify the place by including on the Live Aid bill a single African performer.&quot; Kershaw also described the event as &quot;irritating, shallow, sanctimonious and self-satisfied&quot; for failing to confront the fundamental causes of the famine and being &quot;smug in its assumption that a bunch of largely lamentable rock and pop floozies was capable of making a difference, without tackling simultaneously underlying problems&quot;.

In 2024, Geldof rejected the charge that organising the concerts meant that he was a white savior, calling the accusation &quot;the greatest load of bollocks ever&quot;.

=== Led Zeppelin reunion ===
Led Zeppelin performed for the first time since the death of their drummer John Bonham in 1980. Two drummers filled in for Bonham: Phil Collins, who had played on singer Robert Plant&#x27;s first two solo albums, and Tony Thompson. The performance was criticised for Plant&#x27;s hoarse vocals, Jimmy Page&#x27;s intoxication and out-of-tune Gibson Les Paul guitar (his Gibson EDS-1275 guitar was in tune), a lack of rehearsal, and poorly functioning monitors. Plant described the performance as &quot;a fucking atrocity for us ... It made us look like loonies.&quot;

Page later criticised Collins&#x27; performance, saying: &quot;Robert told me Phil Collins wanted to play with us. I told him that was all right if he knows the numbers. But at the end of the day, he didn&#x27;t know anything. We played &#x27;Whole Lotta Love&#x27;, and he was just there bashing away cluelessly and grinning. I thought that was really a joke.&quot; Collins responded: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my fault it was crap... If I could have walked off, I would have. But then we&#x27;d all be talking about why Phil Collins walked off Live Aid – so I just stuck it out... I turned up and I was a square peg in a round hole. Robert was happy to see me, but Jimmy wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

Led Zeppelin has blocked broadcasts of the performance and withheld permission for it to be included on the DVD release. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; named it &quot;one of the worst rock-and-roll reunions of all time&quot;, with Victor Fiorillo writing: &quot;I&#x27;d like to be able to blame all of the awfulness on anaemic Phil Collins, who sat in on drums, and Page himself later fingered the Genesis drummer for screwing up the set. But Collins was just the beginning of the bad. Go ahead. Watch and remember. It really &quot;was&quot; that terrible.&quot;

=== Fund use in Ethiopia ===

In 1986, &quot;Spin&quot; published an exposé on Live Aid&#x27;s actions in Ethiopia. They claimed that Geldof deliberately ignored warnings from Médecins Sans Frontières, who had complained directly to Geldof even before Live Aid, about the role of the Ethiopian government under Derg leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in causing the famine and that by working with Mengistu directly, much of the relief funds intended for victims were in fact siphoned off to purchase arms from the Soviet Union, thereby exacerbating the situation. Geldof responded by deriding both the articles and Médecins Sans Frontières, who had been expelled from the country, and reportedly saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll shake hands with the Devil on my left and on my right to get to the people we are meant to help.&quot;

According to the BBC World Service, a certain proportion of the funds were siphoned off to buy arms for the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front. This coalition battled at the time against Derg. The Band Aid Trust complained to the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit regarding the specific allegations in the BBC World Service documentary, and their complaint was upheld. In 2010 the BBC issued an apology to the Trust and stated there was no evidence money had been diverted, while the former British Ambassador to Ethiopia, Brian Barder, states, &quot;the diversion of aid related only to the tiny proportion that was supplied by some NGOs to rebel-held areas&quot;.

Although a professed admirer of Geldof&#x27;s generosity and concern, American television commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly was critical of Live Aid&#x27;s oversight of the use of the funds raised. O&#x27;Reilly believed that charity organisations operating in aid-receiving countries should control donations rather than &quot;chaotic nations&quot;. Arguing that Live Aid accomplished good ends while inadvertently causing harm at the same time, David Rieff gave a presentation of similar concerns in &quot;The Guardian&quot; at the time of Live 8.

Tim Russert, in an interview on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; shortly after O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s comments, addressed these concerns to Bono. Bono responded that corruption, not disease or famine, was the greatest threat to Africa, agreeing with the belief that foreign relief organisations should decide how the money is spent. On the other hand, Bono said that it was better to spill some funds into nefarious quarters for the sake of those who needed it than to stifle aid because of possible theft.

=== Notable absences ===
Bruce Springsteen decided not to appear at Live Aid despite his huge global popularity in 1985. Geldof had originally scheduled the event for 6 July but moved the date to the 13th, especially to accommodate Springsteen. Springsteen later expressed regret at turning down Geldof&#x27;s invitation, stating that he &quot;simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be&quot; and regretted not performing an acoustic set. During the MTV broadcast, VJ Martha Quinn repeatedly and erroneously claimed that Springsteen would in fact make an appearance.

Michael Jackson declined to appear. His press agent, Norman Winter, released a statement at the time saying that Jackson was &quot;working around the clock in the studio on a project that he&#x27;s made a major commitment to&quot; and consequently could not free up sufficient time to rehearse and perform at Live Aid. Winter added, &quot;Michael is just about living in the studio, rehearsing and recording. I know what could be more major than Live Aid, but Michael couldn&#x27;t turn his back on his responsibility to the people he&#x27;s working with. This affected employment for a lot of people.&quot;

Prince also declined to appear in person but sent a pre-taped video of an acoustic version of &quot;4 the Tears in Your Eyes&quot;, which was played during the concert in Philadelphia. The original version appears on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album, while the video version was released in 1993 on Prince&#x27;s compilation &quot;The Hits/The B-Sides&quot;.

Culture Club leader Boy George decided not to take part in the concert. He feared that Culture Club would fail to measure up performing for two billion people, and he disliked what he viewed as self-important posturing on the part of other participants. In his memoir &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot; he said his band members were angry with him because he had &quot;ruined their chance of a part in history&quot;.

Huey Lewis and the News were scheduled to play the Philadelphia leg and were in some of the promotional material but decided on 28 June to pull out over concerns that the money raised by relief efforts thus far had not been reaching those it was intended to help. &quot;It was a very tough decision&quot;, Lewis told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;We felt, having done the USA for Africa thing, that we should wait and watch that ... The prudent thing to do is to see how that money translates into food for the people before we do another one.&quot; Harry Belafonte, who had organised USA for Africa, responded harshly, calling Lewis&#x27;s scepticism &quot;disruptive and divisive&quot;. He had himself recently returned from a trip to Africa to see how the money had so far been spent, and suggested that Lewis do the same. &quot;For him to sit back here and send out information based on hearsay is unfair to his colleagues and very unfair to the victims.&quot;

Annie Lennox, whose hits as the vocalist of Eurythmics included 1983&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, was forced to pull out of performing at Live Aid due to a serious throat infection; she appeared at Live 8 held in Hyde Park, London in 2005.

Cliff Richard later stated he had been unable to perform as he was already committed to a gospel charity concert in Birmingham the same day.

A reunited Deep Purple were also due to appear from Switzerland via satellite, but pulled out after guitarist Ritchie Blackmore refused to take part. Deep Purple (minus Blackmore, who left the band in 1993) appeared at Geldof&#x27;s Live 8 sequel 20 years later, performing at the Toronto leg of the event. Bill Graham is said to have turned down Foreigner and Yes because there was no free space on the bill for them.

Marillion, riding high in the UK charts that summer with their &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; album and &quot;Kayleigh&quot; single, missed out on an invitation to perform at Wembley because their manager had deemed it not worthwhile for singer Fish to participate in the &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; single. Fish was quoted: &quot;When it came to the bill for the concert, we were passed over.&quot;

UB40 lead singer Ali Campbell admitted that his band was also ignored by Geldof while planning the list of musical acts of the British leg of the event: &quot;We weren&#x27;t asked to do Live Aid because Uncle Bob didn&#x27;t like our music much. It was a great gig, but I thought it was a bit dodgy not having any black acts on the bill when it was raising money for Africa.&quot;

Thin Lizzy keyboard player Darren Wharton expressed regrets about the band not being asked to perform: &quot;That was a tragic, tragic decision. It could&#x27;ve been, and it should&#x27;ve been the turning point for Phil (Lynott). And I think that really did Phil in quite a lot that we were never asked to play. I mean Phil, he had a few problems at the time, but at the end of the day, if he would&#x27;ve been asked to play Live Aid, that would&#x27;ve been a goal for him to clean himself up to do that gig. We were all very upset of the fact that we weren&#x27;t asked to do it because Phil knew Geldof and Midge Ure very well indeed. I was surprised that we weren&#x27;t asked to do that. I don&#x27;t think Phil ever forgave Bob.&quot; Lynott died less than five months after the concert, from complications associated with his drug and alcohol addictions.

&quot;I tried to pitch into Live Aid,&quot; recalled Roger Waters, &quot;They asked me to put Pink Floyd back together for it, and I said no, but I&#x27;d bring my new band to play. They didn&#x27;t want that. But that&#x27;s alright. I went along on my own.&quot; Waters appeared backstage at the Wembley Stadium leg of Live Aid (where he was interviewed), and the classic Pink Floyd lineup reunited for the follow-up to Live Aid, Live 8, in 2005.

Neil Peart, drummer of Canadian rock band Rush, said: &quot;Geddy was involved with the Northern Lights charity record here in Canada, although Rush wasn&#x27;t invited to participate in the Live Aid event—mainly because if you look at the guest list, it was very much an &#x27;in-crowd&#x27; situation. We were &#x27;out&#x27; by then. We didn&#x27;t refuse to take part because of any principles. Mind you, I wouldn&#x27;t have been happy being part of this scenario. Those stars should have shut up and just given over their money if they were genuine. I recall that Tears for Fears, who made a musical and artistic decision to pull out of the concert, were subsequently accused by Geldof of killing children in Africa—what a shockingly irresponsible and stupid attitude to take. But I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about Bob Geldof; he sacrificed his health, his career, [and] everything for something he believed in. But others around him got involved for their own reasons. Some of those involved in &quot;Northern Lights&quot; were actually quoted as saying that their managers told them to get down to the recording sessions because it would be a good career move!&quot;

== International broadcasting ==

== Live Aid recordings ==
When organiser Bob Geldof was persuading artists to take part in the concert, he promised them that it would be a one-off event, never to be seen again. Hence, the concert was never recorded in its complete original form, and only secondary television broadcasts were recorded. Following Geldof&#x27;s request, ABC erased its own broadcast tapes. However, before the syndicated/ABC footage was erased, copies of it were donated to the Smithsonian Institution and have now been presumed lost. The ABC feed of the USA for Africa/&quot;We Are The World&quot; finale does exist in its entirety, complete with the network end credits, and can be found as a supplemental feature on the &quot;We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song&quot; DVD.

Meanwhile, MTV decided to keep recordings of its broadcast and eventually located more than 100 tapes of Live Aid in its archives, but many songs in these tapes were cut short by MTV&#x27;s ad breaks and presenters (according to the BBC). Many performances from the US were not shown on the BBC, and recordings of these performances are missing. There were four separate Audio Trucks in Philadelphia provided by David Hewitt of Remote Recording Services. ABC had taken the decision that no multi track tape recordings would be allowed, so no remixing of the Philadelphia show was possible.

=== Official Live Aid DVD ===
An official four-disc DVD set of the Live Aid concerts was released on 8 November 2004. A premiere to launch the new DVD was held on 7 November and shown in DTS surround sound featuring a short compilation of the four-disc set. The screening was held at the Odeon Cinema in Kensington, London and included guests such as Brian May, Anita Dobson, Roger Taylor, Bob Geldof and partner Jean Marie, Annie Lennox, Midge Ure, Michael Buerk, Gary Kemp and The Darkness. Other theatrical premieres were held in Zürich, Milan, Rome, Vienna, Hamburg and Berlin. A 52-minute compilation was later released as a limited edition DVD in July 2005 titled &quot;20 Years Ago Today: Live Aid&quot;. The box set contains 10-hour partial footage of the 16-hour length concert. The DVD was produced by Geldof&#x27;s company, Woodcharm Ltd., and distributed by Warner Music Vision. The DVD has since been out of print and is no longer available in stores. The decision to finally release it was taken by Bob Geldof nearly 20 years after the original concerts after he found a number of unlicensed copies of the concert on the Internet.

The most complete footage that exists is used from the BBC source, and this was the main source of the DVD. During production of the official DVD, MTV lent Woodcharm Ltd. their B-roll and alternate camera footage where MTV provided extra footage of the Philadelphia concert (where ABC had erased the tapes from the command of Bob Geldof). Songs that were not originally interrupted with advertisements were also used on the official DVD.

Working from the BBC and MTV footage, several degrees of dramatic licence were taken to release the concert on DVD. Many songs had their soundtracks altered for the DVD release, mainly in sequences where there were originally microphone problems. In one of those instances, Paul McCartney had re-recorded his failed vocals for &quot;Let It Be&quot; in a studio the day after the concert (14 July 1985). Beatles biographer Keith Badman explains, &quot;because of what happened, he decided to re-record his vocals for any future film of the concert. That&#x27;s the version you&#x27;ll hear when the DVD comes out.&quot; Also, in the US finale, the original USA for Africa studio track for &quot;We Are the World&quot; was overlaid in places where the microphone was absent (consequently, it includes the vocals of Kenny Rogers and James Ingram, two artists who did not even take part in Live Aid).

Some artists did not want their performances to be featured on the DVD. At their own request, Led Zeppelin and Santana were omitted. The former defended their decision not to be included on the grounds that their performance was &quot;sub-standard&quot;, but to lend their support, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant pledged to donate proceeds from the DVD release of &quot;Page &amp; Plant: No Quarter&quot; to the campaign, and John Paul Jones pledged proceeds from his American tour with Mutual Admiration Society.

Judicious decisions were also made on which acts would be included and which ones would not due to either technical difficulties in the original performances, the absence of original footage, or music rights reasons. Rick Springfield, the Four Tops, the Hooters, the Power Station, Billy Ocean and Kool and the Gang were among those acts that were left off the DVD. Several artists who did feature on the DVD also had songs that were performed omitted. Madonna performed three solo songs in the concert, but only two were included on the DVD (&quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot; was omitted). Phil Collins played &quot;Against All Odds&quot; and &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; at both Wembley and JFK, but only the London performance of the former and the Philadelphia performance of the latter were included on the DVD. The JFK performance of &quot;Against All Odds&quot; was later included in Collins&#x27; &quot;Finally ... The First Farewell Tour&quot; DVD. Tom Petty performed four songs, and only two were included on DVD. Patti LaBelle played six songs, but only two songs were included.

In 2007, Queen released a special edition of &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD formats containing their 1981 concert from The Forum in Montreal, Canada, and their complete Live Aid performance, along with Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing &quot;Is This the World We Created...?&quot; from the UK Live Aid finale, all re-mixed in DTS 5.1 sound by Justin Shirley-Smith. Also included is their Live Aid rehearsal and an interview with the band from earlier in the week.

On its release, the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, decided the VAT collected on sales of the Live Aid DVD would be given back to the charity, which would raise an extra £5 for every DVD sold.

On 14 November 2004, the DVD entered the UK Official Music Video Chart at number one and stayed in the top position for twelve consecutive weeks.

===Official Live Aid audio===
An audio copy of Live Aid was officially released by the Band Aid Trust label on 7 September 2018 on digital download. When first released in 2018, the Queen performance was excluded. The band&#x27;s set was, however, later included as a part of the digital download in May 2019. It has a total of ninety-three audio tracks.

===Live Aid channel===
On 12 September 2018, YouTube launched the Official Live Aid channel with a total of 87 videos from the Live Aid 1985 concert. According to the channel, all earnings from viewings go to the Band Aid Trust. As with the digital download release, a few notable performances are not included for unknown reasons, although Queen&#x27;s set was uploaded to the channel with its inclusion on the digital download.

=== Unofficial recordings ===
Because the Live Aid broadcast was watched by 1.5 billion people, most of the footage was recorded on home consumer video recorders all around the world, in various qualities. Many of these recordings were in mono because, in the mid-1980s, most home video machines could only record mono sound and also because the European BBC TV broadcast was in mono. The US MTV broadcast, the ABC Radio Network and BBC Radio 1 simulcasts were stereo. These recordings circulated among collectors and, in recent years, have also appeared on the Internet in file sharing networks.

Since the official DVD release of Live Aid includes only partial footage of this event, unofficial distribution sources continue to be the only source of the most complete recordings. The official DVD is the only authorised video release in which proceeds go directly to famine relief, the cause that the concert was originally intended to help.

== Legacy ==

Live Aid eventually raised $127 million ($370 million in 2024 terms) in famine relief for African nations, and the publicity it generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa. According to one aid worker, a larger impact than the money raised for the Ethiopian famine is that &quot;humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy&quot; for the west.

Regarding Buerk&#x27;s landmark BBC News report as a watershed moment in crisis reporting that influenced modern coverage—one that was broadcast in its entirety with Buerk&#x27;s narration on a major US channel—Suzanne Franks in &quot;The Guardian&quot; states, &quot;the nexus of politics, media and aid are influenced by the coverage of a famine 30 years ago.&quot;

Many artists and performers at Live Aid gained prominence and positive commercial influence. For all the cultural, charitable, and technological significance of 1985&#x27;s Live Aid, its most immediate impact was on the charts. In the UK, for example, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; by Phil Collins and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; leapt back into the top ten. Queen&#x27;s three-year-old &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; rose fifty-five places into the top twenty, followed by Freddie Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;. Every U2 album available at the time also returned to the chart. In 1986, Geldof received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts. Claire Bertschinger, the nurse who featured in Buerk&#x27;s news reports that sparked the aid relief movement, received the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 for her work in nursing and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for &quot;services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid&quot;.

Queen&#x27;s performance at Live Aid was later recreated in the band&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in 2018. Footage from the original performance can be seen to match very accurately with the movie performance. In 2020, Queen + Adam Lambert reprised the original Queen setlist from Live Aid for the Fire Fight Australia charity concert in Sydney, Australia.

The background to the staging of the concert as a whole was dramatised in the 2010 television drama &quot;When Harvey Met Bob&quot;.

In November 2023, Geldof stated that a six-part miniseries about Live Aid was being produced by Disney as well as an IMAX-format theatrical documentary from Geldof himself.

A jukebox musical based on the day, &quot;Just for One Day&quot; (named after a line in Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Heroes&quot;, which he performed at the event), had its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in February 2024.

In August 2024, opening for Taylor Swift&#x27;s Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium, Hayley Williams, lead vocalist of Paramore, tributed Freddie Mercury&#x27;s Live Aid performance. Wearing an outfit compared to the one Mercury wore, Williams led the audience in unison refrains, similar to Mercury&#x27;s during Queen&#x27;s set, while the other band members took a break.

<text>The Province of Seville () is a province of southern Spain, in the western part of the autonomous community of Andalusia. It borders the provinces of Málaga and Cádiz in the south, Huelva in the west, Badajoz in the north and Córdoba in the east. Seville is the province&#x27;s as well as the Andalusian autonomous community&#x27;s capital.

==Overview==
Located on the southern bank of the Guadalquivir river, the city of Seville is the largest one in Andalusia. The former province of Andalusia was divided by the Moors into four separate kingdoms—Seville, Cordova, Jaen and Granada. Seville has the highest GDP among the provinces of Andalusia . The Provinces of Málaga (€28,506 million) and Cadiz (€22,574 million) are 2nd and 3rd respectively. The Port of Seville is of great economic importance to the province.

The area of the province is 14,042 km2. Its population is 1,914,958 (2010), of whom 40% live in the capital, Seville, and its population density is 125.25/km2. It contains 105 municipalities. The province shares the Parque Nacional de Doñana with Huelva province. It also has the Sierra Norte de Sevilla Natural Park. The 177,484 hectares park is Andalusia&#x27;s largest protected area. The Guadalquivir crosses the province from east to west. Guadiana, Pinta and Xenil are other important rivers. The northern part of the province is mostly mountainous. Seville has a warm Mediterranean climate with an annual average temperature of 18.5 °C. Winters are generally mild while summers are hot. The maximum temperatures in summer often surpass 40 °C. The locality of Écija is popularly known as the &quot;Frying Pan of Andalusia&quot; for its torrid summers. Écija is known for its high value of corn production. The province of Seville generates 1.92% of the Spanish hotel movement. In terms of tourism, the city of Seville is one of the leading cities in Andalusia, situated behind Barcelona and Madrid on a national level. In 208 B.C. the whole population of an outpost in the present town of Estepa burnt their houses and committed suicide before Romans attacked it. The capital city Seville is the world&#x27;s most dense one in terms of Baroque churches. The Socialist Workers Party won the elections in the province from 1982 to 2000. In comparison to other Spanish provinces, Seville is underdeveloped.

<doc id="143451" wikidata="Q81978" url="?curid=143451" title="Province of Cádiz">
<text>Cádiz is a province of southern Spain, in the southwestern part of the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is the southernmost part of mainland Spain, as well as the southernmost part of continental Europe.

It is bordered by the Spanish provinces of Huelva, Seville, and Málaga, as well as the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Its area is .

Its capital is the city of Cádiz, which has a population of 114,244. As of 2021, the largest city is Jerez de la Frontera with 212,801 inhabitants. Algeciras, which surpassed Cádiz with 122,982 inhabitants, is the second most populated city. The entire province had a population of 1,245,960 (as of 2021), of whom about 600,000 live in the Bay of Cádiz area (including Jerez), making it the third most populous province in Andalusia.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Climate==
The entire province of Cádiz has a Mediterranean climate, mostly Köppen &quot;Csa&quot; but also &quot;Csb&quot; in high altitude areas. Large differences in summer temperatures exist between the three official stations in Cádiz, Jerez, and Tarifa depending on position relative to the coastline. Tarifa is exceptionally mild for such a southerly place in Spain, meanwhile winter temperatures are mild throughout the province with less difference between localities than in summer. Average yearly rainfall is in Cádiz, in Jerez, and in Tarifa. This is comparable to much cloudier climates further north in Europe, in spite of the high number of sunshine hours in the province. The Cádiz region is also much wetter than the arid Almería province further east in Andalusia.

==Economy==

In 2014 the unemployment rate was 42%, the highest in the country.
The main industry is tourism, mainly from non-coastal Spanish cities, Germany and the UK. Its once-important shipbuilding industry (Astilleros) is now in crisis due to competition from South Korea and China. There are factories of Airbus and Delphi. It also exports sherry as well as alimentary products.

===Primary sector===
* Sherry production
* John Harvey &amp; Sons in Jerez de la Frontera
* Gonzalez Byass
* Olive groves
* Fishing Ports, as in Cádiz and Algeciras.
* Cork products from the Alcornocales cork-oak forests

===Major industrial facilities===
* Navantia
* Airbus
* CASA
* Delphi
* Ford
* Cepsa
* Lufthansa CityLine
* Endesa
* Acerinox

==Tourism==

===Beaches===
The province of Cádiz has many kilometres of beaches and (as of 2005) the highest number of Blue Flags of all coastal provinces in Europe.

Some of these beaches are relatively wild and far from big urban areas. One of the attractions of the area is its contrast to the mass tourism on the Mediterranean coast. There are extensive nature reserves in the region and the unspoilt feel of the area is heightened by the presence of wild animals including cows and horses on many stretches of beach.

The Costa de la Luz has traditionally been a popular destination for Spaniards wanting to enjoy the beach while avoiding the stifling heat of the Mediterranean Coast, although until recently this largely unspoilt Atlantic coastline was little known to foreign visitors. One of the factors that brought the region to the attention of foreign holidaymakers was the growing realisation that its Southern reaches are one of the world&#x27;s best locations for wind sports.

Tarifa, located on the Strait of Gibraltar at the southernmost point of mainland Europe, has become Europe&#x27;s foremost kitesurfing destination due to the area&#x27;s unique wind phenomena, reliably sunny summer weather and the variety of beaches at locations such as Los Canos de Meca, Bolonia, Punta Paloma and, most famously, Playa de Los Lances where in the summer months you will often see over 1,000 kites in the air. The local economy has benefited significantly from the wind sport explosion: there are more than 50 kite schools in Tarifa and hundreds of shops, bars and hotels serving the many thousands of kitesurfers who visit every year.

Notable beaches:
* Playa La Barrosa in Chiclana de la Frontera
* Playa La Victoria in Cádiz
* Playa de Levante in El Puerto de Santa María
* Playa de Bolonia in Tarifa
* Playa de Camposoto in San Fernando
* Los Canos de Meca
* Playa de Los Lances in Tarifa

===Culture===
* Carnival of Cádiz
* Feria de Jerez
* Semana Santa in all municipalities of the Province
* Horse racing in Sanlúcar de Barrameda
* Circuito Permanente de Jerez
* White Towns of Andalusia
* Ruta del Toro

<text>Huelva () is a province of southern Spain, in the western part of the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is bordered by Portugal, the provinces of Badajoz, Seville, and Cádiz, and the Atlantic Ocean. Its capital is Huelva.

Its area is 10,148 km². Its population is 483,792 (2005), of whom about 30% live in the capital, and its population density is 47.67/km². It contains 79 municipalities.

The economy is based on agriculture and mining. The famous Rio Tinto mines have been worked since before 1000 BC, and were the major source of copper for the Roman Empire. As an indication of the scope of ancient mining, sixteen million tons of Roman slag have been identified at the Roman mines. British companies resumed large-scale mining in 1873; the district is the namesake of the Rio Tinto Group. 

In the 21st century, municipalities such as Moguer, Palos de la Frontera, and Lepe, have witnessed the development of intensive water-demanding strawberry farming, which has elicited attention on the basis of alleged mispractices and abuses regarding the labor conditions of foreign workers and the ecocidal depletion of water resources in Doñana.

The province contains Palos de la Frontera, and Moguer, where Christopher Columbus sailed out of on his first voyage in 1492, and shares the Parque Nacional de Doñana, located mainly in Almonte.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:
== Tourism ==

The delayed tourist development of the province has allowed better city planning than in other regions on the Spanish coast. The nuclei of Islantilla and Isla Canela are an example of this attempt to plan in a more coherent form. Although in a smaller scale in comparison to other regions, urban pressure continues. Previous developments that had little planning until recent time are El Rompido, El Portil, Mazagón and Matalascañas (Torre de la Higuera).

Although Punta Umbría had its beginnings like pedanía de Cartaya, after the democratization of summer tourism, it began its urban development for its proximity to the capital and its location on the beach. Present development would not endure without tourist activity and its vacation housing. Other tourist areas are Nuevo Umbría, Nuevo Portil, Punta del Moral, La Antilla and Urbasur. The marismas de Isla Cristina, next to the towns of Ayamonte and Isla Cristina, are a protected nature reserve. In the mountain town of Almonaster la Real, the Visigothic-mosque church built in the first decades of the 10th century and whose mihrab is one of the oldest in Spain is one important turistic point.

Of note is Huelva&#x27;s recent classification of “rural tourism” for its interior mountain range.

==Green electricity==
Huelva has 388 megawatts (MW) of wind power, 68 MW biomass power, and 66 MW of solar power. A 220 kilovolt transmission line has been constructed to send power to the main grid as well as improving connections between Spain and Portugal.

<doc id="143455" wikidata="Q447631" url="?curid=143455" title="Glenn Quinn">
<text>Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn (28 May 1970 – 3 December 2002) was an Irish actor, best known for his portrayal of Mark Healy on the 1990s family sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; and his role as the half-demon Allen Francis Doyle on &quot;Angel&quot;, a spin-off series of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Early life==
Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn was born in Dublin on 28 May 1970, the son of Bernadette Quinn (née Brady) and Murty Quinn. His father was a musician and singer with the Miami Showband, who had seven No. 1 hits in the 1960s and 1970s. He was raised in the Cabinteely suburb of Dublin, and attended Clonkeen College. In 1988, at the age of 18 he moved to the United States along with his mother and two sisters, Sonya and Louisa, who settled in Los Angeles. He also had a third sibling whom he never met, his brother, Ciaran, who had been put up for adoption as a baby. Quinn never knew of his existence.

==Career==
In 1990, Quinn did television commercials for Pepsi and Ray-Ban, appeared in the music video for the Richard Marx song &quot;Satisfied&quot;, and had his first speaking line in the pilot of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; after having endured eight separate auditions for the roles of Brandon Walsh and Steve Sanders (played by Jason Priestley and Ian Ziering, respectively). Casting director Johanna Ray gave him a small role with two speaking lines in the pilot, however Quinn was barely visible in the final broadcast version.

In 1991, Quinn had his first major film role in the musical film &quot;Shout&quot;, starring John Travolta and Heather Graham, sharing an on-screen kiss with Gwyneth Paltrow in her debut film.

In 1990, Quinn was cast as the recurring character Mark Healy, Becky Conner&#x27;s boyfriend and later husband, in &quot;Roseanne&quot; in its third season and remained a series regular through its ninth and final season in 1997. In 1992, while still on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Quinn also took a main role on the American and British TV series &quot;Covington Cross&quot; and in the same year, co-starred with Holly Marie Combs in the slasher film, &quot;Dr. Giggles&quot;. In 1997, he played dual roles in the horror anthology &quot;Campfire Tales&quot;.

In 1999, after seven years of using an American accent on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Quinn was pleased when producers cast him in the role of Allen Francis Doyle on the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Angel&quot;. Although the character was not written as Irish, he was allowed to use his native Irish accent at the suggestion of series creator, Joss Whedon. In an interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, he said of his accent, &quot;I&#x27;ve been hiding it for so long that it&#x27;s amazing to have some freedom. It was like putting on an old pair of shoes. It&#x27;s bringing my soul back to life.&quot; Whedon stated that the character was supposed to die early in the first season, but the character became a fan favorite. Whedon informed Quinn and promised him a &quot;hero&#x27;s exit&quot;.

His last film was the dark comedy, &quot;R.S.V.P.&quot; (2002).

== Personal life ==
Quinn struggled with substance addiction in the time following &quot;Roseanne&quot;, a timeline confirmed by co-star Michael Fishman and Quinn&#x27;s sister. Unable to maintain sobriety, he was eventually bought out as the owner of Goldfingers nightclub in Los Angeles in 1997. He returned to Ireland in 1997 to be with his family, who supported him in achieving short periods of sobriety and spent time in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. He would later return to Los Angeles to resume his acting career.

== Death ==
On 3 December 2002, at the age of 32, Quinn was found dead at a friend&#x27;s home in North Hollywood, California, where he had been staying for a few months. An autopsy found that he had died from an accidental drug overdose earlier that day.

During production of the tenth season of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, which aired in 2018, it was decided that Quinn&#x27;s role of Mark Healy would not be recast, and his role was written off the show as having died years ago. It introduced, however, a new Mark Healy, the son of Darlene Conner and David Healy. The series paid tribute to Quinn at the end of one of its episodes, &quot;Eggs Over, Not Easy.&quot;

In 2019, during &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; 20th-anniversary reunion of the cast of &quot;Angel&quot;, actor David Boreanaz stated that &quot;Glenn played a great character, but also became a really close friend of mine. God rest his soul.&quot;

<doc id="143456" wikidata="Q54936" url="?curid=143456" title="Province of Alicante">
<text>Alicante (, , ; ; ; officially: / ) is a province of eastern Spain, in the southern part of the Valencian Community. It is the second most populated Valencian province. Likewise, the second and third biggest cities in the Valencian Community—Alicante and Elche, respectively—are located in this province.

Alicante is bordered by the provinces of Murcia on the southwest, Albacete on the west, Valencia on the north, and the Mediterranean Sea on the east. The province is named after its capital, the city of Alicante (also known in Valencian as &quot;Alacant&quot;).

==Territory, population and resources==

According to the 2018 population data, Alicante ranks as the fourth most populous province in Spain (after Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia), with 1,838,819 inhabitants. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants in the province are Alicante (334,757 inhabitants), Elche (230,112), Torrevieja (101,792), Orihuela (86,164), Benidorm (71,034), Alcoy (61,552), Elda (55,168), and San Vicente del Raspeig (53,126).

The province has the largest ratio of foreigner population among all Spanish provinces. The total of 446,368 foreigners are registered in the province, which represents 23.6 percent of the total population. Out of 141 municipalities that make up the province, foreign population is above 25% in 54 municipalities, and above 50% in 19 municipalities. The latter include San Fulgencio (80%), Rojales (74%), Benitatxell (69.8%), Algorfa (69.7%), Llíber (67%), Teulada (65.5%), Daya Vieja (64.4%); San Miguel de Salinas (64.3%), Calp (62.8%), Els Poblets (61.6%), Alcalalí (60.8%), Benijófar (58.5%), L&#x27;Alfàs del Pi (56.6%), Orba (55%), Xàbia (54%), Torrevieja (53.5%), Murla (52%), Fondó (51.7%), and Benidoleig (50%).

From the 50 provinces of Spain, Alicante is the only one with three metropolitan areas—Alicante–Elche, Elda–Petrer and Benidorm—even though only one of them (Alicante–Elche) is ranked within the Spanish top ten metropolitan areas. It has an area of , and so it has a population density of 313.8 inhabitants/km2.

===Geography and climate===
The province is mountainous, especially in the north and midwest, whereas it is mostly flat to the south, in the Vega Baja del Segura area; the most elevated points in the province are Aitana (1,558 m), Puig Campana (1,410 m), Montcabrer (1,389 m), Carrascar de la Font Roja (1,354 m), Maigmó (1,296 m), Serra de Crevillent (835 m) and El Montgó (753 m). All of these peaks are a part of the Subbaetic Range.

The coast extends from the cape, Cap de la Nau, in the north to almost reaching the Mar Menor (Minor Sea) in the south. With regard to water sources, due to the dry rain regime there are no major rivers, but mostly &quot;ramblas&quot; (dry rivers), which fill in with water when torrential rains occur.

The only remarkable streams are the Vinalopó, Serpis, and the river Segura. Other minor seasonal creeks (some completely dried out in summer) are Girona, Algar, Amadorio and Ebo.

There are saline wetlands and marshlands along the coast such &quot;El Fondo&quot; and the former wetlands and now salt evaporation ponds in Santa Pola and Torrevieja. All of them are key Ramsar Sites which make the Alicante province of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds.

Important coastal dunes are present in the Guardamar area which were planted with thousands of pine trees during the 19th century in order to protect the ville from the dunes advancing, which has created now an area of remarkable ecologic value.

The climate is strikingly diverse for such a reduced area. Three major areas can be cited:

* Most of the province belongs to a semi-arid climate. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from La Vila Joiosa through the southernmost border (cities included here are, amongst others, Alicante, Elche, Orihuela and Torrevieja). Summers are very long, hot to very hot and very dry, winters are cool to mild and its most prominent feature is very scarce precipitation, typically below 300mm. per year and most likely to happen during spring and autumn. The reasons for this lack of precipitation is mostly the marked rain shadow effect caused by hills to the west of the Alicante province (and, to a lesser degree, those in the northern part of the province which, in turn, enhance the inverse Orographic lift effect around Cap de la Nau). Most of its few rainy days happen during Autumn and Spring.

:The predominant vegetation in this part of the province is Matorral Scrublands including thyme, esparto, juniper and the like.

*Proper Mediterranean climate is present in the northeastern areas around Cap de la Nau, mostly to its North but also to its South, in diminishing grades until disappearing slightly north of Benidorm. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from the northern border of the province through the Benidorm area. The north slopes of the mountains in the Marina Alta have a remarkably wetter microclimate with an average of up to 900mm of precipitation due to orographic lift, with most of the precipitation occurring in Autumn and Spring. The precipitation in this area is an average four times that of the semiarid South, with this big precipitation gap occurring in a matter of just .

:The vegetation of this part is an enriched version of the Matorral shrubland and also Mediterranean pine woods.

*The Alicante province also has a mostly dry Mediterranean to Continental Mediterranean climate. These are the innermost part of the province (for example Villena) and some closer to the sea but at a higher elevation (for example Alcoy). Here winters are cool to cold and a few days of snow are not unusual; summers are mild to hot and rains at about 500 mm average and slightly more evenly distributed through the year than in the previous mentioned areas. The innermost part of this domain is more quite dry while the mountainous part reach slightly higher precipitation figures which allow Kermes Oak woods to thrive, such as the one in &quot;La Carrasqueta&quot; or in the Mariola range, both near Alcoy.

==History and politics==

The Iberians were the oldest documented people living in what today is the Alicante province. Belonging to these there are several archaeologic sites from which is especially known the one in &quot;La Serreta&quot; (near Alcoy) because the longest inscriptions remaining in the undeciphered Iberian language were found there.

Along the coast and contemporarily to the Iberians, the seafaring Phoenicians (in Guardamar) and Greeks (along the coastal section to the north of the Alicante city) settled stable trading colonies and interacted with the former (see Lady of Elche for the most renowned archeological piece of this period).

After a brief Carthaginian period, the Romans took over. Romanization in this part of Iberia was intense, the Via Augusta communicated this part of the Empire to the metropoli and so several cities thrived, from which the one known as &quot;Ilici Augusta&quot; (now Elche) even reached the status of colonia.

After a brief period of Visigothic ruling, the area was taken by Islamic armies and became a part of Al Andalus.
From the 13th century, kings like Ferdinand III of Castile, James I of Aragon, Alfonso X of Castile, James II of Aragon reconquered the cities that Moors occupied. What today is the Alicante province was initially split between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon by means of the Treaty of Almizra, however later on the whole territory became under the control of the Kingdom of Valencia, which was a component Kingdom of the Crown of Aragon.

Alicante contributes with 12 deputies in the Spanish Parliament and with 36 deputies in the Corts Valencianes, the regional Parliament of the Valencian Community.

==Economy==
The main industries in Alicante province are, in the primary sector, intensive agriculture, especially in the fertile Vega Baja del Segura, Camp d&#x27;Elx (Elche&#x27;s countryside) and vineyards in the inner part of the province (Monforte, Novelda, Pinós), also near the coast in the Marina Alta area. Fishing is important all along the coast, with important fishing harbours such as Santa Pola, Calp or Dénia.

Industry has been historically important in the textile sector around Alcoy. Footwear still remains as the flagship industrial sector of the province, which occurs in Elche, Elda, Petrer and Villena, both labour-intensive footwear and, specially, textile are at a low ebb due to harsh competition from fast pace growing economies in Asia. The traditionally important toys industry around the Ibi and Onil area is another one competing internationally with those same areas.

A sector which has gained preeminence during the last 20 years is marble quarrying and processing, it happens mostly in the Novelda and Pinós area.

Still, what the province is known for is its massive tourism sector. The Costa Blanca&#x27;s generally mild and sunny weather attracts millions of tourists from other European countries such as the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Norway or France and also from other parts in Spain like Madrid. Thousands of families from other places own a second home in the Alicante province which they use for their vacation time.

<text>Castellón (); co-officially in ) is a province in the northern part of the Valencian Community. It is bordered by the provinces of Valencia to the south, Teruel to the west, Tarragona to the north, and by the Mediterranean Sea to the east. The western side of the province is in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area.

==Geography==
Castellón&#x27;s capital is Castellón de la Plana. The province had a population of 579,962 at the start of 2019, 30% of whom were residing in the capital, 60% in its metropolitan area, and 85% along the coastline. As of the 2011 Census, the population had grown to 594,423 people, but has since declined. The province, and in particular its idle large airport, has become a symbol of the wasteful spending prior to the 2008-14 Spanish financial crisis.

It is a bilingual territory whose inhabitants speak both Spanish and the local co-official language Valencian.

Other major cities of the province include Vila-real, Borriana, La Vall d&#x27;Uixó and Vinaròs. There are 135 municipalities in Castellón; see List of municipalities in Castellón.

Castellón is the home of Penyagolosa, the highest mountain of the province and the second highest one in the Valencian Community. It is widely considered to be one of the most emblematic Valencian mountains.

The Greenwich Meridian (the Prime Meridian) passes through the province; there are localities with commemorative monuments such as La Pobla Tornesa, Castellón or Almassora (Paseo Marítimo), and in Castellon it intersects the 40th parallel, and the exact point can be visited at the Meridian Park.

===Population development===
The historical population is given in the following chart:
==Economy==

Traditionally, the economy of Castellón has been focused on the production of citrus and vegetables (Nules and Benicarló). Since the 17th century, Castellón has developed an important ceramic and ceramic tile industry (Onda, L&#x27;Alcora, Nules, Castellón de la Plana and Vila-real) and nowadays most of the Spanish tile producers are concentrated in the province. Also, furniture (Benicarló and Vinaròs) and chemical industries (Benicarló and Castellón) are present. There is a large oil refinery in Castellón de la Plana.

Traditional industries such as shoe and footwear (La Vall d&#x27;Uixó), fishing (Castellón, Vinaròs) and textiles (Vilafranca and Morella), have given way to a service-based economy due to the increasing importance of tourism in the economy of the province.

==Tourism==
The Province of Castellón has varied landscapes and heritage that supports a growing tourist industry. The largest seaside and beach resorts include Benicàssim, Orpesa, Vinaròs, Borriana, Peníscola, Benicarló, etc. There are opportunities for rural tourism in the interior, as well as monumental towns like Morella, Vilafamés, Sant Mateu, Segorbe, mineral springs at Montanejos, Benassal, Catí, etc.

More than 50% of the hotel beds are concentrated in Peniscola, which is the third most popular tourist destination in the Valencian Community after Benidorm and Valencia.

The province is historically subdivided into the following comarques:

* Alcalatén
* Alt Maestrat
* Alto Mijares

<text>Tarragona (; ) is a province of eastern Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous community of Catalonia. It is bordered by the provinces of Castellón, Teruel, Zaragoza, Lleida and Barcelona and by the Mediterranean Sea.
The province&#x27;s population is 795,902 (2018), about one fifth of whom live in the capital, Tarragona. Some of the larger cities and towns in Tarragona province include Reus, Salou, El Vendrell, Tortosa, Valls, Amposta. This province has 183 municipalities. The province includes several World Heritage Sites and is a popular tourist destination. There are Roman Catholic cathedrals in Tarragona and Tortosa.

==History==
After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the late eighth century, this part of Spain came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate and most of the Iberian peninsula was known as Al-Andalus, and was dominated by Muslim rulers. Abd al-Rahman I founded an independent dynasty that survived in the region until the 11th century. 

After the Muslim conquest, the bishopric of Tarragona came under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Narbonne or Auch in southern France. In 1089, this was reorganised, and it came under the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Vich, and in 1118, after Tarragona had been reconquered, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona was established.

==Geography==
The province of Tarragona is in the northeast of Spain with a coast on the Mediterranean Sea. Much of the province is hilly or mountainous and the main feature is the broad valley of the River Ebro and the coastal plain which is backed by the Catalan ranges. In general, industrial development is on the coast and inland is predominantly forest and agricultural land. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the southeast of the province, the province of Barcelona lies to the northeast, Lleida lies to the north, Zaragoza to the northwest, Teruel to the west and Castellón to the southwest. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters.

The area of the province is . The main crops are cereals, grapes, fruit, olives, hemp, and silk. The province has some mineral resources; copper, lead and silver are found and limestone and marble are quarried. Quarrying for aggregate has caused groundwater levels to fall and the environment has been adversely affected by the arrival of invasive species such as the zebra mussel in the Riba-roja d&#x27;Ebre reservoir on the Ebro, the invasive fish &quot;Gambusia&quot; in the Ebro delta and chemical contamination in the Flix reservoir beside which is a chemical works and a hydro-electric plant.

==Population==
The historical population is given in the following chart:

==Tourism==
As well as the port city of Tarragona, the province has much to offer for the tourist. There are Catalan villages to visit, historic sites, sandy beaches, rocky shores, crags, rivers and woodlands and several wildlife reserves. The area has been publicised under the Costa Daurada (golden coast) brand.
The city of Tarragona may have been founded by the Phoenicians and was a major city in Roman times that they called Tarraco. There are many archaeological remains from that period but little remains of the second century amphitheatre; after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the abandoned structure was quarried to provide stone for building. The Les Ferreres Aqueduct dates from the same period and has survived intact. It was built to supply water to the ancient city and is part of the Archaeological Ensemble of Tarraco which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. The city also houses a cathedral, dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which combines Romanesque and Gothic architectural features. There are also many historic churches and convents.

The Catalan authorities have designated four villages as &quot;family holiday destinations&quot;. These are Calafell, Cambrils, La Pineda and nearby Vila-seca, and Salou. Salou is the site of the PortAventura World (PortAventura Park, the most visited theme park in Spain, Ferrari Land and also the PortAventura Caribe Aquatic Park).

The Costa Daurada is served by Reus Airport which receives tourist traffic from passengers journeying to the beach resorts of Salou and Cambrils as well as those travelling to Barcelona. It is a destination of low-cost flights provider Ryanair, and planes fly to Reus from many different European and North African locations. The province also has good road and rail links to Barcelona and southwards to Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia along the coastal strip, and high-speed rail services from Tarragona to Madrid started in 2008.

There are several monasteries in the province that can be visited by following the &quot;Cistercian Monastery Route&quot;. The best known is the Cistercian monastery of Poblet in the comarca of Conca de Barberà, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other monasteries on the route include the Santes Creus, in the municipality of Aiguamúrcia, and Vallbona de les Monges.

Other attractions of the province include the food and wine. The &quot;Penedès Wine and Cava Route&quot; is a tourist trail offering wine-related activities. There are also festivals celebrating local fare, where local gastronomic specialities are eaten, including calçots (grilled spring onions) in Valls, and Xató a sauce served with fish or an endive salad.

<text>The Province of Lleida (; ; ) is one of the four provinces of Catalonia. It lies in northeastern Spain, in the western part of the autonomous community of Catalonia, and is bordered by the provinces of Girona, Barcelona, Tarragona, Zaragoza and Huesca and the country of France and the principality of Andorra. It is often popularly referred to as Ponent (i.e. the West).

Of the population of 414,015 (2007), about 30% live in the capital, Lleida. Some other towns in the province of Lleida are La Seu d&#x27;Urgell (the archbishop of which is also the co-prince of Andorra), Mollerussa, Cervera, Tàrrega, and Balaguer. There are 231 municipalities in Lleida.

Located in the Pyrenees, the Aran Valley is a special comarca with greater autonomy and with Aranese, a variety of Occitan, as its official language.

The Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park is located in this province.

The province enjoys a thriving fruit-growing industry, including pears and peaches.

According to the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, the provinces of Catalonia are due to be superseded by territorial units (&quot;unitats territorials&quot;) or &quot;vegueries&quot; based on a more historical political division, and the province of Lleida would become two territorial units: Ponent or Terres de Lleida Vegueria (the entire southern area) and Alt Pirineu i Aran Vegueria (the entire northern part plus the comarca of Cerdanya, part of which is currently in the Province of Girona), the county of Solsona going to the Comarques Centrals (Central Counties) Vegueria. The plan is currently on hold as of 2015.

== Language ==

The province of Lleida has a characteristic Catalan dialect popularly known as &quot;lleidatà&quot;, with &quot;lo&quot;/&quot;los&quot; used as the masculine definite article instead of &quot;el&quot;/&quot;els&quot; as well as its pronunciation in a large number of words. One example of the pronunciation is the &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word that is pronounced like an &quot;e&quot;. The local dialect, properly known as North-Western Catalan, is part of the Western Catalan block, and as such, shares some features with Valencian (whose dialects are also part of that group).

Lleida is the only province in Catalonia to have a second native language: Occitan, in the Aran Valley.

Lleida is located in the western part of Catalonia and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, between Barcelona and Madrid, and not far from Zaragoza. It borders France and Andorra to the north. This is a popular destination for mountain activities such as skiing and adventure sports.

=== Nature ===
Lleida has a wide variety of landscapes. This includes the mountain area of the Pyrenees. The Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park, the only National Park in Catalonia, and the Alt Pirineu (&quot;High Pyrenees&quot;) and Cadí-Moixeró natural parks are all in the Pyrenees region. The Collegats-Terradets Territorial Park, the Boumort Natural Hunting Reserve and the Congost de Mont-rebei gorge are in the Pre-Pyrenees.

In contrast, the Lleida Plain has more peaceful landscapes. In some cases, these are rather sober, while in others there is fertile land with century-old olive trees, fruit trees, meadows and crop fields. In this area, it is particularly relevant to highlight such spectacular settings as the Estany d&#x27;Ivars i Vila-sana pool and the Aiguabarreig (confluence) of the rivers Segre, Cinca and Ebro. On 6 January 2021, in Tuc de la Llança, Spain&#x27;s absolute minimum temperature of was registered.

=== Sports ===
The comarques (local districts) of Lleida are also market leaders within Spain in the provision of adventure sports, with more than 170 companies organising around fifty different activities on land and water and in the air. This area is also Spain&#x27;s leading ski destination.

Lleida has 11 different ski resorts which are marketed under the brand &quot;Neu de Lleida&quot; (Lleida Snow) and offer over of ski slopes. Their 81 ski lifts have the capacity to carry 115,000 skiers per hour, while the area immediately surrounding these winter sports complexes can also accommodate more than 30,000 visitors.

=== Culture ===
Lleida has a rich architectural heritage. The churches of the Vall de Boi have been declared part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Recently Lleida has started many new initiatives for tourists. These include: the Centre d&#x27;Observació de l&#x27;Univers (Centre for Observing the Universe), or PAM, of Montsec, which is an ambitious project that combines research, education and diffusion within the field of cultural and scientific tourism; the establishment of the Tren dels Llacs (Lakes Train), a touristic railway that connects the provincial capital to the Pre-Pyrenees; the creation of new exhibition spaces (including the Museum of Lleida, the Paper Dresses Museum of Mollerussa and the Skiing Museum of the Val d&#x27;Aran); the organisation of routes to help discover the natural, cultural and monumental treasures of Lleida (with the Castles of Sió Route, the Pyrenean Counties and Nostalgic Pallars Route, the Wine Route of Les Garrigues, and the Literary Routes of Pallars, etc.); and also projects to promote excellence in the field of tourism, such as the Network of Villages with Charm.

=== The city of Lleida ===

Lleida, the capital of the province, is notable for its historical-architectural legacy, which includes buildings such as the Seu Vella (old cathedral) and the Knights Templar Castle of Gardeny. These buildings coexist with modern constructions such as La Llotja, a congress and conference centre. Other city landmarks include the diocese and county museum (which has a collection of Roman, Islamic, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque artefacts and paintings), the Jaume Morera Museum of Modern Art, and the &quot;Roda Roda&quot; Automobile Museum.

<text>The Province of Girona ( ; ) is a province in the northeastern part of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain. It is bordered on the northwest by the province of Lleida, on the southwest by the province of Barcelona, on the north by France (Pyrénées-Orientales), and on the east by the Mediterranean Sea.

The population of the province in 2016 was 739,607. Its capital and largest city is Girona, with an urban area (including the neighbouring municipalities of Salt, Sarrià de Ter and Vilablareix) representing, with a total population of 144,709, 19.2% of the population. The Girona area acts as an industrial, commercial and service hub for a significant part of the province.

==Municipalities of Girona==

The province has 222 municipalities, including Girona city (population 96,722), Figueres (pop. 44,765), Lloret de Mar (pop. 40,282), Blanes (pop. 39,834), Olot (33,725), Salt (pop. 30,389), Palafrugell (pop. 22,816) and Sant Feliu de Guíxols (pop. 21,814), as well as some significant and historical towns such as Banyoles, Besalú, Cadaqués, Camprodon, Palamós, Puigcerdà or Ripoll.

The municipality of Llívia, which is an exclave separated from the rest of Spain and surrounded by France, is also officially part of this province.

==&quot;Comarques&quot; of Girona==
Since the division by provinces in Spain and the division by &quot;comarques&quot; in Catalonia do not completely match, the term &quot;comarques of the province of Girona&quot; is not accurate. However, a list of the &quot;comarques&quot; that are included—totally or partially—in the province of Girona can be made:

* Fully included:
** l&#x27;Alt Empordà
** el Baix Empordà
** la Garrotxa
** el Gironès
** el Pla de l&#x27;Estany
** el Ripollès
* Partially included:
** la Selva (all municipalities except Fogars de la Selva)
** la Cerdanya (only its eastern half)
** Osona (this &quot;comarca&quot; is generally not listed as part of Girona, since only three of its municipalities are part of this province: Espinelves, Vidrà and Viladrau)

<doc id="143466" wikidata="Q1050690" url="?curid=143466" title="Matchbox (brand)">
<text>Matchbox is a toy brand which was introduced by Lesney Products in 1953, and is now owned by Mattel, Inc, which purchased the brand in 1997. The brand was given its name because the original die-cast &quot;Matchbox&quot; toys were sold in boxes similar to those in which matches were sold. The brand grew to encompass a broad range of toys, including larger scale die-cast models, plastic model kits, slot car racing, and action figures.

During the 1980s, Matchbox began to switch to the more conventional plastic and cardboard &quot;blister packs&quot; that were used by other die-cast toy brands such as Hot Wheels. By the 2000s, the box style packaging was re-introduced for the collectors&#x27; market, such as the 35th Anniversary of Superfast series in 2004 and the 50th Anniversary of Superfast in 2019.

Products currently marketed under the Matchbox name include scale model plastic and die-cast vehicles, and toy garages.

==History==
===Early years: Lesney, the origin of the Matchbox name and the &quot;1-75&quot; series===
The Matchbox name originated in 1953 as a brand name of the British die-casting company Lesney Products, whose reputation was moulded by John W. &quot;Jack&quot; Odell (1920–2007), Leslie Charles Smith (1918–2005), and Rodney Smith. The name Lesney was a portmanteau of Leslie and Rodney Smith&#x27;s first names. Their first major sales success was the popular model of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation coach, which sold more than a million models. Lesney co-owner Jack Odell then created a toy that paved the way for the company&#x27;s future success which was designed for his daughter. Her school only allowed children to bring toys that could fit inside a matchbox, so Odell crafted a scaled-down version of the Lesney green and red road roller. This toy ultimately became the first of the &quot;1-75&quot; miniature range. A dump truck and a cement mixer completed the original three-model release that marked the starting point for the mass-market success of the Matchbox series. The company decided to sell the models in replica matchboxes, thus yielding the name of the series.

Additional models continued to be added to the line throughout the decade, including cars such as an MG Midget TD, a Vauxhall Cresta, a Ford Zodiac, and many others. As the collection grew, it also gradually became more international, including models of Volkswagens, a Citroën, and American makes. To make such miniatures, the designers took detailed photographs of the real models, even obtaining some original blueprints. This enabled them to make models with surprisingly high levels of detail, despite the small scale. The size of the models allowed Matchbox to occupy a market niche barely touched by the competition; the associated price advantage made the toys affordable and helped establish &quot;Matchbox&quot; as a generic word for small toy cars, whatever the brand.

===Moko; growth &amp; development of the &quot;1-75&quot; and other core series===
In the earliest years of the regular, or &quot;1-75&quot; series – well before the series actually numbered 75 models – Lesney was marketed/distributed by Moko (itself named after its founder, Moses Kohnstam). Boxes in that era mentioned this, with the text &quot;A Moko Lesney&quot; appearing on each. Lesney gained its independence from Moko in 1959 by buying out Moko&#x27;s share in the joint enterprise, leading to a period of growth, both in sales and in size. Early models did not feature windows or interiors, were made entirely of metal, and were often about 2&quot; (5 cm) in length. By 1968, Matchbox was the biggest-selling brand of small die-cast model cars worldwide. By this time, the average model in their collection featured plastic windows, interiors, tyres (often with separate disc wheels), and occasional accessories; spring suspensions; opening parts; and was about 3&quot; (7 cm) long. Some even featured steering, including the pressure-based AutoSteer system debuting in 1969. The line was very diverse, including lorries, buses, tractors, motorcycles, and trailers as well as standard passenger cars.
The three dominant brands in the world at the time, all British-made (Dinky, Matchbox and Corgi), were very successful. Each had its own market niche and its own strong reputation, while innovations and advances by one were adopted by the others within a matter of a few years. Each also expanded to some extent into the others&#x27; territory, though this never seemed to seriously affect the sales of any brand&#x27;s core series.

As part of Lesney&#x27;s expansion activities, four further die-cast model ranges were introduced during the 1950s and 60s. The &quot;Models of Yesteryear&quot;, introduced in 1956, were renditions of classic vehicles from the steam and early automotive eras. These were often about 3½–4&quot; in length. &quot;Accessories Packs&quot; were also introduced in 1956 and included petrol pumps, garages, and the like. &quot;Major Packs&quot;, which were larger-scale models, often of construction vehicles, were added in 1957. The &quot;King Size&quot; series of larger-scale trucks and tractors was added in 1960 and was diversified from 1967 onwards to include passenger car models in a scale similar to that used by Corgi and Dinky. Major Packs had been absorbed into the King Size range by 1968.

===Competition and crisis===
The main focus at Matchbox continued to be their smaller cars. Other brands, including Husky/Corgi Junior, Budgie, and Cigar Box, attempted to compete with Matchbox, but none were particularly successful until American toy giant Mattel introduced the revolutionary low-friction &quot;racing&quot; wheels on its Hot Wheels line of cars. These models, although less true to scale and often featuring fantasy vehicles, were attractive, painted in bright metallic colours and fitted with racing-style &quot;mag&quot; wheels and slick tyres, and were marketed aggressively and with numerous accessory products, such as race track sets and the like. The Hot Wheels line often featured models that were decidedly American. In 1969, a second competitor based in the US, Johnny Lightning, entered the market, and the bottom effectively fell out of Lesney&#x27;s US sales. At the same time, the other major market (the UK) was also under attack by competitors.

Lesney&#x27;s response to this was relatively quick – but not quick enough to avoid major financial worries – by creating the &quot;Superfast&quot; line. This was effectively a transformation of the 1969 line to include low-friction wheels (at first narrow, since the company needed time to retool the series to accommodate wide tyres), often accompanied with new colours. The result was, at first, a strange but interesting line of fast-wheeling cars, trucks, and trailers, basically complete in 1970. Racing track sets and the like were also released to allow children to race their cars. Starting in 1970 and particularly in 1971, new models appeared with wider tyres, and older models (including trucks still in the line) were retooled to fit slicks. The &quot;King Size&quot; range was similarly updated, including a division into &quot;Super Kings&quot; (mostly trucks, but also with mag wheels) and &quot;Speed Kings&quot; (cars). A short-lived series of rechargeable electric cars, called &quot;Scorpions&quot;, was released as well, to compete with similar products from Hot Wheels (Sizzlers) and Corgi (ElectroRockets).

By the mid-1970s, Matchbox was again a force on the world market, having completed the transition and having even updated its line to include some fantasy vehicles. The &quot;1-75&quot; series was also amended to include the Rola-Matics (featuring mechanical parts that moved when the vehicle was moved) and Streakers, the latter an attempt to compete with Hot Wheels&#x27; newest innovation, tampo-printing on the vehicle itself.

===Expansion in the Superfast era===

In an attempt to reap more benefits from the regained popularity of the Matchbox brand, a last period of great expansion started with the introduction of multiple new lines, including the &quot;Sky Busters&quot; range of aircraft (including current and historical private, commercial, and military planes), &quot;Battle Kings&quot; military models, &quot;Sea Kings&quot; naval models, &quot;Adventure 2000&quot; science fiction models, and the &quot;Two Packs&quot; series, which revisited the traditional Matchbox idea of a model and an associated trailer.
Unfortunately, early marketing concepts of metallic-painted tanks and bright-coloured ships were not consistent with market demands, and the models, many of which were quite well made for the money, were generally not successful. Second editions of the &quot;Battle Kings&quot; and &quot;Sky Busters&quot; series were painted in more realistic colours and were well-received but, by this time, general economic factors were seriously affecting the ability of the company to make a profit on toys manufactured in England.

Of these series, only the &quot;Sky Busters&quot; and, to some extent, the &quot;Two Packs&quot; survived over time. The &quot;Convoy&quot; series of articulated truck-trailers (mostly American) was an offshoot of the &quot;Two Packs&quot; line and continues under various guises to this day.

A rather simple development in this period―as much philosophical in nature as product-related―initiated a revolutionary change in the marketplace. The Matchbox brand had become the most widely collected of all die-cast toy lines (see below, &quot;Matchbox collectors&quot;). In the 1970s, Lesney began to seek contact with collectors, sending representatives to collectors&#x27; meets, providing information to the various collectors&#x27; clubs, and informally surveying collectors&#x27; interests. This resulted at first in the creation of several models for collectors, such as a &quot;Yesteryear&quot; model, the black Y1 Ford Model T.

The success of this decision led the company to place models of commercial vehicles in the &quot;Yesteryear&quot; line (two vans at first, a Talbot and another Model T) which were tampo-printed with period advertising for brand-name items such as Lipton&#x27;s Tea, Coca-Cola, or Suze. These models were the first commercial vehicles in the series since the 1950s. The concept was quickly expanded to include limited editions of models made for specific countries (Arnott&#x27;s Biscuits [Australia], Sunlight Seife [Germany]) or at the specific request of companies such as Nestlé&#x27;s Milk, Taystee Bread, and Harrods department store. This aspect of the business―so-called &quot;promotionals&quot;―had existed since the 1960s, but had established itself firmly in the company&#x27;s culture in the 1970s with numerous models, particularly of a &quot;1-75&quot; model, the no. 17 London bus.

It immediately became evident that special, low-volume models of this nature were highly desirable from both the sponsor and the collectors&#x27; perspective, as well as being profitable for Matchbox. The market expanded rapidly, leading to increased licensing as well as the development of models no longer aimed at all at the children&#x27;s toy market, but rather at the higher-margin &quot;premium&quot; segment.

===Economic difficulties, bankruptcy and the post-Lesney era===

Due more to the economic climate in the United Kingdom at the time than to the lack of success of the Matchbox brand, even though all of the core ranges continued to sell strongly, the company was in difficult financial straits by the end of the 1970s. Matchbox suffered in the same way as its British competitors. Following in the footsteps of Meccano (Dinky), and just a year before Mettoy (Corgi), Lesney became bankrupt in June 1982, and went into receivership. The &quot;Matchbox&quot; brand name, some tooling, moulds and other assets were then sold to Universal Toys and David Yeh. Some of the Matchbox tooling became property of Jack Odell, who continued to market Matchbox &quot;Yesteryear&quot;-like products under the Lledo (Odell&#x27;s last name in reverse) brand name, but essentially Lesney and Matchbox had been sold to Yeh and his group. Yeh reorganized Lesney and renamed the group &quot;Matchbox International Ltd.&quot;, with Yeh as Chairman and Jack Forcelledo as President. Yeh took the group public on the NYSE in 1986, with a successful IPO.

Although the company was no longer British-owned, limited production continued in England until the mid-1980s, re-using many of the old Lesney castings, but most production and tooling was moved to Macau. It was during this period that Matchbox acquired the rights to the venerated Dinky brand, perhaps the &quot;mother of all toy car collectibles&quot;, and united two of the most important names in die-cast under one roof. New models were created (sometimes dies were also bought from competing companies), and the &quot;Dinky Collection&quot; was born. &quot;Dinky&quot; models tended to be of more recent classics (particularly the 1950s), while &quot;Yesteryears&quot; tended to concentrate on older vintages. It was also during the Universal era that the &quot;Matchbox Collectibles&quot; concept was developed (see below, &quot;Matchbox Collectibles&quot;).
Because of high labour costs, and the lack of enough skilled workers in Hong Kong and Macau, Universal decided to outsource its die casting to mainland China. In April 1984, the first Hong Kong-Shanghai joint venture toy company, called Shanghai Universal Toys Co., Ltd. (usually abbreviated as SUTC/上海环球玩具有限公司), was established in Minhang, Shanghai. Yeh was the Hong Kong party, while the Shanghai Toys Import &amp; Export Company, the Shanghai Shang Shi Investment Company (the Shanghai Government owned investment vehicle), the Bank of China, and Aijian Holdings, were the Chinese shareholders. The CJV contract was signed off with 20-year period of validity.

1985 saw the first batch of Matchbox toys which had &quot;China&quot; cast on the base. Dies were imported to Shanghai from Macau until the early 1990s, when Macau finally ceased producing Matchbox toys and moved its production to the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. No dies were designed by SUTC, which confined itself to decal painting, assembling and packing. Accompanying its metal casting, SUTC also had a plastic kits and components factory, called Shanghai Universal Plastic Toys Company (usually abbreviated as SUPT/上海环球塑胶玩具有限公司). The Motor City series, Matchbox PK series, and many plastic components, were produced there between the late 1980s and mid 1990s. Meanwhile, Universal also outsourced its die casting capabilities in Southern China. The Yongtai Toys Company (永泰玩具有限公司) produced Matchbox toys under licence from Universal, but without fixed assets investment.

===Purchase by Mattel and present day===

By 1992, Universal was also seeking a buyer. In May 1992, it sold the brand to Tyco Toys, the toy division of which was bought out in turn by Mattel in 1997, uniting Matchbox with its longtime rival Hot Wheels under the same corporate banner. Under Mattel, the name &quot;Matchbox International Ltd.&quot; was terminated.

The buyout by Mattel was greeted with considerable trepidation by the Matchbox collectors&#x27; community. The rivalry between the Hot Wheels and Matchbox brands was not only a battle fought by the companies; collectors of each of the brands felt strongly about the qualities of their brand of choice. For the typical Matchbox collector, Hot Wheels were inferior in scaling and model choice, making them less desirable. There were fears that Mattel would either impose a Hot Wheels-style philosophy on the Matchbox line, or actually fold the Matchbox line into the Hot Wheels series. Early concerns of this nature by collectors were countered by assurances from Mattel that Matchbox would continue to develop its own product line independently from Hot Wheels, and that it was intended that Matchbox represent more realistic and traditional vehicles, while fantasy ones would be placed firmly in Hot Wheels territory. To demonstrate the latter commitment, some very realistic Hot Wheels Caterpillar models were re-branded to Matchbox.

In 2002, to celebrate its 50th anniversary, &quot;Sky Busters&quot; made a comeback, but with Continental Airlines as the only major airline to sponsor the product. In 2003, Matchbox came out with a line of special-edition cars.
Breaking with its commitment of the 1990s, Mattel revamped the Matchbox line almost completely in 2003, introducing &quot;Ultra Heroes&quot;, a series of fantasy vehicles, as part of a &quot;Hero City&quot; theme. Matchbox collectors were appalled, and the market didn&#x27;t respond. The toys proved to be unpopular, and the line was soon discontinued. Next year, Matchbox, with a new team in charge based in El Segundo, California, started a return to the company&#x27;s roots by selling realistic, well-detailed models, most of which were based on real prototypes, although mostly of American cars, or brands well known on the American market. The reappearance of the pre-2001 Matchbox logo, albeit without its classic quotation marks, signalled the return to the original philosophy.

To signal the seriousness of the venture, and its commitment to the brand, Mattel introduced a new, second &quot;1-75&quot; series, parallel to the standard range, celebrating the &quot;35th Anniversary of Superfast&quot;. Models were packaged in model-specific blister packs containing not only the model, but also individual, traditional-style &quot;retro&quot; boxes, harking back to the Superfast boxes from about 1970. All castings were of realistic vehicles, and some 1969 castings were re-activated for inclusion in the range. The series was strictly limited in production volume, sold at a premium price, and was a great success. Further Superfast series were released in 2005 and 2006, and continued again in 2019 and 2020. The &quot;Superfast&quot; series was later discontinued for 2021 and was replaced by the similar &quot;Matchbox Collector&quot; line, which are collector-focused vehicles in 1950s-style retro packing. These vehicles have features which are not present on standard cars, such as opening parts and two-piece wheels with rubber tires, and increased detailing and decorations on the cars.

Also in 2005, certain &quot;Yesteryear&quot; castings, which had been released during the Tyco/early Mattel era as part of the &quot;Muscle Car&quot; series of Matchbox Collectibles, were re-released in 1971-style retro packaging and retro wheels as &quot;Super Kings&quot;—considered by many to be a strange name choice, since models of that nature had been called &quot;Speed Kings&quot; in the 1970s.

Following the &quot;Hero City&quot; fiasco (the name being dropped in late 2005 in favor of &quot;MBX Metal&quot;), Mattel showed interest in reviving the Matchbox brand. However, since Matchbox Collectibles Inc. was shut down, Mattel&#x27;s interests have always been concentrated on very few series of the Matchbox legacy: &quot;1-75&quot;, &quot;Sky Busters&quot;, &quot;Convoys&quot;, and to some extent the &quot;Two Packs&quot; concept, although now sold under a different name, &quot;Hitch &#x27;n Haul&quot;. Although small numbers of &quot;Super Kings&quot; and &quot;Yesteryears&quot; were released at times, no new castings were created. &quot;Battle Kings&quot; reappeared on the market in 2006, not as King Size models, but rather as a name of military-oriented &quot;Two Pack&quot;-style sets of regular-size models. The &quot;Dinky&quot; name has effectively been reduced to a few &quot;re-branded&quot; Matchbox &quot;1-75&quot; cars on the international market (normal models with &quot;Dinky&quot; tampo-printed onto the baseplate). No further investment in dies or tooling was made. It appeared that the classic brand, once saved by Matchbox, would be allowed by Mattel to languish or die once again.

In 2019, Matchbox launched the &quot;Moving Parts&quot; line, which are vehicles that incorporate opening features such as bonnets and doors. Some vehicles in the series harken back to older Lesney castings, such as the Volkswagen Type 3 and Pontiac Grand Prix. These vehicles usually retail for twice the amount of a standard Matchbox car.

===Green strategy===
On Thursday, April 15, 2021 Matchbox announced that they will make a 1:64 scale Tesla Roadster in 2022, made out of 99% recycled materials (62.1% recycled zinc, 1.0% stainless steel and 36.9% recycled plastic) and classified as a carbon neutral product. This move was made as part of a plan for the brand to become more environmentally sustainable, and Matchbox pledged to make all of their cars and packaging out of 100% recycled materials by the year 2030. The first Matchbox cars to feature recycled packaging will be the &quot;Power Grabs&quot; assortment. In addition, Matchbox launched an EV-themed pack with a Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius, BMW i3, BMW i8, and an International eStar, and also announced that EV charging stations will be featured in two playsets, to encourage environmental consciousness among children.&quot;&quot;

===Model numbering: The &quot;1-75&quot; (or &quot;75&quot;) series===
Lesney gradually increased the number of models in its standard Matchbox Series range from three in 1953 to 75 in 1960. The &quot;1-75&quot; range would then remain at 75 models for almost 40 years. When a new model was released, an existing model was discontinued, its number being re-allocated. This meant that dealer display stands only had to accommodate 75 models. New owners Mattel expanded the regular US market Matchbox series to 100 models for 1999 but changed it back to 75 models for 2001. The US range was again increased from 75 to 100 models for 2008, and then further expanded to 120 models for 2012 and then to 125 in 2016. These changes were not applied in all markets.

The actual numbering of the &quot;1-75&quot; series number &quot;on&quot; the individual models (starting in the mid-&#x27;50s, numbers were cast onto the baseplates) was discontinued in the Universal era. This was in part due to the new concept of offering country-specific lines of models for many of the key markets, which led to the same castings being used under different numbers in different markets. In recent years (Mattel), a sequential casting no. (e.g. MB687) – unrelated to any &quot;1-75&quot; number used in any market – is cast onto each baseplate. The relevant &quot;1-75&quot; series number is printed on the blister pack or box.

(Other Matchbox ranges also had identifying numbers cast on their bases, many of which were reallocated as older models were retired and new ones introduced. The numbering conventions are listed in the Series Overview section below. However, with the exception of the &quot;Yesteryear&quot; line, which was held to 16 models for well over a decade [before being expanded greatly], there was no other case of a strict series size limitation by Lesney.)

====Scales of models====

Matchbox cars are primarily made in two sizes:
* The smaller models (&quot;regular size&quot;; &quot;1-75&quot; and related series) are often classified as 1:64 scale (though they range from smaller than 1:100 to much larger than 1:64) and measure about 2.5-3 inches, or 6.5-7.5 centimetres, in length.
* Matchbox has also manufactured models in approx. 1:43 scale (sometimes called &quot;King Size&quot;), later labelling them &quot;Speed Kings&quot; or &quot;Super Kings&quot; (or, later—particularly in the Matchbox Collectibles lines [cf. below]—&quot;Models of Yesteryear&quot; or &quot;Dinky&quot;), which measure about 3.5-4 inches, or 9-10 centimetres, in length. This was basically the same scale as Corgi or Dinky. Matchbox&#x27;s designers favoured this larger size because it permitted more detail. The 1:43 models are still made, but are primarily marketed as collectibles rather than as toys. While the actual car models in these series tend to be around the 1:43 scale, other vehicle types (trucks, construction and farm vehicles, hovercraft, tanks, etc.) vary greatly, in the same manner as do the regular size models.
=== Scale model kits ===
Matchbox set up its own plastic kit division in the UK around 1972/73. Concentrating on 1:72 scale military aircraft and 1:76 military vehicles, it competed with the then-dominant Airfix company. The Matchbox kits had a distinctive appearance, the parts in each kit were produced in two or three colours compared to the single colour plastic of Airfix. The boxes were also more colourful and included clear windows so the contents could be seen. In addition, unlike Airfix&#x27;s military vehicle kits, the Matchbox military vehicle kits all came with a small diorama base.

At the end of the decade Matchbox bought the AMT Corporation, an American plastic model kit manufacturer. AMT&#x27;s line of 1:25 scale cars and trucks was continued.

The Matchbox kits were well made, with modern tooling and techniques, but critics felt that the kits were too coarsely detailed in comparison with other models on the market, and too &quot;toy-like&quot;. Yet they were still just as complex and time consuming to construct as any other kit, which limited their appeal to more casual model builders. The company was unable to fully satisfy either the casual or serious model building market, and was one of the first companies to abandon model kits when the hobby started its decline, selling AMT to the Ertl Company and shutting down its own kit division less than twenty years after starting it.

Original Matchbox model kits are highly collectable.
=== Kit ranges ===
* 1:72, 1:48, 1:32 scale aircraft
* 1:32, 1:76 scale military vehicles
* 1:76 scale soldiers
* 1:700 scale ships
* 1:32 scale cars
* 1:12 scale motorcycles

In addition it produced the well-known 1:72 .

=== Current status ===
The Matchbox model kit moulds were acquired in the early 1990s by Revell Germany, which continues to sporadically re-issue the old Matchbox kits, now under the Revell label. Recently, a number of the most desirable Matchbox kits have made re-appearances, to the delight of modelers: In 1:72 scale, The Handley Page Victor, the Supermarine Walrus, Handley Page Halifax and PB4Y Privateer, and in 1:48 scale the A1-E four-seat Skyraider. Many modellers are also looking forward to a re-release of the Mk II/Mk VI Hawker Tempest, the English Electric Canberra, RR Spey Phantom.

Revell has confirmed that it will be re-releasing the much sought after 1:32 scale Spitfire Mk. 22 with Griffon, and the 1:32 scale de Havilland Venom.

Multi-coloured kits were only produced until 1990.

===Other products and series===
Numerous additional product lines have been produced and/or sold by Matchbox over the years, particularly in the Lesney era. Collectors catalogues were published in various languages by the company each year starting in 1957, continuing well into the 1980s. Collectors cases were designed for children to carry/store their &quot;1-75&quot; vehicles. From 1957 until the 1970s, a range of garages/service stations was offered in either Esso or BP logos (under the series no. MG-1).

There were also jigsaw puzzles of photographs depicting Matchbox vehicles in realistic-looking situations, race track sets (Superfast track was yellow, as opposed to Hot Wheels&#x27; orange, and of a slightly wider gauge), a particularly clever plastic snap-together wall-display system, roadways, and even a slot-car system for standard (non-powered) car models, the Matchbox Motorways.

At several points, in an attempt to move into Mattel and Hasbro territory, Matchbox produced dolls, first a line of pirate dolls for younger school-age boys, and later baby dolls for pre-school girls. Numerous other non-die-cast items have been marketed, as well as a number of shorter-lived die-cast series (Historic Inn Signs, Disney cars, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; models, etc.).

==== Die cast aeroplanes ====
As mentioned above, Matchbox also tried its hand in the die cast aeroplanes area, under the name &quot;Sky Busters&quot;. The models were not only produced for children; &quot;Sky Busters&quot; produced plane models for such airlines as Aeroméxico, Air France, British Airways, Iberia, Lufthansa and Saudi Arabian Airlines. However, they were and are designed more for the inexpensive toy market. Promotional models sold by the airlines themselves more often tend to be models of higher quality, exactness, and price.

==== Matchbox Motorways ====
In the late 1960s, the Arnold Minimobil system (Germany) was marketed as the Matchbox Motorway (UK). These consisted of easily assembled hard plastic track, designed to look like concrete roads, rather than the soft plastic of Hotwheels and Superfast track. The system worked by means of trackside electric motors driving continuous spring loops which would run in channels. Small plastic pins could be attached to the underside of Matchbox vehicles which would pass through the slot in the track and engage with the spring, allowing the vehicles to be pulled along. There were three main sets: M1, M2 and M3.

Set M1 consisted of a simple oval of track. Small huts, on each side of the main straight track section, contained the individual motors which powered each lane, allowing the vehicles in adjacent lanes vehicles to be raced, although all vehicles in the same lane would travel at the same speed. As the drive spring for the outer slot would be longer than that of the inner slot, the springs were stored in colour-coded bags in the box.

Set M2 consisted of a simple figure-of-eight track, with both drive springs being of the same length. the springs were driven in a similar method to those in the M1 set.

Set M3, known as &#x27;Switch-A-Track&#x27;, instead of separate motors, had a single motor hidden in a dummy roundhouse in the centre of a roundabout. Whereas set M2 had a simple figure-of-eight layout, set M3 had a track layout consisting of two extended loops, connected by means of the central roundabout. Each of the 4 exits from the roundabout had a rocker switch which, through a mechanical linkage, moved small turnouts which would allow the vehicles to change path.

In addition, there was a set E2, an extension pack which could be added to set M2, which allowed for a greater variety of track layouts.

==== Slot cars ====
In the late &#x27;70s, Matchbox also produced slot cars called &quot;Powertrack&quot; or Speedtrack, which featured working headlights. (Some Powertrack models had parallel issues in the &quot;normal&quot; Matchbox &quot;1-75&quot; line.) Other slot car sets from Matchbox included a lane changer (which allowed cars to switch lanes) and a Race and Chase set which featured a police car and chased car which could jump and u-turn.

==== Scale soldiers ====
Also in the late 1970s, Matchbox produced a small range of 1:32 and 1:76 Second World War toy soldiers in direct competition to Airfix. These sets included British, German and American infantry, the British 8th Army and the German Afrika Korps and British Commandos. Though Matchbox&#x27;s sets featured fewer figures than comparable Airfix sets (15 vs. 29 in 1:32), they included weapons that Airfix did not model (flame-throwers, heavy machine guns), and Montgomery and Rommel figures in the Desert War sets. The figures were popular for their high-quality molding and their different extra weapons and poses as compared to the more common Airfix sets.

==== Action figures ====
During the 1970s Matchbox created its own lines of action figures including &quot;Matchbox Fighting Furies&quot;—pirate and cowboy figures with separate costumes—in 1974 and &quot;Mobile Action Command&quot;, plastic figures with accessories and rescue-themed vehicles. From the 1980s onwards its action figure lines tied in with television and animations such as &quot;Ring Raiders&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Voltron&quot;, &quot;Parasites&quot;, &quot;Monster in My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. They ceased developing most of such lines when Matchbox was absorbed into Tyco; some of the &quot;Robotech&quot; toys were later re-released by Playmates Toys under the &quot;Exosquad&quot; line.

==== Video games ====
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Matchbox also published several video games that tied into the Matchbox line of model vehicles. These games featured construction and emergency services (fire, police, ambulance, rescue), with game play involving vehicle-appropriate action sequences (for example, intercepting a robbery with a squad car in &quot;Motor City Patrol&quot;). These games were developed by other companies for a variety of platforms, including Game Boy handheld gamers, the NES video gaming system, and PC.

There were plans to release more Matchbox games on the NES system; however, they only released &quot;Motor City Patrol&quot;. Matchbox games not released to North America included &quot;Sir Eric the Bold&quot; (which never got past prototype stage), &quot;Matchbox Racers&quot; and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, only the latter being eventually released in Europe by Konami. However, due to Nintendo&#x27;s strict policies against any forms of religion in their games, it is likely that they would have faced internal controversy.

====An overview of the principal die-cast series====

* &quot;Accessories&quot;; numbered A-#
* &quot;Models of Yesteryear&quot;; numbered Y-#, later YY-#
* &quot;Major Packs&quot;; numbered M-#

In addition to these, a series of Gift Sets (numbered G-#) was sold by Lesney, each comprising models from the die-cast ranges (sometimes from different ranges within a single set). The sets were updated/changed regularly for various reasons, but mainly to ensure that the models contained therein were current. Set numbers were often reallocated in the same fashion as for &quot;normal&quot; series. Some sets included model variations officially released only in the sets (generally, these were variant colours), while others contained additional, non-die-cast items not available without the set.

==Model collectibility and value==

Not unlike other &quot;classical&quot; collectible items such as stamps, coins, or real cars, the value and collectibility of model cars such as Matchbox is driven primarily by three factors:
:* Rarity (incl. variations),
:* Condition, and
:* Popularity of the model
with one additional important factor,
:* Packaging

===Rarity and variations===

The rarity of a model can refer either to the model in general, or to a variation thereof.

Some models are produced in very limited quantities. Prior to the evolution of &quot;purpose-made&quot; collectibles (cf. &quot;Matchbox Collectibles&quot;, below) – i.e. models made in intentionally limited quantities to allow a high initial sales price and/or force the value to remain high on the collectors market – rarity was based on the simple criterion that the production numbers of a model were low. This was not generally due to any specific intent by the manufacturer. For example, this could occur if the mold (die) broke, or if the model proved to be unpopular and was replaced very quickly, creating a situation in which &quot;normal&quot; numbers of the model never reached the market.
Variations are changes in production models. The most common three types are changes in the materials used, in the dies, or in the colour scheme. For instance, early Matchbox models were entirely made of metal, including the tyres/wheels. However, within the first few years of production, Lesney switched to plastic wheels. These were silver at first; later, grey wheels were fitted, followed finally by black wheels. Thus it was entirely possible that models introduced in the &#x27;50s could be fitted with four different wheel types during the span of their inclusion in the series – or even more, since there were further variations (e.g. knobby or smooth) besides the colour or material. Depending on the particular model, a given wheel type might be much rarer than the others.

Moulds or dies are changed at times. This is commonly due to weaknesses in the final die-cast product, or to difficulties in production caused by the die. Often, the changes are very minor, even minute, and may occur in places that are not clearly visible at first glance. Especially in cases where e.g. a weakness was detected early in the production run, the numbers of early versions reaching the market are often quite low.

Colour changes – now commonplace, a planned marketing tool – were rarer earlier, with most models being produced over the span of their inclusion in the series in just one or two major colour schemes. However, not only the colour of the model&#x27;s body must be regarded, but rather the entire model— including baseplate, interior, windows – and thus changes in different components can lead to a factorial increase in variation possibilities.

Age also plays an important part in making a model rare. A model produced in standard quantities in the 1950s will likely be much rarer today than one produced in similar quantities the 1980s.

===Condition===

The better the condition of the model, the higher its value. Model conditions are usually expressed in a simple, somewhat subjective manner, in categories such as: mint, excellent, very good, good, fair, poor. Simply put, a &quot;mint&quot; model, i.e. one in factory-fresh condition, is worth far more than a sandbox-quality model with chipped paint, rusty axles, and broken parts. However, to be valuable, the condition must be original; repainting or repairing a model reduces its value greatly, even if the final result can be impressive.

===Packaging===
The presence or lack of packaging affects the value of a model. A &quot;mint boxed&quot; model can in some cases be worth 50-100% more than the mint model without the box, depending on the age of the model, the condition of the box, and even the variations of the box.

As box designs were changed regularly, some boxes or even model/box combinations were produced in lower quantities, and thus became quite difficult to find. As an example, the first seven &quot;1-75&quot; models were packaged in &quot;A Moko Lesney&quot; boxes (cf. above, &quot;History&quot;, Moko) on which the word &quot;Moko&quot; was written in script. Today, these boxes are extremely valuable. Later &#x27;50s boxes – including the 2nd editions of those for model numbers 1 to 7 – had &quot;Moko&quot; in the same capital letters as the words surrounding it.

Even in the era of blister packs, the role of packaging has not really diminished. However, as the &quot;box&quot; concept is tremendously important for the brand Matchbox, the presence of a box usually affects the value of a model significantly more than does a blister pack. The exception to this is blister packs from the box era, particularly those in which the box was also included.

===Popularity===
The popularity of the model affects its value both directly and indirectly. For example, if two models were produced in similar quantities in the &#x27;50s, one an interesting sports car, the other a rather dull military vehicle, then the former probably disappeared from store shelves much faster. Its value, then in non-monetary terms, was higher.

Though the former model may therefore be found relatively ubiquitously in British or American households, often it was either played with (i.e. the condition is poor) or it has a particular &quot;treasure&quot;-like sentimental value (often the case with, for example, horse-drawn models), so that the model will be kept &quot;forever&quot;, even by those who do not collect. Thus it becomes harder to find in good condition on the collectors market, while the less popular model can still be found mint-boxed in large quantities. And as it is likely that the sports car&#x27;s initial popularity remains
unbroken, its value is now also driven upward by this fact as well.

===Cataloguing===
Since the advent of organized Matchbox collectors&#x27; clubs (see below, &quot;Matchbox collectors&quot;), models and their variations have been coded and catalogued, and values have been roughly established. The major collectors&#x27; organizations (NAMC, AIM, Matchbox USA, MICA, MBXForum etc.) as well as individual authors have published numerous works describing the various Matchbox ranges including the models and their variations. Whereas the best of these were formerly available mainly through the clubs themselves, it is now possible to buy books on Matchbox from various publishing houses. These are available not only in English, but in several other languages (particularly German) as well.

As there have been multiple reference catalogues over the years, there is no complete consensus on the coding of a model. However, a standard code might read as such: Y-15 A 6. This would mean the 6th variation of the first (&quot;A&quot;) release of model no. Y-15.

Many books now include a price guide, but there is no real consensus on the actual monetary value of a model. The numbers in any of the publications give relative information, but not more. It remains a collectors market, and, accordingly, prices fluctuate greatly.

==Regional issues and promotionals==

===Regional issues===

By the 1960s, it was clear to Lesney that sales in certain already profitable markets might be increased by providing the markets with models &quot;of their own&quot;. Since the regular series was primarily aimed at the UK and the US, models for the Commonwealth and North America could easily be integrated into it. But early on, Germany established itself as a major market for Matchbox models, not however one large enough to warrant numerous castings of German cars in the line. Certainly, the major internationally known German brands (Volkswagen and Mercedes, as well as Magirus-Deutz) were represented in the range, but in order to cater to that market using the dies at hand, it was decided to develop a model &quot;version&quot; just for Germany. The model chosen was the #25 Bedford Tanker, which, for the German market, was changed from its usual yellow-and-white colours and BP livery to a blue and white model with Aral decals. This first regional issue was followed by a second, when the Bedford was retired from the series and replaced, effectively, by the #32 Leyland Tanker. This model, too, was produced in a blue and white Aral version for Germany.

This proved to be a successful strategy, which was then expanded in the late 1970s and the 1980s. At first, it was again Germany for which models were produced, as many as 6 at a time (Polizei cars were developed, trucks offered with German logos, etc.), some even in specially constructed boxes. Later, the idea was expanded to larger models (&quot;Yesteryears&quot; such as the previously mentioned Y12 Ford Model T Van, or numerous &quot;Super Kings&quot; models), and to other countries (Australia, Denmark, etc.), even including regional issues for the UK or the US.

For a short period in the 1970s to 1980s, Lesney also produced or licensed Matchbox production in other countries. Having started by developing several model variants in England specifically for the Japanese market, they later produced four Superfast models in Japan, based on Japanese prototypes. Dies and tooling were later also licensed to groups in Hungary and Bulgaria (Mikro&#x27;67), in an attempt to gain a foothold in the Communist bloc countries. Although only standard models were produced there, there were numerous colour variations, some of which are very rare today.

Beginning in the Matchbox International era, it was decided that the line should be regionalised more generally, which led to multiple versions of the &quot;1-75&quot; series being available; depending on where in the world the customer was, almost the entire range might be different from in the rest of the world. Although this philosophy is still followed today to some extent, it has been largely scaled back. Usually, there are ranges for the US and the rest of the world, with some &quot;local&quot; mini-series still being offered in certain countries (e.g. an annual 12-car release in Germany called &quot;Stars of Cars&quot;, or a similar set of models in the UK called &quot;Best of British&quot;).
===Promotionals===
Almost from the beginning of the Matchbox series, commerce recognized the possibilities offered by providing a model of a &quot;relevant&quot; vehicle to their customers as a method of advertising. In the mid-1950s, for example, it was not rare for dairy companies to provide the Matchbox #7 Horse-Drawn Milk Float to customers as a token of appreciation for their business.

The first issue to be purposely made for a particular customer is the now famous &quot;Beales Bealesons&quot; #46 Guy &quot;Pickfords&quot; Removal Van. The promotional issue, made for a shop in southern England, differed drastically in colours, decals and box from the standard model (in Pickfords livery). Besides fulfilling its original purpose, it also became highly sought after by collectors.

A few further models were made in the late 1960s or early 1970s, amongst them several bus models and the famous &quot;NAMC&quot; promotional version of the #32 Leyland Tanker (the first model made exclusively for collectors; see below, &quot;Matchbox collectors&quot;). However, the major shift in the number and value of promotionals began with the use of London Bus models in the 1970s, particularly the Superfast #17 Londoner Bus. With this model, what had been a trickle turned into a flood, as it was used by countless companies as advertising material for their business customers. The success of this concept—and its value to the Matchbox brand—was huge, leading to a rapid expansion of the idea, both in the numbers of models used (and the introduction of models offering good &quot;advertising space&quot;, such as the #38 Ford Model A Van, into the series), and, again, in the size of the models (&quot;Yesteryears&quot;, and often &quot;Super Kings&quot; as well).

Eventually, almost any model could be and indeed was used for promotional purposes. Some companies only allow extremely limited numbers of their models to be made (e.g. the K-16 Quaker State model), while others have them produced in large quantities to serve as on-pack offers, for example, or even put them on general but limited release, such as the set of models commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Ford Motor Company. As one of the most difficult aspects of collecting, promotionals&#x27; values can skyrocket within months of their being issued. Today, promotionals remain an important part of Matchbox&#x27;s business.

As mentioned above (cf. &quot;History&quot;, expansion in the Superfast era), the popularity of both regional issues and promotionals were recognized by the company and played a role in the development of models designed not specifically as toys, but with the collector in mind. The realisation of the market potential of catering to collectors led to a major shift in the entire die-cast industry, as other brands followed while Matchbox continued to refine the idea into what later became Matchbox Collectables (q.v.).

==Matchbox Collectibles==
Starting in the Universal era and continuing until after Mattel purchased the brand, a growing awareness of the adult collector led to multiple series being produced specifically for that market. The idea was not new; in the 1960s, Lesney had first realized the potential for adult buyers of its products and had marketed gold and silver-plated versions of its &quot;Yesteryear&quot; series mounted on pen stands, ashtrays, and similar items. Also (as mentioned above, cf. &quot;History&quot;), in the 1970s and particularly the 1980s, contact by the company to collectors and sponsors led to the release of a small number of highly collectible models designed for a limited, but more profitable market base. Most often, these models were &quot;Yesteryears&quot;, though the &quot;1-75&quot; series was also used for this purpose.

Matchbox introduced the &quot;Matchbox Collectibles&quot; name to designate purpose-made collectible items. Initially, the Matchbox Collectibles range revolved mainly around &quot;1-75&quot; or &quot;Convoy&quot; models, usually produced with a high level of tampo or mask-spray detailing and with rubber tyres and &quot;chrome&quot; wheels. The models were manufactured in limited quantities and sold at better-stocked retail stores as &quot;Premiere Collectibles&quot;, &quot;World Class&quot;, &quot;First Editions&quot;, &quot;Barrett-Jackson&quot;, etc., for a premium price. This concept of making intentionally collectible versions of toy cars was widely copied by the competition, including Hot Wheels and Johnny Lightning. Later, the &quot;Models of Yesteryear&quot;, &quot;Dinky&quot; and &quot;Convoy&quot; series were used as a basis for creating themed collectable &quot;mini-series&quot; of models, while the &quot;Super Kings&quot; range often yielded large-scale truck &quot;specials&quot;, all of which were generally offered only by mail order. At that time, Matchbox Collectibles Inc. essentially became a semi-independent sub-unit of Matchbox International Ltd. The idea was quite successful, leading to the creation of many new, high-quality castings over a relatively short time span. Tie-ins with major brands (Texaco, Campbell&#x27;s Soup, Coca-Cola, Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate, Jack Daniel&#x27;s, etc.) increased the attractiveness of the range. However, to finance the new castings, prices continually increased, while castings were re-used for multiple purposes, sometimes rather far from realistic.

Although the main scales tended to hover around 1:43 (1:50 or 1:100 for truck models), eventually there were even 1:24 automobiles. Airplanes and tanks (in appropriate scales) made their returns as well. However, the timing of these latter series was almost as poor as in the 1970s, as about 3 years after Mattel bought the Matchbox brand, development of the Collectibles range was effectively halted, and Matchbox Collectibles Inc. was mothballed. Some models continue to be marketed via major retailers such as Target in the US.

== Film adaptation ==
A live-action film adaptation produced by Mattel Films was announced in January 2022. Later that year, Skydance Media joined in making the film with Mattel Films. On May 7, 2024, Mattel and Skydance hired Sam Hargrave to direct. On September 17, 2024, it was announced that John Cena has been cast as the lead and the film is set to be released on Apple TV+. In November, Jessica Biel was attached to star in the film. In the following month, Sam Richardson, Arturo Castro, Teyonah Parris and Danai Gurira were added to the cast.

==Matchbox collectors==

As with any other item dealing with transport, sport or similar themes, it did not take long before Matchbox models became collectable items, with rabid followings, collectors&#x27; meets, etc. The Fred Bronner Corp., American importer of Lesney toys, took a first step towards organising this movement to a small extent by creating the &quot;Matchbox Collectors Club&quot;, which produced a polished, quarterly, 4 to 6 page newsletter for a small membership fee, starting in the late 1960s. The MCC was primarily aimed at younger collectors.

In the 1970s, adult collectors began to form semi-official clubs to discuss collecting at a higher level of sophistication. Variations were discussed and catalogued, swap meets organized, and new journals or bulletins began to appear, written by and for the serious collector. Not unlike stamps or coins, prices for older and/or more collectable models began to spiral upwards in a trend that continues. Collecting is, however, not limited to the models themselves. Anything related to Matchbox ― catalogues, dealer display cases, promotional literature, etc. ― is also collected. In the US, two competing clubs were both established in Massachusetts (NAMC, the National Association of Matchbox Collectors, run by Bob Brennan, and AIM, the American-International Matchbox club, run by Harold Colpitts). These clubs were the central force of Matchbox collecting in US during the 1970s and 1980s (though both have since ceased to exist), and from them, further spin-offs were formed, including UK Matchbox (run by Ray Bush), MICA (Matchbox International Collectors Association) and Matchbox USA (run by Charlie Mack), the latter of which are still in operation. Charlies Mack, as well as others, have also published books for collectors showing models, their variations and giving value/price guidance. The Route 66 Die cast collectors gathering of friends is also in existence, and happens annually in July and is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This is the only existing die cast show to feature the Matchbox Team making an appearance, and having exclusive models made just for the advent.

Dinky collecting is centred around the UK and France, Corgi collecting in the UK, and Hot Wheels collecting in North America. Only Matchbox collecting is popular in the UK, Commonwealth countries and in North America.

Like many high value collectable items Matchbox models are now prone to faking. Rare variations can be quite easily made up using genuine parts, and then sold as a &quot;rare&quot; variation.

==Sky Busters series==

Matchbox Sky Busters is a range of die-cast model aircraft produced under the Matchbox brand, initially by Lesney Products and later by Mattel.

The earlier Sky Busters were produced in 1973 from London, England. During the 1970s, Skybusters competed against Dyna-Flytes, produced by San Diego–based Zee Toys and the Ertl Company distributed-Hong Kong manufactured Lintoy.

Skybusters combined military and commercial aircraft models at their earlier stage. The United States Air Force, Air France, Federal Express, Lufthansa and QX Express were among the first brands to advertise with Skybusters. Some of the first Skybusters released were Learjet, Airbus A300, Boeing 747 and Corsair AD7 airplanes.

In 1976, the Skybusters line returned, at a time when the die cast airplanes market was largely dominated by Dyna-Flytes. The brand kept coming on and off the market until the 2000s, when Mattel decided to release the models each year. Currently no airlines are under contract with Matchbox to produce Skybusters models. The most recent ones are American Airlines, UPS, British Airways, Alaska Airlines, Lufthansa and DHL. (Delta Air Lines and United Airlines did not have a contract with Matchbox since the takeover of Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, respectively), but jetliners are released under fictional airline names, such as Matchbox Airlines (also called MBX Airways).

In 2012, Matchbox Skybusters released a replica of The Bat, an aircraft from the film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.

In 2024, Matchbox announced a partnership with SpaceX to produce models of that company&#x27;s aircraft.

<doc id="143468" wikidata="Q81949" url="?curid=143468" title="Province of Barcelona">
<text>Barcelona (; ) is a province of eastern Spain, in the center of the autonomous community of Catalonia. The province is bordered by the provinces of Tarragona, Lleida, and Girona, and by the Mediterranean Sea. Its area is . A total of 5,743,402 people live in the province, of whom about 29% (1,664,182) live within the administrative limits of the city of Barcelona, which itself is contained in the Barcelona metropolitan area.

== Divisions ==

The capital of the province is the city of Barcelona, and the provincial council is based in the Casa Serra on the Rambla de Catalunya in that city. Some other cities and towns in Barcelona province include L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat, Badalona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Martorell, Mataró, Granollers, Sabadell, Terrassa, Sitges, Igualada, Vic, Manresa, and Berga.

Since the division by provinces in Spain and the division by &quot;comarques&quot; in Catalonia do not completely agree, the term &quot;comarques of the province of Barcelona&quot; would not be entirely correct. However, a list of the &quot;comarques&quot; that are included—totally or partially—in the province of Barcelona can be made:

*Fully included:
**Alt Penedès
**Anoia
**Bages
**Baix Llobregat
**Barcelonès
**Garraf
**Maresme
**Moianès
**Vallès Occidental
**Vallès Oriental
*Partially included:
**Berguedà (all municipalities except Gósol)
**Osona (all municipalities except Espinelves, Vidrà and Viladrau)
**Selva (only the municipality of Fogars de la Selva)

== Geography ==
The Catalan Pre-Coastal Range and Catalan Coastal Range mountains run through the Province of Barcelona. There are several notable smaller mountain ranges that are located in the province, including Montseny Massif, Serra de Collserola, and Tibidabo. Pedraforca is the tallest mountain in the province, located on the north side as part of the Pre-Pyrenees. Tibidabo is the mountain that overlooks the city of Barcelona.

The majority of the Province of Barcelona has a Mediterranean climate on the coast and an oceanic climate inland.

<doc id="143471" wikidata="Q183319" url="?curid=143471" title="Tuber">
<text>Tubers are a type of enlarged structure that plants use as storage organs for nutrients, derived from stems or roots. Tubers help plants perennate (survive winter or dry months), provide energy and nutrients, and are a means of asexual reproduction.

Stem tubers manifest as thickened rhizomes (underground stems) or stolons (horizontal connections between organisms); examples include the potato and yam. The term root tuber describes modified lateral roots, as in sweet potatoes, cassava, and dahlias.

==Terminology==
The term originates from the Latin , meaning &#x27;lump, bump, or swelling&#x27;.

Some writers limit the definition of &quot;tuber&quot; to structures derived from stems, while others also apply the term to structures derived from roots.
== Stem tubers ==
A stem tuber forms from thickened rhizomes or stolons. The top sides of the tuber produce shoots that grow into typical stems and leaves and the undersides produce roots. They tend to form at the sides of the parent plant and are most often located near the soil surface. The underground tuber is normally a short-lived storage and regenerative organ developing from a shoot that branches off a mature plant. The offspring or new tubers are attached to a parent tuber or form at the end of a hypogeogenous (initiated below ground) rhizome. In the autumn the plant dies, except for the new offspring tubers, which have one dominant bud that in spring regrows a new shoot producing stems and leaves; in summer the tubers decay and new tubers begin to grow. Some plants also form smaller tubers or tubercules that act like seeds, producing small plants that resemble (in morphology and size) seedlings. Some stem tubers are long-lived, such as those of tuberous begonias, but many plants have tubers that survive only until the plants have fully leafed out, at which point the tuber is reduced to a shriveled-up husk.

Stem tubers generally start off as enlargements of the hypocotyl section of a seedling, but sometimes also include the first node or two of the epicotyl and the upper section of the root. The tuber has a vertical orientation, with one or a few vegetative buds on the top and fibrous roots produced on the bottom from a basal section. Typically the tuber has an oblong rounded shape.

Tuberous begonias, yams, and cyclamens are commonly grown stem tubers. Mignonette vine (&quot;Anredera cordifolia&quot;) produces aerial stem tubers on vines; the tubers fall to the ground and grow. &quot;Plectranthus esculentus&quot;, of the mint family Lamiaceae, produces tuberous underground organs from the base of the stem, weighing up to per tuber, forming from axillary buds producing short stolons that grow into tubers. Even though legumes are not commonly associated with forming stem tubers, &quot;Lathyrus tuberosus&quot; is an example native to Asia and Europe, where it was once grown as a crop.

===Potatoes===

Potatoes are stem tubersenlarged stolons thicken to develop into storage organs. The tuber has all the parts of a normal stem, including nodes and internodes. The nodes are the eyes and each has a leaf scar. The nodes or eyes are arranged around the tuber in a spiral fashion beginning on the end opposite the attachment point to the stolon. The terminal bud is produced at the farthest point away from the stolon attachment and tubers, and thus show the same apical dominance as a normal stem. Internally, a tuber is filled with starch stored in enlarged parenchyma-like cells. The inside of a tuber has the typical cell structures of any stem, including a pith, vascular zones, and a cortex.

The tuber is produced in one growing season and used to perennate the plant and as a means of propagation. When fall comes, the above-ground structure of the plant dies, but the tubers survive underground over winter until spring, when they regenerate new shoots that use the stored food in the tuber to grow. As the main shoot develops from the tuber, the base of the shoot close to the tuber produces adventitious roots and lateral buds on the shoot. The shoot also produces stolons that are long etiolated stems. The stolon elongates during long days with the presence of high auxins levels that prevent root growth off of the stolon. Before new tuber formation begins, the stolon must be a certain age. The enzyme lipoxygenase makes a hormone, jasmonic acid, which is involved in the control of potato tuber development.

The stolons are easily recognized when potato plants are grown from seeds. As the plants grow, stolons are produced around the soil surface from the nodes. The tubers form close to the soil surface and sometimes even on top of the ground. When potatoes are cultivated, the tubers are cut into pieces and planted much deeper into the soil. Planting the pieces deeper creates more area for the plants to generate the tubers and their size increases. The pieces sprout shoots that grow to the surface. These shoots are rhizome-like and generate short stolons from the nodes while in the ground. When the shoots reach the soil surface, they produce roots and shoots that grow into the green plant.
== Root tubers ==

A root tuber, tuberous root or storage root is a modified lateral root, enlarged to function as a storage organ. The enlarged area of the tuber can be produced at the end or middle of a root or involve the entire root. It is thus different in origin, but similar in function and appearance, to a stem tuber. Plants with tuberous roots include the sweet potato (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;), cassava, dahlia, and &quot;Sagittaria&quot; (arrowhead) species.

Root tubers are perennating organs, thickened roots that store nutrients over periods when the plant cannot actively grow, thus permitting survival from one year to the next. The massive enlargement of secondary roots typically represented by sweet potato have the internal and external cell and tissue structures of a normal root; they produce adventitious roots and stems, which again produce adventitious roots.

In root tubers, there are no nodes and internodes or reduced leaves. The proximal end of the tuber, which was attached to the old plant, has crown tissue that produces buds which grow into new stems and foliage. The distal end of the tuber normally produces unmodified roots. In stem tubers the order is reversed, with the distal end producing stems. Tuberous roots are biennial in duration: the plant produces tubers the first year, and at the end of the growing season, the shoots often die, leaving the newly generated tubers; the next growing season, the tubers produce new shoots. As the shoots of the new plant grow, the stored reserves of the tuber are consumed in the production of new roots, stems, and reproductive organs; any remaining root tissue dies concurrently to the plant&#x27;s regeneration of the next generation of tubers.

&quot;Hemerocallis fulva&quot; (orange daylily) and a number of daylily hybrids have large root tubers; &quot;H. fulva&quot; spreads by underground stolons that end with a new fan that grows roots that produce thick tubers and then send out more stolons.

Plants with root tubers can be propagated from late summer to late winter by digging up the tubers and separating them, making sure that each piece has some crown tissue for replanting.

Root tubers are a rich source of nutrients for humans and wild animals, e.g. those of &quot;Sagittaria&quot; plants which are eaten by ducks.

<text>Windows Notepad is a simple text editor for Windows; it creates and edits plain text documents. It was first released in 1983 to commercialize the computer mouse in MS-DOS.

== History ==
In May 1983, at the COMDEX computer expo in Atlanta, Microsoft introduced the Multi-Tool Notepad, a mouse-based text editor Richard Brodie had created as a stripped down version of Multi-Tool Word. Notepad had the ability to bold, underline or italicise text removed. All these programs were to support the release of the $195 Microsoft Mouse, with the mouse coming with Notepad or Word, sometimes both, depending on the date. Most visitors had never heard of a computer mouse before. The mouse began shipping in July. Initial sales were modest because it had no use other than running the programs included in the box (a tutorial, a Doodle drawing app, a musical piano app, Multi-Tool Notepad and/or Multi-tool Word.)

The Multi-Tool product line began with expert systems for the Multiplan spreadsheet. On the suggestion of Rowland Hanson, Microsoft dropped the Multi-Tool brand name. Hanson&#x27;s rationale was that &quot;the brand is the hero&quot; and people wouldn&#x27;t automatically associate &quot;Multi-Tool&quot; with Microsoft. As a result, the Multi-Tool Notepad and the Multi-Tool Word became Windows Notepad and Microsoft Word, respectively. (Hanson also convinced Bill Gates to rename &quot;Interface Manager&quot; to &quot;Windows&quot; before the release of Windows 1.0.)

Since then, Notepad has been part of Microsoft Windows.

=== Change in development model ===
Since the introduction of Microsoft Store in 2012, Microsoft has converted some of the built-in Windows apps into Microsoft Store apps (e.g., Sticky Notes), so that they could be updated independent of Windows releases. Within three years, Notepad has appeared on Microsoft Store thrice. The first time was in August 2019; it vanished shortly thereafter. This version required Windows 10 preview build 18963. During this short-lived presence on the Store, technology news blogs speculated that Microsoft intended to de-couple Notepad&#x27;s life-cycle from that of Windows 10 and update it more frequently through Microsoft Store. Notepad appeared on Microsoft Store for a second time in April 2020, this time, sporting a new logo. It runs on the preview versions of Windows 10, build number 19541 or later.

On 16 February 2022, Microsoft started rolling out a new and redesigned version of Notepad to all Windows 11 users. This version had Dark Mode added and a new Find and Replace flyout with the same functionality. Notepad is now available in the Microsoft Store in both Windows 10 and 11.

On March 21, 2024, Microsoft announced that it is adding spellcheck and autocorrect to Notepad for Windows 11.

On November 6, 2024, Microsoft announced that rewriting tools powered by LLMs will be added to Notepad. Users will be able to rewrite selected text, adjust its length and modify its tone and format, similar to Grammarly&#x27;s AI writing features.

The new features are available to Windows Insider members in the Canary and Dev Channels and will be available to all Windows 11 users at a later time.

== Features ==
Notepad is a text editor, i.e., an app specialized in editing plain text. It can edit text files (bearing the &quot;.txt&quot; filename extension) and compatible formats, such as batch files, INI files, and log files.

Notepad offers only the most basic text manipulation functions, such as finding and replacing text. Until Windows ME, there were almost no keyboard shortcuts and no line-counting feature. Starting with Windows 2000, shortcuts for common commands like &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, and &quot;Save&quot; were added, as well as a status bar with a line counter (available only when word-wrap is disabled). Before Windows 10 version 1809, Notepad could not properly interpret either Unix-style or Mac-style newline characters. Windows 10 version 1809 also introduced the keyboard shortcut (deletes the previous word), zoom functionality, the ability to zoom in and out, and the &quot;Search with Bing&quot; function.

Improving performance has been the main focus of Notepad&#x27;s development. As part of this effort, Notepad is capable of reading text files even when other apps have acquired a range-based lock on the file.

On Windows 95 and earlier, Notepad renders text files in the Fixedsys font. Starting with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98, it allows users to choose their own font to display the text. They cannot, however, select individual parts of the text and change their fonts. Its default font changed to Lucida Console on Windows 2000, and Consolas on Windows 8.

Notepad can print files. It allows customizing headers, footers, and margins before printing. The date, file name, and other information can be placed in the headers and footers with various codes consisting of an ampersand (&#x27;&amp;&#x27;) followed by a letter.

Notepad accepts text from the Windows clipboard, but only in the CF_TEXT format. It strips the pasted text of any embedded font and style information. One could temporarily paste formatted text into Notepad, then immediately copy it again to obtain the raw text.

Notepad has a simple logging function. Each time it opens a file with &quot;.LOG&quot; on its first line, the app inserts a timestamp on the file&#x27;s last line.

===Encoding support===
Notepad supports the following character encodings:
*&quot;ANSI&quot; (the locale-dependent codepage)
*Unicode, encoded as:
**UCS-2 (Windows NT 3.5 to 2000)
**UTF-16 (Windows 2000 or later), both little- and big-endian
**UTF-8 (Windows 2000 or later)
***Before Windows 10, Notepad always inserted a byte order mark character at the start of the file. Since Windows 10, the BOM has been optional.
Starting with Windows 10 1809 Insider build, it supports Unix-style (LF) and Classic Mac OS -style (CR) line endings, along with the native DOS/Windows CRLF style. Before this, only CRLF line endings were recognized.

Opening and editing in left-to-right and right-to-left based languages are done via RichEdit controls and input method editors, available in versions for Windows XP or later.

== Limitations ==
Notepad used a built-in window class named &quot;EDIT&quot;. The maximum file size Notepad can open depends on operating system limitations on the size of the &quot;EDIT&quot; window class, with a different limit in each version of Windows. Because of this limitation, on Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, and Windows 3.11, Notepad could not open files larger than 54 KB. (Microsoft recommended using another text editor for opening files larger than 45 KB.) This limit was extended to 64 KB in Windows 95, with users now directed to WordPad for larger files. On Windows XP, Notepad was limited to 32 MB and declined to open bigger files. On Windows 11, Notepad uses the RichEdit control. The size limit was raised to about 1 GB, and attempting to open any file larger than that shows a dialog box suggesting that the user open it with a different text editor.

===Unicode detection===

On the Windows NT family of operating systems (including Windows 2000 and Windows XP), Notepad can detect Unicode files even when they lack a byte order mark. To do this, it calls the codice_1 function of the Windows API. Until Windows Vista, this function was imperfect, incorrectly identifying some all-lowercase ASCII text as UTF-16. As a result, Notepad interpreted a file containing a phrase like &quot;aaaa aaa aaa aaaaa&quot; (&quot;4-3-3-5&quot;) as a two-byte-encoded Unicode text file. If a font with support for Chinese was installed, nine Chinese characters (桴獩愠灰挠湡戠敲歡) would display. Otherwise, it would display square substitute characters instead of Chinese characters. This issue was resolved on Windows Vista and newer.

== Competing software ==

Notepad lacks many basic features available in other text editors, such as block selection and MDI. There are many third-party replacements for Notepad with additional functionality, such as AkelPad, Metapad, Notepad++, Notepad2, and TED Notepad, which include features such as:

* undo history
* syntax coloring 
* code folding
* regular expressions
* macros
* manual code page selection
* themes
* sorting 
* case changes
* external change detection
* matching braces
* visible line-endings and visible line-wrap indication
* line numbering, splitting and joining
* automatic indentation
* mass-editing of lines
* blank line removal
* hard alignment (using whitespace characters)
* whitespace stripping
* running in portable mode
* and other advanced text-processing features.

<text>Paramahansa Yogananda (born Mukunda Lal Ghosh; January 5, 1893March 7, 1952) was an Indian and American Hindu monk, yogi and guru who introduced millions to meditation and Kriya Yoga through his organization, Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) / Yogoda Satsanga Society (YSS) of India—the only one he created to disseminate his teachings. A chief disciple of the yoga guru Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, he was sent by his lineage to spread the teachings of yoga to the West. He immigrated to the US at the age of 27 to demonstrate the unity between Eastern and Western religions and to advocate for a balance between Western material growth and Indian spirituality. His longstanding influence in the American yoga movement, and especially the yoga culture of Los Angeles, led yoga experts to consider him as the &quot;Father of Yoga in the West&quot;. He lived his last 32 years in the US.

Yogananda was among the first Indian teachers to settle in the US, and the first prominent Indian to be hosted in the White House (by President Calvin Coolidge in 1927); his early acclaim led to him being dubbed &quot;the 20th century&#x27;s first superstar guru&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Arriving in Boston in 1920, he embarked on a successful transcontinental speaking tour before settling in Los Angeles in 1925. For the next two and a half decades, he gained local fame and expanded his influence worldwide: he created a monastic order and trained disciples, went on teaching tours, bought properties for his organization in various California locales, and initiated thousands into Kriya Yoga. By 1952, SRF had over 100 centers in both India and the United States. , they had groups in nearly every major American city. His &quot;plain living and high thinking&quot; principles attracted people from all backgrounds among his followers.

He published his &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; in 1946 to critical and commercial acclaim. It has sold over four million copies, with Harper San Francisco listing it as one of the &quot;100 best spiritual books of the 20th Century&quot;. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered 500 copies of the book, for each guest at his memorial to be given a copy. It was also one of Elvis Presley&#x27;s favorite books, and one he gave out often. The book has been regularly reprinted and is known as &quot;the book that changed the lives of millions&quot;. A documentary about his life commissioned by SRF, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2014. He remains a leading figure in Western spirituality. A biographer of Yogananda, Phillip Goldberg, considers him &quot;the best known and most beloved of all Indian spiritual teachers who have come to the West&quot;.

==Biography==

===Youth and discipleship===

Yogananda was born Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India to a Hindu Bengali Kayastha family. He was the fourth of the eight children, and second of the four sons, of Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, the vice president of Bengal-Nagpur Railway, and Gyanprabha Devi. According to his younger brother Sananda, Mukunda&#x27;s awareness and experience of the spiritual were far beyond the ordinary even from his earliest years. The nature of his father&#x27;s job caused the family to move several times during Mukunda&#x27;s childhood, including to Lahore, Bareilly, and Kolkata. According to &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, he was eleven years old when his mother died, just before the marriage of his eldest brother Ananta; she left behind a sacred amulet for Mukunda, given to her by a holy man, who told her that Mukunda was to possess it for some years, after which it would vanish into the ether from which it came. Throughout his childhood, his father would fund train passes for his many sight-seeing trips to distant cities and pilgrimage spots, which he would often take with friends. In his youth he sought out many of India&#x27;s Hindu sages and saints, including the Soham &quot;Tiger&quot; Swami, Gandha Baba, and Mahendranath Gupta, hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest.

After finishing high school, Mukunda formally left home and joined a Mahamandal Hermitage in Varanasi; however, he soon became dissatisfied with its insistence on organizational work instead of meditation and God-perception. He began praying for guidance; in 1910, his seeking after various teachers mostly ended when, at the age of 17, he met his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri; at that time his well-guarded amulet mysteriously vanished, having served its spiritual purpose. In his autobiography, he describes his first meeting with Sri Yukteswar as a rekindling of a relationship that had lasted for many lifetimes:

&quot;We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight I sensed that my guru knew God, and would lead me to Him. The obscuration of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories. Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are its cycling scenes. This was not the first sun to find me at these holy feet!&quot;

He would go on to train under Sri Yukteswar as his disciple for the next ten years (1910–1920) at his hermitages in Serampore and Puri. Later on Sri Yukteswar informed Mukunda that he had been sent to him by the great guru of their lineage, Mahavatar Babaji, for a special world purpose of yoga dissemination.

After passing his Intermediate Examination in Arts from the Scottish Church College, Calcutta, in 1915, he graduated with a degree similar to a current-day Bachelor of Arts or B.A. (at the time referred to as an A.B.) from Serampore College, the college having two entities, one as a constituent college of the Senate of Serampore College (University) and the other as an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. This allowed him to spend time at Yukteswar&#x27;s ashram in Serampore.

In July 1915, several weeks after graduating from college, he took formal vows into the monastic Swami order; Sri Yukteswar allowed him to choose his own name: Swami Yogananda Giri. In 1917, Yogananda founded a school for boys in Dihika, West Bengal that combined modern educational techniques with yoga training and spiritual ideals. A year later, the school relocated to Ranchi. One of the school&#x27;s first group of pupils was his youngest brother, Bishnu Charan Ghosh. This school would later become the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, the Indian branch of Yogananda&#x27;s American organization, Self-Realization Fellowship.

===Teaching in America===
In his autobiography, Yogananda writes that he received a vision one day in 1920 while meditating at his Ranchi school: faces of a multitude of Americans passed before his mind&#x27;s eye, intimating to him that he would soon go to America. After giving charge of the school over to its faculty (and eventually to his childhood friend Swami Satyananda), he left for Calcutta. On the following day, he received an invitation from the American Unitarian Association to serve as India&#x27;s delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening that year in Boston. Yogananda sought his guru&#x27;s advice, and Sri Yukteswar advised him to go. According to Philip Goldberg, Yogananda shared the following account in his &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. While in deep prayer in his room, he received a surprise visit from Mahavatar Babaji, the foremost guru of his lineage, who told him directly that he was the one chosen to spread Kriya Yoga to the West. Reassured and uplifted, Yogananda soon afterwards accepted the offer to go to Boston. This account became a standard feature of his lectures.

In August 1920, he left for the United States aboard the ship &quot;The City of Sparta&quot; on a two-month voyage that landed near Boston by late September. He spoke at the International Congress in early October and was well received; later that year he founded Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) to disseminate worldwide his teachings on India&#x27;s ancient practices and philosophy of Yoga and its tradition of meditation. Yogananda spent the next four years in Boston; in the interim, he lectured and taught on the East Coast and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Thousands came to his lectures. During this time he attracted a number of celebrity followers, including soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, tenor Vladimir Rosing and Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch, the daughter of Mark Twain. In 1925, he established an international center for Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles, California, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of his growing work. Yogananda was the first Hindu teacher of yoga to spend a major portion of his life in America. He lived in the United States from 1920 to 1952, interrupted by an extended trip abroad in 1935–1936, and through his disciples he developed various temples and meditation centers around the world.

Yogananda was put on a government watch list and kept under surveillance by the FBI and the British authorities, who were concerned about the growing independence movement in India. A confidential file was kept on him from 1926 to 1937 due to concern over his religious and moral practices. Philip Goldberg&#x27;s biography describes Yogananda as being up against a perfect storm of America&#x27;s worst defects: media sensationalism, religious bigotry, ethnic stereotyping, paternalism, sexual anxiety, and brazen racism.

In 1928, Yogananda received unfavorable publicity in Miami, and the police chief, Leslie Quigg, prohibited Yogananda from holding any further events. Quiggs said it was not due to a personal grudge against the Swami but rather in the interest of public order and Yogananda&#x27;s own safety. Quigg had received veiled threats against Yogananda. According to Phil Goldberg:It turns out that Miami officials had summoned the British vice consulate to advise them on the matter ... One consulate officer said that the Miami city manager and Chief Quigg &quot;recognized the fact that the swami was a British subject and apparently an educated man, but unfortunately he was what is considered in this part of the country a coloured man.&quot; Given the South&#x27;s cultural mores, he noted, &quot;the swami was in great danger of suffering bodily harm from the populace.&quot;

In 1929, Yogananda was sued by his long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in America. Bagchi claimed that they had a business partnership and that Yogananda owed him wages and royalties. The lawsuit was eventually settled, but some of Yogananda&#x27;s students chose to instead follow Bagchi, who shed his monastic name and became a married academic.

In the late 1920s, a disciple of Yogananda&#x27;s named Adelaide Erskine served as his photographer. Her descendants would later accuse Yogananda of having an illicit affair with Adelaide and fathering one of her children, Ben Erskine, even though Ben admitted that she never told him who his father was. In 1995 Ben Erskine&#x27;s daughter took it a step further and gave SRF paternity claims along with financial demands. In 2002, SRF hired a former San Diego prosecutor, G. Michael Still, to compare the DNA from Yogananda&#x27;s three male relatives in India to Erskine&#x27;s DNA. The lab work was done in two separate labs, one in Missouri and one in Louisiana. The results from both labs showed no biological connection between Yogananda and Erskine, settling the claim. According to Watanabe of the Los Angeles Times, G. Michael Still said &quot;the results would prevent Erskine from claiming standing in court to seek any inheritance, copyright assets or the disinterment of the guru&#x27;s body.&quot;

===Visit to India, 1935–1936===
In 1935, he returned to India via ocean liner, along with two of his Western students, to visit his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri, and to help establish his Yogoda Satsanga work in India. While enroute, his ship detoured in Europe and the Middle East; he undertook visits to other living Western saints like Therese Neumann, the Catholic Stigmatist of Konnersreuth, and places of spiritual significance: Assisi, Italy to honor St. Francis, the Athenian temples of Greece and prison cell of Socrates, the Holy Land of Palestine and the regions of the Ministry of Jesus, and Cairo, Egypt to view the ancient Pyramids.

In August 1935, he arrived in India at the port of Mumbai; due to his fame in America, many photographers and journalists came to meet him during his short stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Upon taking a train eastward and reaching the Howrah Station near Kolkata, he was received by a huge crowd and a ceremonious procession led by his brother Bishnu Charan Ghosh and the Maharaja of Kasimbazar. Visiting Serampore, he had an emotional reunion with his guru, Sri Yukteswar – this meeting was noted in detail by his Western student C. Richard Wright. During his stay in India, he saw his Ranchi boys&#x27; school become legally incorporated, and took a touring group to visit various locales: the Taj Mahal in Agra, the Chamundeshwari Temple in Mysore, Allahabad for the Kumbh Mela of January 1936, and Brindaban to visit an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Keshabananda.

He also met various people who caught his interest: Mahatma Gandhi, whom he initiated into Kriya Yoga; woman-saint Anandamoyi Ma; Giri Bala, an elderly yogi woman who survived without eating; renowned physicist Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman; and several disciples of Sri Yukteswar&#x27;s guru, Lahiri Mahasaya. While in India, Sri Yukteswar gave Yogananda the monastic title of &quot;Paramahansa,&quot; meaning &quot;supreme swan&quot; and indicating the highest spiritual attainment. This title formally superseded his previous title of &quot;swami&quot;. In March 1936, upon Yogananda&#x27;s return to Calcutta after visiting Brindaban, Sri Yukteswar died (or, in the yogic tradition, attained mahasamadhi) at his hermitage in Puri. After conducting his guru&#x27;s funeral rites, Yogananda continued to teach, conduct interviews, and meet with friends for several months, before planning to return to the US in mid-1936.

According to his autobiography, in June 1936, after having a vision of Krishna, he had a supernatural encounter with the resurrected form of his guru, Sri Yukteswar, while in a room at the Regent Hotel in Mumbai. During the experience, in which Yogananda physically grasped and held onto his guru&#x27;s solid form, Sri Yukteswar explained that he now served as a spiritual guide on a high-astral planet, and expounded truths in deep detail regarding: the astral realm, astral planets and the afterlife; the lifestyles, abilities and varying levels of freedoms of astral beings; the workings of karma; man&#x27;s various superphysical bodies and how he works through them, and other metaphysical topics.

Yogananda and his two western students left India via ocean liner from Mumbai; staying for several weeks in England, they conducted several yoga classes in London and visited historical sites, before leaving for the US in October 1936.

===Return to America, 1936===
In late 1936, Yogananda&#x27;s ship arrived in New York harbor, passing the Statue of Liberty; he and his companions then drove in his Ford car across the continental US back to his Mount Washington, California, headquarters. Rejoined with his American disciples, he continued to lecture, write, and establish centers in southern California. He took up residence at the SRF hermitage in Encinitas, California, which was a surprise gift from his advanced disciple Rajarsi Janakananda. It was at this hermitage that Yogananda wrote his famous &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; and other writings. At this time, he created an &quot;enduring foundation for the spiritual and humanitarian work of Self‑Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.&quot;

In 1946, Yogananda took advantage of a change in immigration laws and applied for citizenship. His application was approved in 1949, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.

The last four years of his life were spent primarily in seclusion with some of his inner circle of disciples at his desert retreat in Twentynine Palms, California, to finish his writings and to finish revising books, articles and lessons written previously over the years. During this period he gave few interviews and public lectures. He told his close disciples, &quot;I can do much more now to reach others with my pen.&quot;

===Death===
Yogananda began hinting to his disciples that it was time for him to leave the world. According to Phil Goldberg, one example was what Yogananda said to Daya Mata just before the dinner, &quot;Do you realize that it is just a matter of hours and I will be gone from this earth?&quot;

On March 7, 1952, he attended a dinner for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Binay Ranjan Sen, and his wife at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. At the conclusion of the banquet, Yogananda spoke of India and America, their contributions to world peace and human progress, and their future co-operation, expressing his hope for a &quot;United World&quot; that would combine the best qualities of &quot;efficient America&quot; and &quot;spiritual India&quot;. According to his direct disciple and eventual head of the SRF Daya Mata, who was present at the banquet, as Yogananda ended his speech, he read from his poem &quot;My India&quot;, concluding with the words &quot;Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves, and men dream God—I am hallowed; my body touched that sod.&quot; Daya Mata stated that &quot;as he uttered these words, he lifted his eyes to the Kutastha center, and his body slumped to the floor.&quot; His funeral service, with hundreds attending, was held at the SRF headquarters atop Mt. Washington in Los Angeles. Rajarsi Janakananda, who Yogananda chose to succeed him as the new president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, &quot;performed a sacred ritual releasing the body to God.&quot;

According to the book &quot;Divine Interventions: True Stories of Mysteries and Miracles That Change Lives&quot;, for three weeks after his death Yogananda&#x27;s body &quot;showed no signs of physical deterioration and &#x27;his unchanged face shone with the divine luster of incorruptibility.&#x27;&quot; A notarized letter from Harry T. Rowe, the mortuary director, added: &quot;The absence of any visual signs of decay … offers the most extraordinary case in our experience... This state of perfect preservation of a body is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one... Yogananda&#x27;s body was apparently in a phenomenal state of immutability... No odor of decay emanated from his body at any time... For these reasons we state again that the case of Paramahansa Yogananda is unique in our experience.&quot; Rowe wrote that Yogananda&#x27;s body was embalmed approximately twenty-four hours after his death. On March 26 a barely noticeable desiccation on his nose was seen and on March 27 Rowe noted that Yogananda&#x27;s body looked fresh and unravaged by decay as it did on the day of his death. Yogananda&#x27;s remains are interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Great Mausoleum (normally closed off to visitors but Yogananda&#x27;s tomb is accessible) in Glendale, California.

===Cause of death===
There are differing accounts of his death. The medical verdict was &quot;acute coronary occlusion&quot;, i.e., a heart attack. According to other accounts, Self-Realization disciples claim that their teacher entered &quot;mahasamadhi&quot; (a yogi&#x27;s conscious exit from the body).

==Teachings==
In 1917, Yogananda, in India, &quot;began his life&#x27;s work with the founding of a &#x27;how-to-live&#x27; school for boys, where modern educational methods were combined with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals.&quot; In 1920 &quot;he was invited to serve as India&#x27;s delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening in Boston. His address to the Congress, on &#x27;The Science of Religion,&#x27; was enthusiastically received.&quot; For the next several years he lectured and taught across the United States. His discourses taught of the &quot;unity of &#x27;the original teachings of Jesus Christ and the original Yoga taught by Bhagavan Krishna.&#x27;&quot;

In 1920, he founded the Self-Realization Fellowship and in 1925 established in Los Angeles, California, US, the international headquarters for SRF.
Yogananda wrote the &quot;Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You&quot; and &quot;God Talks With Arjuna – The Bhagavad Gita&quot; to explain his belief in the harmony and oneness of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and to present that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of all true religions.

Yogananda wrote down his &quot;Aims and Ideals for Self-Realization Fellowship /Yogoda Satsanga Society&quot;:
* To disseminate among the nations a knowledge of definite scientific techniques for attaining direct personal experience of God.
* To teach that the purpose of life is the evolution, through self-effort, of man&#x27;s limited mortal consciousness into God Consciousness; and to this end to establish Self-Realization Fellowship temples for God-communion throughout the world, and to encourage the establishment of individual temples of God in the homes and in the hearts of men.
* To reveal the complete harmony and basic oneness of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna; and to show that these principles of truth are the common scientific foundation of all true religions.
* To point out the one divine highway to which all paths of true religious beliefs eventually lead: the highway of daily, scientific, devotional meditation on God.
* To liberate man from his threefold suffering: physical disease, mental inharmonies, and spiritual ignorance.
* To encourage &quot;plain living and high thinking&quot;; and to spread a spirit of brotherhood among all peoples by teaching the eternal basis of their unity: kinship with God.
* To demonstrate the superiority of mind over body, of soul over mind.
* To overcome evil by good, sorrow by joy, cruelty by kindness, ignorance by wisdom.
* To unite science and religion through realization of the unity of their underlying principles.
* To advocate cultural and spiritual understanding between East and West, and the exchange of their finest distinctive features.
* To serve mankind as one&#x27;s larger Self.

In his published work, &quot;The Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons&quot;, Yogananda gives &quot;his in-depth instruction in the practice of the highest yoga science of God-realization. That ancient science is embodied in the specific principles and meditation techniques of &quot;Kriya Yoga&quot;.&quot; Yogananda taught his students the need for direct experience of truth, as opposed to blind belief. He said that &quot;The true basis of religion is not belief, but intuitive experience. Intuition is the soul&#x27;s power of knowing God. To know what religion is really all about, one must know God.&quot;

Echoing traditional Hindu teachings, he taught that the entire universe is God&#x27;s cosmic motion picture, and that individuals are merely actors in the divine play who change roles through reincarnation. He taught that mankind&#x27;s deep suffering is rooted in identifying too closely with one&#x27;s current role, rather than with the movie&#x27;s director, or God.

He taught Kriya Yoga and other meditation practices to help people achieve that understanding, which he called Self-realization:
Self-realization is the knowing – in body, mind, and soul – that we are one with the omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that we are not merely near it at all times, but that God&#x27;s omnipresence is our omnipresence; and that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be. All we have to do is improve our knowing.

In his book, &quot;How you can talk with God&quot;, he claims that anyone can talk with God, if the person keeps persevering in the request to speak with God with devotion. He also claimed that God had spoken to him many times, apart from making miracles happen in his life. In the book, he claims that, &quot;We may in a vision see a face of some divine/saintly being, or we may hear a Divine voice talking to us, and will know it is God. When our heart-call is intense, and we do not give up, God will come. It is important that we remove from our mind all doubt that God will answer.&quot;

==Kriya Yoga==

The &quot;science&quot; of Kriya Yoga is the foundation of Yogananda&#x27;s teachings. An ancient spiritual practice, Kriya Yoga is &quot;union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya). The Sanskrit root of &quot;kriya&quot; is &quot;kri&quot;, to do, to act and react.&quot; Kriya Yoga was passed down through Yogananda&#x27;s spiritual lineage: Mahavatar Babaji taught the Kriya technique to Lahiri Mahasaya, who taught it to his disciple, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Yogananda&#x27;s Guru.

Yogananda gave a general description of Kriya Yoga in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;:

&quot;The Kriya Yogi mentally directs his life energy to revolve, upward and downward, around the six spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) which correspond to the twelve astral signs of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man. One-half-minute of revolution of energy around the sensitive spinal cord of man effects subtle progress in his evolution; that half-minute of Kriya equals one year of natural spiritual unfoldment&quot;.

Mrinalini Mata, a former president of SRF/YSS, said, &quot;Kriya Yoga is so effective, so complete, because it brings God&#x27;s love – the universal power through which God draws all souls back to reunion with Him – into operation in the devotee&#x27;s life.&quot;

Yogananda wrote in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; that the &quot;actual technique should be learned from an authorized Kriyaban (Kriya Yogi) of Self-Realization Fellowship /Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.&quot;

==&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;==

In 1946, Yogananda published his life story, &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. It has since been translated into 45 languages. In 1999, it was designated one of the &quot;100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century&quot; by a panel of spiritual authors convened by Philip Zaleski and HarperCollins publishers. &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; is the most popular among Yogananda&#x27;s books. According to Philip Goldberg, who wrote &quot;American Veda&quot;, &quot;the Self-Realization Fellowship which represents Yogananda&#x27;s Legacy, is justified in using the slogan, &#x27;The Book that Changed the Lives of Millions.&#x27; It has sold more than four million copies and counting&quot;. In 2006, the publisher, Self-Realization Fellowship, honored the 60th anniversary of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; &quot;with a series of projects designed to promote the legacy of the man thousands of disciples still refer to as &#x27;master&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; describes Yogananda&#x27;s spiritual search for enlightenment, in addition to encounters with notable spiritual figures such as Therese Neumann, Anandamayi Ma, Vishuddhananda Paramahansa, Mohandas Gandhi, Nobel laureate in literature Rabindranath Tagore, noted plant scientist Luther Burbank (the book is &#x27;Dedicated to the Memory of Luther Burbank, An American Saint&#x27;), famous Indian scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Nobel laureate in physics Sir C. V. Raman. One notable chapter of this book is &quot;The Law of Miracles&quot;, where he gives scientific explanations for seemingly miraculous feats. He writes: &quot;the word &#x27;impossible&#x27; is becoming less prominent in man&#x27;s vocabulary.&quot;

The &quot;Autobiography&quot; has been an inspiration for many people including George Harrison, Ravi Shankar and Steve Jobs. In the 2011 book &quot;Steve Jobs: A Biography&quot; the author writes that Jobs first read the &quot;Autobiography&quot; as a teenager. He re-read it in India and later while preparing for a trip, he downloaded it onto his iPad2 and then re-read it once a year ever since. Jon Anderson was inspired by Paramahansa Yogananda and his book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; when he wrote &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; India national cricket team captain, Virat Kohli said that the &quot;Autobiography&quot; influenced his life in a positive manner and also urged everyone to read it.

==Claims of bodily incorruptibility==
As reported in &quot;Time&quot; on August 4, 1952, Harry T. Rowe, Mortuary Director of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where Yogananda&#x27;s body was received, embalmed and interred, wrote in a notarized letter

The absence of any visual signs of decay in the dead body of Paramahansa Yogananda offers the most extraordinary case in our experience... No physical disintegration was visible in his body even twenty days after death... No indication of mold was visible on his skin, and no visible drying up took place in the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of a body is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one... No odour of decay emanated from his body at any time...
On another note, according to Catherine Wessinger, &quot;the body was embalmed but emulsion was not applied to the skin.&quot;

Because of two statements in Rowe&#x27;s letter, some have questioned whether the term &quot;incorruptibility&quot; is appropriate. First, in his fourth paragraph he wrote: &quot;For protection of the public health, embalming is desirable if a dead body is to be exposed for several days to public view. Embalming of the body of Paramahansa Yogananda took place twenty-four hours after his demise.&quot; Claims of incorruptibility require that a body not be embalmed, whereas the letter notes that Yogananda&#x27;s body was embalmed soon after his death. Second, in the eleventh paragraph he wrote: &quot;On the late morning of March 26th, we observed a very slight, a barely noticeable, change – the appearance on the tip of the nose of a brown spot, about one-fourth inch in diameter. This small faint spot indicated that the process of desiccation (drying up) might finally be starting. No visible mold appeared however.&quot;

Rowe continued in paragraphs fourteen and fifteen: &quot;The physical appearance of Paramahansa Yogananda on March 27th just before the bronze cover for the casket was put into position, was the same as it was on March 7th. He looked on March 27th as fresh and unravaged by decay as he had looked on the night of his death. On March 27th there was no reason to say that his body had suffered any physical disintegration at all. For these reason we state again that the case of Paramahansa Yogananda is unique in our experience. On May 11, 1952, during a telephone conversation between an officer of Forest Lawn and an officer of Self-Realization Fellowship, the amazing story was brought out for the first time.&quot;

Self-Realization Fellowship published Rowe&#x27;s four-page notarized letter in its entirety in the May–June 1952 issue of its magazine &quot;Self-Realization&quot;. From 1958 to the present it has been included in that organization&#x27;s booklet &quot;Paramahansa Yogananda: In Memoriam&quot;.

The location of Yogananda&#x27;s crypt is in the Great Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Golden Slumber, Mausoleum Crypt 13857, Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

==Legacy==
===Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India===

Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS) is a non-profit religious organization founded by Yogananda in 1917. In countries outside the Indian subcontinent it is known as the Self-Realization Fellowship. Yogananda&#x27;s dissemination of his teachings is continued only through this organization – the Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) / Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS). Yogananda founded the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 1917 and then expanded it in 1920 to the United States naming it the Self-Realization Fellowship. In 1935, he legally incorporated it in the U.S. to serve as his instrument for the preservation and worldwide dissemination of his teachings. Yogananda expressed this intention again in 1939 in his magazine &quot;Inner Culture for Self-Realization&quot; that he published through his organization:

 Paramahansa Swami Yogananda renounced all his ownership rights in the Self-Realization Fellowship when it was incorporated as a nonprofit religious organization under the laws of California, March 29, 1935. At that time he turned over to the Fellowship all of his rights to and income from sale of his books, writings, magazine, lectures, classes, property, automobiles and all other possessions...

SRF/YSS is headquartered in Los Angeles and has grown to include more than 500 temples and centers around the world. It has members in over 175 countries including the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine. In India and surrounding countries, Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s teachings are disseminated by YSS which has more than 100 centers, retreats, and ashrams. Rajarsi Janakananda was chosen by Yogananda to become the President of SRF/YSS when he was gone. Daya Mata, a religious leader and a direct disciple of Yogananda who was personally chosen and trained by Yogananda, was head of Self-Realization Fellowship /Yogoda Satsanga Society of India from 1955 to 2010. According to Linda Johnsen, the new wave today is women, for major Indian gurus have passed on their spiritual mantle to women including Yogananda to the American-born Daya Mata and then to Mrinalini Mata. Mrinalini Mata, a direct disciple of Yogananda, was the president and spiritual head of Self-Realization Fellowship /Yogoda Satsanga Society of India from January 9, 2011, until her death on August 3, 2017. She, too, was personally chosen and trained by Yogananda to help guide the dissemination of his teachings after his death. On August 30, 2017, Brother Chidananda was elected as the next president in a unanimous vote by the SRF Board of Directors. Yogananda incorporated the Self-Realization Fellowship as a nonprofit organization and reassigned all of his property including Mt. Washington to the corporation, thereby protecting his assets.

On November 15, 2017, the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind visited the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India&#x27;s Ranchi Ashram on its centennial anniversary in honor of the official release of the Hindi translation of Yogananda&#x27;s book &quot;God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

=== Commemorative stamps ===
India released a commemorative stamp in honor of Yogananda in 1977. &quot;Department of Post issued a commemorative postage stamp on the occasion of the twenty‑fifth anniversary of Yogananda&#x27;s passing in honor of his far‑reaching contributions to the spiritual upliftment of humanity. &quot;The ideal of love for God and service to humanity found full expression in the life of Paramahansa Yogananda. Though the major part of his life was spent outside India, still he takes his place among our great saints. His work continues to grow and shine ever more brightly, drawing people everywhere on the path of the pilgrimage of the Spirit.&quot;

On March 7, 2017, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, released another commemorative postage stamp honoring the 100th anniversary of the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. Prime Minister Modi at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi appreciated Yogananda for spreading the message of India&#x27;s spirituality in foreign shores. He said that though Yogananda left the shores of India to spread his message, he always remained connected with India.

===Direct disciples===
Yogananda initiated about 100,000 students into Kriya Yoga during his time in the West. According to SRF, the first disciple to take Kriya Yoga initiation in America was Minott W. Lewis, a Boston dentist who helped establish SRF&#x27;s first center and served as SRF&#x27;s vice president for many years. Three of Yogananda&#x27;s direct disciples went on to lead his organization: Rajarsi Janakananda, Daya Mata, and Mrinalini Mata.

==Bibliography==
According to SRF, Yogananda created a large body of work on subjects such as meditation, balanced living, and &quot;the underlying unity of all great religions&quot;, and he left specific instructions to some of his disciples in SRF regarding how his teachings should be prepared and published. SRF publishes collections of his talks, poems, prayers, chants, and sayings, as well as his commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the four Gospels. The &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; has been in print since 1946.

<text>Ellen McIlwaine (October 1, 1945 – June 23, 2021) was an American-born singer-songwriter and musician best known for her career as a solo singer, songwriter and slide guitarist.

==Biography==
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, McIlwaine was adopted by missionaries and raised in Kobe, Japan, giving her exposure to multiple languages and cultures. She attended the Canadian Academy school in Kobe, graduating in 1963. Her first experience in music was playing on piano Ray Charles, Fats Domino and Professor Longhair songs that she heard on Japanese radio. On moving back to the United States she bought a guitar, beginning a stage career in Atlanta, Georgia in the mid-1960s.

In 1966, McIlwaine had a stint in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village where she opened every night at the Cafe Au Go Go, playing with Jimi Hendrix, and opening for Muddy Waters, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, and Big Joe Williams. She returned to Atlanta to form the band Fear Itself, a psychedelic blues rock band.

After recording one album with Fear Itself, McIlwaine went solo, recording two albums for Polydor, &quot;Honky Tonk Angel&quot; (1972) and &quot;We the People&quot; (1973), the latter featuring a hit single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Play&quot;. Those albums, and most of her work since, have featured McIlwaine&#x27;s approach to acoustic slide guitar. This was followed by &quot;The Real Ellen McIlwaine&quot;, recorded for the independent Canadian label Kot&#x27;ai, which featured two of her &#x27;signature&#x27; songs, her slide guitar version of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;The Secret In This Lady&#x27;s Heart&quot;.

As a female vocalist who is known for her acoustic and electric slide guitar, her music tends to be classified in the folk sections of record stores, despite her strong roots in blues, gospel soul and rock music, and her cover versions of songs by Isaac Hayes, Stevie Wonder, Jack Bruce, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Winwood and Browning Bryant. McIlwaine met Hendrix in New York in 1966, briefly played with him and wrote &quot;Underground River&quot; about him. She was also an ardent fan of Jack Bruce and recorded a version of a song by Bruce and his lyricist Pete Brown on each of her first four solo albums - notably songs from Bruce&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;, as well as songs associated with Bruce (such as &quot;Born Under A Bad Sign&quot;). This culminated in her collaboration with Bruce himself on her fourth solo album, &quot;Everybody Needs It&quot; (1982).

By the mid-1970s, McIlwaine&#x27;s songs &quot;Sliding&quot;, &quot;We the People&quot; and &quot;Losing You&quot; were included on the compilation album, &quot;The Guitar Album&quot;.

McIlwaine&#x27;s album &quot;The Real Ellen McIlwaine&quot;, was recorded in Montreal in 1975 for the Kotai label, and included the Stevie Wonder song &#x27;Higher Ground&#x27;. Her intro later appeared on the David Holmes Essential Collection. A 1982 project, &quot;Everybody Needs It&quot; won the NAIRD Indie Award, and featured Jack Bruce.

McIlwaine gained a cult following in Australia thanks to exposure of her music on the Sydney-based AM public rock radio station 2JJ (now Triple-J). In 1980 she made her first tour of Australia, after being spotted by the Australian singer-guitarist Margret RoadKnight, who was one of the co-promoters of the tour. She returned to Australia in 1984, and during this tour was the last performer to appear at Sydney&#x27;s historic Regent Theatre prior to its closure and subsequent demolition.

After moving to Canada in 1987, (first Toronto, later Alberta), McIlwaine recorded &quot;Looking for Trouble&quot; for Stony Plain Records, which also re-released her early vinyl material on CD. Her next CD &quot;Women in (e)motion Festival/Ellen McIlwaine,&quot; was recorded live in Germany in 1999; and then &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot; featuring Taj Mahal on the German Tradition und Moderne label.

In spite of debilitating arthritis in her hips, she undertook a third tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2003, which reunited her with RoadKnight and the other Honky Tonk Angels, who had first brought her to Australia in 1980.

In 2006 she started her own label, Ellen McIlwaine Music, and released &quot;Mystic Bridge&quot; featuring the Indian tabla drummer Cassius Khan. They were joined by the soprano saxophone of Linsey Wellman on three tracks, including their version of &quot;Take Me to the River&quot;, and harmonium playing by Amika Kushwaha on the last track, &quot;The Question&quot;. This was a poem by Christine Steele, recited over Cassius Khan&#x27;s vocal rendition of the ancient Urdu poem set to music, &quot;Darbari Raag&quot;. The album was widely successful with critical acclaim.

In 2008, 2009, and 2010 she toured with Patty Larkin&#x27;s La Guitara ensemble in the US, and in Canada with Sue Foley&#x27;s Guitar Women, and appeared at various US and Canadian venues and festivals as a solo artist. In 2013 she traveled to Los Angeles to be part of the Jimi Hendrix documentary &quot;Hear My Train A Comin&quot;. In 2019, Ellen was awarded Toronto Blues Society&#x27;s &quot;Blues with a Feeling&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award.

McIlwaine died on June 23, 2021, in her long-time residence of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. She had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer just six weeks prior.

<text>Mrs Brown (also released in cinemas as Her Majesty, Mrs Brown) is a 1997 British drama film starring Judi Dench, Billy Connolly, Geoffrey Palmer, Antony Sher, and Gerard Butler in his film debut. It was written by Jeremy Brock and directed by John Madden. The film was produced by the BBC and Ecosse Films with the intention of being shown on BBC One and on WGBH&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. However, it was acquired by Miramax and released to unexpected success, going on to earn over $13 million worldwide. The story concerns a recently widowed Queen Victoria and her relationship with a Scottish servant, John Brown, a trusted servant of her deceased husband, and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had served Victoria&#x27;s Prince Consort, Prince Albert; Victoria&#x27;s Household thought Brown might help the Queen who had remained in mourning since the Prince Consort&#x27;s death in 1861.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and released in the United Kingdom on 5 September 1997. Judi Dench won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role; additionally, she was nominated for many other awards for her performance, including the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, but lost both awards to Helen Hunt for her role in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1863, hoping to subtly coax Queen Victoria toward resuming public life after two years of seclusion, Scottish servant John Brown is summoned to court. The plan succeeds a little too well for the liking of Victoria&#x27;s Chief Secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby and The Prince of Wales as well as other members of the Royal Family; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown&#x27;s perceived influence over Victoria. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as &quot;woman&quot;. He also quickly takes control over the Queen&#x27;s daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the Royal Family and servants.

The moniker &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;, used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper and perhaps sexual relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that Victoria and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married, though cartoons from the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; are shown as being passed around in Parliament (one cartoon is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying unhanded across it).

As a result of Victoria&#x27;s seclusion, especially at Balmoral Castle in Scotland (something initially encouraged by Brown), her popularity begins failing and republican sentiment begins growing. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s hold over the House of Commons weakens and there is a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He convinces Brown to use his influence with Victoria to persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the speech from the throne at the opening of Parliament.

Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When he urges her to return to London and fulfil her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, Victoria becomes visibly agitated. When Brown once again refers to her as &quot;woman&quot;, she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and her physician, Dr. Jenner, requesting that they serve her needs, visibly demoting Brown&#x27;s contact and influence. Their relationship was never to be the same again. Victoria&#x27;s eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy.

Brown continues to serve Victoria until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown&#x27;s dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun-wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the Royal Family. An ever-vigilant Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son&#x27;s bragging, Victoria announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the &quot;Devoted Service Medal,&quot; will be minted and awarded to Brown.

Years later, Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after running through the woods late at night chasing a possible intruder. Hearing of his illness, Victoria visits his room and is shaken to see her old friend so ill. She confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years, and the pneumonia proves fatal for Brown. During his years of service, Brown had kept a diary and upon his passing, Ponsonby and Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone.

The film&#x27;s closing notes state &quot;John Brown&#x27;s diary was never found.&quot; Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales hurled the Queen&#x27;s favourite bust of Brown over the palace wall, referencing the film&#x27;s opening sequence.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In a contemporary review Roger Ebert said, &quot;It is not about sexual love, or even romantic love, really, but about that kind of love based on challenge and fascination.&quot; He called Judi Dench &quot;wonderful&quot;; Connolly &quot;has the reserve and self-confidence that most stand-up comics lack almost by definition&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Thanks to some top notch acting, the chemistry between its stars, and a witty, thoughtful script, &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; delivers a nuanced and entertaining, if not entirely factual, account of a seldom explored historical relationship.&quot; Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
The film opened 18 July 1997 on 6 screens (including 3 in Los Angeles and 2 in New York) and grossed $76,268 for the weekend. It went on to gross $9.2 million in the United States and Canada. In the UK, the film opened 5 September 1997 on 149 screens and grossed a disappointing £228,469, however, it improved and went on to gross £2,542,212 ($4 million).

<text>Indie rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Although the term was originally used to describe rock music released through independent record labels, by the 1990s it became more widely associated with the music such bands produced.

The sound of indie rock has its origins in the New Zealand Dunedin sound of the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Tall Dwarfs, the Clean and the Verlaines, and early 1980s college rock radio stations who would frequently play jangle pop bands like the Smiths and R.E.M.. The genre solidified itself during the mid–1980s with &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;C86&quot; cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest in the United States. During the decade, indie rock bands like Sonic Youth, the Pixies and Radiohead all released albums on major labels and subgenres like slowcore, Midwest emo, slacker rock and space rock began. By this time, &quot;indie&quot; had evolved to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes on the genre: baggy in Manchester; grebo in Stourbridge and Leicester; and shoegaze in London and the Thames Valley.

During the 1990s, the mainstream success of grunge and Britpop, two movements influenced by indie rock, brought increased attention to the genre and saw record labels use their independent status as a marketing tactic. This led to a split within indie rock: one side conforming to mainstream radio; the other becoming increasingly experimental. By this point, &quot;indie rock&quot; referred to the musical style rather than ties to the independent music scene. In the 2000s, indie rock reentered the mainstream through the garage rock and post-punk revival and the influence of the Strokes and the Libertines. This success was exacerbated in the middle of the decade by Bloc Party, the Arctic Monkeys and the Killers and indie rock proliferated into the landfill indie movement.

==Characteristics==
The term indie rock, which comes from &quot;independent&quot;, describes the small and relatively low-budget labels on which it is released and the do-it-yourself attitude of the bands and artists involved. Although distribution deals are often struck with major corporate companies, these labels and the bands they host have attempted to retain their autonomy, leaving them free to explore sounds, emotions and subjects of limited appeal to large, mainstream audiences. The influences and styles of the artists have been extremely diverse, including punk, psychedelia, post-punk and country.

The lo-fi, experimental and art rock sound of the Velvet Underground as well as late &#x27;70s punk and post-punk bands such as the Fall, Buzzcocks, Wire, Television and Joy Division would be influential to the genre.

&quot;Allmusic&quot; identifies indie rock as including a number of &quot;varying musical approaches [not] compatible with mainstream tastes&quot;. Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. In his book &quot;DIY Style: Fashion, Music and Global Digital Cultures&quot;, Brent Luvaas described the genre as rooted in nostalgia, citing the influence of garage rock and psychedelic rock of the 1960s in progenitors the Stone Roses and the Smiths, in addition to a lyrical preoccupation with literature. 

In this same vein, Matthew Bannister defined indie rock as &quot;small groups of white men playing guitars, influenced by punks and 1960s white pop/rock, within a broader discourse and practice of (degrees of) independence from mainstream musical values.&quot; According to anthropologist Wendy Fonarow, a key element of indie is the dichotomy between a &quot;puritan ethos&quot; and a &quot;romantic one&quot;, with the former using austere ethics, and the latter being eccentric. This is best seen in the contrast between the indie music of United States and the United Kingdom in the 1990s, with British acts being flamboyant performers, while American acts used their lack of virtuosity as a mark of authenticity.

Indie rock is noted for having a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of the feminist-informed riot grrrl music of acts like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, 7 Year Bitch, Team Dresch and Huggy Bear. However, Cortney Harding pointed out that this sense of equality is not reflected in the number of women running indie labels.

==History==
=== Origins ===


The BBC documentary &quot;Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie&quot; pinpoints the coining of the term &quot;indie&quot; to the 1977 self-publication of the &quot;Spiral Scratch EP&quot; by Manchester punk rock band the Buzzcocks, on their &quot;Ind&quot;ependent record label New Hormones. This inspired a DIY punk movement where bands like Swell Maps, &#x27;O&#x27; Level, Television Personalities and Desperate Bicycles followed suit in pressing and distributing their own records. Distribution was further improved with the establishment of &#x27;The Cartel&#x27;, an association of companies like Red Rhino and Rough Trade Records who would take the releases from these small labels and get them into record shops nationwide. 

Independent record labels would also be integral to the early years of punk rock musical distribution, as seen with Beserkley Records in the US, who put out The Modern Lovers debut album, and Stiff Records who released the first UK punk single &quot;New Rose&quot; by the Damned In Australia, the Saints had their first punk release outside the US, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded,&quot; on their own &quot;Fatal Records&quot; label. This was followed by the Go-Betweens releasing &#x27;Lee Remick&#x27; a few months later. 

Dunedin produced the independent record label Flying Nun Records, whose artists defined the Dunedin sound, which would be particularly influential on the development of indie rock&#x27;s sound. According to &quot;Audioculture&quot;, one of the earliest Dunedin Sound band was Chris Knox&#x27;s band the Enemy, which emerged as a post-punk group, whose members also included Alec Bathgate. Although the group was only around for a short time, their shows impressed the teenage musicians that came to see them, including a young Shayne Carter, who went on to form Bored Games, the DoubleHappys and Straitjacket Fits. Knox later formed another short-lived punk band called Toy Love, and after it broke up, he went on to start the influential band Tall Dwarfs, who were an integral influence on the emergence of home-recorded lo-fi indie. The punk-inspired aspects of the scene were often inspired by opposition to Robert Muldoon and his government, which prompted satire or outright criticism. The scene saw bands take influence from punk rock, but strip away its aggression for a reverb heavy, pop–influenced sound. Marked by the Clean&#x27;s 1981 debut single &quot;Tally-Ho!&quot; and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Dunedin Double&quot; EP featuring the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, the Verlaines and the Stones, its guitars were often jangly and droning and vocals indistinct. The following years, the Dunedin sound spread to other New Zealand cities such as Christchurch or Auckland.

The decade then saw the growing popularity of college radio stations, primarily in the United States, who would play independent artists of various genres, including alternative rock, new wave, post-hardcore and post-punk. The bands broadcast on these station became dubbed &quot;college rock&quot; by fans, another term which lacked any stylistic implication. The most prominent college rock bands were jangle pop groups R.E.M., from the US, and the Smiths, from the UK, who Matthew Bannister states were the earliest indie rock groups. These bands&#x27; influence was showcased quickly seen in the formation of Let&#x27;s Active, the Housemartins and the La&#x27;s. By this time, the term &quot;indie rock&quot; had begun to be used to describe the bands who produced music on independent record labels, rather than simply the record labels themselves. This made it the only genre at the time which was defined by the methods by which the music was distributed rather than the sound of said music.

Journalist Steve Taylor also cited the bands involved in the Paisley Underground scene as early indie groups. However, this jangly style became increasingly mainstream as the decade progressed leading subsequent indie rock bands to abandon this style. Instead, in the following years the Jesus and Mary Chain and Flying Nun Records bands like the Jean-Paul Sartre Experience morphed the genre into a slower, darker and more hypnotic style. The number of college radio stations in the US decreased significantly following NPR&#x27;s lobbying against noncommercial station during the 1980s. In turn, the name &quot;college rock&quot; fell into disfavour, soon being replaced by &quot;indie&quot;.

===Development===

In the United Kingdom, &quot;NME&quot; released the &quot;C86&quot; compilation cassette, which consisted of tracks by groups including Primal Scream, the Pastels and the Wedding Present. Intended to showcase the UK&#x27;s current independent music scene, the album was made up of groups combining elements of jangle pop, post-punk and Phil Spector indebted Walls of Sound. In 2006, Bob Stanley called it &quot;the beginning of indie music&quot;. C86 became a descriptor in its own right, describing not only the bands on the tape but also bands who it influenced, often used alongside terms like &quot;anorak pop&quot; and &quot;shambling&quot;. Some C86 bands found significant commercial success: the Soup Dragons went on to sell out Madison Square Garden; Primal Scream were critically acclaimed, receiving the first ever Mercury Prize in 1992; the Wedding Present charted eighteen times in the Top 40; however many bands in its twenty-two track runtime also fell into obscurity.

In the United States, the popularity of R.E.M. allowed those disliking of hardcore punk&#x27;s aggression to become a part of the underground music scene. This empowered an array of musicians, particularly those in what would become the post-hardcore scene as led by the Minutemen. Furthermore, major labels began to pursue underground bands, with both Hüsker Dü and the Replacements releasing albums on majors in the middle of the decade. While these albums did not see the same success as R.E.M., and major labels soon lost interest in the scene, they did have a large impact on younger bands. In the following years, Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest began to release music on independent labels indebted to these bands, and soon too picked up the categorisation of indie rock. As the 1980s closed, both Sonic Youth and the Pixies signed to major labels.

In the late 1980s, the indie rock subgenre shoegaze emerged, as a continuation of the wall of sound production being used by groups like the Jesus and Mary Chain. The genre merged this with influences from Dinosaur Jr. and the Cocteau Twins, to create a dark and droning style so cacophonous that instruments were often indistinguishable. The genre was pioneered by My Bloody Valentine on their early EPs and debut album &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot;. The band&#x27;s style influenced a wave of bands in London and the Thames Valley area including Chapterhouse, Moose and Lush. This scene was collectively termed &quot;the Scene That Celebrates Itself&quot; by &quot;Melody Maker&#x27;s&quot; Steve Sutherland in 1990.
Madchester was another style and scene that originated in the late 1980s. Defined by its merger of C86 indie rock, dance music and Hedonist rave culture, particularly its emphasis on the use of psychedelic drugs, the scene was centred in Manchester. The scene was based around the Haçienda nightclub, which opened in May 1982 as an initiative of Factory Records. For the first few years of its life, the club played predominantly club-oriented pop music and hosted performances by artists including New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Culture Club, Thompson Twins and the Smiths. The Madchester movement burgeoned by 1989, with the success of the Happy Mondays second album &quot;Bummed&quot; and the Stone Roses&#x27; self-titled debut, which became the most influential work in the scene. In the following years, addition high profile acts included the Charlatans, 808 State and the Inspiral Carpets. 

The Madchester scene&#x27;s distinct combination of indie rock and dance music became termed indie dance by critics, or more specifically the subgenre baggy. Madchester and baggy&#x27;s most infamous moment was the 27 May 1990 Spike Island concert headlined by the Stone Roses. With an attendance of around 28,000 and lasting twelve hours, it was the first event of its size and kind to be hosted by an independent act.

In Stourbridge, a scene of indie bands who took influence from electronic, punk, folk and hip-hop music emerged, dubbed grebo by critics. Fronted by Pop Will Eat Itself, the Wonder Stuff and Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, &quot;grebo&quot; was broadly defined, and was used more as a name for the Stourbridge scene than as a genre label. However, the bands quickly gained attention: Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s 1989 singles &quot;Wise Up! Sucker&quot; and &quot;Can U Dig It?&quot; both entered the UK Top 40 and Stourbridge briefly became a tourist attraction for young indie rock fans. The seminal albums from the scene were released between 1989 and 1993: the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s &quot;Hup&quot; and &quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot;; Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin&#x27;s &quot;God Fodder&quot; and &quot;Are You Normal?&quot;; and Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!&quot; and &quot;The Looks or the Lifestyle?&quot;. In this period, the scene&#x27;s bands became fixtures, sometimes headliners, at Reading Festival, sold millions of albums and were frequently featured on the covers of magazines like &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Grebo bands were distinct from prior indie rock groups not only because of their broad influences, but their subversion of the twee or unhappy moods of most other bands in the genre, and their pursuit of a heavier sound and aesthetic. The scene came to include the stylistically similar bands of nearby Leicester: the Bomb Party, Gaye Bykers on Acid, Crazyhead, the Hunters Club and Scum Pups.

===Mainstream–underground split: 1990s===

In the early 1990s, the Seattle grunge scene, and its most visible acts, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, broke into the mainstream. The monumental success of these bands, particularly Nirvana, brought increased attention to the indie rock scene, which initiated a shift in which the indie rock descriptor became displaced by the term alternative rock. As a result, the term &quot;alternative&quot; lost its original counter-cultural meaning and began to refer to the new, commercially lighter form of music that was now achieving mainstream success. &quot;New York&quot; magazine writer Carl Swanson argued that even the term &quot;sellout&quot; lost its meaning as grunge made it possible for a niche movement, no matter how radical, to be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture. 

In his book &quot;Popular Music: The Key Concepts&quot;, media academic Roy Shuker states that &quot;Grunge represented the mainstreaming of the North American indie rock ethic and style of the 1980s&quot;, going on to explain that a band&#x27;s status as independent became &quot;As much a marketing device as [indie rock and alternative rock were an] identifiable &#x27;sound&#x27;&quot;. In the wake of this increased attention, indie rock experienced a split: accessible bands who catered to the now-popular alternative rock radio; and bands who continued to experiment, advancing in the underground. According to &quot;AllMusic&quot;, it was during this split that &quot;indie rock&quot; solidified itself as a term for the style of music played by these underground artists, while the mainstream indie rock-influenced bands became termed alternative rock.

Slowcore developed in the United States as a direct counterpoint to the rapid growth of grunge. Although loosely defined, slowcore generally includes slow tempos, minimalist instrumentals and sad lyrics. Galaxie 500, particularly their second album &quot;On Fire&quot; (1989), were heavy influences on the genre, with &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot; writer Robert Rubsam, calling them the &quot;fountainhead for all that would come&quot;. The first wave of bands in the genre included Red House Painters, Codeine, Bedhead, Ida and Low. The genre originated from around the United States, with no geographic focus, and very little interaction between its artists.

A younger subset of grebo bands emerged around 1991, who were in turn labelled &quot;fraggle&quot; bands. During this movement, the dominant sound was a style of indie rock that was heavily indebted to punk and Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Bleach&quot; album, while also occasionally making use of drum machines. &quot;Gigwise&quot; writer Steven Kline described the style as &quot;filthy guitars, filthier hair and t-shirts only a mother would wash&quot;. Prominent fraggle acts included Senseless Things, Mega City Four and Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine.
&quot;Spin&quot; writer Charles Aaron described Pavement and Guided by Voices as &quot;the two bands that came to exemplify indie rock in this period, and still define the term in many people&#x27;s minds&quot;. Both bands made use of a Lo-fi production style which romanticised their D.I.Y. ethos. Pavement&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot;, was one of the defining albums of the slacker rock subgenre. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;the quintessential indie rock album&quot;, placing it on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

In the North Carolina Research Triangle, an indie rock scene was being spearheaded by groups enfranched Merge Records like Superchunk, Archers of Loaf and Polvo.
describing a growing scene of indie-rock bands who were influenced by hardcore punk and post-punk. At the time, publications such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; took to calling the college town of Chapel Hill the &quot;next Seattle&quot;. Superchunk&#x27;s single &quot;Slack Motherfucker&quot; has also been credited by &quot;Columbia&quot; magazine with popularizing the &quot;slacker&quot; stereotype, and as a defining anthem of 90s indie rock.

With the rise of Britpop, many of Britain&#x27;s earlier indie rock bands fell into obscurity. Fronted by Blur, Oasis, Pulp and Suede, the bands in the movement were advertised as being underground artists, as a means to compete commercially with the United States&#x27; grunge scene. While Britpop was stylistically indebted to indie rock and began as an offshoot of it, Britpop bands abandoned the genre&#x27;s earlier anti-establishment politics and instead brought it into the mainstream, with bands like Blur and Pulp even signing to major labels. 

In her essay &quot;Labouring the Point? The Politics of Britain in &quot;New Britain&quot;&quot;, politician and academic Rupa Huq states that Britpop &quot;began as an offshoot of the independent British music scene but arguably ended up killing it, as a convergence took place between indie and mainstream, removing the distinctive &#x27;protest&#x27; element of British-based independent music&quot; Music journalist John Harris has suggested that Britpop began when Blur&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Popscene&quot; and Suede&#x27;s debut &quot;The Drowners&quot; were released around the same time in the spring of 1992. He stated, &quot;[I]f Britpop started anywhere, it was the deluge of acclaim that greeted Suede&#x27;s first records: all of them audacious, successful and very, very British.&quot; Suede were the first of the new crop of guitar-orientated bands to be embraced by the UK music media as Britain&#x27;s answer to Seattle&#x27;s grunge sound. Their debut album &quot;Suede&quot; for the fastest-selling debut album in the UK.

====Diversification====
Sunny Day Real Estate&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Diary&quot; (1994), began a new wave of the emo genre, by incorporating elements of it into their indie rock sound. Sunny Day Real Estate and other second wave emo bands, including Piebald, the Promise Ring and Cap&#x27;n Jazz distanced emo from its hardcore roots and allowed the genre to develop a much more realised scene than its first wave. 

This style of emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s, with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001) and Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; (2001). One particularly notable scene during this wave was the Midwest emo bands of the latter half of the decade, who incorporated the jangly guitar tones of earlier indie rock and elements of math rock to create the distinctive style of groups like American Football. The popularity of emo, also allowed a number of &quot;not-quite-indie-not-quite-emo&quot; bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Modest Mouse and Karate to gain significant attention.

The loosely defined Elephant 6 collective – which included the Apples in Stereo, Beulah, Circulatory System, Elf Power, the Minders, Neutral Milk Hotel, of Montreal and the Olivia Tremor Control – merged indie rock with psychedelic pop. &quot;Gimme Indie Rock&quot; author Andrew Earles stated that the collective, namely Neutral Milk Hotel on &quot;On Avery Island&quot; (1996), &quot;helped keep the genre artistically relevant while other bands defected and other underground styles rose to prominence&quot;.

Indie electronic or indietronica covers rock-based artists who share an affinity for electronic music, using samplers, synthesizers, drum machines, and computer programs. Less a style and more a categorization, it describes an early 1990s trend of acts who followed in the traditions of early electronic music (composers of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), krautrock and synth-pop. Progenitors of the genre were English bands Disco Inferno, Stereolab, and Space. Most musicians in the genre can be found on independent labels like Warp, Morr Music, Sub Pop or Ghostly International.

Space rock took the psychedelic rock, ambient music influence of Pink Floyd and Hawkwind and incorporated them into an indie rock context. The style began with Spacemen 3 in the 1980s, with later groups including Spiritualized, Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Quickspace.

As Britpop waned towards the end of the decade, post-Britpop took hold within the UK&#x27;s indie rock scene.
From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve&#x27;s album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead although having achieved moderate recognition with &quot;The Bends&quot; in 1995 achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), and its follow-ups &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001). Stereophonics, used elements of a post-grunge and hardcore on their breakthrough albums &quot;Word Gets Around&quot; (1997) and &quot;Performance and Cocktails&quot; (1999), before moving into more melodic territory with &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot; (2001) and subsequent albums.

Feeder, who were initially more influenced by American post-grunge, producing a hard rock sound that led to their breakthrough single &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and the album &quot;Echo Park&quot; (2001). After the death of their drummer Jon Lee, they moved to a more reflective and introspective mode on &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; (2002), their most commercially successful album to that point, which spawned a series of hit singles.

The most commercially successful band in the millennium were Coldplay, whose first two albums &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000) and &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; (2002) went multi-platinum, establishing them as one of the most popular acts in the world by the time of their third album &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; (2005). Snow Patrol&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; (from their 2006 album &quot;Eyes Open&quot;) is the most widely played song of the 21st century on UK radio.

===Mainstream success: 2000s===
====Post-punk and garage rock revival====
The mainstream attention which indie rock garnered in the 2000s began with the Strokes and their 2001 debut album &quot;Is This It&quot;. Playing a style indebted to &#x27;60s-70s bands like the Velvet Underground and the Ramones, the band&#x27;s intention musically was to sound like &quot;a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record.&quot; The album peaked at number thirty-three in the United States, staying in the charts for two additional years and debuted at number two on the UK albums chart. When the Strokes made their commercial debut, the public perception of &quot;rock music&quot; was based in post-grunge, nu metal and rap rock, putting their throwback style of garage rock as a stark contrast to the mainstream. The band&#x27;s immediate influence allowed fellow classic rock influenced New York bands like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol and TV on the Radio to gain mainstream attention. The Strokes were accompanied in this commercial breakthrough by the White Stripes, the Vines, and the Hives. These groups were christened by parts of the media as the &quot;The&quot; bands, and dubbed &quot;the saviours of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, prompting &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine to declare on its September 2002 cover, &quot;Rock is Back!&quot;
The success of the Strokes revitalised the then-dying underground post-Britpop scene in the United Kingdom with groups who took the band&#x27;s influence and experimented with their sound. This first wave of UK acts included Franz Ferdinand, Kasabian, Maxïmo Park, the Cribs, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs and the Others. However, the Libertines, who formed in 1997, stood as the UK&#x27;s counterpoint to the Strokes, being described by &quot;AllMusic&quot; as &quot;one of the U.K.&#x27;s most influential 21st century acts&quot; and &quot;the Independent&quot; stating that &quot;the Libertines wanted to be an important band, but they could not have predicted the impact they would have&quot;. Influenced by the Clash, the Kinks, the Smiths and the Jam, the band&#x27;s style of tinny, high register, sometimes acoustic, guitar parts topped by lyrics of British parochial pleasures in the vocalists&#x27; authentic English accents became widely imitated. The Fratellis, the Kooks, and the View were three such acts to gain significant commercial success, although the most prominent post-Libertines band was Sheffield&#x27;s Arctic Monkeys. One of the earliest groups to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking, the Arctic Monkeys had two No. 1 singles, and their album &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; (2006) became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history.

In this success, legacy indie bands soon entered the mainstream, including Modest Mouse (whose 2004 album &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; reached the US top 40 and was nominated for a Grammy Award), Bright Eyes (who in 2004 had two singles at the top of the Billboard magazine Hot 100 Single Sales) and Death Cab for Cutie (whose 2005 album &quot;Plans&quot; debuted at number four in the US, remaining on the Billboard charts for nearly one year and achieving platinum status and a Grammy nomination). This new commercial breakthrough and the widespread use of the term indie to other forms of popular culture, led a number of commentators to suggest that indie rock had ceased to be a meaningful term.

Additionally, a second wave of bands emerged in the United States that managed to gain international recognition as a result of the movement included the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, the Shins, the Bravery, Spoon, the Hold Steady, and the National. The most commercially successful band of this wave was Las Vegas&#x27; the Killers. Formed in 2001, after hearing &quot;Is This It&quot;, the band scrapped the majority of their prior material to rewrite it under the Strokes&#x27; influence. The band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; spent 260 non-consecutive weeks, or five years, on the UK Singles Chart as of April 2021, the most out of any song, and , it had charted on the UK Singles Chart in 11 of the last 13 years, including a 35-week run peaking at number 49 in 2016–2017. Furthermore, it was the UK&#x27;s most streamed pre-2010 song, until it was surpassed in late 2018, and continued to be purchased for download hundreds of times a week by 2017. In March 2018, the song reached the milestone of staying in the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart for 200 weeks.

====Proliferation====

The impact of the Strokes, the Libertines and Bloc Party led to significant major label interest in indie rock artists, which was then exacerbated by the success of the Arctic Monkeys. In the years following &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; there was a proliferation of bands such as the Rifles, the Pigeon Detectives and Milburn, who created a more formulaic derivative of the earlier acts. By the end of the decade, critics had taken to referring to this wave of acts as &quot;landfill indie&quot;, a description coined by Andrew Harrison of &quot;the Word&quot; magazine. A 2020 &quot;Vice&quot; article cited Johnny Borrell, vocalist of Razorlight, as the &quot;one man who defined, embodied and lived Landfill Indie&quot; due to his forming of a &quot;spectacularly middle-of-the-road&quot; band despite his close proximity to the Libertines&#x27; &quot;desperate kinetic energy, mythologised love-hate dynamic and vision of a dilapidated Britain animated by romance and narcotics&quot;. In a 2009 article for &quot;the Guardian&quot;, journalist Peter Robinson cited the landfill indie movement as dead, blaming the Wombats, Scouting For Girls, and Joe Lean &amp; the Jing Jang Jong by stating &quot;If landfill indie had been a game of &quot;Buckaroo&quot;, those three sent the whole donkey&#x27;s arse of radio-friendly mainstream guitar band monotony flying high into the air, legs flailing.&quot;

===Continued success: 2010s–present===
There continued to be commercial successes in the 2010s Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;The Suburbs&quot; (2010), the Black Keys&#x27;s &quot;Turn Blue&quot; (2014), Kings of Leon&#x27;s &quot;Walls&quot; (2016), the Killers&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; (2017), which reached number one on the Billboard charts in the United States and the official chart in the United Kingdom, with Arcade Fire&#x27;s album winning a Grammy for Album of The Year in 2011. Other indie rock acts like Florence and the Machine, the Decemberists and LCD Soundsystem gained number one singles in the United States during the decade, with Vampire Weekend, Florence and the Machine, Arctic Monkeys, Bon Iver, the Killers and the Postal Service gaining platinum selling records. Vampire Weekend&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Modern Vampires of the City&quot; (2013) received the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2014, with Consequence writer Tyler Clark stating that in 2019 it was still &quot;an indie rock standard bearer in the wider world of music&quot;. Arctic Monkeys&#x27; fifth album &quot;AM&quot; (2013) was one of the biggest indie rock albums of the decade, charting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, having sold 157,329 copies, thus becoming the second fastest-selling album of the year. With the debut of &quot;AM&quot; on the chart, Arctic Monkeys also broke a record, becoming the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums. As of June 2019, &quot;AM&quot; has spent 300 weeks in the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart. The album also peaked at number one in Australia, Belgium (Flanders), Croatia, Slovenia, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal, and reached top ten positions in several other countries. In the United States, the album sold 42,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States. In August 2017, &quot;AM&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units over of a million units in the United States. As of the 14th of April 2023 every track from the album was certified silver or higher by the BPI with &quot;Mad Sounds&quot; being the last to be certified.

When the 1975&#x27;s merger of indie rock and mainstream pop began gaining commercial attraction in the early 2010s, it was controversial; they received the award for &quot;Worst Band&quot; at the 2014 &quot;NME Awards&quot;, but by 2017 received &quot;Best Live Band&quot; at the same award show. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; writer Yasmine Summan stated that &quot;If you could summarize 2013 and 2014 in one album for indie and alternative fans, it would be the 1975&#x27;s self-titled release&quot;. In an article for &quot;the Guardian&quot; accrediting the 1975 as the band to &quot;usher indie into the mainstream&quot;, writer Mark Beaumont compared vocalist Matty Healy&#x27;s influence on the genre to that of Libertines vocalist Pete Doherty, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed them as one of the most influential artists in music since 1995. In the 1975&#x27;s wake, a number of other indie pop artist gained popularity. Some critics termed this phenomenon &quot;Healywave&quot;, which notably included: Pale Waves, the Aces, Joan, Fickle Friends and No Rome. Of this group, Pale Waves were particularly commercially prominent, with their debut album &quot;My Mind Makes Noises&quot; peaking at number eight on the UK albums chart, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; (2021) at number three and &quot;Unwanted&quot; (2022) at number four. At around the same time Wolf Alice became a prominent force in the scene, with their second album &quot;Visions of a Life&quot; (2017) winning the Mercury Prize in 2018 and third album &quot;Blue Weekend&quot; (2021) being nominated. Writer Martin Young stated in a 2021 article for Dork that &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to truly state just how important Wolf Alice are. They are the catalyst for almost all the amazing bands you&#x27;ve read about in &quot;Dork&quot; over the last 5 years.&quot;

<doc id="143491" wikidata="Q368735" url="?curid=143491" title="With a Little Help from My Friends">
<text>&quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; is a song recorded by English rock band the Beatles for their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was written primarily by Paul McCartney with contributions from John Lennon, and is sung by drummer Ringo Starr (as Sgt. Pepper singer Billy Shears), his lead vocal for the album. As the second track on the album, it segues from the applause on the title track.

A subsequent recording of the track by Joe Cocker from his album of the same name became a success in 1968—topping the UK Singles Chart—and an anthem for the Woodstock era. In 1978, the Beatles&#x27; recording, paired with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, was reissued as a single, and peaked at number 63 in Britain and number 71 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Starr has regularly performed the song in concert as a solo artist. The song was ranked number 311 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background and composition==
John Lennon and Paul McCartney finished writing the song in mid-March 1967, written specifically as Ringo Starr&#x27;s track for the Beatles album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. McCartney said: &quot;It was pretty much co-written, John and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little craft job.&quot; In 1970 Lennon stated: &quot;Paul had the line about &#x27;a little help from my friends.&#x27; He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty from his original idea&quot;, but in 1980 Lennon said: &quot;This is Paul, with a little help from me. &#x27;What do you see when you turn out the light/ I can&#x27;t tell you, but I know it&#x27;s mine...&#x27; is mine.&quot; It was briefly called &quot;Bad Finger Boogie&quot; (later the inspiration for the band name Badfinger), supposedly because Lennon composed the melody on a piano using his middle finger after having hurt his forefinger.

Lennon and McCartney deliberately wrote a tune with a limited rangeexcept for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Starr to achieve. In &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, Starr explained that he insisted on changing the first linewhich originally was &quot;What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you throw ripe tomatoes at me?&quot;so that fans would not throw tomatoes at him should he perform it live (in the early days, after George Harrison made a passing comment that he liked Jelly Babies, the group was showered with them at all of their live performances).

After it was released in the United States, Maryland Governor and future Vice President Spiro T. Agnew lobbied to have the song banned because he believed it was about drug use.

==Recording==
The Beatles began recording the song on 29 March 1967, the day before they posed for the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album cover. They recorded 10 takes of the song, wrapping up sessions at 5:45 in the morning. The backing track consisted of Starr on drums, McCartney playing piano, Harrison playing lead guitar and Lennon beating a cowbell. At dawn, Starr trudged up the stairs to head home – but the other Beatles cajoled him into doing his lead vocal then and there, standing around the microphone for moral support. The following day they added tambourine, backing vocals, bass, and more electric guitar. American &quot;TeenSet&quot; editor Judith Sims interviewed each Beatle separately on the 29th as they became available. Others in the studio at various times included roadies Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, publicists Tony Barrow and Terry Doran, photographers Leslie Bryce and Frank Herrmann, and Cynthia Lennon.

==Personnel==

==Live performances==

McCartney and Starr also performed the song together on &quot;The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles&quot;, a commemorative show on 27 January 2014, that marked 50 years since the band&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964.

==Cover versions==
There have been at least 50 cover versions of the song and it has achieved the number one position on the UK Singles Chart three times: by Joe Cocker in 1968, by Wet Wet Wet in 1988, and by Sam &amp; Mark in 2004.

===Joe Cocker version===

English singer Joe Cocker&#x27;s 1968 version of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; for his album of the same name was a radical re-arrangement of the original, inspired by Cocker&#x27;s influences of Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. Recorded by Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti, it used a slower tempo than the original and deployed different chords in the middle eight while adding a lengthy instrumental introduction. The recording featured drums by Procol Harum&#x27;s B.J. Wilson, guitar lines from Jimmy Page, and organ by Tommy Eyre as well as prominent backing vocals. After recording the song, Cocker and record producer Denny Cordell brought it to Paul McCartney, who later said of the recording, &quot;it was just mind blowing, totally turned the song into a soul anthem and I was forever grateful for him for doing that.&quot;

Cocker&#x27;s version of the song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on the week of 6–12 November 1968. The version also peaked at number 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (US) on the week of 14 December, number two on the Dutch Top 40 (Netherlands) on the week of 9 November, and number one on Swiss Hitparade&#x27;s top 100 singles chart on the week of 3 December. In Belgium&#x27;s Ultratop 50 singles charts, it also peaked at number one on the Wallonia chart on the weeks of 14 and 21 December and number eight on the Flanders chart on the week of 7 December.

Cocker performed the song at Woodstock in 1969 and that performance was included in the documentary film, &quot;Woodstock&quot;. Two weeks later he performed it at the Isle of Wight Festival 1969. This version gained even more fame in 1988 when it was used as the opening theme song for the television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. In 2002 he would perform the song at the Party at the Palace held at Buckingham Palace Garden in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2014, a BBC poll saw it voted the seventh best cover song ever. In 2001, Cocker&#x27;s version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<doc id="143494" wikidata="Q821275" url="?curid=143494" title="Indira Gandhi International Airport">
<text>Indira Gandhi International Airport is the primary international airport serving New Delhi, the capital of India, and the National Capital Region (NCR). The airport, spread over an area of , is situated in Palam, Delhi, southwest of the New Delhi Railway Station and from New Delhi city centre.

Named after Indira Gandhi (1917–1984), the former Prime Minister of India, it is the busiest airport of India in terms of passenger traffic since 2009. It is also the busiest airport in the country in terms of cargo traffic. In the financial year of 2023–24, the airport handled 7.36 crore (73.6 million) passengers, the highest ever in the airport&#x27;s history. As of 2024, it is the tenth-busiest airport in the world, as per the latest rankings issued by the UK-based air consultancy firm, OAG. It is the second-busiest airport in the world by seating capacity, having a seating capacity of over 36 lakh (3.6 million) seats, and the fifth busiest airport in Asia , handling over 6.55 crore (65.5 million) passengers in 2023. In fact, it is routinely one of the busiest airports in the world, according to the Airports Council International rankings.

The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management was transferred to the Airports Authority of India. In May 2006, the management of the airport was passed over to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), a consortium led by the GMR Group. In September 2008, the airport inaugurated a runway. With the commencement of operations at Terminal 3 in 2010, it became India&#x27;s and South Asia&#x27;s largest aviation hub. The Terminal 3 building has a capacity to handle 3.4 crore (34 million) passengers annually and was the world&#x27;s 8th largest passenger terminal upon completion. The airport inaugurated a runway and the Eastern Cross Taxiways (ECT) with dual parallel taxiways in July 2023. The airport uses an advanced system called Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) to help keep takeoffs and landings timely and predictable.

The other airport serving NCR is the Hindon Airport, which is much smaller in size and primarily handles regional flights out of the city under the UDAN Scheme. The former airport, which used to be the primary airport of NCR, Safdarjung Airport is now used mainly by VVIP helicopters and small charter helicopters due to its short runway. To offset the burgeoning traffic, the construction of a new airport, Noida International Airport, is currently underway.

==History==
Palam Airport had a peak capacity of around 1,300 passengers per hour. In 1979–80, a total of 30 lakh (3 million) domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Palam Airport. Owing to an increase in air traffic in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, an additional terminal with nearly four times the area of the old Palam terminal was constructed. With the inauguration of this new international terminal, Terminal 2, on 2 May 1986, the airport was renamed as Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).

The old domestic airport (Palam) is known as Terminal 1 and was divided into separate buildings – 1A, 1B, and 1C. Blocks 1A and 1B were used to handle international operations while domestic operations took place in Block 1C. Block 1A and 1B later became dedicated terminals for domestic airlines and are currently closed down. It is planned that they will be demolished after the construction of newer terminals. Block 1C was also turned into a domestic arrivals terminal, and was rebuilt and opened on 24 February 2022. The newly constructed domestic departures block 1D is now used by all domestic low-cost airlines (IndiGo, and SpiceJet). There is also a separate technical area for VIP passengers. The domestic arrivals terminal 1C was demolished and rebuilt into a brand-new domestic arrivals terminal. For this expansion work, GoAir and select flights of IndiGo were moved to Terminal 2 as well as select flights of SpiceJet and IndiGo to Terminal 3.

In October 2001, Canada 3000 commenced a flight to Toronto. This was the first nonstop service between India and North America. Russia&#x27;s decision to open its airspace after the Cold War allowed the airline to save time by flying a direct route over the Arctic. Even though the 11 September attacks had precipitated a global decline in air travel, Canada 3000 was hoping that the service would help it improve its financial position. Nevertheless, the company collapsed one month later.

Significant growth in the Indian aviation industry led to a major increase in passenger traffic. The capacity of Terminal 1 was estimated to be 71.5 lakh (7.15 million) passengers per annum (mppa). The actual throughput for 2005/06 was an estimated 1.04 crore (10.4 million) passengers. Including the then closed down international terminal (Terminal 2), the airport had a total capacity of 1.25 crore (12.5 million) passengers per year, whereas the total passenger traffic in 2006/07 was 1.65 crore (16.5 million) passengers per year. In 2008, the total passenger count at the airport reached 2.4 crore (23.97 million). To ease the traffic congestion on the existing terminals and in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a much larger Terminal 3 was constructed and inaugurated on 3 July 2010. The new terminal&#x27;s construction took 37 months for completion and this terminal increased the airport&#x27;s total passenger capacity by 34 million.

Apart from the three budget domestic airlines handled by Terminals 1 and 2, all other airlines operate their flights from Terminal 3. In June 2022, Delhi International Airport became India&#x27;s first to run entirely on Hydro Power and solar energy.

== Ownership ==
On 31 January 2006, the aviation minister Praful Patel announced that the empowered Group of Ministers have agreed to sell the management-rights of Delhi Airport to the DIAL consortium and the Mumbai Airport to the GVK Group. On 2 May 2006, the management of Delhi and Mumbai airports were handed over to the private consortia. Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) is a consortium of the GMR Group (54% (currently 64%)), Fraport (10%) and Malaysia Airports (10% (currently no share)), and the Airports Authority of India retains a 26% stake.

Nine years later, in May 2015, Malaysia Airports chose to exit from DIAL venture and sold its entire 10% stake to majority shareholder GMR Infra for $79 million. Following this GMR Group&#x27;s stake at DIAL increased to 64%. Earlier, GMR indicated that it was interested in buying out the 10% stake of Fraport.

==Facilities==

===Runways===

Delhi Airport has four near-parallel runways: runway 11R/29L, , runway 11L/29R, , runway 10/28, , and runway 09/27, . The 09/27 runway of the Delhi Airport was the airport&#x27;s first-ever runway; the British constructed the 2,816 metre-long and 60 metre-wide runway in the pre-independence era and used it during World War II. In addition to Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow and Jaipur Airport in Jaipur, Delhi Airport is the only airport in India to have been equipped with the CAT III-B ILS, as of 2017. In the winter of 2005, there were a record number of disruptions at Delhi Airport due to fog/smog. Since then some domestic airlines have trained their pilots to operate under CAT-II conditions of a minimum visibility. On 31 March 2006, IGI became the first Indian airport to operate two runways simultaneously following a test run involving a SpiceJet plane landing on runway 28 and a Jet Airways plane taking off from runway 27 at the same time.

The initially proposed mode involving simultaneous takeoffs in westerly flow to increase handling traffic capacity caused several near misses over the west side of the airport where the centrelines of runways 10/28 and 9/27 intersect. The runway use was changed to segregate dependent mode on 25 December 2007, which was a few days after a near miss involving an Airbus A330-200 of Qatar Airways and an IndiGo A320 aircraft. The new method involved the use of runway 28 for all departures and runway 27 for all arrivals. This more streamlined model was adopted during day hours (– 2300 0600 – 2300 IST) until 24 September 2008.

On 21 August 2008, the airport inaugurated its third runway, 11R/29L, costing ₹1,000 crore and long. The runway has one of the world&#x27;s longest paved threshold displacements of . This, in turn decreases the available landing length on runway 29L to . The reason for the long threshold displacement is due to the presence of a 263 m high Shiv statue, which is located near runway 29L. The runway increased the airport&#x27;s capacity to handle up to 100 flights from the previous 45–60 flights per hour. The new runway was opened for commercial operations on 25 September 2008 and gradually began full round-the-clock operations by the end of October of the same year.

Since 2012, all three runways were operated simultaneously to handle traffic during day hours. Only runways 11R/29L and 10/28 are operated during night (2300–0600 IST) hours with single runway landing restriction during westerly traffic flow that is rotated late night (0300 IST) and reversed weekly to distribute and mitigate night time landing noise over nearby residential areas.

To cater for the demand of increasing air traffic, the master plan for the construction of a fourth parallel runway next to the existing runway 11R/29L was cleared in 2017. along with the Eastern Cross Taxiways (ECT) - a pair of elevated parallel taxiways linking the northern part of the airport with the southern runways. It will be elevated as it will pass over the airport approach roads. It will be long and both the taxiways will be wide, with a wide gap separating the taxiways, making it capable of handling Airbus A380 and Boeing 747 type aircraft. It will help flights reducing duration to reach the southern runways from 9–10 minutes to only two minutes, as well as reducing pollution and traffic. The fourth runway and the ECT was inaugurated on 14 July 2023.

==Terminals==

IGI Airport serves as a major hub or a focus destination for several Indian carriers including Air India, Alliance Air, IndiGo, and SpiceJet. Approximately 80 airlines serve this airport. At present, there are three actively scheduled passenger terminals, as well as a cargo terminal.

In 2021, DIAL introduced an e-boarding facility for passengers at all the three terminals of the airport, by which all boarding gates will have contactless e-boarding gates with boarding card scanners, which will allow passengers to flash their physical or e-boarding cards to verify flight details in order to proceed for security checks.
Terminal 3 is an integrated terminal used for both international and domestic flights. The Indian carriers operating international flights are Air India, IndiGo, and SpiceJet.
The domestic side of Terminal 3 is used by Air India, Air India Express, and select flights of SpiceJet and IndiGo.
Select flights of IndiGo use Terminal 2 for their domestic operations.

===Currently operational terminals===
====Terminal 1====
Terminal 1 is used by the low cost domestic carriers, such as SpiceJet and IndiGo. In 2022, Terminal 1D was fully expanded with an arrivals hall, with the goal of enhancing its annual passenger handling capacity from the previous 1.8 crore (18 million) to 4 crore (40 million).

====Terminal 2====
Terminal 2 was opened on 1 May 1986, at a cost of 95 crores and was used for international flights until July 2010 when operations shifted to Terminal 3. After this, the terminal remained operational for only three months per year catering to Hajj flights. In 2017, after revamping Terminal 2 at a cost of 100 crores, DIAL shifted all operations of GoAir and select operations of IndiGo to that terminal in order to continue expansion work of Terminal 1.

====Terminal 3====


Designed by HOK working in consultation with Mott MacDonald, Terminal 3 is a two-tier building spread over an area of 54 lakh (5.4 million) square feet (approx 502,000 square metre ) making it the world&#x27;s 15th largest terminal in the world, with the lower floor being the arrivals area, and the upper floor being a departures area. This terminal has 168 check-in counters, 78 aerobridges at 48 contact stands, 54 parking bays, 95 immigration counters, 18 X-ray screening areas, shorter waiting times, duty-free shops, and other features.The international flights leave from gates 1-26 (gates 2, 4, 6 are bus gates) and the domestic flights leave from gates 27-62 (gates 42, 44 are bus gates) This new terminal was timed to be completed for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which was held in Delhi and is connected to Delhi by an eight-lane Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway and the Delhi Metro through its Airport Express (Orange Line). The terminal was officially inaugurated on 3 July 2010. All international airlines shifted their operations to the new terminal in late July 2010 and all full service domestic carriers in November 2010. The arrival area is equipped with 14 baggage carousels. Terminal 3 has India&#x27;s first automated parking management and guidance system in a multi-level car park, which comprises seven levels and a capacity of 4,300 cars. Terminal 3 forms the first phase of the airport expansion which tentatively includes the construction of additional passenger and cargo terminals (Terminal 4, 5, and 6).

Domestic full-service airlines Air India operates from Terminal 3. Air India Express, although a low cost airline, also operates its domestic flights from this terminal. Some flights of SpiceJet and IndiGo were also shifted to Terminal 3 temporarily for the expansion of Terminal 1.

On 16 December 2024, the Indira Gandhi International airport became the first in India to connect directly to 150 airports or destinations — both domestic and international — with the launch of a Thai AirAsia X direct flight between Delhi and Bangkok’s Don Mueang airport.

====General Aviation Terminal====
India&#x27;s first general aviation terminal was commissioned in this airport in September 2020. The terminal caters to support the movement and processing of passengers flying through chartered flights or private jets from the airport.

====Air cargo complex====
The air cargo complex is located at a distance of from Terminal 3. It consists of separate brownfield and greenfield cargo terminals. The cargo operations at the brownfield terminal are managed by Celebi Delhi Cargo Management India Pvt. Ltd., which is a joint venture between Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) and the Turkish company Celebi Ground Handling (CGH). CGH was awarded the contract to develop, modernise, and finance the existing cargo terminal and to operate the terminal for a period of twenty-five years by DIAL in November 2009. It started its operations in June 2010. In addition to the existing terminal, a new greenfield terminal is being developed in phases by Delhi Cargo Service Centre (DCSC), also a joint venture between DIAL and Cargo Service Center (CSC). The greenfield cargo terminal project consists of two terminals built over a plot of 48,000 square metres and 28,500 square metres, respectively. Phase 1A of the project has been completed and is fully operational. Once the entire project is completed, these two new terminals will have an annual handling capacity of 12.5 lakh (1.25 million) tonnes. The cargo operations of the airport received &quot;e-Asia 2007&quot; award in 2007 for &quot;Implementation of e-Commerce / Electronic Data Interchange in Air Cargo Sector&quot;.

===Previous terminals===
Terminal 1A

Terminal 1A was built in 1982 as a temporary structure for international VIPs arriving for the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Delhi. After the event, the building was unused until Indian Airlines started operating Airbus A320 operations in 1988. It had to be refurbished after a fire gutted the interiors in October 1996 and DIAL significantly upgraded the terminal. The terminal was closed after Air India shifted operations to the new Terminal 3 on 11 November 2010. DIAL had earlier planned to use the terminal for Haj operations as well as for charter planes; however, it never materialised. The terminal lay unused until 2018, when DIAL decided to demolish it.

Terminal 1B

Terminal 1B was also built in the late 1980s and was used only for domestic departures. Upon the opening of the new domestic departures Terminal 1D in 2009, Terminal 1B was closed and is expected to be demolished on the completion of newer terminals.

Terminal 1C
Terminal 1C was also built in the late 1980s and was used only for domestic arrivals. The terminal has been upgraded with a newly expanded greeting area and a larger luggage reclaim area with eight belts. Terminal 1C was shut down, torn, and rebuilt into a brand new domestic arrivals hall on 24 February 2022.

Terminal 1D

Terminal 1D was developed by DIAL and inaugurated on 27 February 2009 as a domestic departures terminal with a total floor space of and a capacity to handle 1.5 crore (15 million) passengers per year. The terminal commenced operations on 19 April 2009. It has 72 Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE) enabled check-in counters, 16 self check-in counters, and 16 security channels.

==Connectivity==

IGI complex has four passenger terminals, one cargo terminal and a commercial Aerocity. These are the Terminal 1 in the northeast corner for the domestic flights, Aerocity commercial hub in the southeast corner, co-located in Terminal 2 (for domestic budget airlines) and Terminal 3 (international flights) in the southwest corner, cargo terminal between Terminal 3 and Aerocity.

Delhi Aerocity metro station is the main interconnectivity hub for the IGI on Yellow Line (operational) and Golden Line (expected completion by March 2026), with the existing NH48 and existing Dwarka Expressway next to it. Also adjacent to it are the proposed Aerocity ISBT (west of the Aerocity metro station), underground Delhi Aerocity RRTS on Delhi–Alwar Regional Rapid Transit System (expected completion by December 2024, east of the Aerocity metro station), proposed at-grade Automatic People Mover (APM) light rail for moving passengers between various terminals within the restricted area, and under-construction Aerocity Passenger Transport Centre (PTC) (east of the Aerocity metro station) for connectivity via autorickshaw, ride hailing bikes and cars, etc. The upgraded Bijwasan railway station (expected completion by December 2024) is adjacent to the Dwarka Sector 21 metro interchange station on Orange and Blue Line, and Bijwasan railway station will connect to the Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor (expected completion by March 2025) via the Patli railway station in the south.

=== Air train ===
In September 2024, DIAL issued tenders for an elevated cum at-grade Automated People Mover (APM) system to be completed by the end of 2027. The 7.7 km line will have four stops — T2/3, T1, Aerocity and cargo city. This line will be the first APM at an Indian airport and is proposed to be implemented on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model.

=== Metro rail===
IGI complex has three metro stations. Terminal 1 in the northeast corner of IGI Complex is served by the Terminal 1-IGI Airport metro station on the Magenta Line of Delhi Metro.

Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 are co-located in the southwest. Both are served by the same IGI Airport metro station on the Orange Line (Airport Express Line), which runs from New Delhi metro station (Connects to Yellow Line and New Delhi Railway Station) to Dwarka Sector 21 metro station (connects to Blue Line, Bijwasan railway station and Dwarka ISBT Bus Terminal) and IICC - Dwarka Sector 25 metro station (India International Convention and Expo Centre, will be further extended to Gurgaon), with trains running every 10 minutes. Dwarka Sector 21 metro station, west of IGI, is the metro interchange of Orange and Blue Line. Kirti Nagar to Bamnoli Metrolite, proposed light metro, will interchange at IICC - Dwarka Sector 25 metro station for connectivity to the airport. Bamnoli will also be connected further south to Rapid Metro Gurgaon (at Rezang La Chowk in Palam Vihar) via the existing IICC - Dwarka Sector 25 metro station (India International Convention and Expo Centre). East of IGI, the line connects to the Yellow Line and New Delhi Railway Station at New Delhi Station. The line also links the Pink Line at Dhaula Kuan (Walkover Bridge between Dhaula Kuan and Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus Station).

Delhi Aerocity metro station in southeast corner of IGI, between Terminal 1 and Terminals 2 and 3 metro stations, is the metro interchange of Orange and Magenta lines. Metro Phase-IV is extending the Magenta Line further east from Arocity Metro to Tuglakabad, via Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli Archaeological Park, with expected completion by 2026.

===Railways===

Bijwasan railway station, immediately to the west of IGI on the Delhi–Jaipur line, is being upgraded to a major world-class regional multimodal transport hub. Construction for ₹270.83 crore project started in 2022 and is scheduled to be completed in 2024.

Hisar International Airport-IGI Airport line (HIAIGI Line) will directly connect IGI with Hisar Airport. In the first phase, the missing Garhi Harsaru-Farukhnagar–Jhajjar rail link will be constructed. In the second phase, a short Hisar Airport rail line spur from the Jakhal–Hisar line to Hisar Airport will be constructed.

Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor (HORC) connects to the Delhi–Jaipur line at Patli railway station few kilometres south of Bijwasan. HORC will also provide direct rail connectivity to the Noida Airport via the Palwal-Jewar rail spur.

Another smaller station near IGI on the Delhi–Jaipur line is the Palam railway station, located north of Bijwasan station and northeast of IGI, and from Terminals 1 and 3 respectively. Several suburban passenger trains run regularly between these stations.

===Roads and expressways===
The airport, which lies in south Delhi near the border with Haryana state, is connected to Delhi in the north and Gurgaon in Haryana in the south by two expressways, both of which have eight lanes, the older and busier 27.7 km long at-grade Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway NH 48 (part of Delhi-Jaipur National Highway) which runs through Gurgaon and the newer 26.7 km long elevated Dwarka Expressway NH-248BB which passes west of Gurgaon. The Dwarka Expressway begins and ends at NH-48 DELHI-Jaipur acting as a western bypass to Gurgaon. It begins immediately east of IGI airport at Shiv Murti and terminates in Haryana near Kherki Daula Toll Plaza, south of Gurgaon, near Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE).

WPE in turn connects, listed from west to east, IGI to Delhi–Ambala–Amritsar NH 1, Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway, NH9 Delhi-Hisar (Hisar Airport 150 km west of IGI), Delhi–Jaipur NH-48, Gurgaon–Sohna Elevated Expressway, Delhi–Mumbai Expressway, Faridabad–Noida–Ghaziabad Expressway (FNG), Palwal-Jewar Airport Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), etc.

Urban Extension Road-II, a 75.7 km-long six-lane expressway, connects the IGI airport to the south, southwest and western suburbs of Delhi as well as to the Delhi-Hisar NH-9.

===Buses===

As of 2024, two Inter-State Bus Terminals (ISBT) for long-distance buses are being constructed for the IGI.

* Aerocity Inter State Bus Terminus (Aerocity ISBT), adjacent to the Aerocity Metro Interchange Station near Terminal 1 of IGI, proposed in 2023, with IGI complex.
* Dwarka Dwarka Inter State Bus Terminus (Dwarka ISBT), adjacent and west of &quot;Dwarka Sector 21 metro station&quot;, construction started on 27 acres in 2022, will cater to buses from Haryana and Punjab. It is also close to Bijwasan railway station. It is 11 km west of IGI T3.
* Gurgaon Inter State Bus Terminus, announced in 2023 over 15 acres of Sihi village near Kherki Daula toll plaz where Dwarka Expressway meets Delhi-Jaipur Highway NH48. Will cater to the buses from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. It is 28 km south of IGI.

===Local transport===

Air conditioned low-floor buses operated by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) regularly run between the airport and the city.

Metered taxis are also available from Terminals 1 and 3 to all areas of Delhi.

===Alternate airports nearby===
Under the National Capital Region Transport Plan, the following international airports are being developed as an alternate to IGI:

* Hisar International Airport, 190 km west of IGI. In April 2023, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar approved the Hisar International Airport-IGI Airport line (HIAIGI Line) rail link between IGI and Hisar airport via Bijwasan-Gurgaon-Garhi Harsaru-Sultanpur-Farukhnagar-Jhajjar, Rohtak-Hansi-Hisar.
* Noida International Airport, 100 km southeast.

==Awards==
In 2010, IGIA was conferred the fourth best airport award in the world in the 1.5–2.5 crore (15–25 million) category, and &quot;Most Improved Airport&quot; in the Indo-Pacific Region by Airports Council International. The airport was rated as the &quot;Best Airport in the world&quot; in the 2.5–4 crore (25–40 million) passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International. It was awarded &quot;The Best Airport in Central Asia&quot; and &quot;Best Airport Staff in Central Asia&quot; at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015. It also stood first in the new rankings for 2015 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards conducted by Airports Council International.

The airport, along with Mumbai Airport, was adjudged as the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Airport&quot; at the Airport Service Quality Awards 2017, in the highest category of airports handling more than 4 crore (40 million) passengers annually. The airport was awarded the &quot;best airport&quot; in Asia-Pacific in 2020 (over 4 crore (40 million) passengers per annum) by the Airports Council International. In 2023, the airport was awarded as the &quot;Cleanest Airport in the Asia-Pacific Region&quot; and also stood first again in the rankings for 2022 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards in the category of over 4 crore (40 million) passengers per annum, conducted by Airports Council International.

== Future expansion ==
The newer domestic arrivals and departures terminals 1C and 1D, respectively, have been connected and expanded into a singular domestic terminal which are now known as simply, Terminal 1, capable of handling up to 40 million annual passengers.

Terminals 4, 5, and 6 will be built at a later stages which will be triggered by growth in passenger traffic. Once completed, all international flights will move to these three new terminals. Terminal 3 will then be solely used for handling domestic air traffic. A new cargo handling building is also planned. According to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), these new terminals will increase the airport&#x27;s annual passenger volume capacity to 10 crore (100 million).

DIAL submitted a plan in 2016 to the then aviation secretary R N Choubey regarding the expansion of the airport with a new fourth runway and Terminal 4 in a phased manner. The Master Plan of Airport in 2016 was then reviewed and updated by DIAL in consultation with the Airports Authority of India. According to the plan, the terminal construction should have started after the fourth runway was completed and Terminal 1 was expanded. However, the conversion and expansion of Terminal 2 into a fully-international terminal has been put on halt and postponed.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 1970: The pilot of a Royal Nepal Airlines Fokker F27-200 (9N-AAR) lost control due to severe thunderstorms and downdrafts, crashing just short of the runway. The plane was landing after a flight from Kathmandu, Nepal. Of the five crew and 18 passengers, one crew member was killed.
* 1972: Japan Air Lines Flight 471 crashed outside of Palam Airport, killing 82 of 87 occupants; ten of eleven crew members and 72 of 76 passengers died, and three people on the ground.

* On 29 August 1978, Air India Flight 123, a Boeing 747-237B (registered VT-EBO), flying from Delhi to Frankfurt carrying 377 passengers and crew, aborted take-off at 150 knots due to No. 3 engine failure. While the crew hit the brakes and deployed thrust reversers, the plane veered off the runway and entered soft ground resulting in left-hand wing landing gear collapse and substantial damage, as No.3 and 4 reversers were not effective. The No. 3 engine failed due to ingestion of tire pieces. The plane sustained substantial damaged but was repaired and put back to service.
* 1988: An Air France Boeing 747 on 24 July 1988 at 0124hrs flying as flight AF187 from Delhi to Paris Charles de Gaulle carrying 275 people (260 passengers and 15 crew) suffered an accident during take-off at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The copilot was pilot flying. During takeoff the aircraft attained V1 speed (156 kts). 2.5 seconds later the No. 4 engine fire warning came on. The copilot rejected the takeoff at a speed of 172 kts, which was past the safe limit for the aircraft which was at the threshold of its maximum take off weight. The aircraft overran the runway, causing the main gear to collapse and damage to the nose section and undercarriage as the aircraft veered left at the end of the runway as it slid and struck lighting and radar equipment. There was no fire in No. 4 engine it was found. There were no fatalities and one minor injury as passengers evacuated the aircraft on slides. The aircraft was repaired over a period of 6 months on site at Delhi and put back in service.
* 1990: An Air India Boeing 747 flying on the London-Delhi-Mumbai route and carrying 215 people (195 passengers and 20 crew) touched down at Indira Gandhi International Airport after a flight from London Heathrow Airport. On application of reverse thrust, a failure of the no. 1 engine pylon to wing attachment caused this engine to tilt nose down. Hot exhaust gases caused a fire on the left-wing. There were no casualties but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off.
*1993: An Uzbekistan Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 that had been leased by Indian Airlines due to an ongoing pilot strike flipped over and caught fire while landing in bad weather. There were no fatalities, but the aircraft was destroyed by a post-crash fire.
* 1994: A Sahara Airlines Boeing 737-2R4C (registered VT-SIA) crashed while performing a training flight killing all four people on board and one person on the ground. Wreckage struck an Aeroflot Ilyushin-86 (registered RA-86119) parked nearby, killing four people inside.
* 1995: Indian Airlines Flight 492 (IC 492), a Boeing 737-2A8 (Registered VT-ECS), was damaged beyond repair when the aircraft overshot the runway at Delhi Airport due to pilot error, on its scheduled flight from Jaipur to Delhi.
* 1996: The airport was involved in the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision when a Saudia Boeing 747-100B, climbing out after take-off, collided with an incoming Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 chartered by a fashion company, causing the deaths of all 349 people on board the two planes.
* On 24 December 1999, Indian Airlines Flight 814 bound for Delhi was hijacked. The plane was taken to Pakistan, Afghanistan and the UAE. After the turn of the millennium, the plane was allowed to go back to Delhi. One passenger was killed.
* On 17 December 2009, Air India One, a Boeing 747-400 (registered as VT-EVA), operating as an executive flight for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Delhi to Copenhagen, was hit by an by a food delivery trolley shortly before it was scheduled for takeoff. The Prime Minister took off on a substitute Boeing 747-400 aircraft after a delay of three hours.
* On 10 November 2016, Air India Flights 142 from Paris and 154 from Vienna, both Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners heading to Delhi, were nearly involved in a midair collision 12 nautical miles away from the airport, due to conflicting instructions from TCAS and ATC. The incident prompted a DGCA and AAIB investigation, which concluded that the breach of separation between the two aircraft occurred due to incorrect label management, wrong separation technique for sequencing of arrival aircraft and inadequate surveillance.
* 28 June 2024: A portion of the roof of Terminal 1 collapsed on parked vehicles amid heavy rains in the early morning. One person was killed and eight were injured.

<text>Cajemé (born José María Bonifacio Leyba Pérez, May 14, 1835 – April 23, 1887) was a Yaqui military leader in the Mexican state of Sonora. Cajemé or Kahe&#x27;eme means &#x27;one who does not stop to drink [water]&#x27; in the Yaqui language and was originally a clan name, used by Cajemé&#x27;s father.

==Biography==
Cajemé was born José María Bonifacio Leyba Perez on May 14, 1835, in Hermosillo, Sonora. His birthdate is sometimes given as 1837, due to an initial error by his biographer Ramón Corral. Cajemé&#x27;s father, Fernando Leiva, was born in Hermosillo in 1798 and his mother, Juana Maria Peres, was born in Potam, Sonora.

===California Gold Rush===

At the age of 14, Cajemé accompanied his father, Fernando, and many other Yaqui people from Sonora, during the 1849 Gold Rush to Upper California. Cajemé and his father returned to Sonora about two years later. Cajemé seems to have learned English at that time, as well as having his first experience in defending himself against armed conflict. In spite of statements to the contrary, his father Fernando evidently did well in the gold fields, as his son was enrolled in an exclusive private school, the only school at the time in Guaymas, and one of only 20 schools in the State of Sonora in the 1850s. This was the Colegio Sonora operated by Cayetano Navarro, Prefect of Guaymas. Cajemé subsequently learned to read and write Spanish. Corral correctly states that Cajemé was 16 to 18 years of age during his time attending school, supporting the actual 1835 year of his birth.

===Military Experience===

Cajemé had his first taste of military battle in 1854, while serving with the &quot;Urbanos,&quot; the local militia of Guaymas, which was organized by his teacher, Cayetano Navarro. This occurred when a plot to seize control of Sonora was carried out under the leadership of Count (&quot;Comte&quot; in French) Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon, who had two years earlier tried to seized the city of Hermosillo by force, and had been repelled in that attempt after they had captured Hermosillo.

At 14:30 hours on July 13, 1854, the battle began, with the Count&#x27;s forces attacking the defenders of the Guaymas town square. The attackers numbered more than 350 French, Germans and Chileans under the Count&#x27;s leadership. After fighting the Mexican forces for about two hours, the invaders began to retreat. After seeing all of the men that Raousset-Boulbon had lost in the fighting, the French vice-consul, Joseph Calvo, came and requested his intervention to make peace. Calvo promised protection to all who took refuge under his flag, but hesitated for some time before extending this to include Raousset. Under the command of General José María Yáñez, the Urbanos and the other Mexican forces in Guaymas were victorious.

Raousset-Boulbon surrendered his army, asking for no other condition than to respect their lives. The surrender took place at 18:00 hours the same day, giving 313 prisoners being counted among them Count Raousset-Boulbon. The Mexican Army collected 310 rifles, 10 shotguns, 7 swords, 6 flags, a campaign banner and a forge. The losses suffered by both sides included 48 dead and 78 injured foreigners, with 19 dead and 57 wounded Mexican combatants. Gaston Rausset-Boulbon was sentenced to death, with the execution taking place in Guaymas, on August 12, 1854, in an area located in the north of the town square. Captain Francis M. Espino led the firing squad. See also de Collet La Madelène, 1876, pp. 266–304).

Now 18 years of age, Cajemé looked for new opportunities in life, and traveled to Tepic, where he worked for a short time as a blacksmith. Later, he was caught up in the draft for soldiers to serve in the regular army, the San Blas Battalion, but deserted after only three months of service. He fled to the mountains near Acaponeta, Nayarit, and worked for a while as a miner. With the Federal army still searching for him, he traveled to Mazatlán and joined a battalion comprising Pimas, Yaquis, and Opatas, that was part of the ranks of Pablo Lagarma, a Mexican insurgent, who had declared for constitutional restoration.

Not long afterward, Cajemé began service in as a trooper in the army of General Ramón Corona. Due to his previous military experience, and the ability to speak three languages, he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Corona. He ended up participating in the War of Reform, and against the forces of the French Intervention of Emperor Maximilian. It was General Corona that accepted the sword of surrender from Emperor Maximilian at Querétaro on 15 May 1867. Eventually, he came to serve in the forces under , who came to value him as a competent, well educated and trilingual officer, and who eventually commissioned him as a captain in the cavalry.

===Appointment as Alcalde Mayor===

Having successfully served in the Mexican military in the war against the French occupation, Cajemé&#x27;s service proved so exemplary that in 1872 he was appointed to the office of Alcalde Mayor of the Yaqui by then Sonora Governor Ignacio Pesqueira. Expected by Pesqueira to assist in pacifying the Yaqui people, he instead united the eight Yaqui pueblo into a small, independent republic and unexpectedly announced he would not recognize the Mexican government unless his people were allowed to independently govern themselves. Cajemé took on the role of a social reformer, he reorganized the administrative system of Yaqui society and life back to a state that had existed when there was far greater autonomy and self-sufficiency for the Yaqui people. This was based it to a large extent on the earlier Yaqui system (Mayors, Captains, Temastianes etc.). He re-established the popular assemblies, summoning them whenever it was necessary to rely on the entire population. Restructuring and disciplining Yaqui society to provide economic security and military preparedness, Cajemé instituted a system of taxation, and external trade control, initially establishing a tax on the ships that traded in the Yaqui River. To impose a toll on commercial traffic on its territory, in particular those who traded salt extracted from the coasts of the Yaqui nation, and to demand a premium from the cattle owners who the Yaquis stole cattle from, upon their return. All these economic sources allowed them to procure arms and ammunition, and also to develop agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing. This was all for the welfare and defense of the new nation against those that would take away the Yaqui&#x27;s traditional lands.

===Cajemé&#x27;s Rebellion Against Mexican Authority===

Due to Mexican government opposition to Yaqui self-government, Cajemé was forced to lead the Yaqui in a war against the Mexican state and those who sought to control and confiscate the traditional Yaqui lands. The war was long-lasting due to the skill of the Yaqui in battle under Cajemé&#x27;s leadership, and was particularly brutal, with atrocities on both sides, but with a much larger-scale slaughter by the military forces of the Mexican government under President Porfirio Díaz.

One of the many battles during this period was the Battle of Capetamaya, which took place on October 15, 1882. Cajemé, as he was now known, was holding a meeting with the indigenous Mayo in the vicinity of a place called Capetamaya in Sonora. Colonel Augustine Ortiz, who was a landowner in the area of the Mayo people, and who was also the brother of then governor of Sonora Carlos Ortiz, who had succeeded Pesqueira, attacked the assembly with elements of the Mexican Army. Ortiz reported that about Yaqui and Mayo 2,000 soldiers led by Cajemé faced his group of 300 men. The Yaqui&#x27;s forces were scattered after losing 200 men, and Cajemé was wounded, losing part of his right index finger. The attack was seen by many as unnecessary, and led to public criticism against the new governor and his brother, which became so intense that it resulted in the dismissal of Carlos Ortiz as governor of Sonora

Cajemé, when traveling with his Yaqui soldiers, would often sing in Spanish at the head of his troops. Riding on a horse, he would hook his leg around the pommel of his saddle, and sing a song of bravery and lack of fear of the Mexican army. He would have two men with him, one on each side, and would be followed by approximately thirty more men on horseback, arranged in groups of ten, spaced some distance apart. Following at the rear of the column would be the infantry, composed of 100 or more troops.

In 1885, one of Cajemé&#x27;s lieutenants, Loreto Molina, sought to gain control of the Yaqui people. With the support of the Mexican authorities, Molina developed an assassination plot to kill Cajemé at Cajemé&#x27;s own home, at El Guamuchli, near Pótam. On the evening of 28 January 1885, Molina and twenty-two of his Yaqui supporters (some accounts state 30 or more) set out to kill Cajemé, but Cajemé was not at home, having left for the Mayo River with his bodyguard the day before. Cajemé stated that Molina&#x27;s men looted his house, abused the women of the household by beating them with their weapons, and tearing off some of their clothes, and ran off Cajemé&#x27;s family, leaving Cajemé&#x27;s eight-year-old daughter on the bed in the house, while setting fire his house. One of Cajemé&#x27;s sergeants saved the girl out of the flames of the fire, as the house burned to the ground. Among others named by Cajemé as participants in the attack. were the following men:

*Loreto Cuate
*Angél Cuchi
*Agustín Guapo
*Trenidad Guapo
*Francisco Guabesi
*Pancho Juchaji
*Martín Mobesbeo
*Modesto el panadero (the baker)
*hermano de (brother of) Modesto
*Lucio Nasario
*Antonio Ochocomasoleo
*Loreto Omocol
*Nacho Pelado
*Madaleno Quintero
*Luis Sanbaon
*Nacho Suboqui
*José Suple
*José Tolo
*Facundo Yorigelipe
*Ilario Yorigelipe
*Juan María Yorigelipe
*Liandra Yorigelipe

After Molina failed to kill Cajemé, the Mexican Government sent a force of three columns of 1200 men each to occupy the Yaqui territory. This force was originally under the command of Brigadier General Jose Guillermo Carbó (1841–1885), who had been appointed in 1881 as Commander of the First Military Zone comprising Sonora, Baja California, Sinaloa, and Tepic It was thought that this was an advantageous time to move against the Yaquis, as the situation was relatively calm. A military report on the first of September stated that Cajemé had dissolved his troops, and many indigenous people were approaching ranchos near the Yaqui River in search of work, while raids on ranchos had stopped. Also, there was optimism that the potential for disagreements between Cajemé and Anastasio Cuca, Cajemé&#x27;s second in command, would increase, and that it would not be remote if a split occurred between them. However, before Carbó could lead the government forces into an engagement, he died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage on October 29, 1885. Following this, General Ángel Martínez known as &quot;El Machetero&quot; (&quot;The Machete&quot;) was placed in control of these three columns.


Under General Martínez, the Mexican forces moved on the Yaqui River pueblos. Hubert Howe Bancroft relates (1888) how one of the columns was led by General Leiva (no relation to Cajemé) and General Marcos Carillo, and traveled west towards the Yaqui River Valley, carrying two mitrailleuse, which was the first machine gun used in major combat. Another was led by General Camano, and came from the south-east with two howitzers. A heavy body of cavalry came from the town of Buena Vista, from the north-east. General Martinez personally directed the occupation of the strategic Yaqui pueblo of Torím and other areas of the Yaqui River Valley from his headquarters at Barojica. General Bonifacio Topete eventually took control of a large part of the force and attempted to overrun a major fortification that the Yaqui built near Vícam. The fort, &quot;El Añil&quot; (The Indigo), was the first use of defensive warfare by Cajemé, and consisted of fences, parapets, and a moat surrounding the fortification. Although Topete&#x27;s infantry force used cannons against the Yaqui forces in the attack, Topete was defeated with a loss of 20 men. Following this successful repulsion of the Mexican forces, Cajemé gave the order to his forces to fortify other locations and to fight only while behind trenches. In April 1886, the Mexican forces occupied the Yaqui town of Cócorit; and on May 5, 1886, a major siege was begun by the Mexican army at El Añil. By May 16, the Mexican army destroyed the fortification at El Añil, which was a great defeat for the Yaquis.

===Betrayal===
Eventually, Cajemé was betrayed by a Yaqui woman, who was loyal to Loreto Molina, a Yaqui who was opposed to waging an insurgency against the Mexican government, as well as to other Yaquis opposed to resisting Mexican authority, Cajemé was captured while visiting family members in the pueblo of San José de Guaymas (about 8 miles north of the Port of Guaymas) on April 13, 1887. Cajemé was kept under house arrest by General Angel Martínez. He was treated with all of the respect and courtesy accorded to a defeated leader of a country while under arrest. Cajemé was extensively interviewed by Ramón Corral, who was elected Vice-Governor of Sonora on April 25, 1887, and who later became Governor of Sonora, eventually rising to the office of Vice President of Mexico under Porfirio Diaz. It was during this time that Cajemé&#x27;s famous saying was recorded: &quot;Antes como antes y ahora como ahora. Antes éramos enemigos y peleábamos, Ahora está Todo concluido y todos somos amigos (Before was before and now is now. Before we were enemies and we fought; now everything is concluded and all can be friends)&quot; At least two photos were taken of Cajemé during his arrest, in both traditional Mexican campesino garb (as shown in the first photo), as well as in a dark blue military jacket that he was known to wear when fighting. In both photos he is seen holding a Carbine, and carrying a white-handled Colt revolver.

===Execution===

Following his interview, Cajemé was taken from Guaymas bay by the &quot;Demócrata,&quot; a steam-powered, coal-fired, iron-hulled, schooner-rigged gunboat, with one funnel and three masts, to the Yaqui River port of El Médano, near Pótam. Cajemé was then paraded through several of the Yaqui pueblos along the river, showing the people that the leader of the Yaqui had been captured. At eleven in the morning, on the return trip to Guaymas, a pretense was made that Cajemé was trying to escape his guard. He was shot seven times, causing his death at Tres Cruces de Chumampaco. An American reporter for the Tucson Daily Citizen (1887) visited the site of his death, and found Cajemé&#x27;s hat was nailed to a tree, and a wooden cross inscribed with the following: &quot;INRI, aque fallecio General Cajemé, Abril 23, 1887, a los 11 y 5 la manaña&quot; (INRI Here died General Cajemé, April 23, 1887, at 11:05 in the morning).

Cajemé&#x27;s body was given to Tomás Durante, leader of the Yaqui people residing at Cócorit, and those Yaqui loyal to Cajemé reverently buried him at Cócorit. Following this incident, General Martinez ordered an investigation of the actions of his young Lieutenant, Clemente Patiño (born November 1861 who was in charge of the detachment that had escorted Cajemé.

===Events Following Cajemé&#x27;s Death===

On 20 May 1887, Anastasio Cuca, Cajemé&#x27;s second in command, was captured at Tucson, Arizona. He was extradited to Sonora at the request of Sonora Governor Tórres. Cuca was charged with murder and robbery in the District of Guaymas, and then taken to the Yaqui River and executed in front of his people. Afterward, Juan Maldonado Waswechia (Beltran), also known as Tetabiate (&quot;Tetaviecti&quot;, meaning &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in the Yaqui or Yoeme language), took over in leading the fighting against the Mexican forces, becoming Cajemé&#x27;s successor in June 1887 By this time, the devastation to the Yaqui population along the Yaqui river was great. At the direction of the Government of Sonora, a count was taken of the number of indigenous inhabitants still living in the Yaqui Pueblos of Cócorit, Tórim, and El Médano in late 1887. The count showed that there were only 1784 men and 2200 women still living in the three towns.

For many years following Cajemé&#x27;s death there were strenuous efforts by the Mexican government to kill or remove all the Yaqui from the state of Sonora. Much of the Yaqui nation was illegally enslaved and sent to work as slave laborers in the Yucatán Peninsula, in the Quintana Roo, where thousands died laboring in the henequen plantations. Many more were simply killed, usually by firing squad or by hanging. Many Yaqui fled to neighboring Mexican states, submerging their identity with that of other Indian groups. Quite a few Yaqui fled to Southern Arizona, the traditional Northernmost region of their territory, where many of their descendants live today.

===Cajemé&#x27;s families===
It is known that Cajemé was married at least two times. His first wife was María Jesus Salgado Ramires. It appears that this was a traditional Yaqui marriage, as it does not appear to be recorded in the historic Roman Catholic Church records. Cajemé and María had two children, both born in Hermosillo: a son, Sotero Emiliano Leiva Salgado, born in 1863, and a daughter, Victoria Leiva Salgado, born in 1866 Mexican newspaper articles mention Cajemé&#x27;s son from this marriage leading Yaqui soldiers in the fight against the Mexican forces, or fighting alongside his father in the years 1885 and 1886, as well as his daughter leading some raids. His last appearance in the historical record that has been located is on May 4, 1889, where Emiliano Leiva is listed as a Padrino at the baptism of his sister, Victoria Leiva&#x27;s, first child. Victoria was in 1885 noted (but not by name) as the daughter of Cajemé (Newark Daily Advocate, 1885). Victoria married a well-known businessman from Montmorenci, Indiana, in the United States, named William E. Godman. Godman was working as a &quot;ferrocarrilero,&quot; and had been living in Sonora since 1884. The marriage took place in Guaymas, on December 17, 1887, at the home of Don Antonio Moreno, a Senator from Sonora who was largely responsible for pushing through the development of the Sonora Railway. The marriage occurred just eight months after the death of Cajemé. With the aide of her husband William, Victoria, along with her mother María, and her older brother Emiliano, were able to escape the continued persecution of the Yaqui people in Sonora. Godman and his family traveled first to the state of Chihuahua. The family returned to Sonora in 1892, and finally, in January 1900, entered the United States of America at El Paso, Texas, not long after the infamous massacre of Yaquis at Mazocoba, in the heart of the Bacatete Mountains of Sonora. Godman eventually left Victoria and his daughters in El Paso and re-married. At the start of the Mexican Revolution Godman relocated to Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, where he accepted a position as Port Superintendent for the International Railways of Central America (I.R.C.A.), a subsidiary of the United Fruit Company. Victoria died on August 5, 1946, in Los Angeles, California, having had four children and four grandchildren. 

Cajemé&#x27;s second marriage was to María Jesús Maccima Matus Morales on June 14, 1878, recorded at San Fernando, Guaymas, Sonora. Dolores Salgado, the father of Cajemé&#x27;s first wife, was one of the godparents (padrinos) of María Jesús Maccima Matus Morales at the time of her baptism on November 20, 1842. There were at least two children born to this union, the youngest being a son (&quot;joven,&quot;), and also a daughter. This family appears to be the one that Loreto Molina and his followers ran off, burning their home near Pótam in 1885.

===Municipality of Cajeme===
Following the death of Cajemé, the Yaqui struggled to maintain control of their traditional lands. However, by 1890, with most of the Yaqui removed from the Yaqui River Valley, the Mexican government granted the Sonora and Sinaloa Irrigation Company, incorporated in New Jersey, land along the river with water rights in 1890. The company begin the construction of canals for irrigating and growing crops. The Sonora and Sinaloa Irrigation Company soon went bankrupt, and the grant was purchased by the Richardson Construction Company of California in 1906. The Richardson Construction Company sold a 400 hectare block of land to developers from the United States and Europe, and received the exclusive right to sixty-five percent of the Yaqui River’s water for a 99-year period. The first non-indigenous settlers established themselves in the neighborhood called Plano Oriente. The Ferrocarril Sud-Pacífico, a subsidy of the Southern Pacific Railroad, established a station nearby called Cajeme, to provide water for the locomotives. The town of Cajeme was initially a part of Cócorit Municipality until its elevation to a Municipal Seat on September 28, 1927. The first city government was established on January 1, 1928. The July 28, 1928, decree stated that “the city is known now with the name of Ciudad Obregón, the town formerly known as Cajeme.” In 1937 another legislation stated that Cajeme be the name of the Municipality and Ciudad Obregón its seat.

In modern times, the Municipality of Cajeme yearly commemorates the death of Cajemé, with a gathering and public speeches highlighting the battles where Cajemé led his people against the Mexican Government, instead of pacifying the Yaqui people as was expected by Sonoran Governor Pesqueira.

<text>Salting is the preservation of food with dry edible salt. It is related to pickling in general and more specifically to brining also known as fermenting (preparing food with brine, that is, salty water) and is one form of curing. It is one of the oldest methods of preserving food, and two historically significant salt-cured foods are salted fish (usually dried and salted cod or salted herring) and salt-cured meat (such as bacon). Vegetables such as runner beans and cabbage are also often preserved in this manner.

Salting is used because most bacteria, fungi and other potentially pathogenic organisms cannot survive in a highly salty environment, due to the hypertonic nature of salt. Any living cell in such an environment will become dehydrated through osmosis and die or become temporarily inactivated. Fine grained salts were more expensive but also absorbed moisture faster than coarse salt.

==History==

===Pre-modern===

Salting could be combined with smoking to produce bacon in peasant homes. Instructions for preserving (salting) freshly killed venison in the 14th century involved covering the animal with bracken as soon as possible and carrying it to a place where it could be butchered, boiled in brine, and dry salted for long term preservation in a barrel. People in the 14th century could also put salt on vegetables for taste.

Salted meat was a staple of the mariner&#x27;s diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months at sea. The basic Royal Navy diet consisted of salted beef, salted pork, ship&#x27;s biscuit, and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter. Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship &quot;Moshulu&quot; to consist almost entirely of salted meat. &quot;Moshulu&#x27;s&quot; lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.

===Modern===

It was discovered in the 19th century that salt mixed with nitrates (such as saltpeter) would color meats red, rather than grey, and consumers at that time then strongly preferred the red-colored meat. The food hence preserved stays healthy and fresh for days avoiding bacterial decay.

==Salting in foods==
===Meat===
Salting, either with dry salt or brine, was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. Meat that had been preserved in this way was frequently called &quot;junk&quot; or &quot;salt horse&quot;. One early method of salt-curing meat was corning, or applying large, coarse pellets of salt, which were rubbed into the meat to keep it from spoiling and to preserve it. This term originates from Old English and references the large corns or grains of salt used (see ). Corned beef retains this name, although it is typically brined today.

Salt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required.

Various types of salted meat are staples of the diets of people in North Africa, Southern China, Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Some of those salted meats (or foods that contain salted meat) are bacon, biltong, cecina, corned beef, ham, jamón, jerky, pastrami, and salt pork.

===Fish===

Drying or salting, either with dry salt or with brine, was the only widely available method of preserving fish until the 19th century. Dried fish and salted fish (or fish both dried and salted) are a staple of diets in the Caribbean, West Africa, North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Southern China, Scandinavia, parts of Canada including Newfoundland, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Like other salt-cured meats, it provides preserved animal protein even in the absence of refrigeration.

In more recent times, freeze-drying, water binding humectants, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.

==Religious customs==
Jewish and Muslim dietary laws require the removal of blood from freshly slaughtered meat. Salt and brine are used for the purpose in both traditions, but salting is more common in Kosher Shechita (where it is all but required) than in Halal Dhabiha (as in most cases, draining alone will suffice).

==Health effects==
The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF) have stated that there is strong evidence that consuming salted foods including salt-preserved fish and salt-preserved foods in general increases risk of stomach cancer and that the high salt content of processed meat may result in damage to the stomach mucosal lining. The American Cancer Society have stated that &quot;stomach cancer risk is increased in people whose diets include large amounts of foods preserved by salting, such as salted fish and meat and pickled vegetables.&quot; Additionally, an excessive intake of salt has a dose-response relationship with elevated blood pressure, increasing the risk of several cardiovascular diseases.
