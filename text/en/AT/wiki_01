<text>The Isle of Man TT or Tourist Trophy races are an annual motorcycle racing event run on the Isle of Man in May and June of most years since its inaugural race in 1907. The event begins on the UK Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May and runs for thirteen days. It is often called one of the most dangerous racing events in the world as many competitors have died.

==Overview==
The Isle of Man TT is run in a time-trial format on public roads closed to the public by an Act of Tynwald. The event consists of one week of practice and qualifying sessions followed by one week of racing. It was a tradition, perhaps started by racing competitors in the early 1920s, for spectators to tour the Snaefell Mountain Course on motorcycles during the Isle of Man TT on &#x27;Mad Sunday&#x27;, an informal and unofficial event held on the Sunday between Practice Week and Race Week. In 2022, race organizers announced that beginning in 2023, racing would take place on Sunday after practices to allow visitors to see more events, marking the end of Mad Sunday.
The first Isle of Man TT race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was named the International Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy. The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the Isle of Man St John&#x27;s Short Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal &#x27;touring&#x27; motorcycles with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and mudguards.

From 1911, the Isle of Man TT transferred to the much longer Snaefell Mountain Course of (current length ). Its elevation goes from near sea-level to . The race programme developed from a single race with two classes for the 1907 Isle of Man TT, expanding in 1911 to two individual races for the 350cc Junior TT motor-cycles and the Blue Riband event the 500cc Senior TT race. The race did not take place from 1915 to 1919 due to the First World War. It resumed in 1920. A 250cc Lightweight TT race was added to the Isle of Man TT programme in 1922, followed by a Sidecar TT race in 1923.

There was no racing on the Isle of Man between 1940 and 1945 due to the Second World War. It recommenced with the Manx Grand Prix in 1946 and the Isle of Man TT in 1947, with a greatly expanded format that included the new Clubman&#x27;s TT races. The Isle of Man TT became part of the FIM Motor-cycle Grand Prix World Championship (now MotoGP) as the British round of the World Motor-Cycling Championship during the period 1949–1976. Following safety concerns with the Snaefell Mountain Course and problems over inadequate &quot;start-money&quot; for competitors, there was a boycott of the Isle of Man TT races from the early 1970s by many of the leading competitors, motorcycle manufacturers and national motorcycle sporting federations.

Beryl Swain became the first woman to compete in a TT race for solo motorcycles when she competed in the Isle of Man TT in 1962. There was subsequently a ban on women in the race from 1962 until Hilary Musson competed in 1978.

The race is regarded as the most dangerous motorsport event in the world; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 2017 that the number of deaths had risen &quot;to 146 since it was first run in 1907; if one includes fatal accidents occurring during the Manx Grand Prix ... the figure rises above 250&quot;. An account of the 2003 race by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Franz Lidz called the TT &quot;a test of nerves and speed that may be sports&#x27; most dangerous event.&quot;

In 1976, the Isle of Man TT lost its world championship status; this was transferred to the United Kingdom by the FIM and run as the British Grand Prix for the 1977 season. The Isle of Man TT Races then became an integral part of the new style TT Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3 World Championships between 1977 and 1990 to develop and maintain the international racing status of the Isle of Man TT races.

The event was redeveloped by the Isle of Man Department of Tourism as the &quot;Isle of Man TT Festival&quot; from 1989 onwards. This included new racing events for the new Isle of Man TT Festival programme, including the Pre-TT Classic Races in 1989 followed by the Post-TT Races from 1991, both held on the Billown Circuit. In 2013, the Isle of Man &quot;Classic TT&quot; was developed by the Isle of Man Department of Economic Development and the Auto-Cycle Union for historic racing motorcycles, and along with the Manx Grand Prix, it formed part of the &#x27;Isle of Man Festival of Motorcycling&#x27; held in late August of each year. The Classic TT brand ceased operation prior to the 2022 event, with classes for historic racing motorcycles integrated into the Manx Grand Prix. The TT is now promoted by the Isle of Man Government Department for Enterprise.

There has been criticism of the event. In 2007, an incident during the Senior Race resulted in the deaths of a rider and two spectators. The resultant inquest made several recommendations and included several comments, such as: &#x27;Senior Marshals may well have been elevated beyond the sphere of their competence&#x27;. The coroner also noted that &quot;I am more than aware of the fact that the witnesses from the Manx Motor Cycle Club and the marshals are all volunteers. They give their time freely and without paid reward. Having said that however, if it were suggested because they were volunteers there should be some allowance in the standards expected of them, then I regret I cannot agree.&quot;

The 2020 and 2021 TT races were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Early Isle of Man TT race history (1904–1910)==

===Gordon Bennett and Tourist Trophy car races===
Motor racing began on the Isle of Man in 1904 with the Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial, restricted to touring automobiles. As the Motor Car Act 1903 placed a speed restriction of on automobiles in the UK, Julian Orde, Secretary of the Automobile Car Club of Britain and Ireland approached the authorities in the Isle of Man for the permission to race automobiles on the island&#x27;s public roads. The Highways (Light Locomotive) Act 1904 gave permission in the Isle of Man for the Highroads Course for the 1904 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial which was won by Clifford Earl (Napier) in 7 hours 26.5 minutes for five laps () of the Highroads Course. The 1905 Gordon Bennett Trial was held on 30 May 1905 and was again won by Clifford Earl driving a Napier automobile in 6 hours and 6 minutes for six laps of the Highroads Course. This was followed in September 1905 with the first Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race for racing automobiles, now known as the RAC Tourist Trophy and was won by John Napier (Arrol-Johnston) in 6 hours and 9 minutes at an average speed of .

===International Motor-Cycle Cup Race (1905)===
For the 1905 Gordon Bennett Eliminating Trial it was decided to run an eliminating trial for motorcycles the day afterwards for a team to represent Great Britain in the International Motor-Cycle Cup Races. An accident at Ramsey Hairpin forced out one of the pre-race favourites, and the inability of the competitors to climb the steep Mountain Section of the course forced the organisers to use a section of the Gordon Bennett Trial course. This ran from Douglas south to Castletown and then north to Ballacraine along the primary A3 road and returning to the start at the Quarterbridge in Douglas via Crosby and Glen Vine along the current Snaefell Mountain Course in the reverse direction. The 1905 International Motor-Cycle Cup Race for five laps () was won by J.S. Campbell (Ariel) despite a fire during a pit stop in 4 hours, 9 minutes and 36 seconds at an average race speed of .

==Format of the races==

The TT Races since the first race in 1907 have been in the format of time-trial. The races held on the Clypse Course during the period 1954–1959 were the more traditional full grid starts along with the 1924 Lightweight TT Race and Clubmen TT Races from 1948, which were also &quot;mass-start&quot; races. The current format is a &quot;clutch start&quot; and race competitors will be &quot;started singly at 10-second intervals&quot;.

===Race procedure===
* Start Preliminaries
**First Signal – 45 minutes before the start with a warm-up of engines in the Race Paddock and assembly area.
**Second Signal – 30 minutes before start.
**Third Signal – 15 minutes before start, race competitors move to the start-line and form-up in qualification order.
**Fourth Signal – 5 minutes before start, signal to clear the grid and race competitors move towards the exit-gate.

===Eligibility===
Entrants must be in possession of a valid National Entrants or FIM Sponsors Licence for Road Racing.

Entrants must also cite pre-filled documentation of completion of a UK driving licence or motorcycle certification, or a driver&#x27;s licence from a comparable country that is recognised by UK comparable department of transportation standards and may withhold due to any pre race or post race suspensions.

====Supersport TT====
The 1911 Isle of Man TT was the first time the Junior TT race took place, open to 300 cc single-cylinder and 340 cc twin cylinder motorcycles, contested over five laps of the new Snaefell Mountain Course. The first event on the new course was the Junior TT Race contested by 35 entrants, won by Percy J. Evans riding a Humber motor-cycle at an average race speed of . The 1912 event was the first to limit the Junior TT to only 350 cc machines and this engine capacity prevailed until 1976, after which the category was dropped. The event was instead run for 250 cc machines until 1994 when replaced by the 600 cc Supersport class.

Supertwin TT

2022 saw the introduction of the supertwin race run over 3 laps on Wednesday the 8th of June, increased to 4 laps the following year. The class is very similar to the lightweight class which last ran in 2019, although with some differences. The maximum capacity has been increased to 700cc allowing the Yamaha YZF-R7 and Aprilia RS660 to compete. In 2022 bikes with capacities of 651cc+ were required to run 10 kg heavier than the 150 kg limit for the 650cc machines, but 2023 saw this changed and all bikes in the class now have a minimum weight of 150 kg.

====Sidecar TT====

The 1923 TT was the first time the Sidecar TT race was run, over three laps () of the Mountain Course and was won by Freddie Dixon and passenger Walter Denny with a Douglas and special &quot;banking-sidecar&quot; at an average race speed of . For the 1926 event the Sidecar and Ultra-Lightweight TT classes were dropped due to lack of entries.

The Sidecar race was re-introduced from the 1954 event for Sidecars not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity, run on the Clypse Course. A non-championship 750 cc class for sidecars was introduced at the 1968 event. For the 1976 event the race was held over two-legs. From 1975, the previous 500 cc and 750 cc classes for Sidecars were replaced by a 1000 cc engine capacity class.
The new FIM Formula 2 class for Sidecars was introduced for the 1990 Isle of Man TT.

====Senior TT====

For the 1911 Isle of Man TT, the first TT event using the Snaefell Mountain Course or &quot;Mountain Course&quot;, two separate races were introduced. The first event was a four lap Junior TT race and a separate Senior TT race for 500 cc single-cylinder and 585 cc twin-cylinder motorcycles, over five laps of the new Snaefell Mountain Course. The new technical challenges of the Mountain Course forced changes on entrants and motorcycle manufacturers alike. The American Indian motorcycle factory fitted a two-speed gearbox and chain-drive. This proved to be the winning combination when Oliver Godfrey won the 1911 Senior TT race riding an Indian at an average speed of . Fitted with a six-speed belt drive Charlie Collier riding a Matchless motorcycle finished second in the 1911 Senior TT race and was later disqualified for illegal refuelling. During an early morning practice session for the 1911 Isle of Man TT races, Victor Surridge died after crashing his Rudge motorcycle at Glen Helen, the first death of a competitor on the Snaefell Mountain Course and the first death in the Isle of Man of a person in an automotive accident.

:* 1911 For single cylinder motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity and 585 cc twin cylinder motorcycles.
:* 1912–1939 For motorcycles not exceeding 500 cc engine capacity.

:*Supersport Junior TT (without limitation of tyre choice)
:** TT Superstock (without limitation of tyre choice)
:** Other machines admitted at the discretion of the Organisers.

===Discontinued race classes===

====Clubman TT and Production TT====
The Clubman races with Lightweight, Junior and Senior classes were held for production motorcycles from 1947 until 1956. A Senior 1000 cc class provided an opportunity for Vincent motorcycles. The riders were little-known, but as the stars were barred from entering the class, it provided a stepping-stone for future-stars but resulted in less spectator-interest. The series became dominated by one model – the BSA Gold Star, and with little competition from other manufacturers, was discontinued. When previewing the impending re-introduction of a specification-controlled, roadster-based class in March 1967, &quot;David Dixon&quot; wrote: &quot;lack of inter-make rivalry probably put the final nail in the coffin&quot;.

Writing in UK monthly magazine &quot;Motor Cyclist Illustrated&quot;, racing journalist Ray Knight, who had achieved a lap speed of nearly 88 mph on a Triumph Tiger 100 roadster-based racing motorcycle in the Manx Grand Prix, commented in early 1965 that the ACU had refused a request from manufacturers to run a production TT race, which he thought was a missed opportunity, particularly considering the dwindling support for the 500 cc race.A Production TT for roadster-based motorcycles having classes for maximum engine capacities of 250 cc, 500 cc and 750 cc was introduced from 1967 until 1976 when the class was discontinued.

The Production TT was reintroduced for the 1984 races in three classes, reduced to two classes on safety grounds for the 1990 races. For the 2005 races the Superstock class replaced the previous 1000 cc and 600 cc Production TT classes that had been part of the race schedule since 1989.

====Ultra-Lightweight TT====
====Lightweight TT====
====TT Zero====
The TT Zero was a one lap race for electric bikes running from 2010 to 2019. It was announced that the race would take a two-year break after 2019, but it never came back on the schedule since.

==TT course official vehicles==
After the completion of a practice or race period, an official course vehicle displaying the notice &quot;Roads Open&quot; proceeds around the Mountain Course, passing each point opening the roads including side-access junctions to public use. On the Snaefell mountain road section from Ramsey to Douglas, the official vehicle displays the notice &quot;Roads Open One Way.&quot;

===Travelling marshals===

Originally introduced in 1935, there are eight machines positioned around the course to provide a rapid response to any incidents. Selected riders have previous race experience and are first-aid trained, with machines carrying medical equipment that can assist in managing a casualty. They also have other duties such as course inspection, observation of machines on the course for visible faults, and review and report any course incidents. As of 2023, all travelling marshals rode Honda CBR1000RR Fireblades.

==Crossing places during practice and races==
The 1982 Road Racing Act (Isle of Man) and the supplementary TT Road Races Orders allow vehicles and pedestrians to cross the Snaefell Mountain Course at certain points between scheduled race periods under the supervision of a police officer. Several permanent pedestrian overbridges have been erected. These points include:

=== In Douglas ===
* A2 St Ninian&#x27;s Crossroads with the A22 Ballaquayle Road and the A22 Ballanard Road
* A2 junction at Bray Hill with the Tromode Road and Stoney Road
* A1 Peel Road between Braddan Bridge (Jubilee Oak) and the Quarterbridge
* A2 Governor&#x27;s Road, Onchan, the A2 Glencrutchery Road and Victoria Road at Governor&#x27;s Bridge
* A2 Glencrutchery Road between Second &amp; Third Avenues and Victoria Road
* A18 Bemahague Road at Bedstead Corner, Onchan
===Elsewhere===
* A1 Douglas to Peel road with the A23 Eyreton Road and the B36 Old Church Road, Crosby
* A3 Castletown to Ramsey road junction with B10 Sartfield Road and the Ballaleigh Road at Barregarrow Crossroads, Michael
* A3 junction with A10 Station Road and C37 Ballaugh Glen Road at Ballaugh Bridge
* A3 junction with A14 Sandygate Road and A14 Tholt-y-Will Glen Road at Sulby Crossroads
* A2 Albert Square and Princes Road, Ramsey at the junction with A18 Snaefell Mountain Road, close to May Hill
==TT Course access road==

The TT Access Road runs parallel to a section of the A1 Peel Road, which is part of the Snaefell Mountain Course, and operates during practice and race periods to enable vehicles to pass from inside of the race course to the outside. It runs along a section of former railway line on the historic Douglas to Peel route, from the junction of the A5 &quot;New Castletown Road&quot; at the Quarter Bridge, passing under the course at Braddan Bridge, to an exit at Braddan School Road in Douglas outskirts, near the former Braddan Railway Halt and the A23/Ballafletcher Road junction. The access road is a narrow, single-track width with passing places and is restricted to cars and light vans below a weight limit of . When used for vehicular traffic, pedestrian access is prohibited, but at other times it is part of a system of nature trails.

==Incidents==

Between 1907 and 2023, there have been 156 fatalities during official practices or races on the Snaefell Mountain Course, and 269 total fatalities (this number includes the riders killed during the Manx Grand Prix, and Clubman TT race series of the late 1940s/1950s). In 2016, 5 riders died on the course during official practices or races. There were six fatalities among competitors in the 1970 and 2022 Isle of Man TTs, making them the two deadliest years in the history of the event.

===2018 Course Car incident===

On 30 May 2018, an experienced TT rider, Steve Mercer, was seriously injured during a head-on collision with an official Course Car at Ballacrye. The car, being driven at high speed, was conveying police officers to officiate at the scene of a fatality involving Dan Kneen. Mercer was unconscious for five days and hospitalised for five months due to multiple injuries. He was one of seven riders who had been halted on the course and turned back by marshals, being instructed to proceed back to the TT Grandstand area in the reverse direction after the red flag stoppage. Immediately after the accident the organisers changed their protocols, requiring that returning riders must be controlled by motorcycle-mounted travelling marshals to the front and rear. An independent inquiry into the circumstances was arranged by ACU Events, the event organisers.

The Auto-Cycle Union, the Isle of Man Department for Enterprise, and the inquiry report author, lawyer Rob Jones, a former chief executive of the Motor Sports Association, all refused to release the report as it was confidential and privately owned by the ACU.

The ACU admitted liability for the accident, but instructed that any legal claim for compensation by Mercer must be filed in the Isle of Man. The ACU stated that Mercer was receiving financial assistance through its &quot;extensive insurance arrangements&quot;.

In 2019, it was reported that the driver of the car in the collision had quit after criticism that he exceeded a newly introduced speed limit recorded by a GPS tracking device when he drove to attend a fatality involving Chris Swallow at Ballaugh in August&#x27;s Senior Classic TT. Gary Thompson, Clerk of the Course and an ACU employee, had been criticised in 2018 for also fulfilling the role of Safety Officer; consequently a new incumbent was in place for 2019.

==Cancellations==
===World Wars I and II===
From 1915 to 1919, and 1940 to 1946, no TT events took place, due to the outbreak of World Wars I and II. Events continued from 1920 to 1939 and 1947 to 2000.

Since TT 1947, the Isle of Man TT has only been cancelled three times: 2001, 2020 and 2021, all of which were due to viral outbreaks.

===2001 cancellation===
The 2001 Isle of Man TT races were cancelled because of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in the spring and summer of 2001. Disinfecting 40,000 spectators and competitors (and their motorcycles) to ensure the disease was kept off the island proved difficult.

===2020 and 2021 cancellations===
In March 2020, the Isle of Man Government announced the cancellation of the 2020 TT due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Classic TT was subsequently cancelled in May, and in December 2020, it was announced that 2021&#x27;s TT races would also not go ahead, due to the continued worldwide spread of the virus. In 2020, the Isle of Man Government lost an estimated £4.8 million of its annual projected revenue due to the cancellation of the TT races.

The event returned in 2022 after a two-year absence.

==FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World Championship Rounds (1949–1976)==
The Isle of Man TT was part of the FIM Motorcycle Grand Prix World Championship (now MotoGP) between 1949 and 1976. During this period the Isle of Man TT Races counted as the United Kingdom round including the Sidecar TT, 50 cc Ultra-Lightweight TT, 125 cc Lightweight TT, 250 cc Lightweight TT, 350 cc Junior TT and 500 cc Senior TT races counted towards the FIM Motor-Cycle Grand Prix World Championship.

After the 1972 races, multiple world champion, 10-time TT race winner and dominant motorcycle racer of his time Giacomo Agostini announced he would never race again at the Isle of Man, declaring it too dangerous for international competition and that it was outrageous that such a race should ever be part of a scenario professional riders were forced into; at this point the Isle of Man TT was not suited to the growing professionalism and business aspects of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. More and more riders joined his boycott, and after 1976 the race was struck from the championship and replaced by the British Grand Prix.

&quot;Most Meritorious Female Competitor&quot; – The Susan Jenness Trophy was awarded yearly by the Executive Committee of the TT Supporters&#x27; Club, in recognition of the &quot;most meritorious performance by a female competitor&quot; during the previous TT meeting. The award has not been awarded since 2019.

==Video games==

There have been numerous video games based on the Isle of Man TT; the first was the 1995 Sega arcade game Manx TT Super Bike, which was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997. Several other games have followed since, including Suzuki TT Superbikes (2005), TT Superbikes: Real Road Racing Championship and TT Superbikes Legends (both 2008), all of which were released exclusively for the PlayStation 2, and developed by Jester Interactive.

Bigben Interactive has since revived the TT game license, releasing TT Isle Of Man: Ride on the Edge in 2018 and two sequels in 2020 and 2023.

<doc id="136962" wikidata="Q482489" url="?curid=136962" title="Scofield, Utah">
<text>Scofield is a town in Carbon County, Utah, United States. The population was 26 at the 2020 census. Scofield&#x27;s name is frequently applied to the 1900 mine disaster in the Pleasant Valley Coal Company&#x27;s Winter Quarters mine. The community was named for &quot;General Charles W. Scofield&quot;, a timber contractor and local mine official. It is the smallest incorporated area in Utah by population.

==History==

The town of Scofield is situated on high ground two miles south of the reservoir of the same name, the oldest and largest of the major impoundments on the Wasatch Plateau. Once the most populous community in Carbon County, Scofield has shrunk to only a few permanent residents. What has slowed the continual decline has become outsiders constructing summer vacation homes. The old brick school stands empty at the upper end of town, and there are abandoned buildings scattered through what was once the business district. Only the cemetery on a hill to the east suggests that this was once a community of some size.

===Settlement===
Due to the luxuriant growth of the native grasses indigenous to this region, this valley was first utilized as pastures for the immense herds of cattle that came from Utah Valley. Among the first settlers of this region were S. J. Harkness, T. H. Thomas, William Burrows, O. G. Kimball, D. D. Green, A. H. Earll, R. McKecheney, who were attracted by the immense ranges for their cattle.

===Discovery of coal and coming of the railroad===
Coal was discovered in the valley in 1875, and two years later a small mine was opened on the western slopes of the canyon, with the coal transported out along narrow roads. The winter of 1877 came early and was very severe, stranding the miners in the coal pit and keeping them snowbound until the following February. The ordeal led the miners to name their forced camp &quot;Winter Quarters&quot;. It became one of the first commercial coal mines in the state. Most of the first miners at the Winter Quarters were Mormon converts from the coal districts of Wales, England and Scotland. One of them, David Williams, leased the Winter Quarters Mine from the Pleasant Valley Coal Company from 1880 to 1885, operating in the dual capacity of mine manager and bishop of the local LDS ward. When the Rio Grande Western Railway acquired the coal company, they undertook the development of a new mine on Mud Creek, a mile from Winter Quarters, much to the chagrin of Williams, who protested that the new mine infringed on his lease. Because Bishop Williams controlled the Mormon miners, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company brought in Chinese laborers to work the Mud Creek mine. Soon a large contingent of Finns were recruited, along with Italian, Greek, and other Scandinavian workers.

As coal veins commenced to be worked, it was not long before the discoverers found out that the supply seemed inexhaustible. The railway companies finding that the coal fields were of such magnitude and covered so much territory, began to survey for practicable routes to reach the coal. The route through Spanish Fork Canyon was finally decided upon, and a narrow-gauge railroad was built into Scofield. Before the railroad was completed, winter set in, and the last few miles were laid upon the ice and snow as it was impossible to find the ground due to the snow drifts. The Union Pacific Coal Company claimed all of the land on the town site, and those building a home were compelled to lease the spot of ground desired from this company. Not knowing how long they would be permitted to remain as laborers in the mines, the men did not build elaborate homes, as they knew that should the work cease, they would be compelled to sacrifice their homes. Log cabins were the order of the day, as lath and plaster was out of reach on account of high prices. The Union Pacific still continued to collect their ground rent, and the knowledge that the miners had of the company that was ruling the camp at that time deterred them from beautifying their homes as they desired.

However, this state of affairs was not to continue for long, as the rights of the company to hold the land came to be questioned. Part of their land was jumped, and their title was found to be imperfect. In fact, they had no title whatever to the land now incorporated in the townsite. The business district was more than a mile long and boasted dozens of substantial stone buildings, including an Odd Fellows Hall. As the mine and the community grew, new and more efficient methods were sought to move the coal from the mines, and so the Utah &amp; Pleasant Valley Railroad was constructed, running from Springville to Winter Quarters and Scofield. It connected with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande line in Colton to the northeast.

In 1882, the Utah Fuel Company took over the mine and town, and it soon became a subsidiary of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad. The region continued to thrive until 1900, when there were several hundred men in the mines and residents that numbered as high as 1,800. The mine was considered to be the safest in the region and according to reports, was free from the gases that plagued so many other coal operations.

===Disaster===

On May 1, 1900, an errant spark touched off the fine haze of coal dust deep underground, and the Winter Quarters #4 mine exploded with fury. Exactly 100 of the men were killed in an instant, and another 99 died from the poisonous afterdamp, making this one of the worst coal mine disasters in history. Death came so swiftly that some of the mineworkers were found still clutching their tools. That one moment of time left 105 widows and 270 fatherless children behind. Almost 150 of the slain miners were buried in the cemetery in nearby Scofield, and two special funeral trains carried the rest of the victims to burial grounds in Utah and in other states.

===Decline===
On May 28, just four weeks after the disaster in Number Four, coal mining resumed at Winter Quarters. While some of those who had escaped the explosion left the area for other work, many others returned to the mines. The dead were soon replaced, though production evidently suffered somewhat from the loss of more experienced miners. Despite declining profitability, the Winter Quarters mines continued to operate until the 1930s. The coal tipple and other large structures were dismantled for their salvage value during World War II; the chapel and the boarding house were leveled.

Scofield, sustained by several mines in Pleasant Valley, was still the largest town in Carbon County in 1915, when its citizens made an attempt to have the county seat moved to their community from Price. By the 1920s, however, the coal industry in Pleasant Valley was clearly in decline and most mines ceased operation causing the town to lose nearly all its residents.

==Geography==
The town of Scofield lies in the bituminous coal field of Carbon County, Utah, about from the main line of the Rio Grande Western Railroad, and is nestled among the hills that surround the upper part of Pleasant Valley. The town is situated along Mud Creek, just south (upstream) of the Scofield Reservoir. The outlet of the reservoir is the Price River, which flows southeast to the Green River and is thus part of the Colorado River basin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Scofield has a total area of , all land.

Utah State Route 96 passes through Scofield, leading north then east to U.S. Route 6 near Colton, and south to its end at Clear Creek.

===Climate===
Scofield has an alpine subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with enormous yearly snowfall in its long, cold winters due to its location in the Wasatch Range. Summertime on the other hand is pleasant, with warm days and crisp, cool nights hovering not too far above freezing.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 28 people, 12 households, and 9 families residing in the town. The population density was 55.9 people per square mile (21.6/km2). There were 78 housing units at an average density of 155.6 per square mile (60.2/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White.

There were 12 households, out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.7% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.50.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 14.3% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 28.6% from 45 to 64, and 21.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 75.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $26,250, and the median income for a family was $28,750. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $14,375 for females. The per capita income for the town was $10,764. There were no families and 9.1% of the population living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Scofield State Park==
Scofield State Park surrounds Scofield Reservoir and has three different camping areas: Mountain View, Madsen Bay, and Lake Side. Mountain View is a 34-unit campground that includes restrooms, heated showers, fish cleaning and disposal stations, a group use pavilion, a boat launching ramp, and rental boats. Madsen Bay is a 40-unit campground with restrooms, fish cleaning and disposal areas, a boat ramp, and parking for day use. Lake Side has no camping areas and is strictly day use, offering restrooms, a group use pavilion and a fishing platform for the disabled.

==Clear Creek Camp==

Clear Creek Camp is an outdoor education center located south of the town of Scofield, for post-fifth grade students in the Alpine School District. Each summer, Clear Creek Camp hosts approximately 1,100 students. The summer camp experience is designed to educate students about the outdoors and help foster a deep appreciation for the abundant natural resources and beauty in their surroundings. The camp has its roots in an outdoor education program held at Central Elementary School in the 1940s. Between 1940 and the 1960s, the program eventually grew to be so successful that a summer camp was requested. It was held at various locations for many years, including the town of Clear Creek for which it is named. After being there for a few years, property became available from Questar (then Mountain Fuel) with six cabins and a multi-purpose facility in 1973. The facilities were ready to use for groups of students in 1974, and Alpine School District has used the same grounds since then.

==History==
The area known as Sunnyside was founded in 1879, when George and James Whitmore arrived at the base of the Book Cliffs and established the Whitmore Cattle Ranch. In 1883, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW) extended its line from the railhead at Deseret to Price. Along this stretch two additional railheads were added, one at Woodside, and another north at Sunnyside, named for its location on the sunny side of the Book Cliffs.

For over a century, Sunnyside was the leader in coal production in Carbon County. The history of coal mining in Sunnyside began shortly after Jefferson Tidwell and his three sons discovered coal in Whitmore Canyon in 1896. By 1898, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company had acquired the rights to the coal from Tidwell. On July 4 of that year, the Sunnyside railhead was abandoned by the D&amp;RGW, and the coal camp located in Whitmore Canyon was named Sunnyside. By 1901, the D&amp;RGW and its subsidiary, Utah Fuel Coal Company, acquired the operation.

Sunnyside was officially incorporated as a town in 1916, with a mayor and four trustees.
For fifty years, Utah Fuel operated the coal mines in Sunnyside, selling its interest to Kaiser Steel Corporation in 1949. The financial investments of these companies turned Tidwell&#x27;s mining operation into a major coal industry, inextricably tied to Sunnyside.

Until 1994, the Sunnyside&#x27;s mayor was not an elected official. Instead, the office was held by the Superintendent of Mines for Utah Fuel, then later by Kaiser Steel Corporation when it took over in 1950.

==Education==
Sunnyside is located in the Carbon School District. It has one elementary school, which also accommodates students from East Carbon City. Students attend middle and high school in Price.

<text>Bountiful is a city in Davis County, Utah. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 45,762, an eight percent increase over the 2010 figure of 42,552. The city grew rapidly during the suburb growth of the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and was Davis County&#x27;s largest city until 1985, when it was surpassed by Layton. Bountiful is Utah&#x27;s 18th-largest city.

Although a part of the Ogden–Clearfield metropolitan area, it serves as a bedroom community to Salt Lake City and the surrounding area. However, due to the very narrow entrance into Salt Lake County, roads between the counties often reach near-gridlock traffic during rush hour. The &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail has been running since April 2008, and the Legacy Parkway was opened on September 13, 2008. These were built to help alleviate the traffic load on Interstate 15 through the Bountiful area.

==History==

Bountiful was settled on September 27, 1847, by Perrigrine Sessions and his family. It was Utah&#x27;s second settlement after Salt Lake City. It was known as Sessions Settlement and North Canyon Ward before being named Bountiful in 1855. This city was so named both because of the city&#x27;s reputation as a great place for gardening and because &quot;Bountiful&quot; is the name of a city in the Book of Mormon (Alma 52:9). Most of the settlers, and also many of the present inhabitants, are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). The city also shares 14 other religious institutions, including a Catholic school and church, Saint Olaf School, established in 1959. The Bountiful Utah Temple was dedicated in 1995 by the LDS Church. A tabernacle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is also located in Bountiful.

The city was incorporated in 1892 with Joseph L Holbrook as mayor.

In 1907 electric lights came to Bountiful through the efforts of its citizens.

Serial killer Ted Bundy snatched victim Debra Kent from Viewmont High School in Bountiful on November 8, 1974.

The city celebrates its history at the annual Handcart Days celebration every July in conjunction with the U.S. State of Utah&#x27;s official holiday, Pioneer Day. Handcart Days is a volunteer-driven event. People from Six cities in the south of Davis County, Utah come together to commemorate the first group of Mormon Pioneers’ entry into the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. The festivities include a parade, fireworks, games, entertainment, an art exhibit, and food.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 13.5 square miles (34.9 km), all land.

The original portion of the city and downtown is located at the base of the Wasatch Range, which rises high to the east, overlooking the city. Most of the residential neighborhoods climb high up the slopes of the mountain. To the west lies a flatland that extends to the Great Salt Lake and the mudflats and marshes that border it. Areas of Bountiful include Val Verda in the southern part of the city.

The cities surrounding Bountiful include: North Salt Lake to the south, Woods Cross and West Bountiful to the west, and Centerville to the north. Most land to the east of Bountiful is U.S. Forest Service property.

<text>Clearfield (Shoshone: , “Place where the wind blows hard”) is a city in Davis County, Utah, United States. The population was 31,909 at the 2020 census. The city grew rapidly during the 1940s, with the formation of Hill Air Force Base, and in the 1950s with the nationwide increase in suburb and &quot;bedroom&quot; community populations and has been steadily growing since then.

Clearfield is a principal city of the Ogden–Clearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Davis, Morgan, and Weber counties.

==History==

Clearfield was one of the last communities to be settled in the northern part of Davis County (1877). Hunters and Native American warriors knew this land before the first white man settled here. They referred to it as the land of wind and sand. It was the arrival of the railroad that first awakened the area in 1869 and stirred the sleeping &quot;Sand Ridge&quot;, which it was once known as until the name was later changed to Clearfield.

There was no water for those early families until wells could be successfully dug. The only water available at first had to be hauled in large barrels from Kays Creek in East Layton. But the great event that did more to transform the bleak &quot;Sand Ridge&quot; into a fertile garden spot was the coming of the Davis and Weber Counties Canal in 1884. This caused an immediate population boom in the area as people plowed up the sagebrush and cactus, and homes and farms began to appear throughout the area.

Many Clearfield children went to school nearby in Syracuse by walking several miles a day. In 1907, the new Clearfield Elementary School opened its doors to those same children. The school taught first through eighth grades and operated until 1923, when it was destroyed by fire. The new building later acquired the name &quot;Pioneer&quot; School. North Davis Junior High School was built and opened its doors in 1939. The building cost approximately $170,000 to build. That first year, there were 18 faculty members and 585 students.

Throughout the following years, Clearfield was known as a peaceful farming community. However, the addition of defense installations in the areas changed the agricultural community. Construction began on Hill Field (Hill Air Force Base) in 1940, and the facility eventually stretched along the eastern border of Clearfield. The base has since provided many jobs for civilians and is one of Utah&#x27;s major employers.

On the southwestern side of Clearfield, the U.S. Navy installed the Clearfield Naval Supply Depot in 1943. Clearfield was considered a prime location for the depot because of its relative security from enemy attack, nearby air transportation at Hill Air Force Base, and the proximity of railroads and highways. The dry climate was ideal for storage, and there was a good supply of manpower.

Another more modern school, South Clearfield Elementary, was added in 1950 to help keep pace with the growing population.

The early winter of 1959 saw the beginnings of Clearfield High School, the first high school in northern Davis County.

The Clearfield Naval Supply Depot was eventually phased out by 1962, but the facility did not stay empty for long. Private firms soon began moving into the large warehouse buildings. The area became known as the Freeport Center and is a major western hub for manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution.

Hill Field Elementary opened in 1963 and is located just west of the west border of Hill Air Force Base.

The Clearfield Job Corps Center was established in 1966. This facility is located west of the Freeport Center on Antelope Drive. It was established to train unemployed and unskilled youth 16 to 24 years old.

Clearfield City dedicated a new city hall building in 1969, and a new state-of-art Clearfield Fire Station opened in 1980, adjacent to city hall.

In 1981, Holt Elementary opened in the northwest corner of the city, near Steed Park.

The newest Clearfield City Municipal Building, located on 55 South State Street, was dedicated in December 1999.

Clearfield&#x27;s premier office and commercial center, Legend Hills, is also the largest office development space in north Davis County. The first phase of Legend Hills was built in 2002 on the city&#x27;s east side, just east of the frontage road along Interstate 15.
In 2004, ground was broken for the Clearfield Aquatic Center. In 2005, the old Clearfield City Swimming Pool was demolished to make way for the new center and for an updated Bernard Fisher Park. The new skate park at Fisher Park was also added the same year. The Clearfield Aquatic Center opened in 2005 adjacent to the newly built North Davis Junior High, which until 2005 had been the oldest standing junior high building in Davis County. An outdoor splash pad feature was added to the Clearfield Aquatic Center in 2006.

Clearfield High School underwent a major renovation in 2006, including the main auditorium and computer upgrades.

The opening of the Utah Transportation Association (UTA) FrontRunner commuter rail stop in Clearfield in 2008 helped the city emerge as a centralized location of business, public, and community development.

Davis County opened a three-story, 45,000-square-foot office building housing the administrative offices of the Davis County Health Department in 2010. The Heritage Senior Activity Center closed its Clearfield Community Center location in 2011. It reopened as the North Davis Senior Center in its new location adjacent to the new county health building.

In 2012, the former Clearfield Community Center was renamed, becoming the Clearfield Community Arts Center. Located east of the Clearfield City Municipal Building north parking lot, the center is expected to become a &quot;hub&quot; for art classes, theatre productions, and more.

==Geography==

Clearfield City has a total land area of , and a population of 31,909 as of the 2020 Census, making it the fifth largest city in Davis County, behind Layton, Bountiful, Kaysville, and Syracuse. This creates a population density of 1498.1 people per square kilometer or 3860.5 people per square mile. Clearfield City has an average elevation of above sea level. The lowest point within the boundaries of the city is at the intersection of 1000 West and Antelope Drive on the city&#x27;s western edge, and the highest is at a point that is within the city&#x27;s northeast corner but physically located on Hill Air Force Base property along Constitution Way in their housing area. (AGRC)

The city is located in the north-central portion of Davis County. The county is surrounded by the Great Salt Lake to the west and the steep Wasatch Range on the east, although neither of these notable natural landmarks is physically within the city boundaries. Directly encircling Clearfield are the cities/areas of Sunset City to the north, Clinton City to the northwest, Syracuse City and West Point City to the west, Layton City to the south and east, and Hill Air Force Base military installation to the northeast.

There are no major lakes or rivers within the city. There are a few small ponds, mostly at public parks or privately owned property. The only significant waterway in the city is the Weber and Davis Canal along the east and northeast edge of the city, which extends north and south of the city boundaries. The Clearfield Canal Trail parallels the canal for a portion of its trip through Clearfield. The Great Salt Lake is separated from Clearfield City by marshlands, mudflats, and the cities. The metabolic activities of bacteria in the lake result in a phenomenon known as &quot;lake stink&quot;, a scent similar to sulfur, once or twice a year for a few hours.

The highest mountaintops visible from Clearfield City are Deseret Peak in Tooele County at , Ben Lomond Peak in Weber County at , and Thurston Peak, just to the east of Clearfield at . Ben Lomond Peak and Thurston Peak are located in the Wasatch Range. The Wasatch Fault is found along the western base of the Wasatch Range and is considered overdue for an earthquake as large as 7.5. Catastrophic damage is predicted in the event of an earthquake, with major damage resulting from the liquefaction of the clay- and sand-based soil. The largest earthquake that has occurred near Clearfield City in the recorded past occurred on 12/7/1967 and was away in Park City, Utah, and registered at a magnitude of 4.3.

The Wasatch Front valley floor is the ancient lakebed of Lake Bonneville, which existed at the end of the last ice age. Several Lake Bonneville shorelines can be distinctly seen on the foothills or benches of nearby mountains.

===Layout===
The city&#x27;s streets, along with the rest of Davis County north of Layton, are laid out on a unified grid plan. Most major streets run very nearly north–south and east–west. Clearfield City is the farthest east on this grid, while Syracuse, West Point, Sunset, Clinton, and Unincorporated Davis County are all located north, west, and south on the same street grid.

===Neighborhoods===
Clearfield City has many informal neighborhoods, most of which are more business or industrial-related than residential. In the southwestern portion of the city is a large industrial business center called The Freeport Center and the Clearfield Job Corps. Having the Job Corps next to one of the largest industrial centers in Northern Utah allows for on-the-job training for many of the programs offered. The Freeport Center began life in the 1940s as the Clearfield Naval Supply Depot but was phased out in 1962, and private firms began moving in.

South Clearfield is a residential neighborhood that is of note due to its isolation as the southernmost section of the city. It is cut off from the rest of residential Clearfield by The Freeport Center and other businesses, as well as being surrounded by other cities on 3 of the four sides of the area.

The presence of Hill Air Force Base has helped in creating two business neighborhoods. Falcon Hill is a 550-acre planned development underway on the west and southwest portion of the base that will be on leased federal government land, but all services and buildings will be public in any areas outside the fence line of the base. It is a planned aerospace research complex with space both inside and outside of the base fence line. (Commercial) Legend Hills is an office and retail-oriented business area located in the southeasternmost corner of the city. It contains many different retail spaces and business offices in numerous office towers. All areas are easily accessed off Interstate 15, which runs north–south through the eastern edge of the city.

===Climate===
The climate of Clearfield City is characterized as humid Continental, with four distinct seasons. Both summer and winter are long, with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters, and with spring and fall serve as brief but comfortable transition periods. The city receives of precipitation annually. Spring is the wettest season (May is the wettest month), while summer is very dry. Snow occurs on average from November to April, producing a total average of yearly.

The primary source of precipitation in Clearfield City is massive Pacific storms that move in from the Pacific Ocean along the jet stream from approximately October through May. Particularly cold storms have brought measurable snow as early as September and as late as May. After the Pacific train of storms has shut off and the jet stream has retreated far to the north during summer, the primary source of precipitation is afternoon thunderstorms generated by monsoon moisture moving up from the Gulf of California during mid-to-late summer. Although rainfall can be heavy, these storms are usually scattered in coverage and are rarely severe.

Clearfield City features large variations in temperatures between seasons. The hottest month is July, and the coldest is January. The average temperature over the year is . The record high temperature is , which occurred in July 2002, while the record low is , which occurred in January 1937.
During mid-winter, strong areas of high pressure often situate themselves over the Great Basin, leading to strong temperature inversions. This causes air stagnation and thick smog in the valley from several days to weeks at a time and can result in the worst air-pollution levels in the U.S., reducing air quality to unhealthy levels. Aside from occasional heavy snows in winter, severe weather is very rare.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 United States Census, in the city of Clearfield there were 31,909 people in 10,343 households.

==Economy==
Some of the state&#x27;s and Davis County&#x27;s largest employers are located in Clearfield: Hill Air Force Base, Lifetime Products, Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company, Alliant Techsystems, Clearfield Job Corps (MTC), Futura Industries Corporation, and Smith Sport Optics, Inc.

Freeport Center
The Freeport Center is a manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution center. It is home to more than 70 national and local companies that have a combined workforce of over 7,000 employees. Freeport Center has an excellent transportation network of highways and railroads, and is only 20 miles from the Salt Lake International Airport.

Legend Hills
Legend Hills is an office development in northern Davis County. Located on the east side of Clearfield, and bordering Interstate 15.

==Government==
Clearfield City has a &quot;six-member council&quot; form of government, with a city manager by ordinance. In this form, the powers of municipal government are vested in a council consisting of six members, one of which is the mayor.

The mayor is, except in limited circumstances, a nonvoting member of the council. The mayor votes only when there is a tie vote of the other council members present, when the council is voting on whether to appoint or dismiss the city manager, or on an ordinance that enlarges or restricts the mayor&#x27;s powers, duties, or functions. The mayor is the chair of the council and presides at all council meetings. The mayor also exercises ceremonial functions for the municipality such as ribbon cuttings and municipal appearances. The mayor may not veto an ordinance, tax levy, or appropriation passed by the council.

Other powers and duties of the mayor in a six-member council form of government can be taken from the mayor and given to either the council or city manager by the adoption of an ordinance by the council. In 1966, such an ordinance was passed in Clearfield City, giving the city manager such powers and duties.

By ordinance, therefore, the city manager is the chief executive officer of Clearfield City. This means that the city manager oversees the city&#x27;s day-to-day operations, and all employees of the city report to the city manager. The city council appoints and hires the city manager and the city manager reports to the mayor and council.
In the six-member council form of government, the council is the legislative body and is therefore primarily responsible for setting policy and adopting a balanced budget. The council enacts laws, appropriates funds, and reviews municipal administration. The city council shall elect one of its members to act as mayor pro tempore during the temporary absence or disability of the mayor. During such absence or disability, the mayor pro tempore shall possess the powers of mayor, except that the mayor pro tempore shall continue to cast votes as a member of the city council. The election of a mayor pro tempore shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting.

The most recent election was held in November, 2023. Dakota Wurth and Megan Ratchford were elected to serve their first terms on the City Council, while Nike Peterson was re-elected to serve her third term.

<text>Farmington is a city in, and the county seat of, Davis County, Utah, United States. The population was 24,531 at the 2020 census. The Lagoon Amusement Park and Station Park transit-oriented retail center (which includes a FrontRunner train station) are located in Farmington.

==History==
The region that is now Farmington was settled in 1847 by the Haight family, a Mormon pioneer family that established a farm and an inn. Five more pioneering families migrated to this region in the autumn of 1849. The region developed into an undefined community originally called North Cottonwood Settlement. In 1852, the territorial legislature picked North Cottonwood as the county seat and officially named it Farmington. Following orders from Daniel H. Wells and Brigham Young, Farmington residents built a wall around the city in 1853 under the direction of Major Thomas S. Smith. This walled townsite became known as &quot;the Fort&quot;. Early church meetings were held in a log school and then an adobe structure. The county courthouse was used for religious meetings from 1855 to 1863. The city&#x27;s ward moved back to the schoolhouse, and the first meetinghouse was dedicated in January 1864. By the early 1860s, the town of Farmington stretched for six miles between Centerville and Kaysville.

The Children&#x27;s Primary Association of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized here on August 11, 1878. It was the birthplace of one of the longest-lived Latter-day Saint apostles, LeGrand Richards. His maternal great-grandfather, Joseph Lee Robinson, was the first bishop of what was then the North Cottonwood Ward. Lagoon Amusement Park was founded here in 1886 and occupies of the city. Ezra T. Clark was an early settler of Farmington who later founded the Davis County Bank and built several houses in the area, some of which are located in the Clark Lane Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Kaysville is a city in Davis County, Utah. It is part of the Ogden–Clearfield metropolitan area. The population was 32,945 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Shortly after Latter Day Saint pioneers arrived in 1847, the Kaysville area, originally known as &quot;Kay&#x27;s Creek&quot; or Kay&#x27;s Ward, was settled by Hector Haight in 1847 as a farming community. He had been sent north to find feed for the stock and soon thereafter constructed a cabin and brought his family to settle the area. Farmington, Utah also claims Hector Haight as its original settler. Two miles north of Haight&#x27;s original settlement, Samuel Holmes built a cabin in 1849 and was soon joined by other settlers from Salt Lake, namely Edward Phillips, John Green, and William Kay.

Although settlement began in the 1847, the name of Kaysville connects with the fact that in 1851 William Kay was made the bishop in the vicinity by Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball.

After the move south in 1858 (see Utah War), there was an attempt to rename the community &quot;Freedom&quot;, but Brigham Young convinced the residents to retain the old name.

In 1868 Kaysville became the first city incorporated in Davis County.

An adobe meetinghouse was built in 1863. It was replaced by the Kaysville Tabernacle in 1914. In 1930 Kaysville had 992 people. Of those residents who were Latter-day Saints, they all were in the Kaysville Ward which also covered most of the rest of the Kaysville Precinct.

In 1977 United Airlines Flight 2860 crashed near Kaysville.

By 2008 there were seven Mormon stakes (similar to a diocese) in Kaysville.

In November 2009, Kaysville voters elected Steve Hiatt as Kaysville City&#x27;s 38th mayor and the youngest mayor in Utah. He was sworn in on January 4, 2010. He was re-elected for a second four-year term in November 2013.

The current mayor, Tamara Tran, won the 2021 election with 59.95 percent of the popular vote over Jay Welk.

<text>Layton (/ˈleɪʔɪn/) is a city in Davis County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 81,773, with 2022 Census Bureau estimates showing an increase to 82,601. 2024 estimates place Layton&#x27;s population at 87,392. Layton is the most populous city in Davis County and the ninth most populous in Utah.
Layton has direct access to Salt Lake City, Ogden, Salt Lake City International Airport, Antelope Island, and the FrontRunner commuter rail. Layton City is a leader in economic development for the region, with immediate adjacency to Hill Air Force Base, a large hospitality district (1,000+ hotel beds) and conference center, the Layton Hills Mall, multiple nationally recognized retail and food chains, the East Gate Business Park, and the Weber State University-Davis campus.

In 2014, Layton contributed $1.34 billion worth of retail sales activity, the second largest market north of Salt Lake City and seventh largest in Utah.

==History==
===Founding===
Layton was settled in the 1850s as an outgrowth of Kaysville and is named after Christopher Layton, a Latter-day Saint settler and leader. It was included in the boundaries when Kaysville was incorporated as a city in 1868, but by the 1880s, many Layton residents wanted to separate from the city. They challenged Kaysville&#x27;s authority to tax their property, claiming they received no municipal services. This dispute reached the United States Supreme Court in 1894 as the case of &quot;Linford v. Ellison&quot;, which was decided in favor of the Layton property owners. The separatist movement finally succeeded in 1902, when Layton became an independent unincorporated area. After further growth, it was made an incorporated town in 1920.

===Expansion===
The town&#x27;s population increased slowly; up until 1940, it was about 600. The creation of Hill Air Force Base to the north in 1940, followed shortly by the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, led to a dramatic population increase. War workers streamed into the area; the 1950 census counted 3,456 people. Layton became a city, transformed from a farming town to a residential community. Growth slowed after the war, but Layton continued to develop as a suburban bedroom community, as those not employed at the Air Force base began commuting to the Salt Lake City or Ogden areas. The city continued to expand geographically, annexing surrounding parcels of land, including the adjacent town of Laytona and the city of East Layton. In 1985, Layton passed Bountiful to become the most populous city in Davis County.

<text>Atlantic Highlands is a borough in Monmouth County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the Bayshore Region. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,414, an increase of 29 (+0.7%) from the 2010 census count of 4,385, which in turn reflected a decline of 320 (−6.8%) from the 4,705 in the 2000 census.

Atlantic Highlands contains Mount Mitchill, the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine, rising above sea level. The borough&#x27;s name comes from its location overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

Atlantic Highlands was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1887, from portions of Middletown Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The borough was reincorporated on September 1, 1891.

Atlantic Highlands was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the county&#x27;s 2016 Master Plan.

==History==

The town overlooks where the Atlantic Ocean and Raritan Bay meet at Sandy Hook, and its hills mark the highest point on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. south of Maine.

For hundreds of years, the original inhabitants were the Lenape, who lived in and along the cliffs and creeks of Atlantic Highlands. The Lenape traded with the Europeans and sold a group of English settlers an area that covered the entire peninsula that was named Portland Poynt. The area was laid out with 10 lots in 1667, making them the first European residents of present-day Atlantic Highlands.

Colonists convened the first Assembly of New Jersey in 1667 in what is now Atlantic Highlands. During Revolutionary War years, loyalists to the British crown and patriots of the new America clashed in repeated raids and counterattacks across these lands. Retreating English troops passed through after their defeat in 1778 by George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth.

During the late 1800s, the many farms were subdivided by resort developers, church groups and builders who created the Victorian core of the borough, attracting thousands of visitors and year-round residents.

In 1879, a surveyor was engaged to lay roads and lots for a permanent community. The Atlantic Highlands Association was formed by prominent members of the Methodist Church. This organization developed the community of Atlantic Highlands.

Individuals and groups came from New York City and the surrounding vicinity to camp along the water in tent colonies. An outdoor amphitheater was created with a large seating capacity and outstanding acoustics. An indoor auditorium was built, which was utilized for entertaining visitors at the camp meetings. In 1887, Atlantic Highlands was incorporated as a borough, containing of land bordering on the Raritan Bay.

Major construction occurred from the 1880s through 1900. It included hotels, cottages, rooming houses, and private homes. A pier was built extending well into the bay to accommodate steamboats from New York City. The next twenty years saw rapid development within the community. A water and sewer system was constructed, cottages were erected, and the road system was completed. During this period of development a fire department was organized.

A number of churches saw their beginning in the 1880s: the Central Baptist, First Presbyterian, Saint Agnes Roman Catholic, First Methodist, and Saint Paul Baptist Church.

Atlantic Highlands became a haven for bootleggers during the Prohibition era.

Steamer service was the most important transport during the formation of the borough, and continued through the 1940s. In the 1890s, rail service came to Atlantic Highlands. This opened up Highlands and points south to vacationers. The 1920s saw 26 passenger trains daily passing through the borough. The Central Railroad of New Jersey built a major pier at the end of First Avenue. Several trains at a time could continue to the end of the pier to offload steamboat passengers. From the 1910s through the 1940s, the steamers &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; and the &quot;Monmouth&quot; navigated the waters bringing businessmen and vacationers to Atlantic Highlands.

The Manhattan skyline can be seen from the borough&#x27;s ridges and its shoreline. Pleasure, fishing and commuter boats sail from its harbor. The municipal harbor was built from 1938 through 1940 with municipal, state, and federal funds. It is the largest on the East Coast, home to 715 craft, including high-speed ferry service to New York City, which was introduced in 1986. In 1966, the Central Railroad of New Jersey pier was destroyed by fire. Its rail route is now used by the Henry Hudson Trail.

The bungalows on the East Side of the borough, which in the 1920s were summer bungalows, are now occupied year-round. Portland Pointe is a five-story residence for senior citizens.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 4.56 square miles (11.82 km2), including 1.26 square miles (3.27 km2) of land and 3.30 square miles (8.54 km2) of water (72.35%).

The township borders the Monmouth County communities of Highlands and Middletown Township.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Brevent Park, Hillside, Hilton, Hilton Park, Navesink and Stone Church.

<text>Jefferson Township is the northernmost township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 20,538, a decrease of 776 (−3.6%) from the 2010 census count of 21,314, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,597 (+8.1%) from the 19,717 counted in the 2000 census.

Jefferson Township was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 11, 1804, from portions of Pequannock Township and Roxbury. The township was named after Thomas Jefferson, the President of the United States at the time the Township was created. The township is situated in the northernmost part of Morris County bordering both Passaic and Sussex counties.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of , including of land and of water (9.06%).

The township borders Mount Arlington, Rockaway Township, Roxbury and Wharton in Morris County; West Milford in Passaic County; and Hardyston Township, Hopatcong and Sparta in Sussex County.

The township has two large divisions, Milton and Lake Hopatcong. Each half has its own first-aid squad, fire department substation and set of elementary schools. Addresses in the Milton section of the township are classified under the Oak Ridge mailing city, which is shared with a portion of West Milford, or in the Newfoundland mailing area, shared with a portion of West Milford and Rockaway Township. Addresses in Lake Hopatcong use either Lake Hopatcong (not to be confused with the Hopatcong mailing city used in the Borough of Hopatcong) or Wharton as their mailing city. In 2016, there was an effort to change the mailing address for the Lake Shawnee section of town from a Wharton, NJ 07885 ZIP code, to a Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849 ZIP code. The effort was narrowly defeated. In 2026, a new effort will be made to change the mailing address ZIP code to Lake Hopatcong, NJ 07849.

Amos Chamberlain built the George Chamberlain House as a wedding gift for his son George Chamberlain. George Chamberlain and his wife Ruth Elizabeth Speaker had two children, Raymond and Archie Chamberlain, who lived in the house until the 1890s, when the Chamberlain family moved out, and started renting the house to people up until 1960. The house was purchased from the Chamberlain family by the Friends of the Library in 1960, and refurbished the building for 19 years in order to turn it into a library, which they opened in 1979. From 1979 to 1982, the house was the Violet Riker Library, named after Violet Riker, who first initiated public library service in Jefferson. In 1982, the township acquired the library and began the process of turning it into a museum, after Emily Panek got a grant of $15,000 and $27,000 in donations. By 1984 the building had been completely repaired after they sandblasted the walls, replaced a hole in the front door, repaired the windows, and replaced the chestnut floors. The house is currently the Jefferson Township Museum.

<text>Duchesne ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Duchesne County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,588 at the 2020 census.

==History==
18 September 1776 The Dominguez–Escalante Expedition came from the east where they crossed Blue Bench and descended into the valley north of the present-day town of Duchesne. &quot;We ascended a not very high mesa [Blue Bench] which was level and very stony, traveled about three-quarters of a league including ascent and descent, crossed another small river [Duchesne River] which near here enters the San Cosme (Strawberry River), named it Santa Caterina de Sena, and camped on its banks.&quot; &quot;Along these three rivers we have crossed today, there is plenty of good land for crops to support three good settlements, with opportunities for irrigation, beautiful cottonwood groves, good pastures, timber, and firewood nearby.&quot;

1822–1840 French Canadian trappers Étienne Provost, François le Clerc, and Antoine Robidoux entered the Uintah Basin by way of the Old Spanish Trail and made their fortunes by trapping the many beaver and trading with the Uintah tribe. From these French Canadian trappers, the Duchesne River and ultimately Duchesne City received its name.

1900–1905 Leases were arranged with the Ute tribe through the Indian agent &quot;Major&quot; H.P. Myton to provide pasture for sheep in and around where Duchesne city is located now. A story passed down from Mrs. William J. Bond about her Father Joseph W. Thomas discusses the area. &quot;During the winter of 1901 - 02, he (Thomas) hauled supplies from Heber to the now Duchesne area, to the sheep herd camp of John E. Austin, a brother-in-law. Together with three herders, Mr. Thomas tended sheep on the West bench (D-hill) near the (Theodore) cemetery site. They moved the herds to the East desert for the winter months. The Indians had quite a village where Duchesne is now. It was a winter camp, and in spring, they scattered.

A fence was stretched across the Indian Canyon as pasture for the horses grazed there on 8&quot; and 10&quot; salt grass. Seguesee Jack (Ute tribe leader) refused settlers (sheep herders) permission to trespass the village site. The Indians feared the sheep would eat the good grasses.&quot;

1905–1906 On 7 June 1905, the Secretary of the Interior directed the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to select one or more tracts of land in the Uintah Reservation suitable for townsites, so they might be reserved as such under the statutes of the United States. Three sites were designated, which are the current sites of Duchesne, Myton, and Randlett. A month later, President Theodore Roosevelt approved the selections and declared these lands reserved as townsites. On 28 August, the US government opened up the Uintah Basin to settle land they had acquired from the Ute Indians under the allotment act of 1891. &quot;Land lotteries&quot; were held in Vernal, Provo, Price, Grand Junction, Colorado, and Vernal, where each person was given a ticket with a number. On 28 August, 1 through 111 was allowed to make their claim. On 29 August, the next 111 people could make their claims. Sixty people, 46 adults and 14 children, settled on the townsite that is now Duchesne and called it by its first name, &quot;Elsie&quot; (Glen). Government surveyors laid out the streets, and the government accepted the survey on 18 October 1905. The first cabin was built by Charles Dickerson and Charles Ragland in October 1905. A.M. Murdock, with the help of a few men, put up a large circus tent to act as a trading post and post office. The town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Dora&quot; for a short time after Murdock&#x27;s 23-year-old daughter, then changed once again to &quot;Theodore&quot;, in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt. On 15 September 1905, Robert Duchesne Marsh was the first &quot;white&quot; child born in the townsite. The first winter was harsh, and the residents lived in tents or other temporary shelters. When spring came, the high water of the Duchesne River overflowed its banks, flooding the town. Many homesteaders&#x27; dreams died after the first winter, and they sold their claims off for next to nothing. Judge M. M. Smith recalls, &quot;One man asked me to write out a relinquishment for him, remarking, &#x27;I must either give up my claim or my wife. She won&#x27;t live here.&#x27;&quot; Dikes were quickly built up but washed away, and some of the town was under of water until June. Tents and houses were moved around to avoid the flooding problem before the next spring.

The flooding continued annually until 1910 when $5,000 was finally given to make the four river cut-offs needed to fix the problem. In 1906 the first bridge was built by Wasatch County across the Duchesne River in east Theodore.

1907–1914 The men of Theodore organized the Boosters Club, and the women organized the Standard Bearers in 1907. Both groups became a forceful factor in the early development of the town. With the flooding of the rivers every spring, the Boosters club was finding it hard to attract people and business to the &quot;muddy&quot; little town. The Boosters Club raised $500 to build a bridge across the Strawberry River at the mouth of Indian Canyon. The bridge was completed in 1908 and later replaced by the state in 1914. In 1908 A. M. Murdock took down the tent and built the first store, barber shop, and post office, the &quot;Pioneer Supply&quot;. The citizens built a town hall in 1907. After the flooding issue was resolved, the town grew quickly. In 1910 the population of &quot;Theodore&quot; was 929. The town&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Duchesne Record&quot;, started publication 8 April 1909. By 1910 the citizens had decided to change the name to &quot;Duchesne&quot;. The post office kept the name &quot;Theodore&quot; until the town&#x27;s petition to change the name was acknowledged on 5 May 1911. The town was incorporated in 1913, and A. M. Murdock was the first mayor.

On 13 July 1914, &quot;Wasatch County was divided, and Duchesne County was created.&quot; Duchesne was made the county seat on 5 Nov 1914 by the popular vote of the county&#x27;s citizens.

The name &quot;Duchesne&quot; is taken from the name of the river that runs through town and may have been named by fur trappers in the 1820s in honor of Mother Rose Philippine Duchesne, founder of the School of the Sacred Heart near St. Louis, Missouri, although other theories as to the name exist.

A photograph dated 1909, showing the A. M. Murdock Pioneer Supply Store and post office at Theodore, Utah (which was located approximately where Kohl&#x27;s Market stood in Duchesne in 1991) appeared in a postal history magazine in 1992. The Theodore post office operated from 1905 through 1913, when it was renamed Duchesne. 

==Geography==
Duchesne is located just west of the junction of the Strawberry and Duchesne rivers in the Uintah Basin of northeastern Utah. The Duchesne River drains the southwest slope of the Uinta Mountains, and the Strawberry river drains the eastern slopes of the Wasatch Range and is connected to Strawberry Reservoir. The two rivers combine at Duchesne, and the Duchesne River continues east to join the Green River at Ouray, Utah.

Native stands of cottonwood trees and willows grow along the river banks, while sagebrush and rabbitbrush fill the unirrigated bench tops. Alfalfa is the main cultivated crop of farmers in the area.

Via highway, Salt Lake City is to the west, Vernal is to the east, and Price is to the south.

==Industry==

In 1948 oil was found in the Uintah Basin but not developed until the early 1970s. Duchesne city is located in vast oil and natural gas reserves spanning the northeast corner of Utah and extending into western Colorado. As prices for crude rise, oil industry jobs open up in the town but also disappear when crude prices fall. Although reserves are vast, oil production is stifled to almost 50% of capacity by a lack of transportation of the paraffin-rich crude. Currently, crude is only transported to refineries in the Salt Lake City area using trucks. Pipelines can not be used because of the high wax content of the crude. Currently (2019), a study is being conducted on the feasibility of a rail line passing through Duchesne to allow transport of the crude to bigger markets.

Duchesne has benefited from the water resources of the Duchesne and Strawberry rivers that flow close to the town. The Central Utah Project was active in the area for 20 years and provided good jobs from 1967 to 1987. A recent expansion to the water treatment plant northwest of town will start supplying culinary water to the community of Roosevelt some away.

Duchesne is home to several heavy machines and steel manufacturers. A wide variety of products and parts are manufactured, including underground cranes, shield haulers, rifle barrels, steam locomotive parts, drill collars, turbine parts, gears, sprockets, and splines for the oil fields, steel mills, coal mines, trona mines, power plants, other machine shops, manufacturers and other industries in many capacities. Products are shipped domestically to Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and Europe.

Agriculture has always been a mainstay for many Duchesne residents and surrounding communities. The vast amount of federally owned and leased lands have given cattle and sheep ranchers good grazing for over 120 years in the area. Overgrazing in the early 20th century has led to reform in the grazing areas and a steady decline in sheep and cow production throughout the area. Small family farms are the mainstay.

Duchesne has always been rich in its rugged beauty and tourism. Thousands are drawn during warmer months to enjoy boating on Starvation Reservoir, fishing on the Strawberry and Duchesne rivers, and camping in the High Uintas.

==Population==
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 1,690 people, 797 households, and 601 families residing in the city. The population density was 893 people per square mile. There were 550 housing units at an average density of 238.8 per square mile (92.3/km2).

==History==

In 1905, by an act of Congress, the unallotted land of the Ute Indian Reservation was opened to homesteading. Several thousand hopeful 20th-century pioneers congregated in Provo and Grand Junction with the hope of successfully drawing lots for a homestead in a fertile region of the soon-to-be-opened lands. Throughout the fall and winter of 1905–06, the settlers came to the Uinta Basin.

The town of Roosevelt was founded in early 1906 when Ed Harmston turned his homestead claim into a townsite and laid out plots. His wife named the prospective town in honor of the president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was originally called &quot;Dry Gulch City&quot;, taking its name from a nearby gulch that only carries water during the early spring runoff season. Within a short time a store, a post office, and the Dry Gulch Irrigation Company were in business in the new town. In 1907, the Harmstons donated of ground for the town&#x27;s citizens to build a school. The first class had about fifteen pupils, who had to provide books from their homes. Roosevelt soon became the economic center for the area, eclipsing Myton and Duchesne.

Roosevelt is situated on U.S. Route 40 in the northeast corner of the state, south of the Uinta Mountains, at an elevation of . The town was incorporated at a mass meeting of 44 citizens on 21 February 1913. From 1906 to 1914 Roosevelt was in Wasatch County, but in 1914 Duchesne County was formed from part of Wasatch County, and, as the largest town in the county, Roosevelt anticipated becoming the county seat. However, when the total county-wide vote came in, the seat went to Duchesne.

==Economy==

The population of Roosevelt is approximately 6,700 people, but the town serves as the business center for several times that number from the many small towns and farming communities in the area.

Roosevelt is located in an area of vast oil reserves spanning the northeast corner of Utah and extending into western Colorado. The town &quot;booms&quot; whenever oil prices go up and falls on harder times when oil prices decrease. The proposed Uinta Basin Rail project would build a new railroad line into Roosevelt for transporting oil drilled in the area.

The city used to have an oil refinery, &quot;Plateau&quot;, named for the geographic location of the area, the Colorado Plateau. The oil from this area is known as &quot;Uinta Basin Black Wax Crude&quot; and has to be refined differently than most types of oil. Those in the oil business and land owners who profit from oil shares indicated during the high oil prices of 2005–2006 that refineries were cutting their profits by limiting the amount of Uinta Basin Black Wax they would refine.

Various types of farming, including beef cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, honey and hay, are prevalent in the outlying areas around town.

Roosevelt is also home of the only hospital in the county, Uintah Basin Medical Center.

==Education==
It is within the Duchesne County School District.

Roosevelt has become the county&#x27;s educational center with Union High School, Uintah Basin Technical College, and Utah State University&#x27;s Uintah Basin Regional Campus all located there. Union High School is on the east end of town and straddled the border between Duchesne and Uintah Counties, thus the name &quot;Union&quot;.

Union High School was then partially demolished in favor of a newly built school; still named Union, but located on a road just behind the old school and a little further west. It was still on the east end of town but not crossing the border how it was. This new school was necessary as the old one could barely accommodate all of the students and was unlikely to have enough space for the next generations to come.

Roosevelt is part of the Duchesne School District. Other schools in the area include: Eagle View Elementary (Public/K-8), East Elementary School (Public/K-5), Kings Peak Elementary (Public/K-5),Centennial Elementary (Public/K-5), Roosevelt Junior High School (Public/6-8), and Thompsen School (Public/3-12).

==Religion and local culture==

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the dominant religious denomination in Roosevelt, with three stake centers in town; the community also includes Roman Catholic, Christian Assembly of God, Baptist, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and other smaller denomination congregations.

Located near the Uintah/Ouray Indian Reservation headquarters of Fort Duchesne, Roosevelt is a multicultural and polyethnic community, with Caucasians and Native Americans being the most numerous. Roosevelt is situated in lands designated as the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation and there are many Pow-Wows and Indian Ceremonies held throughout the summer and fall months.

The UBIC (Uintah Basin in Celebration) is Roosevelt&#x27;s annual celebration. What started in the early part of the century as a yearly display of the latest in farming and industrial technology has developed into a yearly gala complete with parade, talent show, concerts, and dances.

<text>Clawson is a town in Emery County, Utah, United States. The population was 163 at the 2020 census. The community was named after Rudger Clawson, a Mormon leader.

==History==
A canal to carry water from Ferron Creek was completed in 1896. Before being settled, the area was known as North Flat. In 1897, the first settlers arrived, calling the community &quot;Kingsville&quot; after Guy King, who was one of the original settlers. The first school was opened in 1898 in the home of Guy King, with Florence Barney as the teacher. She rode on horseback each day to the school.
In 1902, the President of the Emery Stake, Reuben C. Miller, sent the bishopric of Ferron to select a permanent spot for the town of Kingsville. There were two candidate locations: the homesteads and the Westingkow farm west of that. The bishop decided it should be near the Westingkow farm because the lay of the land suggested that the old location could become swampy. Although the settlers initially disagreed, they consented, purchased the Westingkow farm, and moved their log cabins two miles to the west.

On October 25, 1904, LDS Church Apostle Rudger Clawson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles came and organized a ward. The town&#x27;s name was changed from Kingsville to Clawson in his honor.

After decades of existing as an unincorporated community, Clawson was incorporated as a town in 1981.

<text>Cleveland is a town in Emery County, Utah, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 464, down from 508 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Cleveland is located in northwestern Emery County in a swale of land between the mountains and the desert. It is east of Huntington, south of Price, and northeast of Castle Dale, the Emery County seat. According to the United States Census Bureau, Cleveland has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Cleveland was first settled in 1884 by Samuel Nelson Alger and Henry Sr. These two men took up homesteading, and soon afterward, 25 families joined them. Firm roots began to take hold, and gradually with hard work and persistence, Cleveland began to grow. These families were typically pioneers. Cleveland was named after Grover Cleveland, President of the United States in the 1880s.

The &quot;old timers&quot; claim that farms within the boundaries of Cleveland require less water than other farms in Emery County and have the most productive ground. Many founding fathers came to Cleveland because of good reports of plentiful grass and good homesteading. The reason that Cleveland was not settled sooner was the lack of a sufficient water source and supply.
In 1890, a log school with plank benches was outgrown by 1893 when a frame building was built. Later a two-story section was added. The adobe brick school was built in 1912. Harry B. Mortensen and C. Leslie Bennett were instrumental in getting sports, music, and speech programs started for school students. A new school was built in 1976 and remodeled in 1989.

Cleveland&#x27;s people loved social activities, and they had quite a few socials and parties. The departure of missionaries and servicemen was an exceptionally good reason for a get-together. In April 1910, Ernest E. Davis built a large opera house. Many dances and weddings were held there also. In April 1923, a silent movie picture machine was installed with a player piano for music. In 1928, a talking movie projector was installed. A roller skating rink was added in 1937. These buildings do not exist there today.

It had a population of 294 in 1930.

<text>Emery is a town in Emery County, Utah, United States. The population was 288 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
Emery sits at the base of the mountains that contain the North Horn Formation. Named after North Horn Mountain, near Castle Dale, this formation in Emery County contain numerous Cretaceous- and Tertiary-era fossil invertebrates, microfossils and palynomorphs. Flagstaff Peak, north of Emery, has abundant dinosaur bone material, prehistoric mammal remains, and petrified dinosaur footprints. The elevation is around 7000

===Fremont people, the Old Spanish Trail, and exploration===
The Fremont culture or Fremont people is a pre-Columbian archeological culture who existed in the area from AD 700 to 1300. It was adjacent to, roughly contemporaneous with, but distinctly different from the Ancestral Pueblo peoples. The culture received its name from the Fremont River, where the first Fremont sites were discovered. The Fremont River in Utah flows from the Johnson Valley Reservoir near Fish Lake east through Capitol Reef National Park to Muddy Creek, whose headwaters begin just north of Emery.
Two significant Fremont culture sites are located north and south of the town. Artifacts such as pottery, manos and metates (millingstones), and weaponry have been found along Muddy and Ivie creeks. Coil pottery, which is most often used to identify archaeological sites as Fremont, is not very different from that made by other Southwestern groups, nor are its vessel forms and designs distinct. What distinguishes Fremont pottery from other ceramic types is the material from which it is constructed. Variations in temper, the granular rock or sand added to wet clay to ensure even drying and to prevent cracking, have been used to identify five major Fremont ceramic types. They include Snake Valley gray in the southwestern part of the Fremont region, Sevier gray in the central area, the Great Salt Lake gray in the northwestern area, and Uinta and Emery gray in the northeast and southwestern regions. Sevier, Snake Valley, and Emery gray also occur in painted varieties. A unique and beautiful painted bowl form, Ivie Creek black-on-white, is found along either side of the southern Wasatch Plateau. In addition to these five major types found at Fremont villages, a variety of locally made pottery wares are found on the fringes of the Fremont region in areas occupied by people who seem to have been principally hunters and gatherers rather than farmers. The Rochester Rock Art Panel west of Emery is a significant rock art panel left by the Fremont People and has been the target of vandalism and relic thieves.

The earliest known entrance into the region known as Castle Valley by Europeans dates back to the Spanish explorers. The oldest names in Emery County are Spanish, not Native American — San Rafael, Sinbad, and probably Castle Valley itself are landmarks of that era when Spanish padres, Spanish American explorers, fur traders, trappers, and frontiersmen followed the Old Spanish Trail through Emery. From about 1776 to the mid-1850s, the Old Spanish Trail came up from Santa Fe, New Mexico, crossed the Colorado River at Moab, then the Green River where the city of Green River now stands, across the San Rafael desert into Castle Valley, then crossed along the eastern part of the town. This became the established route of the Spanish slave traders who captured indigenous people along the route and were selling them as slaves.
A sizable herd of wild horses is managed east of Emery. These wild horses and burros have occupied the San Rafael Swell area since the beginning of the Old Spanish Trail in the early 19th century. Early travelers would lose animals or have them run off by native Americans or rustlers. Many of these animals were headed for California to be traded and sold and were of good stock. The herd was also augmented by releasing domestic horses from local ranches. By the early 20th century, wild horse and burro numbers had soared and were captured and sold by local mustangers. This continued until the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. Since the passage of this act, the horses and burros have been managed under federal law and Bureau of Land Management regulation.

In the summer of 1853, Captain John W. Gunnison was sent by the War Department of the United States to explore a railroad route to the Pacific coast. Lt. E. G. Beckwith assisted him. They entered Castle Valley and passed near the town in October 1853. Gunnison described the area as follows: &quot;Except three or four small cottonwood trees, there is not a tree to be seen by the unassisted eye on any part of the horizon. The plain lying between us and the Wasatch Range, one hundred miles to the west, is a series of rocky, parallel chasms, and fantastic sandstone ridges. On the north, Roan Cliffs, ten miles from us, present bare masses miles back, a few scattering cedars may be distinguished with the glass. The surface around is whitened with fields of alkali resembling fields of snow. Unless this interior country possesses undiscovered minerals of great value, it can contribute but the merest trifle towards the maintenance of a railroad through it after it has been constructed.&quot;

===Settlement===

One folk story about the settlement goes as follows. It is said a group of pioneers were traveling through the area. A strong wind storm appeared, and they agreed to stop until it died down. The wind never stopped in time, and ultimately decided to settle there. This story is likely a joke about the prominent wind noted by residents.

The first settlers to Emery came from Sanpete County, Utah. This is unusually notable as the settlers headed east instead of the west (like most settlers at the time), even if it was over a mountain range. The first attempt at settlement was made at Muddy Creek, a stream following down a wide canyon and eventually emptying into the Dirty Devil River. The Muddy Creek vegetation included tall grass, sage, greasewood, rabbit brush, tender shad scale or Castle Valley clover, prickly pear cacti, and yucca. Along the creek banks were giant cottonwood trees and patches of huge thorny bushes with long needle-sharp spines called bull berry bushes. These berries, when beaten off onto a canvas, could be dried, made into jams, jellies, or even eaten raw.

Among these early settlers were Charles Johnson, Marenus, and Joseph Lund families. Casper Christensen and Fred Acord also brought their families and began to build cabins and plant crops. Joseph Lund, the first to build a small one-room log cabin with a lean-to, became discouraged and left it for Casper Christensen (this building still survives and has been restored and relocated to This Is the Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City). Most travels came by way of Salina Canyon and Spring Canyon, which weren&#x27;t much more than deer trails. Roads were bad at best and almost impassable most of the time. The modes of travel were by horseback, team, and wagon or on snowshoes in wintertime.

Another company settled farther up the canyon around this same date—families who came from Beaver, Mayfield, and Sterling. They called themselves &quot;The Beaver Brothers&quot;. Among these were Dan, Miles, and Samuel Miller, George Collier, Samuel Babbett and others. Some of these became discouraged and left the first year. The Millers moved farther down the lower part of the Muddy Creek canyon. This part has been called Miller&#x27;s Canyon ever since that time.

Several miles south, on Quitchupah Creek, several families were trying to homestead on land that was more barren than Muddy Creek. In the 1870s, Brigham Young called on several families from Sanpete County to settle on Muddy Creek. Most of the first homes on Muddy Creek were called a dugout. It was a room dug in the side of a hill or the bank of a wash. The front was very crude, sometimes the only door being a blanket hung over the opening, or a rough wooden door, hung with leather hinges. The windows were small openings made in the front wall and covered with heavy greased paper or white canvas. Each had a fireplace in one end, which served for heat, cooking and light. The heat from the fire made the dugout unbearably hot in summer, so then the cooking was done on an open fire outside. The roof of the dugout was made of poles, covered with willows and dirt. These roofs served well in dry weather, as they were warm and kept out the wind. However, they leaked badly in stormy weather. Another great inconvenience of these roofs was the fact that they were a home for snakes, rats, mice and spiders. The floors were usually dirt or sometimes rock.

During the years from 1882 to 1885 quite a number of families moved into the Muddy Creek area. A few of them were Jedediah Knight, Joseph Nielson, Pleasant Minchey, Frank Foote, Charley and Ammon Foote, George Merrick, Oscar Beebe, Orson Davis, Heber C. K. Petty, Sr., Joseph Evans, Rasmus Johnson, Carl Magnus Olsen, Peter Nielson, Peter Hansen, Heber Broderick, Peter Christensen, George A. Whitlock, Peter Victor Bunderson, Rasmus Albrechtsen, Christian A. Larsen, Lafe Allred, Hyrum Strong, Peter Jensen, Isaac Kimball, William George Petty, Niels Jensen, Wiley Payne Allred, Andrew C. Anderson, Stephen Williams and David Pratt. Most of these families were Danish immigrants. By 1885, it was determined that the canyon itself was not wide enough for many farms and that more fertile land lay to the south of the Muddy.

The settling of this land required bringing the waters of Muddy Creek through a tunnel that took nearly three years to dig. With no trained engineering assistance, the settlers made their calculations, started from opposite sides of the hill, dodged numerous cave-ins of the treacherous Mancos shale, maintained the correct level inside the tunnel, and connected both tunnels nearly perfectly.
1883 was a red-letter year for Casper Christensen. On April 15, he was set apart as the Presiding Elder of the Muddy Creek Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On August 26, his daughter, Bellette, was born, the first baby girl to be born on the Muddy Creek. On September 2, the Emery Ward was organized with Casper Christensen as bishop. Then on November 19, he was officially appointed postmaster at Muddy, in the County of Emery in the Utah Territory. His daughter, Hannah, was appointed as his assistant.

When Casper Christensen was first appointed postmaster and bishop, a postal inspector found him working in the field and tried to make him understand that he wanted to inspect his postal records. Finally, in desperation, he said, &quot;You don&#x27;t seem to know who I am. I am a postal inspector.&quot; Brother Casper indignantly replied, &quot;And YOU don&#x27;t know who I am. I&#x27;m the Bishop on the Creek!&quot; Town residents have continued to use this phrase when dealing with someone who was self-important.
Muddy Creek and Quitchupah residents consolidated on this new townsite. Log cabins were built as soon as logs could be hauled from the nearby mountains. The logs were smoothed on one side with grooves chopped in each end. They were then placed on top of each other with the smooth side facing inward. Chinks between the logs were filled with mud or clay. Willows were used for lath, nailed to the logs, and plastered with mud. This mud was then rubbed smooth and painted with a whitewash of lime. The roofs were made of rough lumber and covered with a layer of straw or brush and then a top layer of dirt. Later the roofs were greatly improved when cedar shingles became available.

The town of Muddy would later change to &quot;Emery&quot;, after Governor George W. Emery. However, both names would be synonymously used. Emery has always been an agricultural community. Ranching and farming are their major livelihood. The town would swell in population to have its own school, but after World War II, the population decreased due to a lack of economic opportunities and generally hovered around 300 residents. The discovery of coal south of the town led to several mines being developed and the idea that the town could once again draw in new residents. However, with the decrease in coal prices, production has not required the initiation of new mining operations.

On November 2, 1967, the Last Chance Motel was destroyed by a cone-shaped F2 tornado. Furniture and bedding were thrown hundreds of yards. The tornado occurred at the unusual time of 5:30 am, and no injuries were reported.

<text>Ferron ( ) is a city in western Emery County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,461 at the 2020 census.

==Settlement==

Ferron was originally populated by Mormon settlers in 1877. Three families responded to a call from the LDS Church asking to settle in the Castle Valley. They started on 15 November 1877 and arrived about 21 days later. The group spent time creating dugouts and later made their living in farming.
Although settled in late 1877, the town received its name sometime in the late 1860s to early 1870s when a government surveyor was sent under the homestead act to survey the area. The surveyor&#x27;s name was Augustus D Ferron, and, as the tale goes, they agreed to name the creek they camped by Ferron&#x27;s Creek if he would agree to a &quot;dunking&quot; in the creek. He did so, and the creek was then known as Ferron&#x27;s Creek. Later, when the town was settled, the &quot;s&quot; was dropped from the name, and the creek and town became known as &quot;Ferron&quot;.

==Geography==
Ferron is in western Emery County, along Utah State Route 10, which leads northeast to Castle Dale, the county seat, and southwest to Emery. According to the United States Census Bureau, Ferron has a total area of , all land.

<text>Huntington is a city in northwestern Emery County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,129 at the 2010 census. It is the largest town in Emery County.

==History==
Huntington is named after Huntington Creek, and the creek was probably named for Huntington brothers (William, Oliver, and Dimick, sons of William Huntington) who led exploring parties into the region during the 1850s. The first settlers of European extraction in the area were four stockmen, Leander Lemmon, James McHadden, Bill Gentry, and Alfred Starr, who brought their herds to Huntington Creek in 1875.

In the fall of 1877, in response to the same call from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that brought settlers to the other creeks in Castle Valley, a small group from Fairview, Utah, under the leadership of Elias Cox, established a dugout colony on the banks of Huntington Creek and began digging irrigation canals. The colony grew from 126 in 1880 to 738 in 1890 and 1,293 in 1910. A majority of the early settlers came from the Sanpete Valley, which by the late 1870s had outgrown its irrigable land, and many belonged to three or four interrelated kinship groups, making for an abundance of cousins in the community.

In 1880 a mile-square townsite was surveyed on the Prickly Pear Flat, a bench south and west of the creek. The first structure erected on the new townsite was a log meetinghouse, which was completed in time for an all-night New Year&#x27;s Eve party on 31 December 1880. Most of the townsite was without water until the completion of the Huntington Canal in 1882. Settlers drew town lots and built homes in town as they proved up on their homesteads. The first homes, some of which were still occupied until recent years, were typically of sawed log or plank construction or of adobe sheathed with lumber. The erection of a new LDS meetinghouse in 1896 inaugurated a twenty-year building boom that saw the completion of many brick homes, schools, and commercial buildings.

Huntington&#x27;s early economic base was agriculture and stockraising. Alfalfa seed was an important cash crop around the start of the 20th century, and honey produced by local apiarist Christian Ottesen won first prize at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in 1903. For most of its history, however, Huntington has drawn its main income from coal mining. Small &quot;wagon mines&quot; in Huntington Canyon provided limited employment. The coal camp of Mohrland, to the north, active from about 1909 to 1938, was virtually an extension of Huntington, with many residents dividing the year between the mine and the farm. With the coming of better highways in the 1940s and 1950s, many miners commuted daily from Huntington to Hiawatha and other Carbon County mines.
Its proximity to the regional commercial center of Price, and distance from a major highway, to the north, has prevented Huntington from developing extensive retail business. However, a flour mill erected in 1892 remained in operation into the 1980s, producing feeds for local farmers and flour and cereals marketed throughout Emery and Carbon counties. Huntington High School, established in 1915 and later renamed North Emery High, was a focal point of the community until the consolidation of Emery County schools in 1962.

From its early years, Huntington has had a strong amateur arts tradition. A martial band was organized in 1884. Community theater groups produced as many as half a dozen plays a year between 1890 and 1910. A choir directed by Thomas L. Hardee and composed of singers from Huntington and neighboring Cleveland won an Eisteddfod competition hosted by the Scofield Welsh Choir in 1895, and later performed at an LDS general conference in Salt Lake City. A men&#x27;s glee club organized in the early 1920s is still in existence, with third- and even fourth-generation members.

The 1950 census found 1,442 residents in the Huntington precinct. The population fell by one-third in the next ten years as mining jobs disappeared. This economic decline was reversed in 1972 when construction began on Utah Power and Light Company&#x27;s Huntington steam-electric generating plant in the mouth of the canyon. The construction plus development of coal-mining operations to supply the plant gave the town the character of an energy boom town for a few years. Industrial development not only enabled some former residents to return to the community but also attracted new permanent residents, bringing more diversity to the town&#x27;s former character as a Mormon farm village. While the community is still predominantly Mormon, the Mission San Rafael was established in 1977 a few miles south of Huntington to serve Catholic families in western Emery County. Baptist, Assembly of God, and nondenominational Protestant religious services have also been held in the community. The 1990 population of Huntington was 1,875.

===Mine disaster===
On Monday, August 6, 2007, at 2:48 a.m. (MDT), UtahAmerican Energy&#x27;s Crandall Canyon Mine, west northwest of Huntington, collapsed trapping six workers inside. The mine, located just off State Route 31, is about southeast of Fairview and south of Salt Lake City ( on a flight line). The workers were approximately from the mine entrance and underground. The collapse registered recorded seismic waves in magnitude 3.9 to 4.0, by seismograph stations of the University of Utah.

As of August 16, 2007, at about 6:30 p.m. MDT, three rescue workers were killed and six injured, as the tunnel the workers were digging collapsed on top of them, covering them with coal and rubble. The six men who were not killed outright were unable to be rescued after the rescue mission was forced to halt and died as well.

On March 22, 2013, one miner died and another was injured after they became trapped in a cave-in at a part of the Castle Valley Mining Complex, about west of Huntington.

==History==
Orangeville was founded in 1878 and was originally known as Upper Castle Dale. In 1879, when a post office was established, it was named Orangeville after Orange Seely, the first man called to settle Castle Valley.

===Naming the town===
Seely attempted to have the incoming settlers to stay on one side of the creek or the other, but they failed to heed him. Ultimately, two settlements about four miles apart developed, one on the northwest side of the creek, the other on the southeast, and the settlers decided that each should have a name. A real misunderstanding arose. &quot;Some contended that the lower town, now Castle Dale, should have been Orangeville because it was the home of Bishop Orange Seely, in whose honor the name was suggested by Erastus Snow, and Orangeville should have retained the original name of Castle Dale because the settlers first located there. A friendly rivalry soon sprang up. Orangeville people were dubbed &#x27;Skillet Lickers,&#x27; because molasses was made there, while the Castle Dale people were called &#x27;Woodenshoes&#x27; implying that Danes had settled there.&quot;

===Mine disaster===

The Wilberg Mine, located northwest of town, was the site of a mine fire on 19 December 1984 which claimed 27 lives: 18 miners and nine company officials. The disaster was the worst coal mine fire in Utah history. The escape route of the 27 persons was cut off when the fire quickly engulfed the intake of the 5th Right longwall. The fire was caused by a faulty air compressor, which was allowed to run unattended in an area that was not fire-proofed.

==History==
A party of 22 men came to the Antimony area in 1873 on a mission to make peace with the local Fish Lake band of Indians. They caught several coyote pups here, and named the place &quot;Coyote&quot;. The first permanent settlement was established, under the name of Coyote, in 1878. In 1880, deposits of the antimony ore stibnite were found in Coyote Canyon, and a mining industry began. This resulted in the town&#x27;s renaming, in 1921, to &quot;Antimony&quot;.

==Fireworks==
Antimony is known throughout Central Utah for its Fourth of July fireworks display which consists of three bottle rockets and free sparklers for anyone over the age of 3.

<text>Escalante () is a city in central Garfield County, Utah, United States, located along Utah Scenic Byway 12 (SR-12) in the south-central part of the state. As of the 2020 census, 786 people were living in the city.

The city is named after Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, a Franciscan missionary and a member of the first European expedition into what is now southern Utah.

The nearest towns are Boulder which is to the northeast on SR-12, and Henrieville, which is to the southwest on SR-12.

The Escalante Petrified Forest State Park is located west of the city. Sections of the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GSENM) abut much of the city&#x27;s limits. The Hole-in-the-Rock Road, which begins east of Escalante, is the main access road into the eastern section of GSENM. The road leads to the Canyons of the Escalante, the Devils Garden and the Hole-in-the-Rock.

==History==
In 1776, Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez left Santa Fe, New Mexico attempting to find a route to the missions of California. The &quot;Dominguez–Escalante Expedition&quot; followed a route north through western Colorado, west across central Utah, and then southwest through what is now called the Escalante Desert, finally circling back to the east after reaching Arizona near the north rim of the Grand Canyon. They returned to Santa Fe having never entered California or the areas near the city of Escalante. In 1866; Captain James Andrus led members of the Southern Utah militia through the Escalante area during the Black Hawk Indian War. The valley east of the Escalante Mountains, where the city of Escalante is located, was named &quot;Potato Valley&quot; since the group had found wild potatoes growing there.
Settlers from Panguitch first visited the area in the 1870s, where they met members of the John Wesley Powell expedition. The settlement was named based on a suggestion of Powell&#x27;s group to honor Escalante even though the expedition had not traveled into the valley. In June 1875, the settlers returned to survey the valley. Twenty-acre parcels were staked out for farming while city lots were also marked. After a winter spent back in Panguitch, the settlers returned, and the first home was built in March 1876 by William Alvey. The first settlers built many homes using native bricks, and as a result, those homes are still standing today.

The primary industries of the new settlement of Escalante were cattle and sheep ranching, dairy farming, logging and mining. Farming and ranching continue to drive the local economy today, along with increasing tourist-related activities. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built improved roads to Posey Lake and Boulder. Federal government management of large tracts of surrounding lands had begun, and stricter regulation of public lands combined with limited private land resources caused many people to leave Escalante in the 1940s.
The exodus to look for work in larger communities resulted in a loss of 33% of the population by the 1950 census. The population continued to decline through the next two decades, dropping to as low as 638 people, leaving only 15 more people than in the very first census in 1880. An increase of 25% by the 1990 census was followed by no change in the 2000 census and a slight decline in the 2010 census.

Since the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument (GSENM) was established in 1996, Escalante has seen a large increase in the number of tourists, especially in the spring through fall months. A survey taken from March to October 2004 by Utah State University claims that the BLM has an estimated 600,000 visitors to various parts of GSENM, many of whom pass through Escalante.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, 797 people, 334 households, and 217 families lived in the city. The population density was 271 people per square mile (105/km2).

<doc id="137007" wikidata="Q244407" url="?curid=137007" title="Paul Kruger">
<text>Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (; 10 October 1825 – 14 July 1904), better known as Paul Kruger, was a South African politician. He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa, and State President of the South African Republic (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed &quot;Oom Paul&quot; (&quot;Uncle Paul&quot;), he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause—that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State—against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom and admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero.

Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no education apart from the Bible. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.

Kruger was appointed vice president in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned. He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic&#x27;s independence, culminating in the Boers&#x27; victory in the First Boer War of 1880–1881. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected president. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a completely independent state.

Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886, &quot;uitlanders&quot; (foreigners) provided almost all of the South African Republic&#x27;s tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer burghers retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger&#x27;s attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in 1888, 1893 and 1898, and led to the Jameson Raid of 1895–1896 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the Heroes&#x27; Acre in Pretoria.

==Early life==

===Family and childhood===
Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the Steynsburg area of the Cape Colony, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801–1852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; &quot;née&quot; Steyn; 1806–1834). The family was of Dutch-speaking Afrikaner background, and of German, French Huguenot and Dutch stock. Kruger also had some Khoi ancestry, which came down to him from his ancestress Krotoa. The Kruger family’s paternal ancestors had lived in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Krüger, from Berlin, arrived in Cape Town as a 17-year-old soldier in the Dutch East India Company&#x27;s service. Jacob&#x27;s children dropped the umlaut from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin. Over the following generations, Kruger&#x27;s paternal forebears moved into the interior. His mother&#x27;s family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards. Kruger&#x27;s great-grand-uncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of Swellendam that revolted against Company rule in 1795.

Bulhoek, Kruger&#x27;s birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie&#x27;s home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in Cradock in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14. A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul was born in 1825. His first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used. The provenance of the third given name, Paulus, &quot;was to remain rather a mystery&quot;, Johannes Meintjes wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, &quot;and yet the boy was always called Paul.&quot;

Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826. Soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother died when he was eight; his father Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (&quot;née&quot; du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, the only education Kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood, Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.

===Great Trek===

In 1834 Casper Kruger, his father, and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the Caledon River, on the Cape Colony&#x27;s far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814 when the Netherlands ceded it to Britain with the Convention of London. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the Great Trek—a mass migration by Dutch-speaking &quot;Voortrekkers&quot; north-east from the Cape to the land on the far side of the Orange and Vaal rivers. Many Boers had been expressing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content. They had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape.

A group of emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter passed through the Krugers&#x27; Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer republic with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger&#x27;s father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey, the trekkers made improvised classrooms, marking them with reeds and grass. The more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.
The Voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a branch from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836, the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter&#x27;s laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting, while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.

During 1837 and 1838 Kruger&#x27;s family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary Daniel Lindley, who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration. The Zulu King Dingane concluded a land treaty with Potgieter. But he reconsidered and massacred first Piet Retief&#x27;s party of settlers, then others at Weenen. Kruger later recounted his family&#x27;s group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing &quot;children pinioned to their mothers&#x27; breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels&quot;. But &quot;God heard our prayer&quot;, he recalled, and &quot;we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack ... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game.&quot;

Because of the attacks, the Krugers returned to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter&#x27;s campaign that forced Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father settled at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal. In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane&#x27;s Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as the Day of the Vow.
===Burgher===

Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two farms—one for crops and one for grazing—upon becoming enfranchised burghers at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at the farm Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg in the Magaliesberg area. Kruger later became the owner of a piece of farmland named Waterkloof, on 30 September 1842. This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in Potchefstroom in 1842. The same year Kruger was elected a deputy field cornet—&quot;a singular honour at seventeen&quot;, Meintjes comments. This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior commissioned officer.

Kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman, horseman, and guerrilla fighter. In addition to his native Dutch, he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion for the first time when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions, Kruger was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-bore elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared on his arm up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—&quot;when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less.&quot; The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again.
Britain annexed the Voortrekkers&#x27; short-lived Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer resistance to this, but before long most of the Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to the area around the Orange and Vaal rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter&#x27;s expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains was settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846. In 1847 Kruger married her cousin, Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.

Concerned by the exodus of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that the Boers remained British subjects, the British Governor Sir Harry Smith in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the &quot;Orange River Sovereignty&quot;. Pretorius led a Boer commando raid against this, and they were defeated by Smith at the Battle of Boomplaats. Like the Krugers, Pretorius lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man&#x27;s resolve, sophistication, and piety. A warm relationship developed. &quot;Kruger&#x27;s political awareness can be dated from 1850&quot;, Meintjes writes, &quot;and it was in no small measure given to him by Pretorius.&quot; Like Pretorius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a single authority and win British recognition for their territory as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain—neither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British—but because they perceived the emigrants&#x27; unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects.

Henry Douglas Warden, the British Resident in the Orange River area, advised Smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with Pretorius. Smith sent representatives to meet him at the Sand River. Kruger, aged 26, accompanied Pretorius and on 17 January 1852 was present at the conclusion of the Sand River Convention, under which Britain recognised &quot;the Emigrant Farmers&quot; in the Transvaal as independent: they called themselves the &quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot; (&quot;South African Republic&quot;). In exchange for the Boers&#x27; pledge not to introduce slavery in the Transvaal, the British agreed not to make an alliance with any &quot;coloured nations&quot; there. Kruger&#x27;s uncle Gert was also present; his father Casper would have been as well but he was ill and unable to attend.

===Field cornet===

The Boer colonists and the local Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852, and in August that year he took part in the Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy (edema). Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but knocked him out without cutting him; later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket but not wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone&#x27;s mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger&#x27;s version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone&#x27;s house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain&#x27;s promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.

Livingstone and many others criticised the Boers for abducting women and children from tribal settlements and taking them home to work as slaves. The Boers argued that they did not keep these captives as slaves but as &quot;inboekelings&quot;—indentured &quot;apprentices&quot; who, having lost their families, were given bed, board and training in a Boer household until reaching adulthood. Modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a technical ruse by the Boers to enforce a means of inexpensive labour for them while avoiding overt slavery. Gezina Kruger had an &quot;inboekeling&quot; maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage, and paid her a dowry.

Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant (between field cornet and commandant), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command. Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late. Meintjes says that Pretorius &quot;was perhaps the first person to recognise that behind [Kruger&#x27;s] rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all the more remarkable for being almost entirely self-developed&quot;.

==Commandant==

Pretorius did not name a successor as Commandant-General; his eldest son, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger to the rank of commandant. Pretorius, the son, claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area—he said the British had promised it to his father—but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following Sir George Cathcart&#x27;s replacement of Smith as governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to the extent that the British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the fact that in addition to the Boer settlers, there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 Sir George Russell Clerk signed the Orange River Convention, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the &quot;Oranje-Vrijstaat&quot; (&quot;Orange Free State&quot;).

Bloemfontein, the former British garrison town, became the Free State&#x27;s capital; the Transvaal seat of government became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius&#x27; supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger&#x27;s first campaign as a commandant was in the latter part of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan (&quot;Makapansgat&quot;) with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.

===Mediator===
Marthinus Pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg&#x27;s new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.

The constitution settled upon formalised a national Volksraad (parliament) and created an executive council, headed by a president. Pretorius was sworn in as the first president of the South African Republic on 6 January 1857. Kruger successfully proposed Schoeman for the post of national Commandant-General, hoping to thereby end the factional disputes and foster unity, but Schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or Pretorius. With the Transvaal on the verge of civil war, tensions also rose with the Orange Free State after Pretorius&#x27;s ambitions of absorbing it became widely known. Kruger had strong personal reservations about Pretorius, not considering him his father&#x27;s equal, but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him.

After the Free State government dismissed an ultimatum from Pretorius to cease what he regarded as the marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms.

With Pretorius&#x27;s approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a white flag. Kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of Pretorius&#x27;s actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his president when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857. Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and Moshoeshoe I of the Basotho, and persuaded Schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as commandant-general. On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic. &quot;All in all&quot;, Kruger&#x27;s biographer T R H Davenport comments, &quot;he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play.&quot;

===Forming the &quot;Dopper Church&quot;===

Kruger considered Providence his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the Earth was flat, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said grace twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become Afrikaans. In late 1858, when he returned to Boekenhoutskloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions of the past few years and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him &quot;nearly dead from hunger and thirst&quot;, Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child.

Kruger belonged to the &quot;Doppers&quot;—a group of about 6,000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional Calvinist doctrine. They based their theology almost entirely on the Old Testament and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the Psalms. When the 1859 synod of the &quot;Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika&quot; (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as &quot;deluded&quot; and &quot;false&quot; and left its Rustenburg congregation. They formed the &quot;Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika&quot; (GK), thereafter known informally as the &quot;Dopper Church&quot;, and recruited the Reverend Dirk Postma, a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister. This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs.

===Civil war; Commandant-General===
In late 1859 Pretorius was invited to stand for president in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year&#x27;s leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be acting president in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as president of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.
Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius&#x27;s unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.
Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced—Van Rensburg became president, with Kruger as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg&#x27;s opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as commandant-general with a large majority. The civil war ended with Kruger&#x27;s victory over Jan Viljoen&#x27;s commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the Crocodile River on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as commandant-general with over two-thirds of the vote.

The civil war had led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government&#x27;s ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger&#x27;s attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.
In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic&#x27;s Swazi allies.

Pretorius stepped down as president in November 1871. In the 1872 election Kruger&#x27;s preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas François Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers&#x27;s election, announcing at his inauguration that &quot;as a good republican&quot; he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new president. He particularly disliked Burgers&#x27;s new education law, which restricted children&#x27;s religious instruction to outside school hours—in Kruger&#x27;s view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of commandant-general was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.

==Diamonds and deputations==

===Under Burgers===

Burgers busied himself attempting to modernise the South African Republic along European lines, hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united, independent South Africa. Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in Griqua territory just north of the Orange River on the western edge of the Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as uitlanders (&quot;out-landers&quot;), were flooding into the region. Britain began to pursue federation (at that time often referred to as &quot;confederation&quot;) of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge diamond mine at Kimberley, dubbing it Griqualand West.

Some Doppers preferred to embark on another trek, north-west across the Kalahari Desert towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the Dorsland Trek of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, but he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.

In 1876 hostilities broke out with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not to fight a war in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile commandant-general refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. &quot;I cannot lead the commando if you come&quot;, Kruger said, &quot;for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God&#x27;s blessing will not rest on your expedition.&quot; Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of &quot;volunteers&quot; under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.

With Burgers due to stand for re-election the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic&#x27;s independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered pace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic&#x27;s government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.

===British annexation; first and second deputations===
Shepstone arrived in Pretoria in January 1877. He outlined criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and expressed support for federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney E J P Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon&#x27;s allegations, one of which was that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of vice-president.

The impression of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone&#x27;s legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him &quot;gigantically horrible&quot;, he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger&#x27;s unsightliness was mentioned in British reports &quot;so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives&quot;. They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions.
Shepstone had the Transvaal&#x27;s annexation as a British territory formally announced in Pretoria on 11 April 1877. Burgers resigned and returned to the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as president was to announce the government&#x27;s decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger&#x27;s request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the first time in his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea.

During the voyage to England Kruger encountered a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, in their eyes more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and the structure of the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger&#x27;s own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls &quot;remarkable heights of oratory&quot;, averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of &quot;a handful of irreconcilables&quot;. Carnarvon dismissed Kruger&#x27;s idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.

Kruger did not meet Queen Victoria, though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact. Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877. He found a national awakening occurring. &quot;Paradoxically&quot;, John Laband writes, &quot;British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit.&quot; When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in Church Square. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British.
According to Meintjes, Kruger was still not particularly anti-British; he thought the British had made a mistake and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.

Carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who received the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: &quot;Have you ever heard of an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?&quot; Kruger retorted: &quot;Yes. The Orange Free State.&quot; The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon&#x27;s decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: &quot;Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end.&quot; Kruger was touched and wore it for the rest of his life.

Like its predecessor, the second deputation went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon for the first time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. &quot;High up in mid-air&quot;, he recalled, &quot;I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home.&quot; The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal &quot;to remind me of my journey through the air&quot;. The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.

===Drive for independence===

Kruger and Joubert returned home to find the British and the Zulus were close to war. Shepstone had supported the Zulus in a border dispute with the South African Republic, but then, after annexing the Transvaal, changed his mind and endorsed the Boer claim. Meeting Sir Bartle Frere and Lord Chelmsford at Pietermaritzburg on 28 November 1878, Kruger happily gave tactical guidance for the British campaign—he advised the use of Boer tactics, making laagers at every stop and constantly scouting ahead—but refused Frere&#x27;s request that he accompany one of the British columns, saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding the Transvaal. Chelmsford thought the campaign would be a &quot;promenade&quot; and did not take Kruger&#x27;s advice. Soon after he entered Zululand in January 1879, starting the Anglo-Zulu War, his unlaagered central column was surprised by Cetshwayo&#x27;s Zulus at Isandlwana and almost totally destroyed.
The war in Zululand effectively ended on 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford&#x27;s decisive victory at the Zulu capital Ulundi. Around the same time the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley&#x27;s new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.

At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, many of them bearing the republic&#x27;s &quot;vierkleur&quot; (&quot;four-colour&quot;) flag, voted to pursue a restored, independent republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger&#x27;s first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.

In early 1880 Hicks Beach forwarded a scheme for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; by the time they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was prime minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan&#x27;s withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic&#x27;s independence, but to their astonishment the prime minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley.
In the last months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax payments from burghers who were in arrears. Piet Cronjé, a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local landdrost a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their &quot;legal government&quot;—that of the South African Republic—but not to the British &quot;usurper&quot; administration. Kruger and Cronjé knew each other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed. In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher&#x27;s wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronjé and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon. On hearing of this from Cronjé, Kruger told Joubert: &quot;I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things.&quot;

Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the south-west of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded meeting of white people in South Africa up to that time. &quot;I stand here before you&quot;, Kruger declared, &quot;called by the people. In the voice of the people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!&quot; He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the vice-president of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.

==Triumvirate==

===Transvaal rebellion: the First Boer War===
At Kruger&#x27;s suggestion Joubert was elected Commandant-General of the restored republic, though he had little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town on the main road from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.

Kruger took part in the First Boer War in a civilian capacity only, playing a diplomatic and political role with the aid of Jorissen and Bok. The first major clash, a successful Boer ambush, took place on 20 December 1880 at Bronkhorstspruit. By the turn of the year the Transvaalers had all six British garrison outposts, including that in Pretoria, under siege. Colley assembled a field force in Natal, summoned reinforcements from India, and advanced towards the Transvaal. Joubert moved about 2,000 Boers south to the Drakensberg and repulsed Colley at Laing&#x27;s Nek on 28 January 1881. After Colley retreated to Schuinshoogte, near Ingogo, he was attacked by Joubert&#x27;s second-in-command Nicolaas Smit on 8 February and again defeated.

Understanding that they could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a solution at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone&#x27;s Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.

Colley&#x27;s death horrified Kruger, who feared it might jeopardise the peace process. His reply to Colley&#x27;s letter was delivered to his successor Sir Evelyn Wood on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, retrocession of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly &quot;suzerainty&quot; meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months. The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881.

===Pretoria Convention===

Kruger presented the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate&#x27;s behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. &quot;With a feeling of gratitude to the God of our fathers&quot;, he said, &quot;who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty ... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the , for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to show you a proof of England&#x27;s noble and magnanimous love for right and justice.&quot; This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger&#x27;s biographers, stresses it as one of his &quot;most notable utterances&quot;. Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape&#x27;s Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened for the first time in Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia.

Kruger was largely happy with the terms under which the republic would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him. The first of these was that the British would recognise them as the &quot;Transvaal Republic&quot; and not the South African Republic; the second was that it was still not clear to him what British &quot;suzerainty&quot; was. The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal&#x27;s external affairs. The final Pretoria Convention was signed on 3 August 1881 by Joubert, Pretorius and the members of the royal commission. Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square. Kruger felt well enough to give only a short speech, after which Pretorius addressed the crowd and the &quot;vierkleur&quot; was raised.

By now aged nearly 56, Kruger resolved that he could no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina&#x27;s permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.

A direct consequence of the end of British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad—approve it or go back to Laing&#x27;s Nek, said Kruger—before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate&#x27;s decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed the Reverend S J du Toit to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new president the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which &quot;God&#x27;s Word would be my rule of conduct&quot;—as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers&#x27;s Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would &quot;prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled&quot;, and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and &quot;obedient native races in their appointed districts&quot;. He defeated Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as president on 9 May 1883.

==President==

===Third deputation; London Convention===
Kruger became president soon after the discovery of gold near what was to become Barberton, which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers. &quot;This gold is still going to soak our country in blood&quot;, said Joubert—a prediction he would repeat many times over the coming years. Joubert remained commandant-general under Kruger and also became vice-president. A convoluted situation developed on the Transvaal&#x27;s western frontier, where burghers had crossed the border defined in the Pretoria Convention and formed two new Boer republics, Stellaland and Goshen, on former Tswana territory in 1882. These states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance—the main road from the Cape to Matabeleland and the African interior.

Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Ewald Esselen as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary Lord Derby and Robinson progressed smoothly—apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson—and on 27 February 1884 the London Convention, superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal&#x27;s national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph.
The deputation went on from London to mainland Europe, where according to Meintjes their reception &quot;was beyond all expectations ... one banquet followed the other, the stand of a handful of Boers against the British Empire having caused a sensation&quot;. During a grand tour Kruger met William III of the Netherlands and his son the Prince of Orange, Leopold II of Belgium, President Jules Grévy of France, Alfonso XII of Spain, Luís I of Portugal, and in Germany Kaiser Wilhelm I and his Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. His public appearances were attended by tens of thousands. The deputation discussed the bilateral aspects of the proposed Delagoa Bay railway with the Portuguese, and in the Netherlands laid the groundwork for the Netherlands-South African Railway Company, which would build and operate it. Kruger now held that Burgers had been &quot;far ahead of his time&quot;—while reviving his predecessor&#x27;s railway scheme, he also brought back the policy of importing officials from the Netherlands, in his view a means to strengthen the Boer identity and keep the Transvaal &quot;Dutch&quot;. Willem Johannes Leyds, a 24-year-old Dutchman, returned to South Africa with the deputation as the republic&#x27;s new State Attorney.

By late 1884 the Scramble for Africa was well underway. Competition on the western frontier rose after Germany annexed South-West Africa; at the behest of the mining magnate and Cape MP Cecil Rhodes, Britain proclaimed a protectorate over Bechuanaland, including the Stellaland–Goshen corridor. While Joubert was in negotiations with Rhodes, Du Toit had Kruger proclaim Transvaal protection over the corridor on 18 September 1884. Joubert was outraged, as was Kruger when on 3 October Du Toit unilaterally hoisted the &quot;vierkleur&quot; in Goshen. Realising the implications of this—it clearly violated the London Convention—Kruger had the flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 September. Meeting Rhodes personally in late January 1885, Kruger insisted the &quot;flag incident&quot; had taken place without his consent and conceded the corridor to the British.

===Gold rush; burghers and uitlanders===
In July 1886 an Australian prospector reported to the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic&#x27;s formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which within a few years was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony&#x27;s the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.

The President was by this time widely nicknamed &quot;Oom Paul&quot; (&quot;Uncle Paul&quot;), both among the Boers and the uitlanders, who variously used it out of affection or contempt. He was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised the independence of the republic&#x27;s judiciary to help his friend Alois Hugo Nellmapius, who had been found guilty of embezzlement—Kruger rejected the court&#x27;s judgement and granted Nellmapius a full pardon, an act Nathan calls &quot;completely indefensible&quot;. Kruger defeated Joubert again in the 1888 election, by 4,483 votes to 834, and was sworn in for a second time in May. Nicolaas Smit was elected vice-president, and Leyds was promoted to state secretary.
Much of Kruger&#x27;s efforts over the next year were dedicated to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King Lobengula of Matabeleland, was killed by Ngwato warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of &quot;Cecil Rhodes and his clique&quot;. Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral—in his memoirs he called him &quot;capital incarnate&quot; and &quot;the curse of South Africa&quot;. According to the editor of Kruger&#x27;s memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting &quot;we simply take&quot; Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled. Failing to make headway in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to Kosi Bay, next to Swaziland, in late 1888.

In early 1889 Kruger and the new Orange Free State President Francis William Reitz enacted a common-defence pact and a customs treaty waiving most import duties. The same year the volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove the &quot;Nederduits Hervormde Kerk&quot;&#x27;s official status, open the legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches &quot;sovereign in their own spheres&quot;. Kruger proposed to end the lack of higher education in the Boer republics by forming a university in Pretoria; enthusiastic support emerged for this but the Free University of Amsterdam expressed strong opposition, not wishing to lose the Afrikaner element of its student body. No university was built.

Kruger was obsessed with the South African Republic&#x27;s independence, the retention of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided almost all of the republic&#x27;s revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official. Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals&#x27; industry and respect for the state&#x27;s laws, but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the probable result of absorption into the British sphere. Agonising over how he &quot;could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers&quot;, he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a &quot;second volksraad&quot; in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them. Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger&#x27;s own supporters were unenthusiastic.

Rhodes and other British figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger&#x27;s administration recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician James Bryce, most uitlanders saw the country as &quot;virtually English&quot; and perceived &quot;something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors&quot;. On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the &quot;vierkleur&quot; at the city landdrost&#x27;s office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying. One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: &quot;I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself.&quot; The riot was broken up by police and the Chamber of Mines issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying only a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as &quot;the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began&quot;.

===Early 1890s===
In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch&#x27;s legal adviser William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now attained a dominant position in the Transvaal&#x27;s mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.

Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A month later the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without consulting the Swazis)—the South African Republic could build a railway through it to Kosi Bay on the condition that the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes&#x27;s Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger&#x27;s administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging.

Kruger&#x27;s second volksraad sat for the first time in 1891. Any resolution it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years&#x27; residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old. During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotzé as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state&#x27;s independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert&#x27;s supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.
Kruger was by this time widely perceived as a personification of Afrikanerdom both at home and abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. &quot;Once seen, he is not easily forgotten&quot;, wrote Lady Phillips. &quot;His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number ... and I think his character is clearly to be read in his face—strength of character and cunning.&quot;

===Rising tensions: raiders and reformers===

By 1894 the Kosi Bay scheme had been abandoned and the Delagoa Bay line was almost complete, and the railways from Natal and the Cape had reached Johannesburg. Chief Malaboch&#x27;s insurgency in the north compelled Joubert to call up a commando and the State Artillery in May 1894. Those drafted included British subjects, the large majority of whom indignantly refused to report, feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted. Kotzé&#x27;s ruling that British nationality did not preclude one from conscription as a Transvaal resident prompted an outpouring of displeasure from the uitlanders that manifested itself when Loch visited Pretoria the following month. Protesters waited for Kruger and Loch to enter the presidential coach at the railway station, then unharnessed the horses, attached a Union Jack and raucously dragged the carriage to Loch&#x27;s hotel. Embarrassed, Loch complied with Kruger&#x27;s request that he should not go on to Johannesburg. Kruger announced that &quot;the government will, in the meantime, provisionally, no more commandeer British subjects for personal military service&quot;. In his memoirs, he alleged that Loch secretly conferred with the uitlanders&#x27; National Union at this time about how long the miners could hold Johannesburg by arms without British help.
The following year the National Union sent Kruger a petition bearing 38,500 signatures requesting electoral reform. Kruger dismissed all such entreaties with the assertion that enfranchising &quot;these new-comers, these disobedient persons&quot; might imperil the republic&#x27;s independence. &quot;Protest!&quot; he shouted at one uitlander deputation; &quot;What is the use of protesting? I have the guns, you haven&#x27;t.&quot; The Johannesburg press became intensely hostile to the President personally, using the term &quot;Krugerism&quot; to encapsulate all the republic&#x27;s perceived injustices. In August 1895, after gauging burghers&#x27; views from across the country, the first volksraad rejected the opposition&#x27;s bill to give all uitlanders the vote by 14 ballots to 10. Kruger said this did not extend to those who had &quot;proved their trustworthiness&quot;, and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in Transvaal commandos.

The Delagoa Bay railway line was completed in December 1894—the realisation of a great personal ambition for Kruger, who tightened the final bolt of &quot;our national railway&quot; personally. The formal opening in July 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all the neighbouring territories present, including Loch&#x27;s successor Sir Hercules Robinson. &quot;This railway changed the whole internal situation in the Transvaal&quot;, Kruger wrote in his autobiography. &quot;Until that time, the Cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly, so to speak, of the Johannesburg traffic.&quot; Difference of opinion between Kruger and Rhodes over the distribution of the profits from customs duties led to the Drifts Crisis of September–October 1895: the Cape Colony avoided the Transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead. Kruger&#x27;s closure of the drifts (fords) in the Vaal River where the wagons crossed prompted Rhodes to call for support from Britain on the grounds that the London Convention was being breached. The Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain told Kruger if he did not reopen the drifts Britain would do so by force; Kruger backed down.
Understanding that renewed hostilities with Britain were now a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took with him an order from the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions. Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes pondered the co-ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland–Transvaal frontier under Leander Starr Jameson, the Chartered Company&#x27;s administrator in Matabeleland. On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand—the Jameson Raid had begun.

Jameson&#x27;s force failed to cut all of the telegraph wires, allowing a rural Transvaal official to raise the alarm early, though there are suggestions Kruger had been tipped off some days before. Joubert called up the burghers and rode west to meet Jameson. Robinson publicly repudiated Jameson&#x27;s actions and ordered him back, but Jameson ignored him and pushed on towards Johannesburg; Robinson wired Kruger offering to come immediately for talks. The Reform Committee&#x27;s efforts to rally the uitlanders for revolt floundered, partly because not all of the mine-owners (or &quot;Randlords&quot;) were supportive, and by 31 December the conspirators had raised a makeshift &quot;vierkleur&quot; over their headquarters at the offices of Rhodes&#x27;s Gold Fields company, signalling their capitulation. Unaware of this, Jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to Piet Cronjé on 2 January 1896.

A congratulatory telegram to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January prompted a storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk of the death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson&#x27;s proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.

===Resurgence===
The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes&#x27;s political reputation in the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as prime minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger&#x27;s handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France.
In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, the young lawyer Kruger had encountered on the ship to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other&#x27;s confidence; each man&#x27;s memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began to take exception to the South African Republic&#x27;s diplomatic actions, such as joining the Geneva Convention, which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called &quot;nonsensical&quot;. Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other&#x27;s independence. Two months later Sir Alfred Milner became the new high commissioner and governor in Cape Town.

Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member Louis Botha reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it. A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice Kotzé abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. &quot;This decision would have upset the whole country&quot;, Kruger recalled, &quot;for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad.&quot; Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the volksraad decrees.
Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897–98 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet—12,853 votes to Joubert&#x27;s 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger&#x27;s 3,753—and was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotzé, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger&#x27;s critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant. Milner called Kotzé&#x27;s dismissal &quot;the end of real justice in the Transvaal&quot; and a step that &quot;threatened all British subjects and interests there&quot;.

Kruger&#x27;s final administration was, Meintjes suggests, the strongest in the history of the republic. He had the former Free State President F W Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger&#x27;s longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners&#x27; sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.

===Road to war===

Anglo-German relations warmed during late 1898, with Berlin disavowing any interest in the Transvaal; this opened the way for Milner and Chamberlain to take a firmer line against Kruger. The so-called &quot;Edgar case&quot; of early 1899, in which a South African Republic Policeman was acquitted of manslaughter after shooting a British subject dead during an attempted arrest, prompted outcry from the British element in the Transvaal and is highlighted by Nathan as &quot;the starting point of the final agitation which led to war&quot;.

The South African League, a new uitlander movement, prepared two petitions, each with more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger&#x27;s government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking on the role of mediator. &quot;You &quot;must&quot; make concessions on the franchise issue&quot;, Steyn counselled. &quot;Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede ... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends.&quot; Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was &quot;prepared to do anything&quot;—&quot;but they must not touch my independence&quot;, he said. &quot;They must be reasonable in their demands.&quot;

Milner wanted full voting rights after five years&#x27; residence, a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for the new burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years&#x27; residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of the Free State. The High Commissioner declared his original request an &quot;irreducible minimum&quot; and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: &quot;How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!&quot; When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying &quot;It is our country you want&quot;. Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary.

Back in Pretoria Kruger introduced a draft law to give the mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years&#x27; prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already in the country for nine years or more would get the vote immediately. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty. Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would &quot;formulate their own proposals for a final settlement&quot;.

Kruger resolved that war was inevitable, comparing the Boers&#x27; position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. &quot;Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?&quot; he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers&#x27; only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.

===Second Boer War===


The outbreak of war raised Kruger&#x27;s international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him this was a fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health—he turned 74 the week war broke out—but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly from his office in Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger&#x27;s sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories and by the end of October were besieging Kimberley, Ladysmith and Mafeking. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be acting commandant-general.

The British relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers. Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.

With the major towns and the railways under British control, the conventional phase of the war ended; Kruger wired Steyn pondering surrender, but the Free State President insisted they fight &quot;to the bitter end&quot;. Kruger found new strength in Steyn and telegrammed all Transvaal officers forbidding the laying down of arms. &quot;Bittereinders&quot; (&quot;bitter-enders&quot;) under Botha, Christiaan de Wet and Koos de la Rey took to the veld and waged a guerrilla campaign. British forces under Lord Kitchener applied a scorched earth policy in response, destroying the farmsteads owned by Boer guerillas still active in the field; non-combatants (mostly women and children) were put into what the British dubbed &quot;concentration camps&quot;. Kruger moved to Waterval Onder, where his small house became the &quot;Krugerhof&quot;, in late June. After Roberts announced the annexation of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900—the Free State had been annexed on 24 May—Kruger proclaimed on 3 September that this was &quot;not recognised&quot; and &quot;declared null and void&quot;. It was decided in the following days that to prevent his capture Kruger would leave for Lourenço Marques and there board ship for Europe. Officially he was to tour the continent, and perhaps America too, to raise support for the Boer cause.

==Exile and death==
Kruger left the Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept as the train crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first outgoing steamer, the &quot;Herzog&quot; of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, at the behest of the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS &quot;Gelderland&quot;, and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. &quot;Gelderland&quot; departed on 20 October 1900.

He received a rapturous welcome in Marseille on 22 November—60,000 people turned out to see him disembark. Accompanied by Leyds, he went on to an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to Cologne on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. &quot;The Kaiser has betrayed us&quot;, he told Leyds. They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would feel more like home. After another buoyant reception from the general public, Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in The Hague, but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch authorities to have them stay in the seat of government. The Kruger party moved to Hilversum in April 1901.

Gezina, with whom Kruger had had 16 children—nine sons, seven daughters (of whom some died young)—had eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from the concentration camp at Krugersdorp, where their mother had died, in July 1901. Five of the eight children died within nine days, and two weeks later Gezina also died. Meintjes writes that a &quot;strange silence&quot; enveloped Kruger thereafter. By now partially blind and almost totally deaf, he dictated his memoirs to his secretary Hermanus Christiaan &quot;Madie&quot; Bredell and Pieter Grobler during the latter part of 1901, and the following year they were published. Kruger and his entourage relocated in December 1901 to Utrecht, where he took a comfortable villa called &quot;Oranjelust&quot; and was joined by his daughter Elsje Eloff and her family.

Rhodes died in March 1902, bequeathing Groote Schuur to be the official residence for future premiers of a unified South Africa. Kruger quipped to Bredell: &quot;Perhaps I&#x27;ll be the first.&quot; The war formally ended on 31 May 1902 with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging; the Boer republics became the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies. Kruger accepted it was all over only when Bredell had the flags of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State removed from outside Oranjelust two weeks later. In reply to condolences from Germany, Kruger would only say: &quot;My grief is beyond expression.&quot;

Kruger would not countenance the idea of returning home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile. Steyn similarly refused to accept the Boer defeat and joined Kruger in Europe, though he did later return to Southern Africa. Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were berated by Kruger for &quot;signing away independence&quot;—rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them.

After passing from October 1902 to May 1903 at Menton on the French Riviera, Kruger moved back to Hilversum, then returned to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he spent the rest of his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. &quot;He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past&quot;, he wrote in his final letter, addressed to the people of the Transvaal. &quot;Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, and levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again.&quot; After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him.

Kruger&#x27;s body was initially buried in The Hague but was soon repatriated with British permission. After ceremonial lying in state, he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the &quot;vierkleur&quot; of the South African Republic draped over his coffin, and buried in what is now called the Heroes&#x27; Acre in the Church Street Cemetery.

==Appraisal and legacy==
Academic opinion on Kruger is divided. To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero; to critics he was &quot;an anachronistic throwback&quot;, the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans. &quot;More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of&quot;, writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image—&quot;a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification&quot;, depicting Kruger as anything &quot;from saint to stuffy mendacious savage&quot;. Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the &quot;most extraordinary&quot; of South Africans.

Following the Union of South Africa under Botha in 1910, Kruger remained &quot;a vital force in South African politics and Afrikaner culture&quot;. The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed Kruger National Park in 1926. In 1954, over half a century after its construction by Anton van Wouw, a bronze statue of Kruger in his characteristic Dopper suit and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods. Thirteen years later the South African Mint put his likeness on the Krugerrand, a gold bullion coin still produced and exported in the 21st century. His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are provincial heritage sites. The former has been preserved to appear as it did in his time.

Kruger gives his name to the town of Krugersdorp, and to many streets and squares in South Africa and other countries, especially the Netherlands and Belgium. This has, on occasion, led to controversy; in 2009 local authorities in St Gallen, Switzerland renamed &quot;Krügerstrasse&quot; &quot;because of racist associations&quot;. Clarens, Free State is named after Kruger&#x27;s last home in Switzerland. During the Second World War Kruger&#x27;s life story and image were appropriated by propagandists in Nazi Germany, who produced the biographical film &quot;Ohm Krüger&quot; (&quot;Uncle Krüger&quot;, 1941) to attack the British, with Emil Jannings in the title role. The underdevelopment of South African administrative law until the late 20th century was, Davenport asserts, the direct result of Kruger&#x27;s censure and dismissal of Chief Justice Kotzé in 1898 over the question of judicial review.

&quot;Paul Kruger&#x27;s name and fame he made himself&quot;, Leyds said. &quot;It is sometimes said that he was illiterate. This is of course nonsense ... He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things.&quot; &quot;In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master&quot;, E B Iwan-Müller asserted. &quot;He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He was what I believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist.&quot; Soon after Kruger&#x27;s death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner Emily Hobhouse: &quot;He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man—both morally and intellectually—whom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his &#x27;never say die&#x27; attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us.&quot;

<text>Panguitch ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Garfield County, Utah, United States. The population was 1,725 at the 2020 census. The name Panguitch comes from a Southern Paiute word meaning “Big Fish,” likely named after the plentiful nearby lakes hosting rainbow trout year-round.

==Geography==

Panguitch is located on the western edge of Garfield County at (37.822234, -112.434650), in the valley of the Sevier River. U.S. Route 89 passes through the center of town, leading north to Junction and south to Orderville. Utah State Route 143 leads southwest from Panguitch to Panguitch Lake in Dixie National Forest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Panguitch has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with summers featuring hot afternoons and cold mornings, and cold, dry winters. The high altitude and relatively high latitude means that mornings are cold throughout the year and freezing for most of it: between 1971 and 2000 an average of 227.7 mornings fell below freezing and 16.5 mornings fell to or below . Maxima, however, can be expected to top freezing on all but fourteen afternoons during an average year, and the winters are so dry that snowfall is light, averaging only with median cover never much above . The most snowfall in a month has been in the famously cold January 1949, and the most in a season from July 1951 to June 1952. Mild, dry winters like 1976/1977 and 1980/1981 can in contrast see negligible snowfall for an entire season.

In a manner more akin to Arizona than northern Utah, most of the limited precipitation occurs during the July to October monsoon season, but Garfield County is usually too far north to receive the monsoon&#x27;s full benefit. The wettest month on record has been August 1987 with , and the wettest day was August 18, 1984, with . 1967 with has been the wettest calendar year, whereas in 1989 only fell.
==History==
Panguitch was first settled in March 1864, when Jens Nielsen, a Danish convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, led a group of 54 families eastward from Parowan and Beaver to the Sevier River. Due to the area&#x27;s high elevation, above sea level, winter&#x27;s cold weather arrived early in the year, and most of the settlers&#x27; initial crops were killed by frost before they could mature. At a crisis point, seven men left the community to seek flour and foodstuffs from surrounding communities. Heavy snow forced the abandonment of wagons and teams, and the men finished their rescue mission on foot, reportedly by laying one quilt after another upon the snow to maintain their footing.

Due to the Black Hawk War to the north, church officials decided the settlers should abandon the area, and they did so in May 1865. Five years later, Brigham Young decided it was time to try again, and new settlers arrived in 1871. The settlers built a fort, where they lived until more housing could be built and the fields could be replanted. They harvested a lot of grain, so much that they built a grist mill. The settlers cut lumber from the forests and processed it in sawmills and shingle mills. They had a tannery to produce leather from local cattle. The settlers used kilns to process local clay into rose-colored bricks. Workers were paid in bricks, which they used to build their own houses. Rose-colored brick houses still stand in Panguitch.

Panguitch was incorporated in 1899. A social hall was built in 1900, but it burned down in 1920. A new social hall replaced it, and it continues to stand, as the Panguitch Playhouse. The Panguitch Indian School operated from 1904 to 1909, primarily housing Utah Paiutes and Kaibab Paiutes. Students as young as six were taken from their tribe and forced to live at the school overseen by the federal government. Some children were taken at gunpoint from St. George and Moccasin, Arizona.

Timber and livestock production were successful industries in Panguitch until the economic shifts following World War I.

Following the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park and the designation of nearby areas as national forests, tourism has since played a major role in the local economy.

The National Register of Historic Places designated the entire town the Panguitch Historic District in 2007.

<doc id="137011" wikidata="Q130134" url="?curid=137011" title="Moab, Utah">
<text>Moab () is the largest city in and the county seat of Grand County in eastern Utah in the western United States, known for its dramatic scenery. The population was 5,366 at the 2020 census. Moab attracts many tourists annually, mostly visitors to the nearby Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. The town is a popular base for mountain bikers who ride the extensive network of trails including the Slickrock Trail, and for off-roaders who come for the annual Moab Jeep Safari.

Moab is home to one of the nine regional campuses of Utah State University.

==History==

===Early years===
Residents named the town Moab in 1880; in the Bible this term refers to an area of land located on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Some historians believe the city in Utah came to use this name because of William Andrew Peirce, the first postmaster, believing that the biblical Moab and this part of Utah were both &quot;the far country&quot;. However, others believe the name has Paiute origins, referring to the word &quot;moapa&quot;, meaning &quot;mosquito&quot;. Some of the area&#x27;s early residents attempted to change the city&#x27;s name, because in the Christian Bible, Moabites are demeaned as incestuous and idolatrous (but note, Ruth was a Moabite). One petition in 1890 had 59 signatures and requested a name change to &quot;Vina&quot;. Another effort attempted to change the name to &quot;Uvadalia&quot;. Both attempts failed.

During the period between 1829 and the early 1850s, the area around what is now Moab served as the Colorado River crossing along the Old Spanish Trail. Latter-day Saint settlers attempted to establish a trading fort at the river crossing called the Elk Mountain Mission in April 1855 to trade with travellers attempting to cross the river. Forty men were called on this mission. There were repeated Indian attacks, including one on September 23, 1855, in which James Hunt, companion to Peter Stubbs, was shot and killed by a Native American. After this last attack, the fort was abandoned. A new group of settlers from Rich County, led by Randolph Hockaday Stewart, established a permanent settlement in 1878 under the direction of Brigham Young. Moab was incorporated as a town on December 20, 1902.

In 1883 the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad main line was constructed across eastern Utah. The rail line did not pass through Moab, instead passing through the towns of Thompson Springs and Cisco, to the north. Later, other places to cross the Colorado were constructed, such as Lee&#x27;s Ferry, Navajo Bridge and Boulder Dam. These changes shifted the trade routes away from Moab. Moab farmers and merchants had to adapt from trading with passing travelers to shipping their goods to distant markets. Soon Moab&#x27;s origins as one of the few natural crossings of the Colorado River were forgotten. Nevertheless, the U.S. military deemed the bridge over the Colorado River at Moab important enough to place it under guard as late as World War II.

In 1943, a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp outside Moab was used as a Citizen Isolation Center to confine Japanese American internees labeled &quot;troublemakers&quot; by authorities in the War Relocation Authority, the government body responsible for overseeing the wartime incarceration program. The Moab Isolation Center for &quot;noncompliant&quot; Japanese Americans was created in response to growing resistance to WRA policies within the camps; a December 1942 clash between guards and inmates known as the &quot;Manzanar Riot&quot;, in which two were killed and ten injured, was the final push. On January 11, 1943, the sixteen men who had initiated the two-day protests were transferred to Moab from the town jails where they were booked (without charges or access to hearings) after the riot. Having closed just fifteen months prior, all 18 military-style structures of the CCC camp were in good condition, and the site was converted to its new use with minimal renovation. 150 military police guarded the camp, and director Raymond Best and head of security Francis Frederick presided over administration. On February 18, thirteen transfers from Gila River, Arizona, were brought to Moab, and six days later, ten more arrived from Manzanar. An additional fifteen Tule Lake inmates were transferred on April 2. Most of these new arrivals were removed from the general camp population because of their resistance to the WRA&#x27;s attempts to determine the loyalty of incarcerated Japanese Americans, met largely with confusion and anger because of a lack of explanation as to how and why internees would be assessed. The Moab Isolation Center remained open until April 27, when most of its inmates were bused to the larger and more secure Leupp Isolation Center. (Five men, serving sentences in the Grand County Jail after protesting conditions in Moab, were transported to Leupp in a five-by-six-foot box on the back of a truck. Their separate transfer was arranged by Francis Frederick, who had also handed down their prison sentences, using a law he later rescinded to charge them with unlawful assembly.) In 1994, the &quot;Dalton Wells CCC Camp/Moab Relocation Center&quot; was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and, although no marker exists on the site, an information plaque at the current site entrance and a photograph on display at the Dan O&#x27;Laurie Museum in Moab mention the former isolation center.

===Later years===
Moab&#x27;s economy was originally based on agriculture, but gradually shifted to mining. Uranium and vanadium were discovered in the area in the 1910s and 1920s. Potash and manganese came next, and then oil and gas were discovered. In the 1950s Moab became the so-called &quot;Uranium Capital of the World&quot; after geologist Charles Steen found a rich deposit of uranium ore south of the city. This discovery coincided with the advent of the era of nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the United States, and Moab&#x27;s boom years began.

The city population grew nearly 500% over the next few years, bringing the population to near 6,000 people. The explosion in population caused much construction of houses and schools. Charles Steen donated a great deal of money and land to create new houses and churches in Moab.

With the winding down of the Cold War, Moab&#x27;s uranium boom was over, and the city&#x27;s population drastically declined. By the early 1980s a number of homes stood empty, and nearly all of the uranium mines had closed.

In 1949, Western movie director John Ford was persuaded to use the area for the movie &quot;Wagon Master&quot;. Ford had been using the area in Monument Valley around Mexican Hat, Utah, south of Moab, since he filmed &quot;Stagecoach&quot; there 10 years earlier in 1939. A local Moab rancher (George White) found Ford and persuaded him to come take a look at Moab. The Moab to Monument Valley Film Commission is a Moab City Department and holds the title of the longest running film commission in the world. Established in 1949, the commission has overseen the production of the many movies filmed near Moab.

In recent years, Moab has experienced a surge of second-home owners. The relatively mild winters and enjoyable summers have attracted many people to build such homes throughout the area. In a situation mirroring that of other resort towns in the American West, controversy has arisen over these new residents and their houses, which in many cases remain unoccupied for most of the year. Many Moab citizens are concerned that the town is seeing changes similar to those experienced in Vail and Aspen in neighboring Colorado: skyrocketing property values, a rising cost of living, and corresponding effects on local low- and middle-income workers.

==Cultural events==
Moab hosts several cultural events and festivals including the Moab Music Festival, LGBT Pride Festival, Folk Festival, Skinny Tire Festival, and others. The annual music festival occurs in September, and was founded in 1992 by several musicians from New York. The Moab Folk Festival features concerts by numerous folk musicians every November. Since 2011 Moab has hosted an LGBT Pride festival. The first festival included a &quot;visibility&quot; march which drew more than 350 people; in its second year&#x27;s festival had over 600 in attendance. The Skinny Tire Festival is a road bike festival that occurs in March each year and raises funds for cancer research and survivors. Additionally, Moab sponsors the Moab Art Walk at multiple venues throughout the year, highlighting local artists&#x27; work.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Prior to the construction of the railroad in 1883, Moab was a strategic place to cross the Colorado River. A toll ferry service across the river ended when a permanent bridge was built in 1911. This bridge was replaced with a new bridge in 1955, which was in turn replaced by another new bridge in 2010. The 1955 bridge was subsequently demolished. The highway that uses this bridge has been renumbered multiple times and is now numbered U.S. Route 191.

Moab gained freight railroad access in 1962, when a spur railroad line (now the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Cane Creek Subdivision) was built to serve the Cane Creek potash mine. Moab has never had passenger rail service, although the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; has advertised service to Moab in the past via stops at Thompson Springs (no longer a scheduled stop), Green River or Grand Junction, Colorado. Beginning on August 15, 2021, the excursion company Rocky Mountaineer began operating passenger rail service between Moab and Denver, Colorado, in the form of the &quot;Rockies to the Red Rocks&quot;.

Bus service is provided by Salt Lake Express. There are a number of locally owned shuttle services that provide transportation to Salt Lake City and Grand Junction, CO.

Air service is available at Canyonlands Field, with daily nonstop flights to Denver International Airport via SkyWest Airlines/United Express.

Winter temperatures are cold, with 80.3 days each year not topping freezing (a number certainly inflated by the very deep snow cover) and reached nineteen times in an average winter. The very heavy snow does not ease until May, when temperatures begin to rise above , and May and June are also the driest months.

Summer weather in Brian Head is influenced by the tail end of the North American Monsoon, which provides frequent thunderstorms in July and August, though convection is inhibited by the cool temperatures at Brian Head&#x27;s extreme altitude. After the monsoon retreats, temperatures rapidly fall during September and October, when snow cover is permanently re-established.

<text>Cedar City is the largest city in Iron County, Utah, United States. Located south of Salt Lake City, it is north of Las Vegas on Interstate 15. Southern Utah University is located in Cedar City. It is the home of the Utah Shakespeare Festival, the Utah Summer Games, the Simon Fest Theatre Co., and other events. As of the 2020 census the city had a population of 35,235, up from 28,857 in the 2010 census.

==History==

The presence of prehistoric people in the Cedar City area is revealed by rock art found in Parowan Gap to the north and Fremont sites dated to A.D. 1000 and 1300. Ancestors of the present-day Southern Paiute people met the Domínguez–Escalante expedition in this area in 1776. Fifty years later, in 1826, mountain man and fur trader Jedediah Smith traveled through the area, exploring a route from Utah to California.

Cedar City was originally settled in late 1851 by Mormon pioneers originating from Parowan, Utah, who were sent to build an iron works. The site, known as &quot;Fort Cedar&quot; or &quot;Cedar City,&quot; was equidistant from vast iron deposits west and coal resources east up Cedar Canyon, but was named after the abundant local trees (which are not cedars but junipers). Two companies of men led by Henry Lunt reached the fort site in a blizzard on November 11, 1851, making that date the official founding. In 1855, a new site, closer to the iron works and out of the flood plain of Coal Creek, was established at the suggestion of Brigham Young. A furnace operated from September 1852 for three years, producing about 25 tons of pig iron, using iron ore deposits located in the Iron Mountain District. 

Cedar City was incorporated on February 18, 1868.

The ironworks closed in 1858, though mining continued in the area until the 1980s. The completion of a railroad connection to Cedar City in 1923 established the area as a tourism gateway to nearby Bryce Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument. Cedar City continues to be a center of tourism, commercial development, education, and the arts in southwestern Utah.

The city has shared in the rapid growth of much of southwestern Utah since the late 1980s.

On December 10, 2017, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dedicated its Cedar City Utah Temple.

==History==
Kanarra, later renamed Kanarraville, on Kanarra Creek, was first settled in 1861 and 1862. It was named for Piute Chief Canarrah or Quanarrah, but settlers spelled it Kanarrah or Kanarra. Its settlers were families driven from Fort Harmony when the fort had to be abandoned after most of its adobe walls were washed away during a month of heavy rains in January and February, during the Great Flood of 1862. New Harmony in Washington County was the other settlement created by refugees from this disaster.

==History==
Paragonah was settled by residents from the nearby town of Parowan in the early 1850s. Parowan residents found meadows next to Red Creek that provided ideal locations for farming. The settlement was first known as Red Creek, but the name was later changed to Paragoonah and then Paragonah. There are conflicting sources as to the name&#x27;s precise meaning, but it is of Southern Paiute origin and apparently is a reference to the red color of the water found in the area. Paragonah was incorporated as a town in 1916.

<text>Parowan ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Iron County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,790 at the 2010 census, and in 2018 the estimated population was 3,100.

Parowan became the first incorporated city in Iron County in 1851. A fort that had been constructed on the east side of Center Creek the previous year was an initial hub in the development of ironworks in the region. Parowan served as the agricultural support base for the local iron industry, whose blast furnace was located in nearby Cedar City. Eventually, the ironworks were decommissioned.

Despite occasional successes, the mission failed to produce a consistent and sustained supply of pig iron. By 1858, most of the area&#x27;s mining operations had ceased due to disappointing yields. Today, the area&#x27;s chief industries are recreation and tourism.

==History==
Fremont culture and Anasazi people were the first known inhabitants of the area where Parowan now exists. Petroglyphs, pithouses, arrowheads, pottery, and manos dating from A.D. 750 to 1250 found in the area are evidence that it was on a major thoroughfare of early indigenous peoples. At Parowan Gap, a mountain pass northwest of Parowan, ancient people inscribed petroglyphs on smooth-surfaced boulders that feature snakes, lizards, mouse-men, bear claws, and mountain sheep. Located near the Parowan Gap there are dinosaur tracks. East of the Gap and petroglyphs hikers can discover Hadrosaurs tracks that were originally formed in non-resistant mudstone. The tracks have three toes and can be found on the side of 12800 N.  Later, the Old Spanish Trail passed through the area.

Parowan was founded on January 13, 1851, twelve months after Parley P. Pratt and members of his exploring party discovered the Little Salt Lake Valley and nearby deposits of iron ore in the Iron Mountain District. On January 8, 1850, Pratt had raised a liberty pole at Heap&#x27;s Spring and dedicated the site as &quot;The City of Little Salt Lake&quot;. Based on Pratt&#x27;s exploration report, Brigham Young called for the establishment of settlements in the area to produce much-needed iron implements for the pioneer state.

Mormon apostle George A. Smith was appointed to head the establishment of this &quot;Iron Mission&quot; in 1850. The first company of 120 men, 31 women, and 18 children braved winter weather traveling south from Provo during December. They sometimes built roads and bridges as they traveled, and they finally reached Center Creek on January 13, 1851. After enduring two bitterly cold nights, they moved across the creek and circled their wagons by Heap&#x27;s Spring and Pratt&#x27;s liberty pole, seeking the protection of the hills. Within days, the settlement organization was completed: companies of men were dispatched to build a road up the canyon, a town site was surveyed and laid into lots, and a fort and a log council house were begun. The council house was used as church, schoolhouse, theater, and community recreation center for many years.

In 1861 construction was begun on a large church building to stand in the center of the public square. The pioneers envisioned a building of three stories, built from the abundant yellow sandstone and massive timbers in nearby canyons. Known as the &quot;Old Rock Church&quot;, the building was completed in 1867 and served as a place of worship, town council hall, school building, social hall, and tourist camp. In 1939 it was restored through the efforts of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers and a Parowan-sponsored WPA project. It is now a museum of Parowan&#x27;s early history.

Parowan has been called the &quot;Mother Town of the Southwest&quot; because of the many pioneers who left from there to start other communities in southern Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and even Oregon and Wyoming. In its first year, colonists were asked to settle Johnson Fort, now Enoch, where a stockade was built, and were also sent to settle along Coal Creek, site of the settlement to manufacture iron which became Cedar City.

Parowan&#x27;s first settlers were instructed to plant crops so that following immigrants could open up the coal and iron ore deposits, but local industries were also developed. Self-sufficiency was envisioned, and local industries included a tannery, sawmill, cotton mill, and factories for making saddles and harnesses, furniture and cabinets, shoes, and guns; there also were carpentry and blacksmith shops. In the early 1900s sheep and dairy industries were well established. Local farms were noted for their quality Rambouillet sheep, and the Southern Utah Dairy Company, a cooperative venture begun in 1900, produced dairy products and was known for its &quot;Pardale Cheese&quot;.

The first attempts at iron manufacturing were unsuccessful, but mining in the twentieth century brought prosperity to Iron County. When the closure of the mines and the completion of Interstate 15 threatened economic depression in the early 1980s, Parowan citizens developed an economic plan to keep the community viable. Businesses now support Brian Head, a year-round resort south of town featuring downhill and cross-country skiing in the winter and numerous summer mountain activities.

Significant growth has occurred in the 1990s in Parowan; it has been attributed to affordable utility fees and a positive economic climate. Parowan is the site of the annual Iron County Fair on Labor Day weekend; it also is a host community for the Utah Summer Games and sponsor of the annual &quot;Christmas in the Country&quot; celebration each November.

In 1993 the city began development of Heritage Park. This site includes a park, a grotto and pond, and statues commemorating the founders of Parowan. Other local historic sites include the original town square with the Old Rock Church, the War Memorial and Rose Garden, the Third/Fourth Ward LDS chapel built in 1915, and the Jesse N. Smith Home Museum. Parowan City supports the Parowan Community Theatre, which produces theatrical productions throughout the year.

==Geography==

Parowan sits on the southeastern edge of Parowan Valley, at the mouth of Parowan Canyon. A distinct red-top mountain known as Valentine Peak () overlooks the valley and is used as a common landmark for the city.

Interstate 15 runs along the northwestern edge of the city, with access from Exits 75 and 78. I-15 leads north to Cove Fort and Interstate 70, and southwest to Cedar City. Utah State Route 143 leads south up Parowan Canyon to Cedar Breaks National Monument.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Eureka was originally known as Ruby Hollow before it developed into a bustling mining town.

The district was organized in 1869 and by 1899 became one of the top mineral-producing areas in Utah. The Eureka Micropolitan Statistical Area housed the &quot;Big Four&quot; mines—Bullion Beck and Champion, Centennial Eureka, Eureka Hill, and Gemini-and later the Chief Consolidated Mining Company.
Eureka&#x27;s role as the central financial point for the district ensured its survival. It housed business establishments, including the second-ever JCPenney store (then called the Golden Rule Store), financial institutions, local and county governmental buildings including Eureka City Hall (1899) and a Juab County Courthouse (1892), various churches, and the meeting places for numerous labor, social, and fraternal organizations. Mining entrepreneurs such as , John Beck (who personally funded the construction of the Eureka LDS Church Meetinghouse in 1902), Jesse Knight, and Walter Fitch Sr. were important figures in Eureka and Tintic history. In the early 1900&#x27;s, Eureka was a powerhouse in the state when it came to soccer. They won the state title in 1905, 1907 and 1909. In 1979, Eureka was placed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Tintic Mining District Multiple Resource Area, recognizing the importance of remaining buildings and sites.

<doc id="137022" wikidata="Q129624" url="?curid=137022" title="Rocky Ridge, Utah">
<text>Rocky Ridge is a town on the northeastern edge of Juab County, Utah, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 733, and in 2018 the estimated population was 833.

The town is located on the northern edge of the Juab Valley in the eastern foothills of the Wasatch Range, but entirely west of Interstate 15 (I‑15). It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area.

While there is a &quot;Rocky Ridge&quot; and a &quot;Rocky Ridge Canyon&quot; in northeastern Juab County (both located east of the city of Nephi, approximately south‑southeast of the community), the town was named for &quot;the rocks, in a bountiful array of types and colors, strewn plentifully across the surrounding ridges separating Juab and Utah counties,&quot; according to the town website.

==History==
The original community in the area was known as York and was the southern terminus of the Utah Southern Railroad from February 1875 to May 1979. (The Utah Southern Railroad was controlled by the Union Pacific Railroad.) However, after the railroad was extended further south, the community of York was essentially abandoned. A post office had been established in the community in 1875, but it closed in 1879.

Nearly a century passed without much change, but by 1971 Marvin L. Allred had purchased in the area and I‑15 had been completed to just north of the Juab‑Utah county line. Over the next quarter century the community (which had become known as locally as Allred Ranch) continued growing, with the completion of I‑15 through the valley and the addition of more than to the community.

In May 1996, the Juab County Commissioners received a petition to incorporate the area under the name &quot;Rocky Ridge&quot;. (A few years prior some residents of the area had petitioned unsuccessfully for incorporation under the name &quot;York&quot;.) The later petition indicated that the population of the area had reached 210. By October of that year, the petition for incorporation was approved.

==Geography==
Rocky Ridge is in the northeast corner of Juab County, at the northern end of the Juab Valley. It is bordered to the north by the city of Santaquin. Interstate 15 runs just east of the town limits, with access from the north at Exit 242 (Summit Ridge Parkway) in Santaquin. Payson is to the north, and Mona is to the south. Nephi, the Juab County seat, is south of Rocky Ridge.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.24% of the population.

There were 61 households, out of which 85.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.5% were married couples living together, 49.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 1.6% were non-families. No households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 6.61 and the average family size was 6.53.

The median age was 14 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 77.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $31,944, and the median income for a family was $31,944. Males had a median income of $25,536 versus $25,179 for females.

<doc id="137023" wikidata="Q483441" url="?curid=137023" title="Alton, Utah">
<text>Alton is a town in northwest Kane County, Utah, United States. The population was 119 at the 2010 census, a decrease from the 2000 figure of 134.

==History==
Alton was first settled by Lorenzo Wesley Roundy in 1865 and was originally called &quot;Roundys Station&quot;. Roundy&#x27;s family was forced to leave due to conflicts with the local indigenous tribes. The community was later called &quot;Graham&quot;, after Graham Duncan McDonald, a local pioneer. Over the years, many names have been discussed, but a consensus could not be reached. In 1912, a drawing was held at a community event to determine the community&#x27;s name. Charles R. Pugh, who had been reading about the Alton Fjord in Norway, suggested the name, and it was pulled from the hat by a two-year-old child.

Dustin Cox currently serves as Alton&#x27;s Mayor and has been in the position for some time. He will likely run unopposed in the town&#x27;s next election. 

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 119 people in 39 households in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 89% white, 5% Hispanic or Latino, and 2.5% Native American.

The population was 45 percent male and 55 percent female. The population was 38.7 percent under 18 and 20 percent 65 or over.

==Geography==

In 1871 Mormons from the Muddy River settlement in Nevada came to settle, naming their town &quot;Glendale&quot;. The people of St. Thomas, Nevada, relocated en masse to Glendale that year, preserving their old ward organization in the new location. By the late 1800s, the Mormon communities in the area had grown in the nearby towns of Orderville and Mt Carmel Junction, and Glendale became part of the United Order, a program of economic and moral reform that began in 1874 under Brigham Young.

On March 29, 1935, Glendale became an incorporated town. The towns of Mount Carmel, Orderville, and Glendale are known as Long Valley.

==Geography and climate==
Kanab is located on the western Colorado Plateau. U.S. Routes 89 and 89A meet in the center of town. US 89 leads north to Orderville and southeast to Page, Arizona, while US 89A leads south to Fredonia, Arizona.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.24%, are water. The city&#x27;s downtown sits on flat ground to the east of Kanab Creek, which flows south to meet the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon.

Kanab has a borderline semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), more typical of exposed regions around Arizona&#x27;s Mogollon Rim. The town is rather wetter, especially during the winter months, and hotter than the typical Mountain West cool semi-arid climate. The dry spring season from April to June is warm to hot during the day and very clear but the hot sun and thin air typical of Utah mean that nights remain cool and frosts can occur even in May. In the summer, monsoon thunderstorms break up the dry weather between July and October. The winters are mild during the day and cold at night, but get more snow than most places in southern Utah. Snowfall varies a considerably from year to year, with some receiving almost none to inches falling in 2001. On average, there will be 70.9 days that reach and 7.6 that reach . Although Kanab is in hardiness zone of 7A with an average yearly low of just under , only 1.5 days fail to reach freezing on average.

==Transportation==
Kanab is served by the Kanab Municipal Airport, a general aviation facility. U.S. Route 89 (US 89) passes through the city and U.S. Route 89A within Utah is entirely within the city limits and has its northern terminus at US 89.

National Park Express provides bus service from Kanab to St. George and Las Vegas.

==Jackson Flat Reservoir==
In 2010, construction began on the Jackson Flat Reservoir under the direction of the Kane County Water Conservancy District. The reservoir had been in various stages of planning for 19 years. Completion of the reservoir took two years of construction, and one year of filling. The dam structure is composed of 800,000 yards of clay, dirt, and rock. The project was supervised by four engineering firms including the Utah State Engineer of Dam Safety, and the Army Corps of Engineers. The 4,228 acre-feet reservoir is an off-stream site fed by a 24-inch pipe capable of transferring 23 acre-feet of water per day. The average depth of the reservoir is , with a conservation pool that will sustain a 400 acre-foot pool of water. In April 2015, the reservoir reached 3,000 acre-feet of water. Water volumes vary throughout the year as reserves are tapped during summer months to supplement local irrigation needs, and are then refilled during the winter season based on annual rainfall. The reservoir is located directly south of Kanab, east of the municipal airport, and is visible from Highway 89A.

During planning and construction, crews discovered ten sites of prehistoric Anasazi ruins, including human remains. Sites which would be below the water line were fully excavated and remains turned over to the local Paiute tribe for proper care and burial ceremonies. Sites above the projected water line remain un-excavated.

The Jackson Flat Reservoir has been stocked with trout, catfish, and bluegill fish varieties. The site supports non-motorized boating, fishing, swimming, concerts, and stargazing.

==Controversies==

===Natural Family Resolution===
On January 10, 2006, then-mayor Kim Lawson and the city council unanimously passed Resolution 1-1-06R, titled &quot;The Natural Family: A Vision for the City of Kanab&quot;:

The nonbinding resolution was formulated by the Sutherland Institute, a conservative advocacy group in Salt Lake City. The symbolic resolution created controversy within the city. Hundreds of tourists canceled trips to Kanab after learning about the resolution.

In Arthur Frommer&#x27;s monthly travel column, Frommer called the city &quot;homophobic&quot; and urged readers to boycott the city.

A local civic group, the Kanab Boosters, published an open letter to ask Frommer to reconsider his boycott, making it clear that &quot;only a small number of people agree with our city council regarding the Natural Family Proclamation.&quot; The Boosters also designed and provided stickers for citizens and resident business owners opposed to the resolution. The stickers featured a string of rainbow-colored human figures underneath the red rocks of Kanab and the words &quot;Everyone welcome here&quot;.

In response to the criticism of the resolution, the Sutherland Institute clarified, saying that the resolution said that children are reared properly when a mother is home a significant amount of time and that a gay relationship is not a natural family.

===Bikini ban===
In June 2008, Kanab&#x27;s city council voted to prohibit the wearing of bikinis and men&#x27;s swim briefs at the city&#x27;s new swimming pool. The ban was rescinded within a month.

==Search for Montezuma&#x27;s treasure==
In 1914 Freddy Crystal arrived in Kanab saying that, while researching in Mexico, he had discovered that the great treasure of Montezuma, spirited away by the king&#x27;s men before he died, was to be found in the mountains around the town. Many searches and digs by Crystal and those who followed him ended when a plan to drain a lake, in the belief that the treasure resided in an under-water cave, was stopped by the government, because it was one of the few refuges of the Kanab ambersnail.

==Kanab ambersnail==
Three Lakes, a privately owned wet meadow near Kanab, is one of only two natural habitats for the Kanab ambersnail, a snail species that was listed as endangered in 1992 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and as a species of conservation priority for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

<doc id="137027" wikidata="Q483345" url="?curid=137027" title="Orderville, Utah">
<text>Orderville is a town in western Kane County, Utah, United States. The population was 577 at the 2010 census. The town was founded and operated under the United Order of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This system allowed the community to flourish for some time, but ultimately ended in 1885.

==History==
===Distribution of goods and services===
Orderville was established at the direction of LDS Church president Brigham Young in 1875 specifically to live the United Order, a voluntary form of communal living defined by Joseph Smith. Orderville was settled primarily by destitute refugees from failed settlements on the Muddy River in Nevada. When it was settled, Orderville included of land and contained 18 houses, 19 oxen, 103 cows, 43 horses, 500 sheep, 30 hogs, 400 chickens, and 30,000 feet of lumber. The settlement began completely debt free.

Homes were one- or two-room apartment units arranged around the town square. Community dining halls and public buildings were constructed. The dining hall began operation for the town on July 24, 1875, and prepared meals for more than 80 families. Men ate first, followed by women and children. Meal times were scheduled at 7 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm.

Under the United Order, no person in Orderville could have private property, as it was all considered to be God&#x27;s land. Each person was made a steward over some personal effects, and every family a steward over a home. During the first two years, the settlers worked without receiving income. They were allowed to use supplies and take food as needed. The bishop of Orderville oversaw the distribution of goods. Credits were recorded for all work done by men, women, and children and used to obtain needed materials and keep track of the labor done in the settlement. In 1877, the order began a price system to replace the credit system, and monetary values were assigned to all labor and goods. At the beginning of each year, debts were forgiven, and those who had earned a surplus voluntarily gave it back to the order.
The settlers there grew their own crops and had some small farms surrounding the settlement. They also used local materials to make their own soap, brooms, buckets, furniture, etc. Orderville settlers produced silk thread and wove it into articles of clothing. They later opened up their own tannery. There were blacksmiths, clerks, artists, musicians, and other professions. Priddy Meeks came to Orderville to serve as the settlement&#x27;s doctor in 1876. Ten percent of the net increase of Orderville was donated to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to follow the law of tithing.

===Management===
The group was managed by an annually-elected Board of Management consisting of nine men who bought and sold goods on behalf of the entire settlement. They also directed labor performed by the settlers. The president was the bishop, and the vice presidents were usually his counselors. Thus, there was a very close connection between spiritual and secular. Orderville was divided into 33 departments, and each year members of the board met with the department directors to determine what the needs were and how many workers would be proportioned to the department.

In order for new members to join, the entire community had to vote. A new member was welcomed into Orderville only if the admission vote was a two-thirds majority. All newcomers were interviewed to determine their motives for wanting to join the society. They were also asked a number of questions regarding their moral and spiritual habits. New members had to agree to follow the strict standards and conditions of the settlement, including no swearing and giving up tobacco, tea, and coffee. Brigham Young cautioned against &quot;allowing those whom might become parasites on the body from becoming members.&quot; When members wanted to leave, they were given back the capital they had initially invested along with their surplus credits for that year. If the members leaving had debts, they were usually forgiven.

===Success===
Although the United Order was practiced in many Utah communities during the late 1870s, Orderville was unique in both the level of success it experienced under the communal living style, and in the duration of the experiment. In the course of a few years, Orderville grew into a thriving, self-sufficient community. The success and relative wealth of the community attracted more settlers, and Orderville grew to about 700 people. Orderville not only provided for the needs of its population, but produced a significant surplus for sale to other communities, which was used to purchase additional land and equipment. The extreme poverty of these settlers likely contributed significantly to their devotion to the principles of the United Order.

===End of the Order===
The Order continued in Orderville for approximately 10 years. During the early 1870s, the economic environment improved in southern Utah. The discovery of silver nearby led to railroad facilities and an influx of people to the area. Local farmers were able to find a market for their goods and gained more profit. The neighboring towns that had once bought goods from Orderville now found themselves able to import materials from other regions. Orderville goods became &quot;old fashioned&quot;. The youth of Orderville envied the youth in other communities, creating friction within the community. Due to this friction, the communal dining system was abandoned in 1880. Three years later the value system assigned to labor was adjusted, introducing a level of inequality that had not existed before. Families were also given their own spending money. These changes led to tension and much internal disruption of the Order. While these internal conflicts and changes eventually would have led to the end of the practice of the United Order in Orderville, national legislation ensured it. In 1885, the enforcement of the Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882 effectively ended the order by jailing many of the order&#x27;s leaders and driving many of the others underground. Members of the community held an auction using their credits as payment. Orderville continued its tannery, wool factory, and sheep enterprise, which were overseen by the Board of Management until 1889.

Orderville&#x27;s current leadership is headed by Mayor Lyle Goulding.

<doc id="137028" wikidata="Q482416" url="?curid=137028" title="Delta, Utah">
<text>Delta is the largest city in Millard County, Utah, United States. It is located in the northeastern area of Millard County along the Sevier River and is surrounded by farmland. The population was 3,622 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Delta was originally a railroad switch called Aiken. In 1905 Aiken was renamed Melville when Millard County began plans to set up irrigation and a dam. People purchased land for 50 cents an acre as long as they agreed to develop a 40-acre lot. The name was changed again because of the similarities between Melville and Millville, another town in Utah. The name was changed on 12 May 1908 to Burtner. The name was finally changed to Delta on May 11, 1911. The name is quite fitting as the area was a delta of the Sevier River.

===Topaz Relocation Camp===
During World War II, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans were gathered up and placed in 10 incarceration camps to protect military installations from espionage. One of these camps, then called &quot;Central Utah Relocation Center&quot;, was located near Delta and filled with former residents of the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Topaz Museum, located in Delta, works to preserve important sites at the relocation center and to provide information on the history of the camps.

===Great Basin Museum===
A history of the area is kept and displayed at The Great Basin Museum.

===Gunnison Massacre Site===

John Williams Gunnison was leading a federal surveying team near the Sevier Lake. He was ambushed by the Pahvant Indians and killed.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Delta experiences a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cold winters. Because of Delta&#x27;s altitude and aridity, temperatures drop quickly after sunset, especially in the summer. Winters are cold. Daytime highs in the winter are usually above freezing, but nighttime lows drop well below freezing, occasionally falling below . Delta&#x27;s climate is similar to that of Salt Lake City, but much more arid.

===Sevier River and Lake===
The Sevier River flows near Delta. The Sevier River is generally used for irrigation before it reaches its eventual end, the dry Sevier Lake.

===DMAD===
DMAD is the initials for the Deseret Melville Abraham and Delta water company.

Just upstream of Delta, the Sevier River is dammed to provide irrigation water, reservoir storage, and cooling water for IPP Intermountain Power Project. This reservoir is referred to as the DMAD.

Agriculture is a major economic force in Delta and the Sevier valley.

===Gunnison Bend Reservoir===
Downstream of Delta, the Sevier River is dammed again for irrigation and reservoir storage. This reservoir is named Gunnison Bend Reservoir in honor of John Williams Gunnison.

==Economy==

===Intermountain Power Project (IPP)===

One of the main sources of income for Delta is a power plant operated by the Intermountain Power Agency, known as the Intermountain Power Project or I.P.P. It is also referred to as Intermountain Power Service Corporation or I.P.S.C. This coal-powered power plant supplies power for much of Los Angeles county in California. The plant was originally designed for four units, but only two have been built. Each unit produces 950 megawatts of electricity.

===Materion Natural Resources===
Materion&#x27;s, formerly Brush Wellman, beryllium refining plant is located north of Delta in Millard County. This is one of the few sources of concentrated beryllium in the world. The plant is a mill and finishing facility for beryllium, a high-strength, lightweight metal alloy used in military, aerospace, and medical industries. The ore for the plant is trucked from Materion&#x27;s mine, located in the Topaz-Spor Mountains, 50 miles west, in Juab County. This is North America&#x27;s only developed source of beryllium. The facility is located here due to its access to the railway and major highways 6 and 50.

===Graymont Lime===
Graymont Lime has a plant in the Cricket Mountains, about 32.5 miles southwest of Delta. It is one of the ten largest lime plants in the United States. It was previously owned by Continental Lime which Graymont Lime purchased.

===Alfalfa===
Alfalfa hay is the main crop of the Delta area. Due to the dry climate in the Delta region, farmers can control the moisture content of the hay when it is baled. This is very important to prohibit mold growth.

===Dairy===
Delta is home to many dairy farmers who may ship the milk out of the county.

==Science==

===Cosmic Ray Center===
Delta is home to the Lon and Mary Watson Cosmic Ray Center, the main staging area for the Telescope Array Project experiment.

===Fossils and minerals===

A great attraction of Millard County&#x27;s economy is the digging of fossils. Trilobite fossils are relatively common in the region west of Delta (part of the House Range&#x27;s Wheeler Shale). Several local companies maintain fossil dig areas where they allow visitors to dig their own fossils for a small fee.

Near Delta is a mountain called Topaz Mountain, which derives its name from the topaz that is abundant in the area.
Other minerals and rocks that are prevalent near Delta include obsidian, opal, and geodes.

==Education==

=== Schools ===
Delta currently has three public schools: Delta elementary school, Delta Middle school, and Delta High school. Delta also has a vocational school with the Delta Technical Center, which offers many Technical classes, including welding, Machining/metalworking, and Woodworking

==== Delta South Elementary ====
Delta South Elementary School is located at 450 South Center Street in Delta, Utah. DSES was originally built in 1982 to accommodate the growth in population due to the construction of the Intermountain Power Plant. The new school was finished in time for the 1983–84 school year and housed grades K-4. In 1989 the fifth grade was moved back to the elementary school. Because of declining enrollment figures, Delta South Elementary was closed in 2009. Delta Early Childhood Center was created using two-thirds of the South Elementary building to accommodate preschool and kindergarten students in West Millard County. At the end of the 2014–15 school year, the Delta area schools were reconfigured, placing all students in preschool, kindergarten, and first and second grades at Delta South Elementary School.

==== Delta Middle School ====
Delta Middle School serves approximately 420 students in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades and is located in Delta, Utah. Its students come from the City of Delta and several smaller communities in Millard County.

DMS has a staff of 21 teachers, nine instructional assistants, and eleven additional support personnel.

==== Delta High School ====
Delta High School is a public school located in rural central Utah, drawing students from several small outlying communities. With a new school and a diverse student population, Delta High is the hub of an agricultural-based community. According to the 2013-2014 DHS report card Delta had 549 students enrolled from the grades 9th-12th and an 87% graduation rate.

==Entertainment==

===Snow Goose Festival===
The Snow Goose Festival occurs every winter as the geese migrating through Delta stop at Gunnison Bend Reservoir.

===Demolition Derby===
Each July 4, the Hinckley Lions Club sponsors a demolition derby at the Millard County Fairgrounds. The derby attracts crowds of over 3,000 people. It is one of the largest derbies in the United States, with up to eleven rounds of competition, including pickup trucks, figure 8 compact car competition, powder puff, a championship round, and a wipe-out round. Following the derby, there is a fireworks display sponsored by Delta City.

===Days of the Old West Rodeo===
A Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Rodeo takes place every year.

<text>Fillmore is a city and the county seat of Millard County, Utah, United States. The population was 2,592 at the 2020 United States Census. It is named for the thirteenth U.S. President Millard Fillmore, who was in office when Millard County was created by the Utah Territorial legislature.

Fillmore was the capital of the Utah Territory from 1851 to 1856, although the territorial legislature met in Fillmore only one term (1855). The original Utah Territorial Statehouse building still stands.

==History==
Fillmore, located near the geographic center of the territory, was originally built as the capital of Utah Territory. The Utah Territorial Legislature approved a plan to locate the capital in the Pahvant Valley. On October 28, 1851, Utah governor Brigham Young chose the specific site for Fillmore. Jesse W. Fox, that same day, surveyed the town. Anson Call headed the colonizing company that shortly followed; they built houses, a grist mill, and a sawmill. The capitol building was begun in 1852.

In the following years, some disagreements developed with the Native Americans in the area, but Brigham Young sent Dimick B. Huntington to the area, and he managed to negotiate peace. The region was considered a route, along the 38th parallel, for the transcontinental railroad. Captain John W. Gunnison, leading a military party surveying the region, was attacked by a band of Pahvants (Ute) west of Fillmore. Gunnison and seven of his men were killed (October 1853). During the 1860s, two forts, Fort Deseret and Cove Fort were constructed nearby as protection from Indian unrest.

In 1855, the territorial legislature met in Fillmore. However, in 1856, the legislature decided to move the Territorial Capital to the larger community of Salt Lake City.

<text>Holden is a town in Millard County, Utah, United States. The population was 438 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Holden was settled in 1855 by a group of ten families sent out by the bishop of the local congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Fillmore. Named Cedar Springs for the springs in the junipers that the community was built around. The town then assumed the name Buttermilk Fort because travelers passing through were encouraged to stop for a glass of cold buttermilk while resting. The town got its post office in 1864, and the town was renamed for Elijah E. Holden, a member of the Mormon Battalion who was one of the first settlers of Holden and died while caught in a snowstorm in 1858.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.4 km2), all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 400 people, 140 households, and 105 families residing in the town. The population density was 728.7 people per square mile (280.8/km2). There were 162 housing units at an average density of 295.1 per square mile (113.7/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.50% White, and 0.50% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.00% of the population.

There were 140 households, out of which 40.0% had children under 18 living with them, 65.0% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.0% were non-families. 24.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.86, and the average family size was 3.47.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 34.0% under 18, 6.3% from 18 to 24, 20.0% from 25 to 44, 22.5% from 45 to 64, and 17.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Economy==

The traditional economy has been agriculture. Before the freeway, I-15, bypassed the town, there were five gas stations, a grocery store, a cafe, a swimming pool, an open-air dance hall, and a show house. Those businesses are now gone. Now there is a dental office with two dentists, a UPS transfer station where packages are delivered throughout Millard County, a nursery that grows native plants, three beauticians, a cabinet shop, a realty business, and several home businesses featuring craft items. Cattle, alfalfa hay, and corn are the main agricultural products. Most of the farms are located outside of the city limits, but they are owned and operated by farmers and ranchers that live in Holden.

Primary employers in the area are Intermountain Community Hospital, Intermountain Power Project (IPP), Brush Wellman, Sunrise Engineering, the Great Lake Cheese Company of Utah, Mountain View Mushrooms, and the Kern River Gas Transmission.

== History ==
Chief Kanosh began a small farm in this area before the arrival of the Mormons in Utah. His band of the Pahvants were based in this vicinity.

In 1859, Peter Robison and Peter Boyce began the aptly named settlement of Petersburg. This was not far from the current site of Kanosh.

The town of Kanosh dates back to April 28, 1867, when Brigham Young, with the approval of Chief Kanosh, advised the pioneers to move from Petersburg (later Hatton, Utah) to the area then known as the campground of the Pahvant band of the Ute Tribe. When this move took place (1867–68) there were approximately 100 pioneers and 500 Native Americans living here.

At that time the Chief Kanosh and many of his tribe were baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mortimer Wilson Warner, a local pioneer, is credited with having suggested that the town be named Kanosh in honor of the wise tribal chief.

Chief Kanosh (1812?–1884), was the leader of the Pahvant Utes from the 1850s until the time of his death. According to Mormon records, he was the son of Kashe Bats and Wah Goots. The Pahvant band ranged the deserts surrounding Sevier Lake. With the intrusion of whites into this area, Kanosh struggled to insure the hegemony and survival of his people through negotiation rather than conflict.

Kanosh was settled by Mormon pioneers and Chief Kanosh himself became an early convert to the faith. It is thought that Kanosh&#x27;s willingness to work with non-Utes came out of his experiences working in the Spanish missions in California. Whether that work was voluntary or part of the long-standing slave trade of Indians into the Spanish settlements is not known. Certainly, the physical characteristics of Kanosh and others of the &quot;Bearded Utes&quot;, as Silvestre Vélez de Escalante had called the Pahvants in the 1770s, suggest generations of contact with the Spaniards. Kanosh spoke Spanish and seems to have had a facility for languages, as he also easily picked up English.

Over time, the Kanosh tribe dwindled both due to difficulty in adapting to a farming culture from a hunter-gathering culture and in intermarriage with the local settlers. Even though many of the natives were deeded farmland, most chose to abandon the lifestyle and accept a government offer to move into the Uinta reservation where they would receive economic assistance.

However, the Pahvants at Corn Creek, a settlement established near Kanosh, continued to farm. Surrounding Mormon settlers gave them some assistance. And although Kanosh was involved in the negotiations of the 1865 Spanish Fork treaty in which Utes agreed to move to the Uinta Basin, Kanosh and his group continued at Corn Creek until a grasshopper invasion in 1868 destroyed most of their crops. Even then, Kanosh and his people did not always remain in the Uinta Basin; they returned often to Corn Creek to farm, forage, and beg from Mormon settlers.

Though Chief Kanosh still has a headstone in an honored location of the city cemetery, it was not until 1929 that the U.S. Government granted official recognition of the tribe and deeded them a small reserve near their ancestral lands at Corn Creek. (The actual location of Kanosh&#x27;s remains is still unknown but is rumored to be in the foothills surrounding Kanosh.) Those few tribal members that remain today have now been almost fully assimilated into the local culture shaped by agriculture, ranching and the Mormon faith. The Kanosh surname is quite common in the area, including among female descendants who retain it as a middle name. Some of Kanosh&#x27;s descendants have earned university degrees and returned from successful careers elsewhere to contribute to a comeback in the local economy.

The town of Kanosh was organized as a ward of the Fillmore Stake in 1877.

The population of the Kanosh precinct was 565 in 1930.

Kanosh was adversely affected by atomic testing in the Nevada desert in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with many residents and former residents developing cancerous symptoms years later. In response and after years of effort by Utah&#x27;s congressional delegation, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2000 to provide minimal compensation for those thus affected.

The government has taken positive steps to clean up the area so that many former residents have begun to return, adding or refurbishing businesses such as a motel, service station and eating places which were once closed or barely surviving. New homes have been or are being constructed on the north side of town. The south side of town has a stone &quot;Welcome to Kanosh&quot; monument at the junction of the new state highway which connects to I-15 southbound and the old highway which leads to the town cemetery. Thus, the once new interstate which once hastened the town&#x27;s exodus has breathed new life into the town since the new state road connects to either the northbound or southbound I-15 interchanges within a few miles in either direction and also greatly reduces the driving time to Fillmore, Utah, county seat and one-time territorial capitol.

On the evening of July 25, 2021, a sandstorm led to a series of crashes near here on Interstate 15 involving 20 vehicles, that killed 8 people, including four children, and injured at least ten others, three critically.

<text>Leamington is a town in Millard County, Utah. The population was 217 at the time of the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all land.

==History==
In 1871 settlers of Oak City, Utah built a dam in what is now Leamington. The town itself was settled in 1873 by Thomas Morgan. He was the first branch president when the Leamington Branch of the LDS Church was organized in 1876. In 1880, a log meetinghouse was built and by this time the town had an LDS Ward with Mary Goble Pay as president of the Primary Organization. Bengt Textorius was hired to bring a spur of the railroad down from SLC through Leamington past Lynndyl Junction. His wife, Josephine, talked her sister Anna and her son, Abe, to move from Sweden. She brought with her Bertha Rorstrum. Hans Olaus Sorenson married both of these women and started rearing families. He followed Bengt to Leamington in 1883. Hans purchased a farm south east of town. He helped build the canal up on the ridge which helped water the valley. Rodney Ashby was bishop for many years and Bengt was one of his counselors. Hans found that sugar cane grew better than wheat so he produced molasses. He also got a cream separator and worked with the neighbors to take the cream and make butter. He took trips to the mining town Eureka up north to sell, butter, eggs, meat, and flour goods, plus fruit and vegetables in season. Life was not easy. He made an adobe mill for bricks to make small homes. They would go up into the canyons to gather firewood for home and for the cone kilns to make charcoal for the trains. In winter they would heat bricks on the pot belly stove and wrap burlap around for their beds. In winter, they would cut blocks of ice from the Sevier River and place them in small caves covered with straw to serve as refrigerators. In 1930 Leamington and its immediate vicinity had a population of 356.

On Highway 132 near the middle of Leamington sits a 1950s-style Phillips 66 gas station with period cars in front of and around the garage. There is also a growing collection of retired farm implements. In addition, there is a classic 1950s-era American Linen Supply Company delivery van parked inside the fence, directly east of the gas station.

==Founding==

The settlement of Oak City was begun in late summer of 1868, when a few families moved there from the community of Deseret, Utah. They had become discouraged after eight years of unsuccessful attempts to dam the Sevier River to provide water for their crops, and had left the area. The early settlers were familiar with the Oak City area because they had pastured their cattle there in the spring and fall. They chose this area to settle because of the reliable creek and the quality of the land for farming.
The town was settled in two phases. The first phase took place in July 1868 and consisted of a few families and young men to survey the town site, clear the land for farming, and provide shelter for the coming winter. Twenty-three more families came in October and November of that year.

==The A-Bomb Project==
Oak City in Millard County was the search director&#x27;s first choice for the atomic weapons laboratory. Maj. John Dudley of the Manhattan District Staff was assigned to survey the West and find potential sites for an atomic laboratory in October 1942. His first choice for the laboratory site was Oak City, Utah, according to the Los Alamos history. &quot;It was a delightful little oasis in south central Utah,&quot; Dudley wrote. &quot;The railroad was only 16 miles away over a nice, easy road. The airport was not too distant. The water supply was good. It was surrounded by hills, and beyond there was mostly desert. However, I noticed one thing: If we took over this area we would evict several dozen families and we would also take a large amount of farm acreage out of production.&quot;

Because of the potential loss of farmland, Dudley recommended his second choice — Jemez Springs, New Mexico. In the end, Dudley&#x27;s choice was overruled by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist and the scientific director of the Manhattan Project. He favored Los Alamos.

==Celebrations==

===Oak City Days===
Oak City Days is held the third week of August every year when the citizens of Oak City host a two-day event to celebrate the founding of the city. It has also been known as ward days and homecoming in the past. Oak City Days is kicked off with a parade on Friday evening followed by an ice cream social. Following the ice cream social there is a program. There are also various competitions such as a Rook tournament. On Saturday a town lunch is prepared which feeds over 1000 people. Craft booths, kids games (including a children’s fish catch), as well as adult fun fill the day. The festivities end with a dance under the stars with music by the local band The Moonlighters.

== History ==

Scipio was settled in 1859. Early names included Round Valley and Graball, but it was eventually named for Scipio Africanus Kenner, a young lawyer who helped the pioneers to obtain legal title to the land.

In 1861, George A. Smith organized a branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the town. A Fort Scipio also existed here at one time.

There are several pioneer-style homes in the town. Several houses are found on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the Peter Quarnberg House, the Merien and Rosabelle Robins House, the Thuesen-Petersen House and the Pharo Village (a Fremont site) south of Scipio. Also on the Historic Register is the Scipio Town Hall built in 1935 which includes a museum for the family, D.U.P. and a Senior Citizens Center. The Scipio Town Hall was intended for use as a town hall and as a meeting place for all civic and political functions in the community.

<text>Circleville is a town in Piute County, Utah, United States. The population was 547 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 9.1 square miles (23.5 km2), all land.

The American Discovery Trail runs through Circleville.

===Climate===
The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Dfb&quot; (Warm Summer Continental Climate).

==History==
In the area that became Circleville, the first European colonizers arrived in 1864. They were Mormon settlers from Mormonism&#x27;s largest denomination the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The town is located within Circle Valley which gets its name from its circular shape. The valley is completely encircled by mountains except where the Sevier River enters and exits the valley in the north and south.

In April 1866, the settlement was the site of the Circleville Massacre, a lynching of 27 Southern Paiute men, women, and children by LDS settlers during the Black Hawk War. In 2016, a monument was dedicated in the town park to remember the Native American people murdered during the massacre.

On June 28, 1866, the town was abandoned by the original settlers due to the war. A few settlers began to trickle back into the area in 1873 and the town was re-established in 1874 when Charles Wakeman Dalton crossed the mountain from Beaver with two of his wives and family.

Circleville became an incorporated community on August 24, 1921. Local residents were interested in facilitating the public services which municipal government provides, and they were particularly interested in building a culinary water system.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 505 people, 172 households, and 132 families residing in the town. The population density was 55.7 people per square mile (21.5/km2). There were 222 housing units at an average density of 24.5 per square mile (9.5/km2).

In the town, the population was spread out, with 34.7% under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 18.4% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 64, and 17.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.8 males. The racial makeup of the town was 97.23% White, 0.20% African American, 0.40% Native American, 0.20% Asian, 0.20% Pacific Islander, 0.99% from other races, and 0.79% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.36% of the population.

The median income for a household in the town was $32,083, and the median income for a family was $36,875. Males had a median income of $25,536 versus $19,063 for females.

About 8.7% of families and 12.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.2% of those under age 18 and 12.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Notable people==

Notable outlaw Butch Cassidy (1866–1908) grew up in Circle Valley just a mile south of Circleville. His family&#x27;s small cabin, on the outskirts of town, is still standing on the land they homesteaded.

Charlie Siringo visited Circleville while in pursuit of the Wild Bunch. Siringo wrote, &quot;a week was spent in the straggling village of Circleville, and I found out all about &#x27;Butch&#x27;s&#x27; early life and much about his late doings. His true name was Parker, his nickname being &#x27;Sallie&#x27; Parker when a boy. This nickname of itself was enough to drive a sensitive boy to the &#x27;bad&#x27;. I had hard work to keep from falling in love with Miss Parker, the pretty young sister of &#x27;Butch&#x27; Cassidy. She was the deputy postmistress in Circleville, and I made her acquaintance.&quot;

Lula Parker Betenson (b. 1884), sister of &quot;Butch&quot; Cassidy, lived in Circleville, dying aged 96 in 1980. Betenson&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;Butch Cassidy, My Brother,&quot; co-authored with Dora Flack, recounts her memory that Cassidy visited Circleville in 1924, adding to the controversy over whether he had died previously in South America. This visit by Cassidy to Circleville is also reported by author W. C. Jameson in &quot;Butch Cassidy: Beyond the Grave.&quot;

Carrie Allen, born in Circleville in 1889, was a spinster and a school teacher. She wrote a history of Circleville. She died in 1983 in Circleville.

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Kingston has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Kingston is named for Thomas Rice King, who moved from Fillmore to Piute County with his five sons and their families specifically to find a place where they could establish a United Order. In the 1870s Brigham Young was encouraging communal living in United Order communities. The King families&#x27; United Order functioned from 1876 to 1883. Kingston became an incorporated town in 1935.

The members of the United Order
built the village of Kingston on ten acres of land east of Circleville.

&quot;The town consisted of a central
community building for school, dances, church and
other meetings. A blacksmith shop, milk house, bakery, tailor shop, post office, carpenter shop and store
surrounded the meetinghouse. Homes built in like style formed a fort around a ten-acre block. These
first log houses had dirt floors and
roofs. A communal kitchen and dining hall about seventy feet long stood in the center, with a large vegetable garden
close by.&quot;

Just east of
Kingston the community had their industrial center in which buildings such as a
flour mill, tannery, sawmill, and woolen mill were located. Isaac Riddle had
previously built a burr mill in the area, however, it could not meet the needs
of the people and so they built a gristmill at the mouth of Kingston Canyon.

A post office called Marysvale has been in operation since 1872. The town&#x27;s name probably commemorates the Virgin Mary.

In the late 1860s, silver ore was discovered in the Volcanic Series of Bullion Canyon and Mount Belknap, west of Marysvale in the Tushar Mountains. In 1889, gold was discovered. Then in 1949, uranium was discovered, prompting the United States Atomic Energy Commission to establish an ore purchasing station and field office in Marysvale. The uranium occurs as veins within quartz monzonite, granite and rhyolite, usually in the form of pitchblende, but also as umohoite, which was first identified at Marysvale. The pitchblende has been age dated to the Late Miocene. Total uranium production from the Marysvale area amounted to about 275,000 tons of 0.2 per cent U2O8.

<doc id="137048" wikidata="Q116129" url="?curid=137048" title="Alta, Utah">
<text>Alta is a town in eastern Salt Lake County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 228 at the 2020 census, a large decrease from the 2010 figure of 383.

Alta is centered in the Alta Ski Area, a ski resort that has 500,000 annual visitors. It is known for its powder skiing and its decision to not allow snowboarding.

==History==

Alta has been important to the development of skiing in Utah. Alta was founded about 1865 to house miners from the Emma mine, the Flagstaff mine, and other silver mines in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Sensationally rich silver ore in the Emma mine enabled its owners to sell the mine at an inflated price to British investors in 1871. The subsequent exhaustion of the Emma ore body led to the recall of the American ambassador to Great Britain, who was a director of the company, and to Congressional hearings in Washington DC on the transaction.

An alleged incident that occurred in the town in 1873 was adapted by Rod Serling for the episode entitled &quot;Mr. Garrity and the Graves&quot; of his television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

An 1878 fire and an 1885 avalanche destroyed most of the original mining town, though some mining activity persisted into the 20th century. By the 1930s, only one resident, George Watson, remained in the town. Facing back taxes on mining claims that he owned, Watson donated much of his land in Alta to the U.S. Forest Service, stipulating that the land be used to construct a ski area. In 1935, Norwegian skiing legend Alf Engen was hired to help develop the area, and Alta opened its first ski lift in 1938. By the end of the twentieth century, up to 7,000 people per day could be found on the Alta slopes, and traffic in the Little Cottonwood Canyon was nearing gridlock proportions.

Today, Alta is a small town centered around the Alta Ski Area.

During the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government-mandated economic restrictions, Alta briefly gained national attention when it was the only ski resort included in a detailed study of disease-transmission probabilities. The university-based study concluded that buses to the site could be made safe, traveling on ski lifts was safe, and queueing at ski lifts was safe. However, no amount of compensating factors could make indoor-dining at restaurants acceptably safe, and locker rooms could only be considered safe if occupants used &quot;quiet voices&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.1 square miles (10.5 km2), of which 0.25% is water.

At , Alta is one of the highest cities in Utah and one of the highest in America.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 386 people in 156 households in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 93 percent white and 4 percent Hispanic or Latino.

The population was 67 percent male and 33 percent female. The population was 4.7 percent under the age of 18, and 2.6 percent was 65 or older.

==Climate==
Alta experiences a high altitude humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), which borders on a subalpine climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), due to its high elevation. Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the town receives very heavy snows, averaging over per year. During the very wet season of 1982/1983, Alta received as much as of snow, leading to record flooding of Wasatch streams as the snow melted during May and June that year. Alta&#x27;s total precipitation of during 1983 is a record for a calendar year in any state of the Mountain West.

<text>Bluffdale is a city in Salt Lake and Utah counties in the U.S. state of Utah, located about south of Salt Lake City. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 17,014.

==History==
Bluffdale, named for its geography of bluffs and dales, was first settled in 1848–1849, when the area was originally part of West Jordan. On July 29, 1858, Orrin Porter Rockwell paid five- hundred dollars to Evan M. Green for sixteen acres of land near the Crystal Hot Lakes (adjacent to the present Utah State Prison). This land included Hot Springs Hotel and Brewery with dining facilities, a stable brewery, and a pony express station. As the community expanded, the Bluffdale area became part of South Jordan, then Riverton. In 1883 the Bluffdale School Precinct was formed from parts of Herriman, South Jordan, and Draper. On August 1, 1886, the Bluffdale Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized with Lewis H. Mousley as Bishop. For a short time, the town was called Mousley. Seven irrigation canals originate at the Jordan Narrows in the Bluffdale area and serve the Salt Lake Valley. One of the earliest was Utah, and Salt Lake Canal started in 1862. Some of the early buildings included an adobe church, built in 1887–1888, a tithing house, and a three-room schoolhouse constructed in 1893. The city was incorporated in 1978.
